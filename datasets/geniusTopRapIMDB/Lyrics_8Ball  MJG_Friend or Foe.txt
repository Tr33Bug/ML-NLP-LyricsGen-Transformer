Friend or Foe? Lyrics[Intro]
Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do, I'm here to do it
How about you?

[E-40]
Our age, five-years-old
We were young bucks
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter sing you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa' some vicious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
(Time of nightway)
Gigantic factor from the
Carquinez Bridge team
Some had it all though (All though)
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
(Green machine)
Three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together, nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin', nigga
That ain't even cool (That ain't cool)
I used to be conned, racked and fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin' up in my pad
[Mac Mall]
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they can't stop me from strivin'
Suckas be shakin' salt
All in his game falsifyin'
Some fools be gettin' crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man, all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or dog food
That have these marks betrayin' macks
Fuckin' off my high breakin' rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phony
I spit for major mints
While you make tapes for ya homies
And then you work up the nerve
To speak foul words
The perpetrators be instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

I trust no man
'Cause man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank God in every rhyme
'Cause I've seen better times
And I've seen worse days
When some of my so-called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
'Cause righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask God to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know?
By the time morning comes, I can see the light
And then I'm thanking God, once again, for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings, puttin' it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot, open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop!
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin
[Chorus]
Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
(No, you never know)
Who can you trust in a world that's, oh, so cold
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go
(Everywhere I go, go, go, go)
Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
(Oh no, you never know)

[8ball]
Listen
I'm tryin' to tell you, my nigga, to watch ya back
And trust few
'Cause ain't no nigga gon' watch ya back for you, like you
When someone is broke, and down, and out without no doubt, it's rough
At least you know who you can, and who you cannot trust
See, let me explain myself, and clear up the point I'm tryin' to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin' or actin' fake
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get too close
I don't know if it's, effects of from the marijuana, that got me 'noid and trippin'
See, nowadays the nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone, would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone, it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny, 'cause my money's loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga, nothin' you don't already know
Personal or business, you got to watch who you friends is

[MJG]
I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch?
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out
Makin' sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep
Who do I turn to, when I be low on my cash
Who am I down with, when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass?
Who is my friends, who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin' about somethin', but I don't know nothin'
My ignorance keepin' me out in the cold
Who do I call, when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody else's car
How do I get from point A to B, if B is just too far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's gonna' give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live?
When will I drive a Beemer, takin' my clothes to the cleaner?
How can I know?
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder, when I be wantin' to lean?
Know what I mean?
When I be needin' some justification
Stuck in the fuckin' same location
Who is the friend that is helpin' me?
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin' is tough?
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust?
Who wanna' share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone?
Constantly gettin' my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda' suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friends, thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

[Chorus]
Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
Who can you trust in a world that's, oh, so cold
Playa' hatin' is everywhere I go
Friend or foe
(Oh friend, or foe)
You just will never know
Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's, oh, so cold
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go
Friend or foe
(Friend or foe)
You just will never know4Embed
