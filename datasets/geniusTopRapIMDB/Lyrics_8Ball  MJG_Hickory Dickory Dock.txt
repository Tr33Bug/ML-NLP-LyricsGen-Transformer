Hickory Dickory Dock Lyrics[Intro: 8Ball & MJG]
Hickory dickory dock (Dock)
Hickory dickory dock (Dock), your girl pulled out my cock (My cock)

[Chorus: 8Ball & MJG]
Here a girl, there a girl
Everywhere I go a girl
Blow dro with the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (Dock), your girl pulled out my cock (My cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Patron, double shots, wit no chase
Sticky green, fire it up and blow it in yo face
We deep, 50 deep, so don't hate
Forever never slippin' naw, pimpin', we straight
What it do, the bets back, the checks fat, the track tight
We finna cook a fresh batch
Money maker, you makin' money, then show me some
Dime pieces, bend it over, let me see ya thong
Shades on, blacka bodies. I'm in my zone
Trunk kickin like it know karate, we sittin' tall
Big Ball, and MJ pushin' to the limit
I'm reppin' for Tennessee so I gotta keep it pimpin' now

[Chorus: 8Ball & MJG]
Here a girl, there a girl
Everywhere I go a girl
Blow dro with the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (Dock), your girl pulled out my cock (My cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

[Verse 2: MJG]
They call me pimp tight MJG, you know I party hard
Most of y'all pussycat niggas that ain't gon' hardly ball
Any time you wanna load up you know I'm ready (I'm ready)
Rich ass niggas can't ride in my Chevy (My Chevy)
You don't wanna hear me speak, you just wanna see my rims
Spinnin' underneath my vehicle like a like a roll of film
I don't even need tint, they already know it's me
If I add tint, when I get out they'll know it's me
Hennessy, Grey Goose, good purp, and Patron
Gotta keep a lot of it, so I can stay in the zone
Every time I'm in the hood, every time I'm in the club
Look kids, grown folks, old folks show me love

All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Wheels spinnin', the kush burnin', the beat knockin'
I know the pill kickin' in, go on get it poppin'
Don't be scared, we rock stars, we party hard
Valet park 20 cars, then go and buy the bar
Bleed, we keep it gritty, we keep it gutta
Bangas worldwide, I'm ya neighborhood cooch cutta

[Verse 4: MJG]
Yeah, spray it on some cooch butta
Some call it KY
Say my muthafuckin' name, girl, say my name
Pimp tight MJG, millions we runnin' through, pimp daily
You can crawl at the bottom 'til ya make ya knees hurt
Or do it like I do it, make the block bleed work

[Chorus: 8Ball & MJG]
Here a girl, there a girl
Everywhere I go a girl
Blow dro with the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (Dock), your girl pulled out my cock (My cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Here a girl, there a girl
Everywhere I go a girl
Blow dro with the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (Dock), your girl pulled out my cock (My cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a weekEmbed
