Just Like Candy Lyrics[Chorus]
Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)

[Verse 1: MJG]
I'm creepin low in a flip, flop drop
Top 'Stang, leanin to the left, gold Dayton's on that thang
I'm the MJG, pimp tight
Put it to the floor, 5-0 swang a right
And the peanut butta guts is a must
Drop it in the shop, take 'em out, wrap 'em up
And the ten clear coats to make it shine
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times
With my gas tank full, drank a bull
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin pretty
Nice round hips, with them well-shaped titties
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin dirty
Fall up in Pressure World, get cleaned in a hurry
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight
Pull off cuttin rubber, disappearin in the night
(Chorus)
Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)

[Eightball]
10 o'clock in the morning, as 8 got up
Chiefin' hay with some Kool-Aid in my favorite cup
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight
Heavy starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes
As I strike, out the door, to my Superb
Parked by the curb, candy-coated bird
The sun got my candy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street
Hit the horn, but no stallin, keep ballin
4 o'clock Sunday, I gotta hit the mall and
Fall in full of them green trees
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King
Fools all in the way with that Econo-spray
Need to take a few classes, learn about molasses
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin on the phone
Tellin Penny thats the way to do it, baby represent ya home

(Chorus)
Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy (It takes over me)
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)
You might also like[MJG]
My candy-coated paint will bring flavors to your mind
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin game
Lying sayin he go and get the same thang
If you ain't ridin wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin
A plain dashboard, crushed velvet got you itchin
$99.95, thirty-day paint jobs
Got niggas ridin round lookin like a junk yard
You need to put a check with a check, with a check
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet
See most of these new paint jobs they'll do
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true

[Eightball]
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus
5th wheel and the grill like them playaz do in Texas
My folks gettin sideways in Vallejo
Ballaz in Memphis slammin shut the Cadillac doors
Full of ink so blinked I could fly
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die
Descending, my mind goes back into reality
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain
Big Ball tellin you its all about the candy mane
(Chorus) x5
Just like candy (candy)
Just like candy
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)Embed
