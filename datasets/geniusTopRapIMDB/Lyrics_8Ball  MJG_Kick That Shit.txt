Kick That Shit Lyrics[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Poetry sayer, true player
Hay cheifa, reefer cheifa
Taking niggas deeper
Creep ya, to retrieve the - sticky leaf uh
8-B-A-Double-L is written on my teeth
The name, of the coast to coast, host with the most
Transparency, meaning you can't see me like a ghost
Fire from the everlasting burning in my head
Creating tablets with commandments of the shit I said
Funk banger, bowling ball nut swanger
Making rhythms using blues but I'm not a singer
Call me the fat mac - cooling, smoking indo
Able to make your ho pussy hotter than tobasco
Heart stopper, 'cause I'm such a shit popper
Bitches dissing gon' be waking up with Jimmy Hoffa
Shut the trash up - bitch, point your ass up
Kicking that shit is an event I just can't pass up
[Chorus: 8Ball]
When the shit jumps off, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If a nigga player hates, don't let it pass
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If player hating turns into violating
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
Man, it's all up to you
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")

[Verse 2: MJG]
Here comes the motherfucking only
Just smack the phonies
Prepare your bitches for stitches
The rubberhead dick is digging ditches
For riches, only in a, emergency
Could it be that the gigolo comes out of me?
I'm MJG, the connoisseur, entrepreneur
I lure a bitch back to the house and let the freaks do her
I'm going blind, the smoke is thick
It's getting cloudy, I'm out this motherfucker, nigga outie
8000, the liquors and ounce, make me lend out
More bullets, more quicker than the whole crowd saw me pull it
Cap 'em high, watch me shake 'em low, 'cause I think 'em go crazy
Screaming, "pay me," that nigga lazy
P-Funk, hit like a tree trunk, and got him peeking
Too much and, mister cuphand, now he reaching
Sneaking, constantly peeping, looking for pickin's
She need to comprehend with the shit that I be kickin'

Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all

[Chorus: 8Ball]
When the shit jumps off, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If a nigga player hates, don't let it pass
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If player hating turns into violating
What you gonna do?

Man, it's all up to you
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Here it is, once again - it's 8Bizzal
Flipping the funky flavor with a pause
Dog, what you say? Nigga, what?
You mad 'cause I boned and broke your little slut?
Fool, what you expect?
I really hope a, sucker get in the range of my scope'a
I told ya, that I would blow your ass all the way
Skippety-bop with my Glock like Cab Calloway
Smiling, profiling, teeth glistening
Talking like I'm whispering 'cause everybody's listening
Mentioning how I'm venturing into Michigan
Third under my belt, and it's still Suave clique again
Hear me, nigga, fear me - don't come near me
Santa, with anna dropping bombs down your chimney
Fatter, Tec gripper, chest mangler
Send a nigga six feet in a box rectangular
[Verse 4: MJG]
They call me M-J fuckin' G, I
Looked for the tree, high since I was knee-high
I rampage a room full of bitches, fuck a rest have'
Lest they's be lickin' testy's, while they rest they's
Chin on my inner thigh and, really try and
Proceed to kinda feel to need to make a nigga believe you
And did you, suck a bandit dick, and bitch, it's still to feed you
I read through, that motherfuckin', shit stuck and
My past shit sent to ruin, ain't true and
You and your whole agenda must surrender
Remember, I strike so hard I knock you down like timber
Relaxing, continue stacking multiple ends
And looking to find a way to flip my dividends again
Mr. Mackin, pistol packin', straight jackin'
The shit out of a nigga's anus, make him famous
Done paid for it last night and, too many fighting
Resulted to a wig splitting, he died shitting

[Bridge: 8Ball]
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
("Get busy")
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
("Get busy y'all")

[Chorus: 8Ball]
When the shit jumps off, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If a nigga player hates, don't let it pass
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
If player hating turns into violating
What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")
Man, it's all up to you
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
("Kick that shit")Embed
