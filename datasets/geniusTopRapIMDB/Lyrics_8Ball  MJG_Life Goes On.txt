Life Goes On Lyrics[Intro: Drumma Boy]
Life, life, life goes on
New music, 8Ball & MJG
Whattup Thugga? Boss
It's ya boy Drumma
A-yeah boy! Life goes on

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Now I've been up, I've been down, I've been in, I've been out
I was loved, I was hated, bitch niggas tried to cross me out
Nigga I've been on, I've been off
I've been a worker, I've been a boss
Out of all the shit I've ever been, I've never been soft
I've been broke, I've been rich
And a nigga ain't never been no snitch
I'm a fat black nigga but I never had a problem gettin' no bitch
But I've been stranded, I've been alone
Had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them young niggas
Keep that dumb shit away from my door
I've been cheated and I've been robbed
Niggas don't give a fuck who you are
Niggas don't give a fuck 'bout your status
Niggas don't give a fuck if you a star
You got all the latest guns, you got 80 niggas with you
But if niggas wanna hit ya, best believe they'll get'cha
[Hook]
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Thugga, Slim Thugga
I done seen it all, saw boys ball then fall down and crawl
One day knockin' down the mall, next day tryna sell it all
These streets so wild, just one call
Can have you locked down by them laws
One nigga snitch, make up some shit
Conspiracy have you behind them walls
Game so foul, not just crack
A nigga out here tryna sell y'all rap
Feel like I'm back up in that trap
I'm in that studio tryna stack my stacks
Radio only play shit that's wack
They ain't tryna hear a nigga spit these facts
So I guess I'll never get me no plaque
But shit, I'll quit 'fore a nigga to do that
Man I'm a hustler, I don't need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
I'll sell anything that a nigga buyin'
Boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back
Life goes on, just stay strong, Pac told me that, huh

And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)

[Verse 3: MJG]
Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone, but life goes on!
And so you gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate, they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever woulda learned how to climb out
Some things you can't be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mils
But what both them got in common?
Neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher or practice still
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight, MJ, tryna live life and do a little good
I played my part but I didn't write the book
[Hook]
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)2Embed
