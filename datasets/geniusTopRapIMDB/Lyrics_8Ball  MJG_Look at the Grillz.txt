Look at the Grillz Lyrics[Intro]
Look at the grill
Look at the grill
Look at the grill
Look at the grill

[Chorus: 8Ball & (MJG)]
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
[Verse 1: T.I.]
(Ay, Grand Hustle, Bad Boy South, let's ride, nigga)
Chevy super clean, two or three screens
Watch DVDs, to the left I lean
50 karats in the crown, nigga, no more scheme
Just to let you sucker niggas know I'm the king
This green I smoke we call it dro
It's deadly as promethazine
You see my folk, we ain't no joke
Don't turn this into a murder scene
I'm paranoid totin' this .44
Been shootin' out since my early teens
I'ma drop that though, grab a M-16
You can bring all the niggas you want to bring
Hey! I thought you were running things
All you did was run the screens
Must be out his mind thinkin' T.I.P. won't touch 'em
See ya, I'ma rush ya, "Let it Burn" like Usher
Click, click, bang, nigga, end the discussion
Ain't shit sweet 'cause I seen you was bluffin'
I still would spray broad day, ain't nothing
And let Mac Boney AK do it for me
I'm immune to the drama, act a fool if you wanna
Lean in my pocket, 40 cal by the stomach
He acting like he want it, I'ma show a nigga somethin'
Somebody finna to have to break the news to his momma
I don't tolerate sucka niggas tryin' me
Take a special kinda nigga to be fly as me
Similar to 8Ball and MJG, been comin' out hard since '93
Niggas know, ain't no outshining me
I've been the G you're trying to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers and killers
Real niggas gonna ride wit' me

[Verse 2: Twista]
Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp Twist, I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game count major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist. fuck you, bitch
I don't really wanna have to bust you, bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
'Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Never try to jack, you gon' lose, 'cause like Cube, I'ma kill at will
And motherfuckers wanna take my style
'Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball & MJG
Twista bitch and I from the Chi
With my Memphis connect and I ain't gon' lie
We be specializing in only coming up with dope shit
And pulling up with cold wheels that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
Ride when I bump Kamikaze shit while I scream look at my grill, ho
[Chorus: 8Ball & (MJG)]
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)

[Verse 3: Eightball]
Gold grill smile, wiling out up in the VIP
The club close at 5 o'clock, we pulling up around three
Woodgrain wheel gripping, Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players keep me gleamin' like I'm Willie Beamen
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She scheming, dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama, I just wanna have some fun

[Verse 4: MJG]
Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You might as well jump off a cliff, you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin' back at perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now and hurt you later
But I ain't worried, I'll smoke one of you fucking haters
And now I'm higher than gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tenn. pimpin', gotta rep it
The dirt I did, under the rug where a nigga swept it

[Chorus: 8Ball & (MJG)]
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the bankrolls (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas with the pretty cars (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who got all the hoes (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
This for my niggas who don't give a fuck (look at the grill on my pimp mobile)
