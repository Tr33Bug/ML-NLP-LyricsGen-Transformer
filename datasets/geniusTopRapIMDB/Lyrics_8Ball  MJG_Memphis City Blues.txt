Memphis City Blues Lyrics[Intro: Corte Ellis]
Hmmm...
Said I got the blues
Said I got the blues
Memphis City Blues

[Verse 1: Eightball]
Light up the green, watch me light up the room
Watch me light up the mic, fat boy be the truth
Nigga live and learn, learn the streets or get burned
Niggas take what you earn, they be slick as a perm
Mayne, I try to be slicker, try to be cunning and quicker
Try to be more than just another broke ass nigga
In this game of life, lose your life in the game
Take a life full of pain, make you remember my name
From the home of the blues, thought I paid my dues
It's hard to fill my shoes, imitators abuse
I just love the music, like my heart or my brain
Couldn't live without it, that's impossible mayne
I'm unstoppable mayne, from the bottom I came
Niggas scratching for bread, stumbled up on the fame
Humble niggas with game, shut your mouth up and listen
Recognize it's a blessing, thankful just to be living
[Chorus]
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

[Verse 2: MJG]
I had the Memphis City jones running through my bones
Way, way back with A+ beepers and gray phones
Even further back when I was just playing around the yard
Riding bikes and shit, falling and getting my legs scarred
In the Music City, Memphis, Tenn., they turned me into this
My dad and a couple of my friends they played instruments
And when we used to roll to school at 16
We bumped shit like Bobby Womack and Al Green
Hell, I knew most of the old school shit from front to end
I would start to memorize four-fives at age 10
I come from a city where R&B run deep
And the blues was the music that paved the whole street
It was only natural that we would take the torch and run wit' it
Be serious but still have a little fun wit' it
MJG from a town that runs real deep
Ask B. B. King and Isaac Hayes on Beale Street
You might also like[Chorus]
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
On that pimping man, me and G was born and raised
Commodores, O'Jays, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Windows rolled down, no AC 'cause the gas low
Bread at a minimum but still we found a place to go
North to the South at my nigga house, chiefing out
Skipping school, learning what the Memphis City Blues 'bout
Me and G and a whole bunch of others
Had a rocky road to travel just to make the world love us

[Verse 4: MJG]
'Cause it's The Memphis City, really, to call it itty bitty
Would be an understatement—we got big ass, cash, and titties
Big pimping working and hurt the pockets of big tippers
Side dippers and big jails to hide niggas
But we stayed out 'em
Hard times we prayed 'bout 'em
Nigga step up talking that shit and I laid out him
MJG reppin' the Memphis, Tenny
You and I could feel it, pass me some of the Henny
[Chorus]
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets, oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets, oh man, oh man, oh man

[Outro: Corte Ellis + Mechalie Jamison]
Memphis City
Said I got the blues
Said I got the blues
Said I got the blues
Got a jones in my bones and it won't leave me alone
I got the blues1Embed
