Pimp In My Own Rhyme Lyrics[Intro: 8Ball]
Uh

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Light up the bomb 'cause here I come, it's 8Bizz-all
Got the remedy, Dr. Green Sticky got the cure for me
Pimp type, I'm so tight, taking flight
Like a kite when the wind blows, creepin' in my Timbos
Most hoes know I'm out to get the loot
Fuck being your boyfriend, girl, I wanna hit the boots
Jump deep in that rump and then I gotta flap, bitch
You should've known how a real nigga act
That's why I be about my Ps and Qs
'Cause hoes end up being bad news
Find 'em, fuck 'em, split 'em, forget 'em
Let the ho go so the next Joe can hit 'em
Real 'bout this playa shit, Suave came deeper than the ocean
Lil' Hane hit me with the potion
Floatin', Cloud 9 is beneath me
Niggas can't see 8Ball & MJ-fuckin'-G
Dope like a cake, fake niggas get the pow
Fuckin' with the Or— Orange Mound veteran
Don't be the next one to get done and find
You can't fade a pimp in his own fuckin' rhyme
[Chorus: 8ball & MJG]
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a—

[Verse 2: MJG & 8Ball]
These bitches be poppin' game and wearin' they nigga's clothes
Scandalous groupie, big choosy booty, outrageous hoes
Bitches and back rubs, bubblin' bathtubs
Luxury hotels, executive strip clubs
A natural born break-a-bitch scholar, holla if you hear me
Step off if you trick bustas fear me
Hear the pimp speakin' for all and each and
And each and all, now break 'em off somethin', Ball
What's next? Much real shit comin' from the two
Pimp niggas who survived comin' up, payin' dues
Funky flippin', style switchin', niggas better pay attention
Before the automatic start spittin'
Listen, 8Ball be straight bubblin'
Slow-ass niggas gettin' broke off by my tongue again
Comin' in, MJ-fuckin'-G, lettin' 'em know the time
And I'm just a pimp in my own rhyme

[Verse 3: MJG]
Here comes the motherfuckin' player, the rhyme sayer, bitch slayer
I break a young woman's back, then I take her
Home, the thrill is gone, I gotta jet
The set before I get my ass in some mess
Sippin' Hennessey 'til I finish the whole cup of the cognac
Catchin' contact with the blunts back
Superfly and Mr. Gold, that is gettin' old
This'll label me a young goodie straight out the hoodie
I'm able to lay my game down in a single bound
Then while I'm in the same town, smoke out on a pound
As I'm keepin' a eye for tight hoes while I creep
Through the streets while you sleep with them Ds on my Jeep
Peep this, a hundred and ten percent physical fitness
I lay the type of pipe to put the plumber out of business
Who is this manipulator? Demonstrator?
Pimp shit, top-rater, trick hater
Bustas can't comprehend, but then again
They never could, too busy fuckin' off in the neighborhood
I'ma keep pimpin' rhymes, I'm out of my pimpin' mind
I'm here to say that I'm a pimp in my own rhyme
[Chorus: 8ball & MJG]
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a
Pimp (Pimp) in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes, I'm a pimpEmbed
