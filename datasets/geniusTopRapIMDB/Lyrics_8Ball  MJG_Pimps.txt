Pimps Lyrics[Intro: Eightball]
Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball & MJG in the muthafuckin' house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin'
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas don't do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah
[Verse 1: 8Ball]
It takes a nigga that's hard from the start, you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch, mack her down, then rip her apart
It's all in the game, a nigga can't change
If you don't break a bitch, then your game is lame, mayne
See, I'm from Tennessee, with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go, bitches strike up conversations wit' me
About the way I talk, about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See, how I bait 'em in, soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my Cadillac, chillin' like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack, drinkin' on a pint of 'gnac
I pick up my car phone 'cause the freak beeped
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creep
That's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
When you ain't around, anybody could be in that ass
But I'm just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live, to some it's hard to swallow
See, livin' down south ain't what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps

[Interlude: Eightball]
Yeah, that's right
We trying to teach all these lames, you know
How to do this shit
'Cause it's really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high
You might also like[Sampled Chorus]
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(I get so high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

[Verse 2: MJG]
Now let me explain a pimp, a nigga about the M-O-N-E-Y
See a ho, break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin'
Surrounded by all these hoes, that's goin' and givin' me money?
It's funny how a ho can make you think she wit' ya
When all the time, she's just another nigga's gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business, bring me the money
Yeah, this shit is thick
Ho, don't violate, bitch, you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a manâ€”"man" meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game, same ol' same to make your pimpin' thicker
Slicker the pimpin' gets, freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coo-coo for these tricks
I pimp

[Interlude: MJG]
Yeah, that's right, baby, I pimp
So uh, what you need to do, you need to sit dat ass there
And uh, right about now, I'm 'bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high
[Sampled Chorus]
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(Ah shit, so high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Part 2, it's all the same, G
Trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
Lesson one: First you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
Next time tell her no, the next time, take her dough
Oh, you better watch your back, too, mayne
'Cause there's a lot of bitches in the world wit' much game
Lesson two: Watch that ho, don't trust her wit' none of yo' dough
Never let a bitch know, how you make your cash flow
Lesson three: If you don't tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit, but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See, a real nigga believe in beatin' them hoes down
Push her head into the wall 'til you hear that crackin' sound
Drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
Some niggas get pussy-whupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this, buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes, fuck 'em then drop 'em fast
I don't understand your plan at all, man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps

[Interlude: Eightball]
Yeah, man, these niggas a trip, you know what I'm sayin'
But niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke 'em, I get so high

[Sampled Chorus]
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(You know I stay high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

[Verse 4: MJG]
Wherever there is a ho, there's bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money 'til he ain't got nothin' left
Instead of blaming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldn't be a ho if it wasn't for the tricks
But I suggest we keep 'em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood, there wouldn't be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka?
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They can't hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimp's game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin' is dead when, nigga, you know it's alive?
Pimpin' is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
Others tried pimpin', but was only makin' chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn, ain't that a bitch, niggas like me
Pimp

[Interlude: MJG]
MJ-fuckin'-G, P-I-M-P
Staying down on this pimpin' 'bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high

[Sampled Chorus]
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(Ah yeah, I get so fuckin' high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground2Embed
