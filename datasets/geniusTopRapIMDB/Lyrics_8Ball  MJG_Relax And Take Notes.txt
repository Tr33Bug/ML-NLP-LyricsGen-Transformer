Relax And Take Notes Lyrics[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. sample]
Relax and take notes
While-while-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, gunsmoke, gunsmoke
I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
Relax and take notes
While-while-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, gun smoke, gun smoke
I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
[Verse 1: 8Ball]
M-E-M-P-H-I-S
I'ma rep this here 'til I walk up on death
My demise ain't near—don't hold your breath
Cook heat over beats, so, I'm something like a chef
Purple kushes; my bitches wax off they pussy bushes (Bushes)
Eat dick like it's delicious and grant a pimp wishes (Wishes)
She dig my country talkin', she say I sound funny
Embassy Suites, sittin' on the bed, counting money
Illegal hustling (Hustling), dirty money muscling (Muscling)
Spend it like I never saw a day of pain or suffering
Look at my face, you can tell I seen both of them (Of them)
I stick and move, do my business, get the dough, and dip (Dip)
My chronic habit heavy, weedman in every city
My money big so my airplane's lil'-bitty
Major visibility, Bad Boy lieutenant
Black Phantom with the black guts, and I'm in it

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Relax and take notes
While I-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, gun-smoke, gun-smoke
I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
Relax and take notes
While I-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, gun-smoke, gun-smoke
I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)

Yeah, fuck it, I'ma blast off, take my mask off
Blow your fuckin' ass off, give me the cash 'cause—
MJG not playing no games
If you not speakin' good, don't be sayin' my name
Nigga, no, it ain't okay with you; within a day or two— (Two)
I'ma track you down and pull a motherfucking Rae Carruth
Ain't no way you niggas can hide
I can get you in the house, I can get you outside
I'ma load the pump up (Pump up), lay down, jump up (Jump up)
Surprise, everybody finna help me with my come-up
Damn, I done made all of y'all shit your jeans
This look like it might be a job for Mr. Clean
Ol' bootleg nigga, you's a knock-off, an imitation
Local-ass kingpin nigga with a limitation
You don't want no drama with me
’Cause I got the ghost of Jeffrey Dahmer with me, yeah!

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Relax and take notes
While I-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke

I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
Relax and take notes
While I-while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, gun-smoke, gun-smoke
I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Suckers want to see me fall, fall like a ton of bricks
It'll never happen, dog—Project Pat-uh play it slick
Flick when I'm in the ride, nine-milli' homicide
Done when you come wrong, shoot suckers in the dome
Always about the cheese, didn't wanna go there (There)
He don't want to pay me? Where he stay? Let's roll there (There)
What's crooked as a crooked letter? Humpback, humpback
Soda cook the dope together, jump back, jump back (Jump back)
Meet any weather, cock it, pump back, pump back (Pump back)
If you bust it first, I'ma dump back, dump back (Dump back)
Down South, we gon' hustle 'til the rooster crow
My nose runnin' still, 'cause a nigga used to blow
If pockets low, I'll let you know—don't turn around
A hair-trigger that'll bust—don't make a sound
I'ma tell you what you do: Lay it on the ground
Don't be hesitatin', fool, before I blow you down

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]

I-I-I just want the paper (Uh-huh), I just-I just want the paper (Uh-huh)
