Stand Up Lyrics[Hook: x2]
South niggas stand up, weak niggas man-up, fuck these niggas that show us no love

Be strong, be a man, don't lie, don't steal, keep it real for as long as you live, make money, get fizzy, the last thing you do, don't matter what he or she do fuck that shit I could see trough anything, you think, you say, you try, slick niggas tryin to get by, you can't even look me in my eye, go hard to the dirt, don't stop don't quit, even if you steal can get rich quick, like you wanna judge me, but you don't know me, I'm a winner already, I don't need a trophy, MJ fuckin G, I'm true I'm straight, same old G every day, you can't even take the reezemey

[Hook x2]
