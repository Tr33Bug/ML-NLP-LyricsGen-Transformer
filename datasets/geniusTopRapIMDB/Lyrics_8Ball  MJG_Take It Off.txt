Take It Off Lyrics
I wanna see you take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Go head show me dat candy babe
Show me dat candy
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off

(Hook x2)
Lemme see you take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off
Go head show me dat candy babe
Go head show me dat candy
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off
I just can't get enuff
I'i just can't get enuff
(Verse 1-8Ball)
Yea yea
Grab dat motherfuckin tight
Don't play around wit me baby go'ne pull it out
You know you wan't to bitch, I got you go'ne put it in yo mouth
Call one of your girlfriends me and you plus her thats three
I know yo pill kickin in i can tell by the way you lookin at me
Shake that big ol round caramel brown sexy ass
Hit this weed, Wat else you need imma go and get that fast
Roll yo hips to tha beat, girl slide yo ass up and down that pole
The way you doin that dance make a pimp like me lose control
Them jeans fit so tight, I know wats up under there so right
(damn)Pack a bag, a bitch like you need to be spendin the night
Need to be ridin wit me, Rollin up trees and catchin flights
Don't be so fly wit me, Let me put this dick up in yo life

(Hook x2
Lemme see you take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off
Go head show me dat candy babe
Go head show me dat candy
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off
I just can't get enuff
I'i just can't get enuff

I saw you walkin in tha club witcha throwback
Witcha hair bent up, Witcha flip flops on
Now go head take it off get naked, Mix a lil r&b over a hard hip hop song

MJ, I be the narrator of the song you dance to when you get tips
You go hard, even when yo pimp got you
Witcha racoon eyes, and yo swole up big lips
Now i be sittin in the front row right before come out of the back room waitin for a strip tease
Can I get me a table dance without all the attitude and the lip please
[- From: http://www.elyrics.net -]
Can we go into the V.I.P of the V.I.P in the back of the back room
Baby you can come with something creative that gonna make me wanna hurry up and try to come back soon
Can you get down and work the pole, you know once you come out the stage i wanna see you do it
Go head put your legs on tha pole, Spin around bring you upside down it ain't nothin to it
All yall lookin good to me, I just wanna reach out with my finger tips tickle it and touch one
Ride this wood, Ride it good, You make me fell like i like i, i wanna bust one

(Hook x2)
Lemme see you take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off
Go head show me dat candy babe
Go head show me dat candy
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off
I just can't get enuff
I'i just can't get enuff
(Verse 3 8Ball & MJG)
(8Ball)now you got that fire I can see it in yo eyes
Mama that ain't no lie, Wat kinda dude would i be if i could stand right here and dont even try
Wanna kiss them thighs let a real nigga taste that cherry pie
Watch you and lil mama get started on the way to the house in my ride
Stop and get my two best friends cigarillos and a pack of condoms
Take them clothes off let a nigga see that candy lil mama
(MJG)Imma hit you with this eye, that yo girlfriend baby girl she already know that
You kickin to this lil classic kid, It'll make you wanna reminous something like a throwback
MJ, pimp tight, i been waitin patiently to see your ass cheek wiggle little
Stop playin wit me, I wanna see you pull a thug to the side like you really wanna give it up
Stick a finger in yo mouth, Lick it up a lil bit now slowly suck down
Next time imma get the airport shuttle and drop me off at the club when i touch down

(Hook x2)
Lemme see you take it off
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off
Go head show me dat candy babe
Go head show me dat candy
Take it off, Take it off
Take it off, Take it off
I just can't get enuff
I'i just can't get enuffEmbed
