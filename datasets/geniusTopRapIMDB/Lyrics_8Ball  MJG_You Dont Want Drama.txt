You Donâ€™t Want Drama Lyrics[Intro: Diddy]
Bangladesh
Yeah, it's Bad Boy South, niggas, Ball and G
Orange Mound, the moment you've been waitin' for
New York collaboration, c'mon now
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Straight from the underground, fat boy from the Mound
Spit it how I live it, keep it gutter, that's how we get down
I wanna see you get it crunk, let a nigga know what hood you from
Everybody with me drunk as fuck, break it down then roll it up
Back it up, a girl like you, a nigga like me can't pass it up
Rollin' by, lookin' good, put it in reverse then back it up
What's the deal? Let me make it clear what you got right here
They broke the mold, one of a kind, fat boy with a gold mouth that shine
Hard to touch, sorry to tell you, boys out here ain't hard as us
Ball and G, part of the streets, 'cause the streets are a part of us
Lay it down, please remember, games, we don't play them now
Disrespect, please remember those stains, we gon' spray them rounds
[Chorus]
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, bitch
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no

[Verse 2: MJG]
Get up (Get up) Get crunk (Get Crunk), let's race to the trunk (To the trunk)
Get a pump, unload and dump, fuck it, he chose to jump
In the middle of a fire, scotch and burn him, lets overheat him
Really mistreat him, let's Rodney King him and overbeat him
MJG is the reason your season needed seasonal spices
They needed more life and lucky your wife was bleedin'
Now your life is leavin' your body for drinkin' too much Bacardi
You should've known when you started, never fuck with G and E
In any climate I'm shinin', floss, I'm perfect with timin'
I'm good for rippin' and rhymin' in and out the beat
And 8 Ball is loadin' the clip for niggas supposin' to trip
And you know I'm rollin' the whip, we finna set 'em free

[Chorus]
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, bitch
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no

8 Ball and G, get it crunk for sure
My swagger, my flavor, my pimpin', my flow
My ho, my woman, my slacks, my denims
My backstroke and swimmin' in pools with models in 'em
Them boys, they hate it, we hustle, we made it
We richer, the picture is two of the greatest
The realest, you bump some Ball and G, you gon' feel it
Guaranteed, motherfucker, stamp, sign, seal it
Replacin', the fakest, they don't give it up we gon' take it
The realest up in in this, niggas buckin', bitches shakin'
They asses, for cash, it might be a habit
Like mics when we grab it, we cock it, we blast it

[Chorus]
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bust a nigga head, smack a ho, shoot the club up
Bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, bitch
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no
You don't want drama, no
You don't want none, no

[Outro: Diddy]
So here we go, Bad Boy South
Ball and G, Orange Mound
New York collaboration
You don't want no drama, you don't want none
I see you ATL, let's tear this shit up
C'mon, c'mon
I said let's tear this shit up!
Yeah, Ball and G, Bad Boy South
Let's go, let's work these motherfuckers
Let's get this money niggas, yeah, as we proceedEmbed
