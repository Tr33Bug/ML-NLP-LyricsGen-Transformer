TranslationsРусскийPortuguêsFrançaisBabushka Boi Lyrics
Uh
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, no dentures please
Princess cut, no dentist, please
Say cheese for the cameras (Ayy)
Eight Gs for the dancers (Ayy)
Benjis in the safe (That's right, ayy)
Bentleys for the phantoms (Uh)
But they all go to waste (Uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
The scar on my face
But w-wait
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)
The world is yours, Scarface, nigga
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)

I ain't duckin' niggas, I ain't duckin' bullets either
Shit, I ain't duck sauce since I became a vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place wit' ya breezy
Prada shades, that's probably why you couldn't see him
Shittin' me? (Boy)

I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars on the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

Uh, fuck no, this ain't no hookah
Smokin' while I'm strollin' down Wooster
Buck fifty, my babushka
No pistol poppers and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low top, yeah, the powder blue ones
Robber too, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God
You might also like
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

Uh, pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes
Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes134Embed
