I ain't scared, uh
Real niggas put the clip in and let it go, uh
Real niggas wanna run real, uh

Real (Buckshot)
Real niggas from the roll (Ends with a buckshot)
Real niggas from the end
Real niggas from the home (Buckshot)
Homeboy, you ain't know (Ends with a buckshot)
Had a bitch suckin' on a lollipop at the bus stop
Green Glock, red Glock (Buckshot)
They ain't really ready for me when I (Buckshot)
They ain't really ready for me when I (Buckshot)
What the blood clot?
Niggas know not what, nigga, whatnot, yeah
From the fort, Fort Knox, this ain't Fortnite, nigga
Get your shit rocked, nigga
Buckshots, uh, uh (Buckshot)
And my picture's like a mugshot (Uh)
And all my bitches got butt shots (Hahaha, uh, ha)
Uh, uh, yeah, buckshots, yeah, yeah
Left this man dead in the damn lot, yeah, uh, yeah
In the kitchen pourin' up the Wock'
Yeah, yeah, pour it on the fuckin' clock (Wrist)
Yeah, buckshots
Everybody in this bitch got a mugshot (Hold up, hold up)
Nigga, push up, now we on your block (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm off the bean and the damn Wock' (Hold up, hold up)

Got a clip and it's full (Buckshot)
Leave a motherfucker in the (Ends with a buckshot)
Man, I was grown up since a young blood (Buckshot)
Now I'm bustin' off shots (Ends with a buckshot)
Back in my younger days, all I want was braids
All my mama want from me was grades (Buckshot)
They ain't really ready for me when I (Buckshot)
One stop, nigga, get some drugs and a damn Glock (Hold up, hold up)

Uh, got them bullets aimin' at your head top
AK-47, try to run up, bet we send shots (Pew-pew)
Walkin' with my chains out on a opp block
I'm with Drippy Drew (Yeah)
Don't try run up, you get dropped off (Dropped, woah)
Oh, yeah, huh, pull up flexin' with the top down, uh (With the top down, yeah)
I'm with gang with some baddies on that yacht now, uh, yeah (On a yacht now, yeah)
Bought a brand new Mulsanne, Gucci-d down now, huh (Gucci-d down now, yeah)
