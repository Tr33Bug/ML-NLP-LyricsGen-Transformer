TranslationsEspañolDemons Lyrics
I just, I just live
I live day by day, fighting demons

I smoked away my brain, I think I’m going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
'Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rappin'
Now we swaggin', makin' money in Manhattan, trick, what’s happenin'?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel 'til my death, it’s in my flesh, it’s in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick
Spit clip, spit quick, split shit, hit kid's women
Oh, that’s your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It’s A$AP nigga, live with it, swag
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
(Thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you) Add it to your thoughts

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (I'm a hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel)
