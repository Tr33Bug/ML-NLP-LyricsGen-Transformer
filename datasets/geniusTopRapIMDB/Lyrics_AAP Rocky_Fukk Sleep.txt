Oh, yeah, ah-ah

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it (Oh, yeah)

Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Céline, Tiffany, she flossing (Oh)
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (Brrr)
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

I remember I was poor and
When I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens
Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (Sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "Son, you the boss" (Ah)
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment (Ah)
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
You might also like
They called me a bitch, burned me like saffron
My matter is golden, a child of the Odyssey
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He told me when I'm present, chosen
So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (Golden)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going (Ahh, yeah)
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies (Ahh)
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it117Embed
