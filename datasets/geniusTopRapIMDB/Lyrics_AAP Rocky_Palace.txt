Palace Lyrics
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga (Uh,) but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga (Uh,) but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

Uh
Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned, nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music (Yeah)
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel 'cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it, 'bout it, we rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash, fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag, niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal, we smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last, walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash, took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life, Clams
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, boy, how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
Uh, goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling itYou might also like61Embed
