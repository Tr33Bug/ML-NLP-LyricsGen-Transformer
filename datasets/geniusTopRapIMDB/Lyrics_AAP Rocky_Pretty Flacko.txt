Pretty Flacko Lyrics
I keep two killas with me
Keep two bitches with me
Two guns with me
Y'all know who I be, I be that pretty motherfucker, man
Man this the birth of Pretty Flacko, nigga
I mean I be that Harlem, nigga
I be that jiggy nigga, get with me, bitch
Like, tell them hoes suck a dick
Swag, swag 'cause I'm swagging on them
And I continue talking my shit
Skinny nigga, Pretty Flacko, nigga grippin' that chopper
Party like a rocker, but my niggas wilder than Flocka
Whip game proper cause I spit to all of these boppas
I'm big-bodied partner and you niggas talkin' that tonka
I'm as famous as Mozart, hoes lark on my go kart
Get niggas for the Goyard, it cost too much so we bogart
We take yours, nigga, Deebo, hoes love that my teeth gold
My hair wild, my gold fangs, my eyes red, that's beast mode
New hoes, I keep those, bad bitch by the week, oh
It's on, it's on to the next ho, I pray to God that she deep throat
I ain't goin' back to bein' broke, pussy, money and free clothes
Can't forget 'bout the weed smoke, niggas stick to the G code
Comin' down, gettin' throwed, bitches all up in my zone
Thirty-five, forty-four, niggas know we get the show
Pusherman with the kilos, iPhone full of freak hoes
Fuck you mean we ain't wild? We crowd surf at the pre-shows
She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko
It's beef, I'm splittin' your taco, you niggas out of your nachos
Cause bad bitches, man, I got those
And the rose Lexes, man, I rock those
And I pop hoes, got a drop Rolls
With a snot nose, in my condo

If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your motherfuckin' hands up

She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko
She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko
She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko
She fuckin' Pretty Flacko, she want that Pretty Flacko

Yeah man, that's that motherfucking trill shit that I be talking 'bout
Bandanna tied like 2Pac to the side, nigga
It's that A$AP life
It's that trill wave right here, man
Get your surfboards ready, man
That's that Pretty Flacko, nigga
