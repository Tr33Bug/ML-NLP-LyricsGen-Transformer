TranslationsTürkçeSundress Lyrics
Adjust to pain
It hurt too bad to say, to say you left me, left me
Fuckin' with the wrong man
(Left me) Said she fuckin’ with the wrong man
Ever since she left me

I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
You took some time away from me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I see you made your mind (Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just read the signs, it’s clear to see (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm tryna make you mine (Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
'Cause love is blind, you're hurt, it's fine (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
To heal, it takes some time (Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Tokyo trips, shoppin' sprees full of gifts
I remember we would dream about kids
Tryna get that V with that crib
Back when you used to be’s with that Crip
Gotta give a little to get
A little bit in return now, tables turn now
And you heard ’bout me and my bitch
I'm just tryna chill
’Cause lately I've been thinkin' 'bout you and rebuildin’
Walking 'round like you lost feelings
I can tell he not fulfilling
You in love with me still
They say only if looks could kill, for real
You walk around town with that guy
When you pass by (Ah-ah)
I just laugh like (Ah-ah)
You might also like
I guess you fell into the wrong hands, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And now you're F-in' with the wrong man, man
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah190Embed
