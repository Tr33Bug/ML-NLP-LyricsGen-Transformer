Back to Black Lyrics[Verse 1: Andr√© 3000]
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry - get on without your guy

And I, I, I went back to a anew
So far removed from all we've been through
Oh-oh-oh, and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I'd go back to her
And you go back to...
You go back to...You might also like7Embed
