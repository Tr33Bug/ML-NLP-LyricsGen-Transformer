Chronomentrophobia (Movie Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...

[Verse 1]
High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone
[Bridge]
Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now

[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia (x8)

[Verse 2]
Lord, be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya headsYou might also like3Embed
