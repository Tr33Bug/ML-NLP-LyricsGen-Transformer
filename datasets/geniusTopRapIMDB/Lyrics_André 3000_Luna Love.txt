Luna Love LyricsLove is in the air

Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?

Darlin' to me you are fantastic
For you I will swim the entire Panama Canal
And you will be my girl
I will dance the flamenco with a flamingo
In the streets of Miami all night long
Until you hear my song

Yes, yes, I know, call me crazy
Call me insane, as long as you call me
My number is

Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?

Te quiero, mi quieres
Te adoro, I confess
I love you, do you love me?
I adore you, can't you see?You might also likeEmbed
