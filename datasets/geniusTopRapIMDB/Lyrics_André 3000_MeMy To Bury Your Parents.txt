Me&My (To Bury Your Parents) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me and my mother, driving to the grocery store
Me riding shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustling harder, rollers and a nightgown

[Verse 2]
Me and my father, driving to the football game
Me riding shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughing
I was much happier when he was around
[Bridge]
When he was around
When he was around
Around

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my—
Me and my—
Me and—
Me and—
