Outkast Reunion Tour Jumpsuit Slogans Lyrics(Yin-Yang)
X
F#CK 3000

I pray there's a god at the end of all this

Life is short, take more baths
Children of the cornbread
I've never been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call you back
Obviously oblivious
How good a friend are you
Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict
Umm, you still on yo' pyramid?
Across cultures, darker people suffer most. why?

Ok, hand over the cure and stop playing

Art or fart?
I've never had f@ckbook, twitt@r, or inst@gram

Everything is temporary

Ninjas kill me
You might also likeBreathe
Sloppy wet Poseidon
God. or god?

I love old people

Loners get lonely too

Narcissistic americans

Thinking deeply about shallow s#it

Passionate about compassion
