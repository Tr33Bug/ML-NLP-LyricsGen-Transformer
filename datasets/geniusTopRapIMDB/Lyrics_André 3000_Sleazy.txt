Sleazy LyricsI dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day hell remember
If not hes human, Im human, you human, well forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
Hes such a cool a-s guy, then wonder why she date him
Im only 8, Im not old enough, guess its complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it dont get negated
I was gon save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 19802s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin Irish Baileys
She say Stacks, youre true blue?
I said Nah, Im Navy
I call her Kesha, she like it, because its hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 cause Im good to her
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
You can't imagine the immensity of the f*ck Im not giving
About your money and man servant at the mansion you live in
And I dont wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and lets take it back to my basement
And get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but Im not that easy
Im not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
Imma take it back to where my man and my girls is
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
I dont mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your moneys not impressing me, its kinda weak
That you really think youre gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we dont buy bottles, we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I dont care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection, and sure as hell not your money, honey
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!You might also likeEmbed
