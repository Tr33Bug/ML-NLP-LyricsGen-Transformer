Throwdown LyricsDo I watch cartoons?
Class of 3000

Talk what you heard, pay your penny
That means I could throwdown, oh yeah
Olly olly oxen free your body
When we come to your town, oh, yeah

Jump up and touch the sky
Fall till you hit the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah, more, yeah, more, yeah
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown

Clap, clap your hands
Tell your mama, "That man throws down"
Ooh, from Atlanta to Japan
Every land throwdown, oh, yeah

Jump up and touch the sky
Fall, hit the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah, more, yeah, more, yeah

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, throwdown

Ooh, wait, we got this thang pumpin' like fried bologne
I'm, Li'l D and all these drums, I throwdown
That's better than throwin' up
I'm Eddie and with my horn I'll blow you away

I'm Kim and I'm Kam
I'm on the turntables and I make the keyboard jam
I'm Philly Phil and I play bass
So I got that bottom, bow your bottom

You know who I am, I'm Tamika
And with this here guitar I'm a superstar
Hey, all people, I'm Madison and I'm a Pisces
No, Madison, you're supposed to let them know what instrument you play
Oh, um, I play violin and I think we're comin' to the end
