We Want Your Soul LyricsAh, Li'l D, welcome to Soul Stack Records
So, I hear you like to be a star
Well, the price of fame is not cheap
I hope you got what it takes
But all we want is your soul, give it to me
(Soul)
All we want is your soul, give it to me
(Soul)

Soul? Shawty, I got that
Lil' D make a beat, make it hop back
Like a Rabbit, Volkswag or a Cadillac
I'ma show you how to do a record contract
You earn it the old fashioned way
I'm already gold in the hood, past the plate and I'm
Sellin' million records, I can't wait and I'm
Gonna do whatever it takes to 'till I'm straight got soul, sell it

All we want is your soul, give it to me
All we want is your soul, give it to me

Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, wham

Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, wham

Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Give it to 'em, give it to 'em
Give it to 'em, wham

Get 'em, shawty, get 'em, shawty
Get 'em, shawty, get
