Average Cat Lyrics[Hook]
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(What you talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(That's what I'm talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that

[Verse 1]
Man, I ain't talking about the Prop, I ain't talking bout the Roc
I don't talk bout mine, why will I talk on what you got
What you talking bout? Cause you ain't talking about a lot
And nigga, I'm from the ghetto so I talk about the block
They say in every rhyme that I talk about my Glock
But I squeeze for real and don't do no talking when I pop
"Punta maricon, cabron" then you drop
And I stand on my own, I don't be talking to no cops
And I ain't talking for Chris and I ain't talking for Neef
And I ain't talking for Sparks and I ain't talking for Free
I ain't talking for Crakk, I got words for Oschi
But I ain't talking bout that, I'm talking for me
B Sig the sequel, better yet, the prequel
Never fear for war, this hog know I squeeze still
For that thing of ours till we D.I.E
My brothers keep it like Nino and G
That's what I'm talking bout
[Hook]
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(What you talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(That's what I'm talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that

[Verse 2]
I'm a grown-ass man; I don't sit on niggas' laps
And I ain't looking for no gifts outta Santa Claus' sack
Santa ain't real, let alone is he black
Catch him coming down my chimney and the Mac'll go Vrack!
(You scared) Get a dog, get a cat
I bet the cat put the tongue on you rats
Niggas extend their hands, put their hands in their lap
Scared to face the man in the mirror: Mike Jack
The mere sight of Beans raise the hairs on your back
Niggas talking "compared to Sig you wack"
Scrap, I know you ain't wanna talk about that
But since niggas talking, let's talk about facts
From the city where it's long dark nights here
Where hard knock life's real (MJ, Annie are you OK?)
I'm so bad, I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a thriller
Holding a snub with a glove that don't glitter, nigga

I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(What you talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(That's what I'm talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that

[Verse 3]
This ain't a diss record, this a real record
How it feel to get exposed? Don't you feel naked?
I was the fly on the wall, the shit I witnessed
I could say shit that make B look at you different
And my gangsta wasn't never on trial
But I was, I stood up tall, no snitching
But the rapper Shawn called the police on me
Cause I was front row at the Blueprint 3
I just wanted to see him MC
And reminisce when we was the R.O.C
But he called on the C.O.P's
Not only that, he brought in the F.E.Ds (snitch)
So that's telling me "F.U. Sig"
So F you too and F Bleek 3
See, whether I rap or riddle out this motherfucker
Pack a Gat keep a pistol out this motherfucker
Crack a brick down the middle out this motherfucker
My name good in every hood out this mother fucker
Motherfucker
[Hook]
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(What you talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
(That's what I'm talking bout?)
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that

[Outro]
Real rap
See, I think I held my tongue long enough
About this whole Roc-A-Fella situation
I was the realest thing that happened to the Roc
The Roc was just a rock
I brought the fellas to Roc-A-Fella Records
Hot 9-7, stay proper, y'all remember
I brought the street cred to that
That thing etched in stone
I fought all them battles, me, that's who
Jadakiss, Nas, Dipset
Anybody you would've told me to go after
Matter of fact you ain't even have to tell me
I front line for that Roc
For that finger guard
For that diamonds that people was throwing up
I'd a took a bullet for Roc that day
This ain't about a dollar
This ain't about me hating on you cuz or anything
Cause I never asked you for a dollar
When I came home from jail
Home, out here in the day
When you ain't come one day to come see me
Not one picture, a letter
I went to the office and asked you
Let me off Roc-A-Fella Records, out that situation
Cause somebody, no man no blame, wanted me
And they wanted to give some real money
And you bounced that tennis ball around in your office for a hour
And went back and forth with me and told me you ain't wanna let me go
You remember that don't you?
You even asked me did I want some money and I told you I don't want your money
But you was in a position to make me get my own money
And you couldn't do that
But Sigel so real
And you will never go to jail again cause you knew I would shoot
If my life was a movie, Sigel be the sequel
You ain't fit for war
Cause Sigel's in the field
It's etched in stone
My gangsta ain't never been on trial
But guess what:
How 2Pac say? I ain't mad at ya
I understand, everybody can't go
And you are already old
Oh, and don't get it fucked up
This ain't the green light for everybody to start making "diss Jay-Z" records
Nah, I still got love for the nigga
This me taking my brother in the yard for 5 minutes
Cause I got a knot in my chest that need to get unloosened
And you got love for a motherfucker don't go away that easy
See, many people gonna walk in and out your life
But only real friends leave footprints on your heart, dog
But I think yours fading in the sand
And that's real rap
And if me and you don't never talk again, dog
And I gotta holla at you via MC on this mic, what up?
How you say? Scream at me
The richest man ain't the one with his first dollar, dogg
It's the one who still got his first friend
Roc-A-Fella for life, nigga
It's the RocEmbed
