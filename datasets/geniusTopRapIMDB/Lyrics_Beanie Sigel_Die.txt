Die Lyrics[Production by Daven "Prestige" Vanderpool]

[Chorus]
We chapters of the same book, just a different page
Niggas in the struggle all out ta get paid
Doin' what we gotta do to avoid the raid
Avoid the cage, but you can't avoid the grave
We chapters of the same book, just a different page
Niggas in the struggle all out ta get paid
Doin' what we gotta do to avoid the raid
Avoid the cage, but you can't avoid the grave
[Verse]
When you live by the sword, you die by the sword
I'll probably die in the vocal booth spittin' out raw
Die on stage, rippin' down tours
Die from AIDS, trickin' out-a-town whores
Die 'cause I didn't have one in the pipe
Might go out like Raymond, went out on his bike
Or die on a death mission, two TECs spittin'
No vest, section from my chest missin'
Die 'cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a reckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
'Cause a broke ass nigga tried to say I ass bet 'em
Die from a shot from a SIG or Glock
From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop
Or die 'cause I was on, ain't see 'em comin'
Too late, eight shots got my body numbin'
Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed
Die 'cause a nigga thought I snitched to the Feds
Die with a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair
Or die 'cause a nigga pulled his Roscoe out quicker
I was high off vodka, hydro, or malt liquor
Die 'cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die 'cause the cops tricked me to say that man
Die 'cause I hesitated to spray that man
Die 'cause I hesitated to pay that man
Die 'cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die 'cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool
Die 'cause I mixed all them pills with Hennessy
Or die 'cause them niggas was jel, they envied me
Die tryin' to steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die 'cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die 'cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't pop
Die 'cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die 'cause them niggas thought the coke was in the spot
Die 'cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die 'cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die 'cause a nigga was tryin' to get a name
Or die 'cause it was just my time to feel the flames
Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots to the heart, to the brain
Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game
Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain
Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac
I'd rather go out in the Masjid makin' Salat
