Feel It in the Air Lyrics[Intro]
My Spidey-Senses is tinglin'
Feel something (Got my radars up)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, doot-doot, doot-doot

[Verse 1]
Somethin' going on, I feel funny
Can't tell me nothin' different (Different), my nose twitchin' (Twitchin')
Intuition setting in like Steve vision (Uh)
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind (Mind)
So what I do? I still take heed, I still listen (Listen)
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism, my words still skippin'
Through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it (You square)
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht, but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will, but I know you won't (You won't, man)
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile, aha, you niggas foul
[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers (Hammers)
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me (Vests on me), two TECs, extra clips on me (Clips on me)
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me (Damn)
I ain't schiz', homie (Homie), ain't nobody drop a mick on me (Mick on me)
It's like they trying to plot and sit on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like, "Mack, tighten up your circle before they hurt you"
Read they body language (Body language)
Eighty-five percent communication nonverbal
Eight-five percent swear they know you, ten percent (You know they story)
Man, the other five, time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master (Puppet master)
Fuck them other bastards (Man), man, watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air (I ain't scared, nigga I ain't goin' nowhere)
I can hear it in your voice (Can you feel it?)
I can feel it in the air (Can you feel me?)

Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'? (Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'?)
Foul preacher quotin'
Scriptures from Revelation, was talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body gettin' stiff (Stiff), soul levitatin' (Levitatin')
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me? As for my sins
No one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parkin'
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka
Same Uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same Lorcin
Damn, I feel it in the air, you not sincere
Nigga, it ain't an "us" or "we" or a "I'ma" thing
It's a good-bad karma thing, this a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something, honestly

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, I can feel it)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh, yeah)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (I can, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it in the air)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air9Embed
