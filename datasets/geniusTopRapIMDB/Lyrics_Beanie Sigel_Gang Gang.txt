Gang Gang Lyrics[Hook]
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Hunting for ops, out hunting for ops, I'm hunting for ops
Got one in the top, I pull out the stock, that chopper go rrah
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Hunting for ops, out hunting for ops, I'm hunting for ops
Got one in the top, I pull out the stock, that chopper go rrah
[Verse 1]
Bully back on that bullshit
Fully Mac with that full clip
Put your ass in the casket nigga
Put the pastor back in that pulpit
Y'all niggas ain't gang gang
Y'all niggas don't bang bang
I let it pop
Still rep the prop
Just took some links out the chain gang
SP, that's me
Think you gangster? Test me
Certified ass real nigga
Bonified ass nigga trill nigga
I'm tooled up, stay hammered down
You done screwed up, I drill niggas
Banana clip in that AK
Your lil monkey ass'll get peeled nigga
Slide up on you smooth, shut up nigga don't move
Run up in the groove, it's too late nigga, boom
Empty out my whole clip on him
Pull my dick out and piss on him
Stand over that bitch nigga
Good night, long kiss homie

[Hook]
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Hunting for ops, out hunting for ops, I'm hunting for ops
Got one in the top, I pull out the stock, that chopper go rrah

Yeah nigga, I'm here nigga
Too late to get scared nigga
Spooned your ass, what your life like?
I know you feel it in the air nigga
You know I'm coming with the gear nigga
100 shot drum prepared nigga
One in the top with that stock off
Body parts get knocked off
Stomping niggas, I ain't boxing niggas
I'm popping niggas, I'm boxing niggas
(You know I rep with bumbaclot mate)
Body shot, I'm oxing niggas
Ready to die, I'm Big Popping niggas
Makaveli alive, 2Pacing niggas
Open your eyes, shit getting scary niggas
La-la-la hail mary nigga
I bury niggas, I'm daring niggas
You ranks, pet cemetery niggas
Invest when I'm hearing niggas
Shoot the rest of you scary niggas
Brrrtttt bitch, I'm back bitch
This Mac bitch, ain't shit changed
Fuck niggas ain't gang gang
And you fuckboys don't bang bang
[Hook]
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Hunting for ops, out hunting for ops, I'm hunting for ops
Got one in the top, I pull out the stock, that chopper go rrah
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Fuck whoever ain't gang gang, fuck whoever ain't gang gang
Hunting for ops, out hunting for ops, I'm hunting for ops
Got one in the top, I pull out the stock, that chopper go rrah
