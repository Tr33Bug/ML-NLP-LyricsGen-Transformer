Gotta Have It Lyrics[Intro: Peedi Crakk]
P. Crakk Cocaine
B, B. Mack is back
Chad, Chad West on track

[Hook 1: Peedi Crakk]
I Gotta Have It! Shout out to my b-boy Beans
And my S.P. chain gang, doin' the damn thing
I Gotta Have It! Don't forget my blicky with the beam
That keep me in good health and kill ya, ya'mean?
[Verse 1: Peedi Crakk]
Chain gang, gang bang, let my middle finger hang
Ain't nothin changed my name, P. Crakk Cocaine (P. Crakk Cocaine)
Relapse, I stay zapped, my urine ain't clean
No one to blame but Peedi and a nigga I mean (nigga I mean)
Ten stacks, Crakk come to the club and do the thing
You ain't got that, I'm in the crib fixin my bricks
Style back, that's the 'methazine
My body itching for a scrap, so I can whip back on the whole sixteen

[Hook 1: Peedi Crakk]
I Gotta Have It! Shout out to my b-boy Beans
And my S.P. chain gang, doin' the damn thing
I Gotta Have It! Don't forget my blicky with the beam
That keep me in good health and kill ya, ya'mean?

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
B. Mack, seat back, S.P. intact
You see me with Crakk, we strapped, what's the reason for that? (What's the reason for that?)
(I Gotta Have It!) I need that, that Philly-boy clap
Hit you niggas in your back, send the rest in your hat (send the rest in your hat)
Stay strapped with the mack, with the 32 tall stack
The aim all that, when I flame you get all that (you get all that)
B-Boy Mack fuck with cracks since tall cats
(It's the chain gang!) Bang bang! I suggest y'all fall back

I Gotta Have It! Shout out to my boy PC
And the S.P. chain gang for doin' their damn thing
I Gotta Have It! Don't forget the rr-ring rr-ring
That keep me in good health and kill ya, ya'mean?

[Verse 3: Peedi Crakk]
Chain gang, blicky with the ban, quickly spit it rr-ring
Sicky Ricky get his ziggy bang, snitchin on the gang (gang)
Don't forget you get that Uncle Midi, get him for his chain
Simply give him a chitty bang, sit him in a cling (cling)
No name, no blame, Mack 10 no aim
Hi-lo, rhino, put your body in pain
No pain, no gain, 'fore I blow your brain
Bo catch me after the show, you know of course I gotta have my thing (thing)

[Hook 1: Peedi Crakk]
I Gotta Have It! Shout out to my b-boy Beans
And my S.P. chain gang, doin' the damn thing
I Gotta Have It! Don't forget my blicky with the beam
That keep me in good health and kill ya, ya'mean?

[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
State Prop click and pop hit you niggas with the Glock
Catch a nigga whippin' in the kitchen, cookin in the pot
Pistol whippin' may crack him (smack him), hit him with the Glock
(When you hear that!) Then you know here come the cops
What up, wait, stop, fuck the cops!
Got the baby uzi wop, turn your cruiser to a drop (cruiser to a drop)
Get off the block 'fore SWATs surround the spot
We be locked in a box, three hots and a cot
[Hook 2: Twista & Peedi Crakk]
I can't have it! Shout out to my boy PC
And the S.P. chain gang for doin' their damn thing
I Gotta Have It! Don't forget the rr-ring rr-ring
That keep me in good health and kill ya, ya'mean?

[Verse 5 - Twista]
The may-or of Chi, this ain't England, ain't no kings and queens
Fixin to hurt from us when you jerk us, we Merciless like Ming
Twista and Beanie greedy like Peedi, make the gun go rr-ring
When you look at the thing, give me the bling, hand me the chain and the ring
Ballin' in the bubble, blowin bubble, always actin up
When trouble feel the double barrell of a double platinum thug
Clappin, ready for some action, and I'ma empty the crib
I rep for the Roc and State Property clique, homie, you can't do shit
Throw a Philly up, give me love, Remy in the club
Windy City thug, in a circle, smoking 50s up
Range Rov, 24 inch, blacked out bulbs
Blows fast, but hit your ho slow with the soul pole
Creeping on niggas trying to test me in the black drop top
Pull up and let the bopper go bop, bop-bop
Switch off in the wind, to my borough, blowin' on my back
And do the same to any nigga that's tryna take what I got
I Can't Have It!

[Bridge: Peedi Crakk]
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kind of hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kind of hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kind of hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kind of hectic
Se pone, se pone, se pone muy difícil
Se pone, se pone, se pone muy difícil
Se pone, se pone, se pone muy difícil
Se pone, se pone, se pone muy difícil

[Outro: Peedi Crakk]
