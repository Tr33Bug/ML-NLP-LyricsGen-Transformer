I Canâ€™t Go On This Way Lyrics[Intro: Beanie Sigel]
Honor, trust, respect
Devotion, friendship, loyalty
Karma, team, us, Roc solid
D'evils, damn

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Wit no union, and no benefits no dental plans
I can't eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin'
You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rude
Make a drunk person sing a sober tune
(I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
Cuz you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon pay the bills? supply the meals? no surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely
(I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out going through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me or you listening? there's a big difference
Do you catch the lines and the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer
(I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out going through it I can't do it
My momma say I got her nerves stressed
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin ya please don't let me bury ya
(I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed man, I'm goin through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, let them niggas surround you? shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' ?
(I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill FIFA jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
Cuz I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir
(I can't go on this way)
I gotta still feel feed my young'n's, so keep huggin
[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine
Cuz I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in one time, Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Can't wait til rain turn to sunshine
Cuz I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in the box
(I can't go on this way)


[Verse 3 - Young Chris]
Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto I'm from the youngest be the ghettoist ones
Tryna make just as much as we could
Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could
That's why, that's why I hate 'em man
Them crackers ain't nothing without paper
They look at us it's nothing and uh
(I can't go on this way)
Came too far and I ain't going backwoods for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She hold me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown
(I can't go on this way)
I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated
(I can't go on this way)
Ya'll better make a decision before us
Cuz the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)
They can get it all it take is a column
My dogs'll be down if the rounds gotta unlit it though
(I can't go on this way)
Someday got to forget it though
Consequences for my sentence, got to forgive us thoughYou might also like4Embed
