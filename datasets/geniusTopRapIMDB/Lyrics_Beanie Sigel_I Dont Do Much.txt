I Don’t Do Much Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm
Shit, I don't do much
Y'kna'mean? Smoke weed, fuck bitches (Huh)
Get papercuts from counting money, menage à trois, nah mean? Quadruple à trois nah mean?
I just be chillin, y'kna'mean?
Shit, I don't do much
All that shit—what you expect, man?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't do much, you know Mack stay sucker-free
So please don't fuck with me, you don't really want war
You don't really want the heat from the four
You don't really wanna eat out a straw
Man you niggas is broke, y'all niggas ain't got no cash
Man, you niggas ain't got no stash
Where your wheel and your rims?
Motherfucker, look at the heel on your Timbs
Nigga, your walk and your talking—you niggas is ass
Shit, I don't do much—you know Mack, lay in the cut
In the 'telly somewhere, laying a smut
Champelly, purple hay'ing it up
Front-row, A laying it up
Or in the kitchen, prob'ly weighing it up
Or in a mission, prob'ly spraying shit up
Niggas playing too much
I try to chill, but they be saying too much
But you know they don't say it to me (Uh-huh)
They don't play with me
You shit where you eat, you might as well lay in your pee
[Hook]
Shit, I don't do much
I don't do much
Shit, I don't do much
Y'kna'mean? Fuck
Fuck, I don't do much
I be chilling, man, I don't know about y'all, though
Shit I don't do much

[Verse 2]
I roll a L, go in the booth
Spark it up, start blowing the truth
I don't do much—I smoke weed, pop pills, sip water
(Fuck it) Keep it real, keep steel, give orders
(Suckers) Give out halves, squirrellys, y'all call it "quarters"
Young'un', take this eightball (Chyeah), 'cause you take long
And please, don't make me use this eight-long
'Cause you could get all six up in your acorn
And trust me... Y'all don't want that
Y'all don't want Mack to snap on you cats (Uh-huh)
You don't really want no problems (Yeah)
You don't want me laying under your squatter
You don't want me firebombing your house
You don't want me duct-taping your mouth
Better yet, pouring lye in your mouth
You don't want me smacking up your kids
You don't want me laying up in your trash
Popping up, then I'm popping your ass
You might also like[Hook]
'Cause you won't do shit
I don't do much
Shit, I don't do much
Y'kna'mean? I just be chilling, I be smoking, man, I don't be thinking 'bout y'all niggas, man
I don't do much
Y'kna'mean? I be chilling
Shit, I don't do much

[Verse 3]
I just chill up in the middle of the block
Watch my younguns make a killin on the block
Tell 'em watch trucks who be wheelin through the block
Get shot, get shucked with vans chillin on the block
Shit, I don't do much, I just chill and relax a lot
I don't hustle, I just tax the block
Shit, I don't do much, I just roll out and play with tools
And make you faggots obey the rules
Shit, y'all don't do much but drink forties, look dumb on the block
Damn near forty, still running from cops
Y'all don't do much, y'all niggas ain't stacking no cash
That shit you pack got a crack in yo' ass
Y'all don't give a fuck, y'all gon' get cuffed
And I'ma laugh when y'all get stuck

[Hook]
Shit, I don't do much
Heh, y'kna'mean? (Y'kna'mean?)
I don't do much
I don't give a fuck, man
Smoke weed, get high, fuck bitches, that's my biz, y'kna'mean?
I don't do much
I don't do much
Y'kna'mean, four-pound?
Shit, I don't do much
I don't do much
And I don't give a fuckEmbed
