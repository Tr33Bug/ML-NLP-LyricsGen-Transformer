Look at Me Now LyricsI've done came up

[Verse 1]
My head was knotty then
Nose- snotty then
Sweats, no pockets then
Sweatin'?, no problems then
Fats? off the potty then
News? watched karate then...
Muddas playin' Double Dutch, she was hop-scotchin' then
Me? girl watchin' them
Crooked letter, I (I)
Hump-back, tryna hump that, yes I (I)...
Couldn't play with Cousin Pooh
They thought I was mockin' him
Grams? said I was devilish
Been knew I was rotten then
School? been dropped out
Never really clockin' in
Pops? been dropped out
Neva really stoppin' in...
Moms? tryna lock me out
Cops? tryna lock me in
Damn, devilish one with Pellet-guns
Grew from sling-shottin' them...
To sling-shootin' them dice all day
Kept hook, shot nice all day
Right hook, fight nights all day
Nigga left all night
To keep money right all day
Breaking night,  all day
[Bridge]
If you could look at me now 2X

If you could look at me now
Let me smoke with you young'in

[Verse 2]
Y'all was pop-lockin' then
Card-board boxin then
Me-
I was up the center
3-D lockin' in
Strong-arm robbin then
Started car poppin' in
ME-
Skinny toots, Telly boots, Marley Park and El
Got in junk with Passyunk
Wilson Park and them-
Different jects different sets
Started sparkin him-
I had the four-teen gauge
My nigga Larken then
How it made front page
-He caught a spark from them
He got gauged in his leg
Still was walkin' then
8-toss, shook it off
Kept sparkin' them
All heads ain't help
We had more heart then them
We squashed that war
Got some wall, stayed apart from them
Down in Iraq, they give me dap
I'm takin' pounds from clowns
You shake my hand like a grown man (grown man)
Ya ain't see it like Tony and old man
Mob-style ferreal
This is my life-style f'real

[Verse 3]
...Now its big buisnesses
You see them big Bentley-skids
You see them Bee's on those shiny-ass
Rims of his
You can't find him in the woods
With his kids with his
Mob cookin breakfast with no S.W.A.T
A good day this is
You could bull-shit with rap if you want
I pull the bull-shit to the back
And put rap to the front
Now I'm State-Prop flickin' it
State-Prop stitchin' it
I'm paper soldier y'all
Your boy gettin' rich

I see a kids hair -knotty now..
They nose -snotty now
So what I do
I try to turn they frown around
I make 'em smile a day
If only for a -while a day
I give them dollar-day
That's my ghetto -holliday
I must say for myself
I'm feelin proud today
My life is shaped
Like I run about a mile a day
I dedicate this to the one's that counted me out
And looked at me down
Just look at me now
[Speaking]
I know y'all see me
Look at me now man
I'm killin this shit
Sheed, check your boy out man
Your boy got buisnesses man
I done came up on my own nigga
I'm a ceo nigga
Clothing line... cartoons, movies, name it nigga
Bullshit with rap if you want
...I'm a big-boy-toy driver nigga
With unlaced Air Force 1's with no license
Holla at me nigga
Yall can't tell me shit
Look at me now1Embed
