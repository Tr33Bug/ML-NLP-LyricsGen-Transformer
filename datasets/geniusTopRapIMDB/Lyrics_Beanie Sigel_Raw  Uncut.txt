Raw & Uncut Lyrics[Production by Bink!]

[Intro: Beanie]
What
Spit what man
Man I don't know where that shit be comin from dawg for real
Ain't no fuckin rapper man
16
I don't know Jay
If you don't believe me then
[Verse 1: Beanie]
Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin till he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce 1 ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the Desert Eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll em
Rookie nigga clipping niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it
Catch me in Avis and Budget in something rented
Long as the windows tinted (I don't give a fuck)
I'm in it
I was holding with music rolling in the gold Infinite

[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Jay Z]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and that's how life goes
That's just the life we chose
You might also like[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
We don't complain that's just how it be
I shuffle back against the ropes like Ali
I hustle through the alley, through the Valley of Death
And I never play fair in the eyes of the ref
Fuck it, give me a Tech and I'll come back right
Can't throw us out the game, you ain't got enough strikes
Come at me wrong I'll come at you the same
Come at me sideways, I'll come blasting your brains
Come at me indirect and I'll come back wit names
I'm hot like boiling water, I'll come back wit caine

[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Jay Z]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the bitches and hoes
The first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
I know I'm outta control
Me and Jay same track you gotta be kidding
Its like that nigga Jordan, I'm Scottie Pippen
It's like Magic, Worthy, Parrish, Bird
Stockton-Malone shit, who gonna stop and hold this
Game like Doc and Moses
Full court press and the Roc control this
[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Jay-Z]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
And the first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me

[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel & Jay-Z]
I use to catch that train and snatch that chain (uh-huh)
Do anything for a game to catch some change
Whether it was shooting the dice or clapping the gauge
I was a nigga wit a strong arm like Satchel Paige
I'm telling you dawg I'm the wrong one to fuck wit at all
I'm the type that'll set a broad day in the mall
Whether Glocks or body shots, you taking a fall
Fuck you cops, SWATs, Feds and all
No no no homie I didn't say I could hit you wit 30 0's
What I said is I can supply you with 30 of those
Ding ding homie come holla at the kingpin
The Gods are reapal the Carters is lethal
Hang with psychotic people who like so fucked
Niggas came up singing that God was evil
Slang heroin to cats who like revolving the needle
And I blew to the point I bought cars for the P.O
What!

[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Jay-Z]
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thats how life goes
But nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me
We keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
The first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
But only the strong survive and thas how life goes
Thas just the life we chose

[Outro: Jay-Z]
