Ride 4 My Lyrics[Production by Bink]

Ayo
Feel this shit right here
All my block niggas, gimme a second dogs I got us I swear to God
Feel this shit right here

[Verse 1: Beanie Mac]
Aiyyo, from Boyz II Men to the End of the Road
Yo we boys to the end never bendin the code
You got me, I got you till our souls grow old
He shot you, he shot me, how we supposed to roll
I take a shot for my nigga gimme two to the ribs
Run a spot for my nigga, while you doin your bid
Fuck a step pop your seeds gonna know who you is
I get it through to your wiz that it's due to the kids
For my dog, I swear to God I'll sit in a box
Gimme three hots and a cot before I snitch to the cops
Six foot ditch pine box covered with rocks
Tombstone read hed die for the love of his block
Know what I want in my life I want for my brother
Know what I want for my wife I want for my mother
It ain't a question on what I would do for my squad
Ask yourself if you really true to your squad
[Hookx2]
I'mma ride with my niggas
Die with my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Flip pies with my niggas
Till my body get hard, soul touch the sky
Till my number get called and God shut my eyes

[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]
We gon ride 95 till it ain't no gas
Flip and divide pies till it ain't no cash
And til the computers crash, and the dough on plastic
Everything in our path, go through and smash it
Put our niggas over bitches, niggas over riches
Niggas over drugs for my niggas I get slugs
I know my niggas thugs for my niggas I shed blood
My niggas y'all don't owe me shit, just show me love
I'mma get us out these streets, help our family eat
Move us out the hoods, put us in the Woods
Gimme just a second my flow ain't yet perfected
But damn when it is, shit the winner is
I speak the truth don't take this here as no song
Till I'm gray at the roots and my beard grow long
It's me and you ride or die let's weather the storm
Take on the world playboy whatever it's on

[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]
I took bread with my niggas, spot rushed for funds
Took lead with my niggas, and we bust our guns
I shook feds with my niggas, knew where to duck and run
Ain't care, where and when and who the fuck would come
We knew we'd ride till the day we die, till the day I fry
Told y'all till I touch the sky
We gon roll, gon flip, touch them pies
Know if I got the six you can touch the five
For my true block niggas I'mma spark for them
I get shot a million times lay in chalk for them
Gimme that 5 by 8 where it's dark and grim
I give anything to see my dog walk again
You can trust me with your wife, trust me with your kids
Trust me with your life, trust me where you live
Nobody know but me, you, and God
Your seed, your girl, mom and my word is my bond
