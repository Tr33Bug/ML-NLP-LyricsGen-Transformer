The Empire Strikes Back Lyrics[Intro]
The empire strikes back mother fuckers!
Lenny S
DJ Envy, holla at ya boy!
Bang bang, Sigel street gang
Early
Ayo they coming at my head homes
My blood pressure is building
The headphones is on fire this time around Bleek
About to squeeze the juice out of this nigga
[Verse]
Yo
Fuck the speculation talk over
Nigga dig this, I'm 'bout to Sunkist like the soda
And make Jay to the mwah
Put his lips on his nine and really kiss the game goodbye
You 'bout to really make me hurt you kiss
Spitting candy bars, this nigga sweeter than a Hershey's kiss
Got the heat I'm 'bout to work the fifth
Resin off that purple shit
The reverend got to get a hearse for kiss
You broke
Talkin' 'bout you rocked ya self out
When I see you gon' really wish you knocked ya self out
Want it with Sig'? Need the whole Lox to help out
It's just me, I don't need the Roc to help out
I could tell why Styles say he the ghost of this shit
I could tell in ya style he write most of ya shit
Ya name mwah nigga, most of you bitch
Got me pissed
Can't put ya dick in the dirt
Fucking pussies, I'ma fuck you when I'm lifting ya skirt
We could spit it or gun it out
Four fifth or M1 it out
Tell me nigga how you wanna route
You still living in the basement of ya mothers house
I tried to have a little patience but it's running out
Pop you, leave the blood in ya mouth
Knock ya brains out
Let the doc' remind you what a thug is about
And I'm talking to Jada
And any of ya muhfuckin haters, who like they wanna put down paper
Tell em meet me at any arena
Bring his nina
I'll spark him up, starch him, leave him stiff like the cleaners
Niggas got hidden agendas
We got gats hitting the engines
A pocket in the coupe of the pigeons
Get the S K right for ya chest
Give ya long mwah goodnight, and ain't no life after death
Ayo peep how I handle this nigga
I'll rock your bells like L, I ain't Canibus nigga
Yeah, recess over for you playground niggas
Wouldn't shoot up a ladder, slide down a bar
Fuck ya monkey ass bars when I'm swinging this four
Can't duck when I land shots
Get buried in a sandbox
Sharks in the water can't swim in the pool
No snacks after school, and my stomach is full
Gotta bring it to him hard as shit
I'll kick his ball over the fence to let the nigga know
Who yard is this
What's funny Jason, really think you grimey too
And everybody likes you better in that shiny suite
So no matter where you go, I'ma spot you
Double R tee and a baldie, I'ma pop you
My pump make you lift up
Tech make you do a 360
Got gats that the government's got
Motherfucker is you thuggin' or not?
(Empire strikes back)
Nah fuck it I don't wanna stop
My gun'll pop, his a-fella tell me who you wanna rock
And I could show you how grimey dun
I cup ya ass, strip ya ass, whip ya ass
Till ya mommy come
I got the mask and the techs and the tommy guns
Leave it up to Hov to X out Tommy Buns
We could bet what you owe Puff and double ya debt
Double that, quadruple the threat
Now look what you made me do, brains blew
My team of the marine blue, six coupe
Skeeted out, heated out, weeded out
Haze and hydro
On our way to Y O
And that tenant shit, rented shit
Extended shit
You cheesecake niggas, my dogs get they spinach dipped
In angel dust
Come through and tame ya pups
Think it's a game till ya brains get touched
Yeah nigga lets clash the crews
Attitude like Noah, gats in twos
I got a hundred niggas, hundred  K's
Rain on you for a hundred nights, hundred days
Fuck a million man march
Let a million men spark
Got a million men with heart
Yeah nigga, fuck the peace
Motherfucker can't duck the beast
What made this stupid ass nigga wanna fuck with Sig?
Come on dog, there's another verse
I know that funeral home got a stash, reverend got another hearse
