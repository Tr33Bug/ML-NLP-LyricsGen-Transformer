The Truth Lyrics[Chorus]
I speak the truth
Truth, nothin' but the truth
Y'all know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth, nothing but the truth

[Verse 1]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know, I'm known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down tracks, DAT's, reels and slaves
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats tote Mac's to rap
Y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untamed
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before ya honor he couldn't peep my game
Gotta laugh, don't act like we spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game?
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig'?
[Chorus]
Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga, the truth

[Verse 2]
Ain't nuthin' changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed? That's fine, still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin' and bitchin'
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin'
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin' like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin' coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed, it's on
Motherfucker
You might also like[Chorus]
Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga, the truth

[Verse 3]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin' your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

[Chorus]
Nigga, the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga, the truth2Embed
