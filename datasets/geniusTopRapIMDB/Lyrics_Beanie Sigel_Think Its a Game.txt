Think It’s a Game Lyrics[Intro: Saint Nick]
Yeah
Gangster, gangster
Ooh
Gangster
Ah
Ooh

[Chorus: Saint Nick]
Think it's a game 'til them things come out ('Til them things come out)
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga (When them things come out)
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga
[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
It was a full moon in the beginning of March, 'bout the end of winter '74
The gangster was born
Introduced to sinnin' and spinnin' women, cats with big hats slammin' Cadillac doors
Who choosin' hoes, you losin' your hoes, you niggas loose with your hoes
Motherfucker, y'all ain't used to no hoes
Niggas wanna LoJack, track your bitches, shack your bitches
I pimps up, smack my bitches
You wanna fuck-trick your bitches
I duck-flip my bitches
Get that cash with that extra ass bitch
Plus I keep a gat at arm reach
You ain't no hustler, you's a car thief
Nigga, where your car keys?
Crack topic, back block it
Thirty-one long, blacktop it
You can't stop it, gat top it
Black MAC, black Glock it, blast rocket
Sit your faggot ass on your back pocket (Bitch)
It's not a game, prick

[Chorus: Saint Nick & Jay-Z]
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga (Straight gangster nigga)
Think it's a game 'til them things come out (Uh, uh, uh)
I bang out 'til your brains hang out (Straight gangster nigga)
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga (Yeah)

They call me Hov' the hustler, dough doubler
Drove customers crazy in the late '80s, early '90s
Now you can find me, girlie behind me, holdin' my mink up
Ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin' my drink up
Top down, 'dro in the air, blowin' that stink up
It's seldom that I smoke, but it helps my thinker
Makes me a mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass, I'm a statistician, rap with precision
Nigga, your ho chose Hov', that's rapid division
Now divide yourself and slide
I, young Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers
Took it where few went, made a few cents
Don't call me Hov' no more, call me The Blueprint
Sold dope (And), sold crack (And)
Sold soap (And), sold rap (And)
Bought Bentley's, bought 'em back
Nigga, can you buy that?

[Chorus: Saint Nick]
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga
[Verse 3: Freeway]
Purpose of man, worship Allah, then you die
Purpose of my gun, run in your shop and take pies
Purpose of my son, raise him to do the same
Clip, blazin' it through your brains
Strip, use it 'til it's burned out
Benz Coupes, Jags, and trucks when we roll out
Man, it ain't no lie
It's real as this four-five
And real as these five salaats
Whether we Dīn or not
Our kids gotta eat, red Beamer stops
Where your connects gotta meet, interrupt your cop
Dependin' on the dope size, we slide up from both sides
With hammers with hollows, you peel, we follow with both rides, and
They killed your cousin, you strapped and you won't ride, and
Don't think 'cause I rap that I won't ride, man
Play O-Dog in Menace and drive-by men
Real gangsters keep a bitch in the wheel, workin' the gas tank
Hoes on the strip, bringin' that cash in

[Chorus: Saint Nick]
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga

[Verse 4: Young Chris]
It's C the young gunner
They call me the boy wonder
Without that caped crusader
That cake is major, uh
Nickel plate, stay with it (Uh-huh), except for in school
Metal detectors in school
But every last nickel get moved
Fucked every bad little bitch in the school
Good with math, but I skipped it in school
Ain't go to shop, but I'm sick with them tools
Shit, that's why I'm kicked out of school
Bucked J's by the locker, come and holler, uh
Out on my own, movin' out with that chrome
And can't nobody take me out of that zone, not even AI
It ain't even a business, it's just the way I
Get it consistently, flip it until the day I'm gone
Scream beef any day and it's on
The same Chris dangerous with an eight in my palm
And been paid since the day I was born
But these lames think it's a game 'til them things is drawn, uh

[Chorus: Saint Nick]
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga
Think it's a game 'til them things come out
I bang out 'til your brains hang out
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga2Embed
