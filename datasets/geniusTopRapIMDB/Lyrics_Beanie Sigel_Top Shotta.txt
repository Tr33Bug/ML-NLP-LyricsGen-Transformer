Top Shotta Lyrics[Intro]


[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]

$200 Fanta in a styrofoam
30-shot banana in my firearm
Death to any nigga that I slide up on
Supply ya mama with the casket she put flowers on
The Don Dada, the rude boy, the top shotta
Ya ras clot, ya batty boy, go suck ya fadda
I’m bad boy, I warn boy, like Big Poppa
I squeeze choppa, release copper, ya bleed proper
Yeah, empty out the clip 'till the Baretta lock
Circle the block, scope, see if he dead or not
7-shot .38, the lead’ll pop
Squat, squeeze with one eye open like Fetty Wap
And I don’t really wanna expose you, I’m tryna be humble
But deers belong in the woods and not in the jungle
And you ain’t never in the hood, scared them nigga’s will trunk you
Got niggas in your circle now that’s waiting to slump you
[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]

Right back on that ass, I ain’t finish nigga
I will drag your ass ‘till you surrender nigga
You sweet nigga, you fake nigga, you Splenda nigga
Pussy you ain’t tough nigga, you tender nigga
I injure niggas, beginner niggas, I been the nigga
Bitch I kill your vibe, shout out to Kendrick, nigga
I watched the LOX and I listened nigga
Could’ve been the fourth member, but I went with Jigga
Send your niggas, I’m with whatever, let’s get it nigga
I slide down your chimney like it’s December nigga
Pop off on sight, shoot up your Sprinter nigga
And you ain’t 'bout that life, so stop pretending nigga
And I can give two shits if I’m offending niggas
Bitch if that shoe fits, that’s who it’s meant for nigga
I put the city on the map, facts
Who the fuck wanna claim king now? Bully back
