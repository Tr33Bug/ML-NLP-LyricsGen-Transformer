Watch Your Bitches LyricsAs far back as I can remember I always wanted to be was a gangster...
(Watch your bitches!)

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack
Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat
Gators and flavors, colors like now & laters
Split champagne wishes to bitches, trips to Vegas
Jot down numbers on small pieces of paper
I got ya, skate, watch these bitches catch the vapors
Breaks down doe over a hoe?
Spend my chips over a trick?
I don't rock no masquino shit
I don't know know labeled me no trick
Biatch! You should pay me for dick
All I'm gone do is fuck you crazy
Bust a couple nuts, get lazy
Bust another nut, it's Swayze
Tell your ass don't page me, see you when I see you
You need doe for what? Wouldn't wanna be you
Yeah I'm a break you off, after I stroke you off
When I break you off, biatch! That's when I broke you off
Tell your ass get lost
Only thing I'm gonna pay for, is to be the boss
Can't see me giving no skee's my cheese
Tell 'em like they tell Bean's, I got four seeds to feed
Till I fuck you and some change fall out of your ass (watch your bitches!)
Biatch! Ain't nothing changed, I'm all about the cash
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hey yo I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack
Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat
Gators and flavors, colors like now & laters (watch your bitches!)
Leave you jelly like fishes
Niggas watch your bitches

[Verse 2]
You know Mack pop fly bitch
No Jonny Gill 'round my bitch
Bye Bye bitch
Fuck that red dress on, get a head step on
Speed on 'for you get peed on
When I piss, I don't miss (Shit)
Get mad, scratch your ass, and get glad
'For I, scratch your ass and get Glad-bags
Throw your shit out on the trash
B-Mack, pimp-slash
Hustla, muthafucka!
But, back to the sript
When I'm twisted off that sip
You know my twist, Mack on that lick
On that super hero juice but could handle my cake
Quick to throw bags, zams, and cakes
Cocktails come banana and grape
Yellow and purple, everything mellow in your circle
Feeling like metal can't hurt you
Got that pro meth 'itch  (Watch your bitches!)
Keep a hoe in check quick off that pro meth shit
You might also like[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hey yo I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack
Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat
Gators and flavors, colors like now & laters (watch your bitches!)
Leave you jelly like fishes
Niggas watch your bitches

[Verse 3]
I don't gotta play games and chase a hoe
Spend cheese, say please, and lace a hoe
Man, all my bitches know to SUCK me off and hit the door
Especially if I hit before, They know the rutine
Dick to jaw, I don't give a bitch shit but game
And spit that like Rudy Raymoore
Man my whole squad play on tours
That's all we do is play on whores
That's up to you if you pay for yours
I might let 'em run around in the apartment
Just don't steal shit or spill shit on the carpet
You know the address, apartment 3F
Find you, fuck you, and flee, and my man Bleek next

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hey yo I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack
Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat
Gators and flavors, colors like now & laters (watch your bitches!)
Leave you jelly like fishes
Niggas watch your bitches1Embed
