(Tell me what your life like)
[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna know if Beanie Sigel life is real
Nigga twenty-five ta life is real
I get a body, take me right ta jail
I know what it's like in hell
I did a stretch in a triflin' cell
What you know about twenty-three and one
Locked down all day, underground, neva seein' the sun
Visits stripped from you, neva seein' your son
You got bricks on the strip, neva see 'em get done
What you know about all day
Them Little Debbies and them Chi Chi's, they makin' you sick
You gotta wash out your drawers same water you shit
Brush, gargle, and spit same water you piss
You down wit this nigga, you done killed his brotha
But dog, don't think he don't know it
Think he a sucker cuz he don't show it
Paybacks a muthafucka, and he won't blow it
What you know about them 4 letters, not the kind you write
Or the kind you sit down and type
Sign at the margin, get it right
I'm talkin' 'bout that real time
Life like Eddie or Martin
Ta my niggas, that's up the fort
When I get there fuck a pack, hand me a log
And a push rod toilet sword
So when I hit these niggas up they can't call the guards
You might also like[Hook]
Tell me what your life like
Shit, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Nigga, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Shit, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Nigga, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed

[Verse 2]
What you know about solitary
Locked down, no commissary
And you wild or ready
And you just seen your mom get buried
You got drowns, comin' in all kinds of flurries
What you know about your towel on your cell when you alone at night
Or a jailhouse hunger srike
Or you sittin' in your cell and just zone one night
And you think "damn, I'm neva comin' home one night"
You got 5 years in, neva been flown a kite
You hearin' grown men moan at night
They got you stuck in the can
White man got you fuckin' your hand
Your wife on land fuckin' your man
What you know about no parole
Life in the hole
Lifes cold, you be eatin' them swags
Guards on the nightshift they be beatin' you bad
The hardest nigga turned bitch, be sleepin' wit fags
What you know about gettin' and shippin' balloons
Keep switchin' positions in the visitin' room
Gotta take Ex-Lax, hope you did it in time
Gotta shit in your palm just ta get the heroin
And you talkin' 'bout your life is this, your life is that
Your life ain't shit, your life is whack
Man you listenin' ta the realest nigga
Close your eyes, muthafuckas tell me you don't feel this nigga
The illest nigga
[Hook]
Tell me what your life like
Shit, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Nigga, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Shit, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Nigga, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed

[Outro]
Tell me what your life like
Mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Nigga, what your life like
Mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like
Nigga, mines is real
Everything signed is sealed
Tell me what your life like (What your life like)
Mines is real (What your life like)
Mines is real (What your life like)3Embed
