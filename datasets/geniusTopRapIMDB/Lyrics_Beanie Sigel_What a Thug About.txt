What a Thug About Lyrics[Production by Buckwild]

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, Beanie Mac, rap guerrilla
I'm out for the skrilla
Face it, ain't no replacement for this killa
Keep your hands where I can see 'em
Don't make me nervous
This 4-4 auto mag, you don't deserve that shit
Kids either, don't make me make you a believer
I don't do a lot of talkin', I speak with the heater
I'll run up in your crib, put some in your wig
Your baby cryin': pop, pop, pop, put some in the crib
And I want everything, not just some of the shit
Got niggas comin' home at night, like you son of a bitch
Nigga done took me off, yeah, you shook and soft
You can't blink 'round no crook
One look you lost
Niggas'll find your bitch to find your bricks
See if you love your chick or you love your chips
4-4 snub shit, send slugs to the whip
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, I love this thug shit
[Hook]
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
A true thugs spreads his game, linked up and bubble
While niggas stay in one lane, like the Lincoln Tunnel
I refuse to limit my game to one hustle
I don't only sling crack, or let the cards shuffle
I know how to play cee-lo, set it off like Cleo
Ain't no tellin', First Union or Mellon
The first nigga that move, put two up in his melon
From the 9-two-m Beretta Parabellum
Man, I run through cats, I'm a 2 gun cat
One nickel, one black, who want that?
I done schooled my youngins
Gave tools to my youngins
Broke fool with my youngins
Broke rules with my youngins
Walk my way out of shit and had bad run in's
Talked my way out of shit in near death comings
Real thugs do what they want, say what they feel
They never front, they keep it real

Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Niggas claim to be thugs, be real fuckin' suckas
Quick ass runnin', good fuckin' duckas (Yeah)
Obey the rules when my Glock unloads
'Cause when I start firin', stop, drop, and roll
Duck behind cars, hide behind poles
Know I live by the code "anything goes"
Real thugs stand up straight, they never fold
And they don't know shit if anything ever blows
Thugs don't wanna talk shit out, they wanna spark shit out
Until the cops come and chalk shit out
Blaze with the toaster, extra clip in the leg holster
Face off like Cage and Travolta (Yeah)
If you got beef, a thug gon' roast ya
Talk behind your back, a thug gon' approach ya
Ride on mama's stacks, a thug gon' ghost ya
Lay you out flat, like a thug suppose to
[Hook]
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about
Yo, what you really know what a thug about?
Locked up in the bing, no grub about
On the block, do ya thing, slangin' drugs about
Tell me, what you really know what a thug about3Embed
