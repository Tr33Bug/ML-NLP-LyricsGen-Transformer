When You Hear That Lyrics[Chorus: Beanie Sigel]
When you hear that
That's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, uh
Don't get handcuffed by the beast
When you hear that
That means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a rhyme about the nine and what the TEC do
The four-pound Llama, thirty-eight special
With AK shells through your Teflon vest too
Yeah Scrap, when the Bastard's back out
The pastor's back out, the casket's passed out
The shit bags and the catheters passed out
Shoot up the crack house, smack workers pour all they
Cracks out, go to war, Mack never backed out
The MACs get backed out, the ARs get dust off
The Ks get bust off, the shaft and the stock get
Cut off, your cash and your block get cut off
And the SWAT and the ambulance rush off
My hand on my nuts like fuck ya'll, my SP
Jeans drip, layin' on them S Dot green shits
Count the bucket like And 1, just run when the van come
[Chorus: Beanie Sigel & Ol' Dirty Bastard]
When you hear that
That's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, man, you better throw that piece
Toss the handgun, before the man come
When you hear that
That means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga
Toss the handgun, before the man come

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu..
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a
Nigga who put restraints on a nigga
Wu bandana, I smoke Diana
Fuck Joanna, she hot Louisiana
The Ol' is famous for ignoramous
I gets mine, not being boisterous
Americana, half Montana
Only gonna smoke the best marijuana
Diss the Grammys, on the panel
Change the channel, good smell flannel
You think shit is dandy, her pussy is candy
Forty-four Glock, keep it handy
I fucked Amanda, you talk propaganda
Only gettin' money, on the Miranda
I stay candid, government branded
Heavy handed, woman demanding
You might also like[Chorus: Beanie Sigel & Ol' Dirty Bastard]
When you hear that
That's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, man, you better throw that piece
Toss the handgun, before the man come
When you hear that
That means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga
Toss the handgun, before the man come

[Verse 3: Peedi Crakk]
It's not game of R. Kelly
Run up on twenty-six and seven, coke peli'
Open up and them in deli, spray whoever the sweaty
My felony, mix emotions when I walk in that building
That's why I sip that purple potion that make choke up your seven
It's Peed Crakk don't act as if you don't notice
Make me call that boy Mack, Bean Sig' flip you over
Respect mine, them TEC-9s ain't my thing
I defeat the purpose of Teflon with one ring
Make the place, vacate, I can't wait
For you to come out your face, so I could come off the waist
Hey, it's Peedi, Peedi, when you see me, take it easy
My uncle be named Reesy, his luger be named Squeezy
Make you get low without M-Eazy
My murder just might please you, you know them niggas my people's
And every time you see me do my thing
They tell me, Peedi, Peedi, crush easy, the Mac gon' ring
[Chorus: Beanie Sigel & Olâ€™ Dirty Bastard]
When you hear that
That's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, man, you better throw that piece
Toss the handgun, before the man come
When you hear that
That means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga
Toss the handgun, before the man come

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
When you hear that!
