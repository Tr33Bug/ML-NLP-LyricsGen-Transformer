Ain’t No Half-Steppin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics 'cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Rappers steppin' to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me — yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs; dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you tried to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk, 'cause ...
[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
"Down the road"

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon, I'll have to open
A school of emceein', for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MC's comin' out soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh, yes, I guess, suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stoppin' the groove until when it's
The climax and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin' ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, makin' it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, aw shit!
I stop and stand strong over MC's
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleepin' on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that

Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
"Down the road"

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin' to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Pfft, picture that

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Mister Cee, step to me
[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MC's evaporate
The party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceedin' to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messin' around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take your title
Namely me because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes, I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign
