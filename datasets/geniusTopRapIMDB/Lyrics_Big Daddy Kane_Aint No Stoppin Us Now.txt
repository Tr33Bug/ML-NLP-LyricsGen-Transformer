Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now Lyrics[Produced by Prince Paul]

[Verse 1]
Here we go, here we go on the smooth side
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
With the source, and of course
I don't wanna be the king or boss, I just wanna get my point across
'Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
To the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
And stop livin' for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
All chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
And I ain't goin' out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin' like a champ
Step out my face, talkin' 'bout a food stamp
Child please, put it at ease
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these
We can't take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the Kane and go for yours, because
[Verse 2]
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear
We gotta step up front, to get our share
Make the change, cause we're not inferior
For example, there was a black Ms. America
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
That if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemima
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
To stay alive, that's the reason I've
Came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin' no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because

[Interlude]
Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go
One more thing

[Verse 3]
Let's unite together, we can't sever never
No matter what or whatever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I see equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
The true way of livin' that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!

Ah keep it goin y'all
A Prince Paul, rulin' em all y'all
A Prince Paul, schoolin' em all y'all
And Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony
And Tony Tone never leavin' the girls alone
Tony Tone never leavin' the girls alone
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stopEmbed
