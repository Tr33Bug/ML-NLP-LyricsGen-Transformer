Cameo Afro Lyrics[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Battle cry Samurai, I'm what they call terror
Erasing all errors, give work to pall bearers
I'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massive organs
Fear factor, hereafter, disaster
Climb like the Stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of
The raw aggression, that'll take your best on
You start talking Teflon, then you switch to Revlon
Nigga, choose your weapon, hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit when you ain't got ya S on?
Get ahead of who? Never you, skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you but residue, the state of vegetable
The mad swag and do flaunt it, my dick and you want it
Only question now, is "nigga, who want it?"
Cause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead
Boy don't make me have to pull out this double edge
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho-
Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step
Do I come off? Yep
[GZA]
My sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace
Behind punctured steel, their bodies rot
Arm and leg missing, head laying near the chopping block
An experience, that shattered your spine, break spirits
Same shit that fucks with your mind, you hate to hear it, nigga
Def man world is silent, he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choked with bodies, float it like rafts
Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats
Streets filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at
Conflict is imminent, preliminary attack
Everyone's a target, so cemeteries are packed
A solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupefying drug, pass ya cup

[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
Why you trying to test me swordplay when I'm sharp in every way?
This life I live—I'll do it all by myself
