Children R the Future LyricsOn and on and on and on
Me say the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Nor does the growth of our young world
Yes the children, be buildin, each boy and girl
Cause you are the cream of the planet earth
The new birth, now take that for what it's worth
And give the child room, to blossom and bloom
Livin large, it's your destiny to consume
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
Cause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!)
To start reachin, come on each and every
Single one of y'all comprehend what I'm teachin
I said listen up, listen up, listen up youngster
Learn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya
It's nothin but knowledge, I shall bring to you
And I'm not Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo, but I know
"children, children" - "are the future" (variations 4X)

"children, children" Where we goin now?
Take my hand my child, and let me show you how
Cause I'm here to help..
.. those who need Knowledge of Self
Young brothers and sisters, considered the cream
That must rise to the top and fulfill the dream
And there are desires that we all want to achieve
But remember, respect is most greatest to receive
And we don't have to gain it by bein TOUGH
Or sellin our own kind that cooked white stuff
So bring your negative mind from out of the shade
Find your true self and let's all get paid, because

"children, children" - "are the future" (variations 4X)

People, people, why we live illegal?
Your life just ends short and you know that there's no sequel
(sequel) They'll say that it was fun while it lasted
You run wild, stickin up and gettin blasted
Pregnant girls livin solo, on the welfare
Cause your so-called man said go to hell dere
And young brothers that could be tryin to rap
Instead, are out boostin clothes at the Gap
Now what kind of life is that for a child?
Runnin wild livin foul, hey, change your lifestyle
Get some knowledge, and open your eyes
Just take a little bit of time
How fully you'll come to realize, that
You might also like"children, children" - "are the future" (variations 4X)

[Kane * singing *]
I believe the children are the future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all of the beauty they posess inside
Give them, a sense of pride
To make it easier, let the children laughter
Remind us how we used to beEmbed
