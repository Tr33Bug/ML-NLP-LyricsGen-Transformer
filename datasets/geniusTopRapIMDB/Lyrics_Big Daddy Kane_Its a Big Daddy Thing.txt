Itâ€™s a Big Daddy Thing Lyrics[Intro]
Dr. Harrah, is Mr. Kane loose in this hospital?
In the morgue I think, doctor
I specifically told Dr. Riley to suspend him
Aw, yeah
We gon' pump this up one time
As we set it off a little like this, kick it
Pump it up now (It's a Big Daddy thing)
As we send this out to New York City
Can't forget the posse down in Philly
Also in Detroit (It's a Big Daddy thing)
Chicago, Atlanta, GA
Sendin' this out to Miami (It's a Big Daddy thing)
Tampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina
LA and Oakland (It's a Big Daddy thing)
And the rest of the world as we go a little somethin' like this (It's a Big Daddy thing)
[Verse 1]
Let it rain, let it rain, be put it pain
With nothin' to gain under the wrath of Kane
'Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or path or road, until the next episode
Let the B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
Or be funky like a underarm
And allow me to show how the microphone
Should flow, now, competition bow
To me like a Buddha, the teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin' or crabbin'
So save it, 'cause that's one thing I ain't havin'
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to, um
Get loose, now put a boost and use to chill
The comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice

[Chorus]
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
'Cause you're useless, makin' up excuses, excuses
So never touch, tap, tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
'Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'ma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin' wild just ain't my style
'Cause only the live will be movin' the crowd, but see
Quiet as kept, not like a star to you
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the dead zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin' to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child, you shouldn't even bother
To press up and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya, plus scoop your female
Just like a gigolo, but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin' the trigger slow
And smooth to the groove with lyrics that'll soothe
And improve with every move, that's why you've
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football and let's go the nine
Shorts, I take none, 'cause I ain't the one
In '89 there's damage being done
And for you to diss me will be very risky
'Cause I make this be as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose and fall
So y'all can see how me, the Kane, will just reign
Superior, 'cause I ain't even hearin' ya
Save the yang 'cause it's a Big Daddy thang
[Chorus]
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing

[Outro]
And this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph
Can't forget Big Sha, Big Therm
And also I got to say what's up to my man Horace
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Mack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin'?
Can't forget my man Ant Live
And of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing
It's a Big Daddy thing2Embed
