Long Live the Kane Lyrics[Verse 1]
Party people in the place
Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, I'm greeeat!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean, me being wack, oh come come now
That's quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, it's on your face, and it's conspicuous
Not that you're on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, that's the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ain't no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, that's ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, nah don't even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you can't fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man that's here to live long
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that I'm the Kane, you said "oh yeah"
"That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh he's def," you know what time it is
But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MC's don't understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ain't no joke
I take time and care in whatever I'm doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what you're hearing as I entertain
So hip-hip hooray, long live the Kane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now here's my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say I'm not, don't even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time I'm through
And that's coming from a Black man's point of view

[Verse 4]
Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MC's, it's a must that I diss you
The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
Now I'ma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
So if we ever battle you're bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No I'm not Chinese, it's just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
You're rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I can't taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I won't stop there, I still rock a little harder
While the toy MC's step and say, sayonara

Long Live the Kane (x2)
