Mister Ceeâ€™s Master Plan Lyrics[Who is the man with the master plan? (x2)
DJ Mister Cee
Who is the man with the master plan?
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
Then it goes a little something like this...]

Yes, here we go, on with the show
As the rhythm of this starts to flow
No matter the tempo, fast or slow
Get up and dance cause the Kane said so
This is the dance floor groove of the album
Presented to you all live from Calvin
Whoops! I meant to say Mister Cee
The disc jockey down with me, the
Microphone lord, my wisdom is a sword
Try to get with us, and get floored
Some DJ's try to front, but yo don't let them fool you
Cause wine is fine, but Calvin is cooler
Jump up and down, and eh, and all around and
Check out the way that my DJ is sounding
On the turntables to keep the crowd stable
Killing the cuts putting bodies on a record label
And just for the symphony
Here comes the M.I.S.T.E.R.C.E.E
Taking a stand like a band
Mister Cee got a master plan
Hit it!
[Who is the man with the master plan?
DJ Mister Cee...on the mix] (x4)

[Kane speaking as Cee cuts it up:
Whooo! yeah, warm it up, Cee...uh!
C'mon now, make it happen, make it happen
Go hit me one more time, c'mon Cee warm it up
Yeaaahh... that sounds funky!
I, I mean like extra crazy stooopid def!
Hit some of them transformers hops
Again, again, again
Uh! Uh! Uh!
Now, yo, tell yourself a song]

[Getting ready to, (various samples), oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (x12)
(Samples, in order): play it, let go, feel it, come out, clap to this
Move your body, get fresh, go go go, I'll do it, do it again, hit me
Hnn--drop!]

[Big Daddy Kane in the house!
Big Daddy (x2) Biz: huh, huh! (x2)
My man, my mellow]
