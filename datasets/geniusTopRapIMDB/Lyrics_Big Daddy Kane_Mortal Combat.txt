Mortal Combat Lyrics[Verse 1]
The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick, so guard it with Chapstick
In other words, protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get ya head flown
Fists of fury, suckers get buried
'Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothin' could save ya from catchin' the vapors
Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
And I'm rubbin' 'em in just like Vicks salve
Captivatin', dominatin', innovatin', illustratin', fascinatin'
Motivatin', elevatin', terminatin', mutilatin'
Rhymes they're worth their weight in
Gold, bold, never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage, don't tell me what another do
'Cause I quote that I'm R-A-W
So make room, 'cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume, and make your own tomb
A grave or a casket, a tisket, a tasket
You're rhymes out of basket
Boy, you get your ass kicked!
For frontin' like you hittin' hard
When your arms are too short to box with God
So don't even touch 'cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle, he must be senile
And that's why meanwhile, back at the ranch...
The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin' with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up, sucker, this is mortal combat!
[Hook: x4]
"Make you say, daddy, I don't want none..." - Kool Moe Dee

[Verse 2]
I seize and freeze MC's with these degrees
Put me to my knees, or at ease? Chiiiillld, please
I break it down, to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit, they need Ex-Lax
So stop griffin', your mind is driftin'
Prepare yourself 'cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you can't understand
At times, I gotta say to myself, "God damn!"
As I get hot, and still be gettin' warmer
And I don't have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself, never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss, I crush the motherfucker!
Frontin' MC's that be tryin' to riff
Need to save it, and don't even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin'
I step to you and say, "Now, what's up then?"
Every word'll be just like surgery
Cuttin' you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and bend low
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
J-O-K-E-S ain't my style
I ain't a child, that's why I don't smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine, the other rappers need resign
As I go on, from night to morn'
Beginning to end, from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin' for static
Looks like a job for King-Asiatic
N-E, send me competitors
Then again, it might just be better to
Just slow down, you don't wanna throw-down
I get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition, prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat

[Verse 3]
I roll so bold with soul, control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin' black gold
So let it be said, let it be read 'cause I lead ahead
Of others whose rhymes are old as Pro-Keds
Tryin' to diss the Big Daddy repertoire? Moi?!
You steady screamin' out a antique segment wrote
As I just play 'em like a pregnant roach and STOMP 'EM
For tryin' the forbidden
Your rhymes ain't hittin', boy, you won't be gettin'
None of, or in front of, 'cause every one of
My adversaries lack, you little son of
O-bit-uary columns will read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin' or aimin' to be champion
Against me? Psssh, can't be won
I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique, but redeem
'Cause there's only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise man'll reach ya
I teach freedom, justice and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves, from mental death in power
That's the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam
