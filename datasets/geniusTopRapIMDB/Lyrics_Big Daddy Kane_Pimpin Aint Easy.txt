Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy Lyrics[Produced by Big Daddy Kane]

[Hook]
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
[Verse 1: Greg Nice]
One-two-three-four, to five-six-seven
Eight, nine-ten, then ya got eleven
Twelve, thirteen, start your age
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, the pubic stage
Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum
Let me get off the virgin before I cum
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some
Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum
I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a
'Specially when the hoochie's on birth control-a
Lift her up just like a pick-up truck
Then I sat her down and we started to fuck
Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, yo
I hope this time I don't make a cookie
Brothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie
Two from the Greg Nice from the old school
But bullshit, I ain't no fool, 'cause

[Hook]
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)

Well, I say... Extra! Extra!
Here is a bachelor comin' straight at ya
I see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it
The Big Daddy law is anti-faggot
That means no homosexuality
What's in my pants'll make you see reality
And if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova
Bend over!
Cuz I don't half-step when it comes to broads
The K-A-N-E'll go the whole nine yards
There's no time for coversation my dear
(Ohh!) Is all I wanna hear
So let's make a move, as I get smooth
Cuz the purpose I serve is to soothe
I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk
Even white girls be sayin' "Ooh, Kane's a hunk!"
Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi
Some try to copy, but they look sloppy
So imitators that wanna step to a
Brother like me, lick my manure

[Hook]
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
[Verse 3:Smooth B]
I'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo
And when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Ho
But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E
And if you girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee
I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree
That when it comes to pimpin' hoes, it ain't easy
First name, Smooth, last name, B
When I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly
I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg
And when I take off my clothes, then I form a third leg
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating, my mind is in paradise

[Hook]
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)

[Verse 4: Scoob Lover]
Tip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein'
Braggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin'
Buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'
Right in front of me, hmm, not even knowin'
A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty
Nametag earrings readin' off "Tootie"
Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh, "Come a little bit closer"
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said "Hi
Hi, hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?"
I said, "Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate"
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
Went for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it
I wanted to tax that ass like the government

[Hook]
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, because
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, because
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)

[Outro: Ant Live]
Well, it's Friday night, ain't a damn thing funny --
Bitch better have my money2Embed
