Set it Off Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold back
Or fold 'cause I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck?
Rock the discotheque and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift, MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant 'em
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an Afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no problem
I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter, I'mma still come off
'Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course, that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what's said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
'Cause I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, you're no frill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up
Don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up
[Chorus x3]
"I can't hold it back"
Set it off

Now break loose

[Verse 2]
Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew, so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic, and rhymes start flowin' automatically from me
So don't play me, obey me
When asked "Who's the best?", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some... set if off!
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat, they're feedin' me dope
'Cause I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says "Peace"
So, maestro, yo, hit it!
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it, 'cause...
