Taste of Chocolate Intro Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah..
You know, 1990 begins a new decade
Since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
It's been a three, four year stretch
And I'd just like to thank all of you
Mmm..
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States, overseas in the U.K
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
[Verse 1]
Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease, never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
'Cause I'm so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
I'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G
D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place
Doin' the job how you want it done
With lyrics that's bright as the mornin' sun
So, grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
And everythin' else'll combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh, also for every girly
To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now, wait, now, wait, now, wait a minute
Uhh! Now, check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one, but all of the above
Comin' together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man, oh man
What joy do we find?
Hard for me to say it sometimes
You might also like[Verse 2]
Nothin' can stop this flow so back up off me
Hold your cup of Folgers, wake up and smell the coffee
Big Daddy Kane’s the name of the one and only
You wanna say it three times like Tony! Toni! Toné!
It’s not an avocation of being the best
But I at least deserve a cape or an S on my chest
Quote: “The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice”
Mmm, they shoulda never turned me loose
'Cause I’m a true livin' Casanova
Smooth and stylistic and suave bowler
And they say nasty couldn’t even tell it
'Cause when I’m with girls, I get Funkadelic
So, ladies stand still as I start to fulfill
Just chill, the scenery’s about to get ill
The places I feel to give your body a thrill
As I rub you the right way like Johnny Gill
And competition take notes from a champ
You once had this but all your girls broke camp
And now you wanna diss
You swung but you missed
So, now, tip your hat and bow down to this
Who? The father of civilization
With knowledge of self under any situation
The F to the I to the V to the E
The P-E-R-C-E-N-T
That means an Asiatic king just rocked it
And left your mouth wet with a taste of chocolate
That’s right, y'all, and that’s right, y'all
My rhymes freshen the air like Lysol
Girls, uh, right there, yeah, right there
