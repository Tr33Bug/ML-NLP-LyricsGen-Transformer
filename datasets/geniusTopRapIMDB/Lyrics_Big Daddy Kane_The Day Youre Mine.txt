The Day Youâ€™re Mine Lyrics[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
Well, one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see, but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine
[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
'Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed

[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
Baby, I'm waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
(You've got me waiting for you day by day)
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it, so please don't spoil it
Yeah, it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it
Ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance, I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you
You might also like[Chorus: Big Daddy Kane]
You've got me waiting for you day by day (I'm waiting, everyday)
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away (Dreams, drifting)
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find (I know, oh so very hard to find)
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine (Mine, mine)

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
A dramatic, fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion, so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe, you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
'Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserves the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh, so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
'Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine5Embed
