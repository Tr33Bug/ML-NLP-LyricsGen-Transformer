The Lover in You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take it from the man that does it real smooth
All that, "Yo baby yo baby," it's.. it's-it's-it's not the move
You gotta treat em with respect, never neglect
Try to protect, most of all, project some intellect
Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her
So be a gentlemen, and be in her corner
Make her feel like the most
For example -- forget Goodfellas, and take her to see Ghost
Wine and dine under candlelight
Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright
Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back
Tssssh, yeah they like that
Satisfaction guaranteed
We gotta give the woman what she need
These days, they don't be fallin for no phony Casanova
Since they started watchin Oprah
So even if it's not your style
Open the door for them once in a while
Even buyin them some flowers don't hurt
Yeah it sounds old fashioned.. but it works!
Conversation, good communication
Only makes things better in a relation
Cause if you keep watchin the game every week
You might find out your wife's gettin dunked by Dominique
And that can be so upsettin
So try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding
Put the gangster approach on pause
And I dedicate this to you and yours
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)

[Verse 2]
Now, what I'm gonna do to keep the flame warm
Is sing a better love song than Jeffrey Osborne
Serenade a double, what I mean is a couple
That might wanna hug and snuggle and then kiss and say I love you
Cause I think it's best to get a little affectionate
Matter of fact fellas, I would suggest you give
Your woman the treatment of a queen and supply her
With some of that Babyface routine, know what I mean?
T-E-N-D-E-R L-O-V-I-N-G C-A-R-E
You figure that out, and keep it in mind
While I bring the chorus back for ya one more time

This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)

(One two three!)

[Verse 3]
I wanna do somethin' freaky to you
Take you to a level that you never been to
Cause no one knows where the nose goes
When the doors close, so take off your pantyhose
I wanna see you moan and groan as I nibble
On your bodily parts as I proceed to jump your bones
And put your feet up here my dear
So I can lick upon your toes until your Revlon disappear
The passion between will be so incredible
As I prove that a woman is edible
So if you're game for havin a ball
Ladies, I send this out to y'all
