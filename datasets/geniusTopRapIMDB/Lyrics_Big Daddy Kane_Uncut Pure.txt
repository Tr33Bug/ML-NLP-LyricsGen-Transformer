Uncut, Pure Lyrics[Verse 1]
See the crowd in an uproar actin' unstable
Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
The mic ripper, cash flipper, Cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere, that's French for ass whipper
Long time puttin' work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best, then I'm a damn strikin' resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attackin' this enrage to disengage the missin' page
To the newest in age that's hittin' stage
(Now why that be?) For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me, how much can you take from me, the man that make
Rhymes that be so butter, my breath smell like Land O'Lakes?
You know the lick, see me hit 'em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God? I hope you mean the SAT
Because your poetasterous style, it plain, bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story (come on!)
[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky-

[Verse 2]
Ah, man, fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if you
Was invisible, it'll make your life miserable
Hip-Hop icon, keep a grip just like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy, you got to get that player hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You soon to find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise, disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhymin'
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen done need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kickin' through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn, I know how Jehovah's Witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Because I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
I turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look, I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
'Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cuttin' through, split his gut in two
I touch 'em, what him do? You know the style ain't nothin' new
(Let's go!)
You might also like[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live

[Verse 3]
A good game it lets the plot thicken
But the thing that just ain't clickin' is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride when you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' 'em, black
Closest thing to me would be (what's that?) Nothing in fact
I come with more in skill to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach 'em all with some bad intentions
In other words, I'm makin' 'em resign
Diminish mine, runnin' through 'em like a finish line
[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it liveEmbed
