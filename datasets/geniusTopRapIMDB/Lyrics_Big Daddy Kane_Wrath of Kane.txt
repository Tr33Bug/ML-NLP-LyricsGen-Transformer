[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
The wrath of Kane, taking over your circumference
Destroying negativity and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the worse, the poor
I thrash, bash, clash, mash... and then more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremacy
You need a savior to save ya so lean on me
I'm playing rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp 'em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay, I blow away and throw away
So go away, 'cause I don't play
Attacking like a psychopath, breaking rappers in half
So feel the wrath
Of Kane
[Scratched Hook]
"The name is Big Daddy"
"Here to bring trouble to"

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
The man at hand to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most and boast the loud and proud
The Kane'll reign your domain
(Yeah Kane!)
The heat is on so feel the fire
Come off the empire, on a more higher
Level than def, one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
'Cause I can never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of Monopoly
Let 'em speed around the board like an Astro
Then send 'em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking 'em up, breaking 'em up, taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee, let the volume grow so I can flow
Now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet, KRS and Public Enemy
Blahzay Blah, you know who you are
The red, black and green, the sun, moon and star
Knowledge of self is being taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reaching each
With the speech every leech I'll impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb, deaf and blind'll feel the wrath
Of Kane

Marley Marl, break it down!
Bring it back, Cee

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes
I still dispose, and blow 'em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out
Off the wall and butter soft to y'all
So you waited for Kane to come forth to all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
So stop lying and trying to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you dine on mine
Instead of fronting and trying to be a friend of
You might as well say guess who's coming to dinner
So just quit, submit and forget
Huh, you must be on some new improved shit
I get busy from sun to sun
I'm only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes, I keep 'em running like pantyhose
They get soft and tender, front and then surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on your class, force, team or staff
But when I'm in effect they feel the wrath
Of KaneEmbed
