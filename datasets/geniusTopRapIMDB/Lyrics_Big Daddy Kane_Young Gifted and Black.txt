Young, Gifted and Black Lyrics[Intro: Minister Farrakhan]
So out of the mercy of Allah
And the law, written in our nature
We call an individual into existence
And when that individual come
I make no apologies for what I'm about to say

[Verse: Big Daddy Kane]
Rough, rugged and real, you're on standstill
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Rappers I replace, rub out and erase
Competition you must be on freebase
Smoking or choking, bound to be broken
Man, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm choking!
'Cause I got a stranglehold
Youâ€™re still cold on parole for the role you stole
Rhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out
Crossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out
I'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller
I'm a rebel, blessed, able to hold a
Mic like a hammer and drop grammar
Treat a rapper like a wrestler and body slam him
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
So just play mute, don't even whisper
Open your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya
Ragtag and dog, put you in the morgue
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to Rock Steady
In other words you're Half-Steppin'
Tiptoeing, get going because my weapon
Is not a nine, an Uzi or a shotgun
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
Long Live the Kane, ain't a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
We sample beats, you sue and try to fight us
*tchk* Man, you still be home with arthritis
If we didn't revive 'em, bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand, the way that I live
That's positive and the message I got to give
It's a benefit for you and me
I'm talking bout P.E.A.C.E
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef
No pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish
The Kane falling victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish
I flow like water, slaughter
Put you out of order, floored ya!
Rappers are ragging and tagging and snagging and bragging
To be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just get back, I'm Young, Gifted and Black
[Outro]
And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sending this out to Divine Force
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast
Can't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two
I say, "Peace!"You might also like6Embed
