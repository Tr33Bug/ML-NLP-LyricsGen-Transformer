’93 Stretch & Bobbito Freestyle Lyrics[Big L]
You better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L be keepin’ niggas hearts pumpin’ like Reeboks
It's the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet
Disrespect and I'm a break your fuckin’ neck
I'm known to put a cap in a duck face
I spray guns, fuck mace
I'm a nutcase from a rough place
It's called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on, that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix
Straight from H-E double hockey sticks
I'm the devil's son, like my song said
I smash niggas like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and my crew peel caps and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash, so step to the rear fast
Before I have your queer ass cryin’ like tear gas
Every day I gain clout and my game sprout
Some niggas'll still be virgins if crack never came out
The Big L's hard to kill, when my squad gets ill
You better guard your grill, before you get scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin’ more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
You'll get smoked like a Phillie fast
‘cause your shit is really trash
Fuck around, I’ll swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L the crime converter
Sayin’ peace to all the niggas in jail doin’ time for murder
I wreck the mic, plus the whole stage
Rockin’ cornrow braids
I'm killin’ muthafuckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin’
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach, so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Marc Buchanan and North Beach
I'm makin’ rap hits, I snap flicks at mack chicks
Just the slim ones, you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call A.W.O.L
Punks, I slay all, on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds, I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin’ gs from transportin’ kis on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin’ like a sensei
I'm smoother than Ben Gay
Comprende?
I'm outtie like M.J
So Herb McGruff
My mellow, my nigga
Get on the mic and pull the MC triggerYou might also like4Embed
