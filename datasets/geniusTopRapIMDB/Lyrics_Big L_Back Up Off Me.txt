Back Up Off Me LyricsFuck them other cats, I'm runnin' with my own wolfpack
Keep frontin' like you's a thug and get your dome pushed back
'Cause you don't get down, that tough shit you talk is profound
You's a clown, fuck around, come Uptown and get found
I keep a pocket full, none of you niggas can touch my funds
I don't fight no more, all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed, I'm squeezin' MACs, bustin' off caps
Those coward cats with golden platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies to make C.R.E.A.M. rise
It's all about these green guys, front; your whole team dies
How I'm livin' so far swell, you can't scar L
Headed a cartel, sellin' more cakes than Carvel
And I'm labeled a kind thug, police got my line bugged
Hope I see the grave from old age and not a nine slug
I'm quick to bust a mean nut in some teen slut
Big L is clean-cut with more jewels than King TutYou might also like3Embed
