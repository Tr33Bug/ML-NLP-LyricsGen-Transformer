Devil’s Son Lyrics[Intro]
Ayo, Showbiz, man, I had this bugged out dream last night that I was the Devil's son, B
I was doin' some ill shit

[Refrain]
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns"
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus"
"I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns"
[Verse 1]
L's a rebel on a higher level, go get the shovel
'Cause I'm the only son of the motherfuckin' Devil
It's a fact I'm livin' foul, black
Niggas should have known I was sick
From the shit I did a while back
'Cause bein' bad I couldn't stop
When I was in pre-school, I beat a kid to death with a wooden block
Faggot niggas I was back-slappin'
I realized that every time I got mad that somethin' bad happened
A nigga hit me with a can of beer, then he ran in fear
Later they found him hangin' from a chandelier
Enemies I be buckin' quick
My moms know who I am
'Cause she know who she was fuckin' with
On my skull the 666, no tricks
When I catch fits, my mom picks up the crucifix
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
I'm rollin' with Satan, not Jesus Christ
Enemies, I got several done
Big L straight from hell, the motherfuckin' Devil's son
[Hook]
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

It's Big L and I'm all about takin' funds
I'm a stone villain, known for killin' and rapin' nuns
Ayo, I even kill handicapped and crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
This kid Joe owed me dough, I didn't take his life
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
One nigga cold tried to diss me, and that shit is risky
The nigga took a swung but he missed me
So I popped off, now the chump's knocked off
I spit in his mothafuckin' face and then bopped off
Once a hottie shot me with a shotty
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm livin' is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Killin' is fun, I'm number one with a gun
Front and get done 'cause you can't run from the Devil's Son

[Refrain]
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
[Verse 3]
The Big L is strictly gun-play
I run through church and pistol-whip the priest every Sunday
Once I put out the crazy order
I sent niggas to kill Tom, his mom, and his baby daughter
I'm livin' up to my extortion image
I be stalkin' Lennox
Catchin' more bodies than abortion clinics
A kid tried to take L out
Shot me in the chest with a TEC
I just laughed and spit the shell out
Next I took his gun, then he dropped to his knees with ease
I made him freeze, he begged me please not to squeeze
But I ain’t the type to fuss, I just snipe and bust
Click clack bang, another nigga bites the dust
Shorts, I'm takin' none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son

[Outro]
Word, Big L
The motherfuckin' Devil's Son is definitely in effect
Givin' a shout-out to all the murderers, thieves
Armed robbers, serial killers, psychos, lunatics
Crackheads, mental patients, mental retards
And a special special shout-out to all the niggas with AIDS
Peace!

[Refrain]
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns11Embed
