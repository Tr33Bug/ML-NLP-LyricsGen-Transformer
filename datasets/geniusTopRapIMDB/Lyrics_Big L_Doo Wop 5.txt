Doo Wop #5 LyricsI'm comin through y'all, with the Glock buckin'
Ya whole block duckin'
Every bitch that I'm fuckin' with now is cock-suckin'
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin'
Ya niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson and Boy George
I destroy frauds with one verse
Nigga, we could knuckle up
Or we could let the guns burst
L is the type to murder your son first
To get my point across
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the coppers
Y'all might as well join The Force
Where I'm from, believe me
Snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin' daily
Tryna fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin pictures in silk, gator'd up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch
But I ain't rape the slut, she gave it up
I runnin' with Wop, you runnin' wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front, the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill
Ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin to Corle', you better be real
'Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' up shit in rap events
It's like soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin'
The people yell
I'm rugged as hell, brothers can tell
That none of y'all niggas is fuckin' with L
When I'm that nigga ya expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time
My parents haven't met yetYou might also like4Embed
