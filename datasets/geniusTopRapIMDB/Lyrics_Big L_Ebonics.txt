Ebonics Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it

[Verse 1]
My weed smoke is my lye, a key of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high, with new clothes on I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
Ugh, a radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck
If you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is an okey-doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
[Chorus]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
Yo, yo

[Verse 2]
A burglary is a jook, a wolf's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F
If you got killed, you got left
But if you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
"Hit me on the hip" means page me
Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub, a victim's a mark
A sweatbox is a small club, your ticker's your heart
Your apartment is your pad, your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab, and heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
You might also like[Chorus]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

[Verse 3]
The iron horse is the train, and champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine she's a dime, a suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine, if you in love that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing, bleeding is leaking
Begging is bummin', if you nuttin', you cummin'
Taking orders is sonnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L, you took a loss, to show off mean floss
Uh, I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
[Chorus]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
