Flamboyant Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah!
Big L, Corleone
My nigga C-Town, my big brother Big Lee holdin' it down
Flamboyant, baby, for life
We takin' over (No doubt)
Comin' to a theater near you
Check it out, come on, check it

[Verse 1]
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
Better watch me 'round your girl if you ain't fuckin' her right
You damn playa haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Yo, the spotlight is mine, it ain't his no more
When Lee come home, niggas can't live no more
And I'm straight, keep a Harlem World mind-state
I never lounge where you find Jake
Surprise niggas like a blind date, L rhyme great
And I'mma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'mma make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in a M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Sellin' niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cocked, represent one block
139, nigga, the Danger Zone
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo, I'm out, I done took up enough time
We out, no doubt
You know how we do
Flamboyant for life

[Hook]
Big L, Corleone
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
Big L, for real
Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Big L, I'm a pimped-out nigga for real
Big L, Corleone is too advanced for y'all

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's Corleone and Queen's Most
We bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'mma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop frontin' ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'mma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machete, pockets heavy, slang more cane than Eddie
I represent uno-tres-nueve
Time is money, so I stay late
I'm quick to slide a playmate, bust off like a tre-eight then vacate
