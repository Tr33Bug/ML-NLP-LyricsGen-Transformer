Games Females Play Lyrics[Intro: Big L]
Aiyyo, what's up? This is Big L, know what I'm sayin'?
Callin' to see how that joint, know what I'm sayin', came out

[Interlude]
Aiyyo fellas... keep a eye open... watch out
'Cause females be playin' a whole lot of games like these

[Hook]
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
'Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you not aware
[Verse 1]
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed in Chanel, Guess, nothin' less
Body got more curves than a S, I smoked the boots like cess
And I confess, the sex was the best (Yes)
Within a week, she had keys to my rest
I done made her my main squeeze and gave her G's to invest
Then one day, I overheard her talkin' to friends
Sayin' how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo, honey was sheisty
Had me thinkin' she was wifey
Trickin' ridiculous, givin' her jewels that was icey
I said, "It's over, and what I gave you, you can have that"
It wasn't even her â€” it was myself I was mad at
Lettin' that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A year ago, I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, "Monique"
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin' to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin' to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah, right! It's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night, to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in, before you know it, we was doin' our thang
I drove her home, and said, "Tomorrow give me a ring"
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin' she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle

[Outro]
So watch out fellas... watch out
You better watch out, fellas
Yeah, you better watch out
Watch out fellas... you better watch out
