Hell Up In Harlem Lyrics[Intro: Big L]

A yo check it out
We about to make this shit real hot
We got Big L, Herb McGruff and Ron G the mix king
The niggas that hold it down for Uptown
Check it out
Bust it

[Verse 1: Big L]
I walk around with six thou' sippin' on Cristal
My whole clicks wild I'm rich pal no more sticks I'm makin' hits now
What I recite, you takin' hours to write
So if you bite, just tell your man what kind of flowers you like
I’m about as ridiculous as bankrolls, clothes and hostin' shows Smokin foes and strokin' hoes in the Poconos
I roll wit intruders looters and sharp shooters
Who spark Buddhas and fuck thick bitches wit large hooters
I grew up in the slums of greed
Known for Drawin guns with speed or
Sellin' tons a weed cuz I got sons to feed
Harlem’s where the thugs rest, in the slug fest
We sendin faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
I only roll wit big willie ass niggas
So motherfuck all them little silly ass niggas
I chew punks like chew sticks, known for droppin' new hits
I know you want me ho if I was you I’d want me too bitch
L is that nigga you expect to catch wreck on any cassette deck
I’m so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
So Herb McGruff my mellow my man
Word up, get on the mic' and do the best you can

[Verse 2: Herb McGruff]

Yo it’s me, livin' in the lap of luxury
Never ending funds, my niggas got the guns
Hon's wigglin', shakin' they buns
That's how it runs, money makin' in tons
Mansion swimmin' pool, you know the rules
Champagne and brews, flossin' my jewels
City zone, mad game like pretty Tone
3-57 chrome to your dome
Hard as stone all Gruff cars got phones
Like Mob style, smoking cigars and bones
Who be that? Hundred dollar bills crispy
Versace suit, slightly out to blaze and (?)
Gator morry, sliding through the party mad pissy
Champagne cooler filled wit Mo, Don, and Cristy
Eyes low, from the dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low, what the fuck we buy mo'
I’m universal, girls love Herb's style
Every now and then mix my herb wit' Tical
I run wit real niggas who live life foul
My clans off the hook, y’all soft and shook
Now look, we never talk lives get took
Straight up crook, Gruff can never live by the book
Yeah and ya don’t stop

[Verse 3 - Mase]
Yo, this Mase the newest and youngest member
Of the Bad Boy click
Representing on this new Ron G shit
Yeah kid Harlem on the rise
You don’t really want a problem with us guys
I got my man Killa Kam wit me
A.K.A. nigga K.F.C
We blowin' this shit down on the 123
Represent kid for the NYC
Yo, you know me I be OT low key
Icy rollie, puff on the O.Z
Hoes think I’m cute, 5001 suits
Now I got the loot stay in hot pursuit
My people see dough, legal, Puerto Rico
(??), watchin' for the police yo
Yo, I can stay on the red, we always shake the feds
Send ki's, (??) taped to there legs
Bonnie and Noani, became my Sugar Mammi
They hit me off wit mad loot plus the good punani
Now I’m mackin' Movado like I got half of the lotto
And be in Monte Carlo sippin' Remy out the bottle
Parle wit moms Alize in my palms
Stay calm, send drug money to my baby moms
I don’t know what it is or what they seen me wit
But these Moschino chicks want Casino chips
I be frontin' wit loot 600’s and coops
Mad bitches lickin' down my stomach like I’m Luke
While you wit' your team, flippin' bricks to get your green
I whip the mean triple beam deluxe wit the wings
But real life, that I could die over this cream
I ain’t tryin' to be seen in jail wit 5 to 15
So I change my ways start carryin' the Qu'ran
Follow the man that they call Louis Farrakhan
Soon as I stop dealin' drugs is a career
A thug appeared, hit me wit a slug from the rear
It’s fucked up but that what happens
When you dwell in these streets
Only two ways out the game
Go to jail or be deceased, nigga


Where my man Killa Kam at? (Right here)
What? Where my nigga Killa Kam at?
What? Where my nigga Killa Kam at?
Show them niggas how we do..

[Verse 4: Killa Cam]

Now check this, yo yo yo
We's about to crush this, cats out for justice
Crack yeah we crush this, gats yeah we bust this
You got me, i'm everybody wise copy
Without the Versace, girls still flock me
And watch me, 5-0, always tryna knock me and lock
But they know that they can't stop me
Perfect me, check me, rolling in the sexy
400 S-C, jet black Lexie
Edible, sexible, running from these federals
Catch me? They never will!
Cam too incredible, respectable
Pad locks, dead cops, mad rocks from mad blocks
Dead cops now we getting mad props
Creamy, white girl saying that I'm dreamy
In made bikini, claim they wanna see me
Used to ride the Beamy, me and Muscolini
Bought em size jeanys when he came from the greens (??)
Mud shed when i'm in the Beam over bloodshed
Ride right cash jay, go get our assay from Tucker's hookers
Yeah they should look this but when it's time pay
They gonn' say they shook us
Like Sandra, Conda, four pair of farmers
And mad ganja, took her (??)
On my dick and another bitch fonder
But I wear two hats I don't wanna catch the monster
Get me, hit me, Motorola flippy
Wildness since bits, ya'll cat's are kittens

No doubt!
