I Don’t Understand It Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight 'fore I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
A-yo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buckwild, and start sayin' names
But deep down inside, you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum, and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around
[Hook]
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted

[Verse 2]
MC's — what's goin on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute, you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same
Your raps are plain, that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make phat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same, and only change with the time
Or else you'll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough!
If you're dap, stay dapper!
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beads?

I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted

[Verse 3]
This is how it should be done!
I'm not the one, and my raps are strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb, plus slum
(How come?) Rap skills — they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail, and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin' you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack, and you went on tour with that crap
Don't understand it, 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin' hard, and rhymes — they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's?
Please, how could that be?

[Hook x2]
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
