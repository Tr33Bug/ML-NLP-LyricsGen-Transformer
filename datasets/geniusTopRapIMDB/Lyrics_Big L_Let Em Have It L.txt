Let ’Em Have It “L” Lyrics[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', "L's this," and, "L's that"—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up
[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

[Verse 2: Big L]
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
It's all about me, yo it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing, cause every hero got a theme song

[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)
Outro [Ma$e]:
A-yo, big shots to all them niggas on the corner
Doin' something they ain't
Got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to S&S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget my peeps from Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid
A-yo, L, you must be buggin', B
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes, B

[Big L]
Oh yeah, we gotta say what's up to the hoes, man
