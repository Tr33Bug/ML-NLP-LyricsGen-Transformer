Let Me Find Out Lyrics[Big L]
Let me find out this gonna rock the clubs
All the thugs at the bar, poppin' bubs
Dime pieces, shake that ass, show me love
This goes out to all of the above
Let me find out this gonna rock the clubs
All the thugs at the bar, poppin' bubs
Dime pieces, shake that ass, show me love
This goes out to all of the above

Check it!
I be that playa with the big street buzz, who all the freaks love
Braided hair, light moustache, a little peach fuzz
That slim guy, all my life been fly
Representin' one-three-nine, Harlem World, NY
Yeah!
Yo I was destined to be a star honey
Plus I rock jewels that cost car money
And cats like you never got rocks on
Rappin' bout Roleys, and got a Swatch on
Playa hatas don't wanna see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment C.E.O
Huh! (You know)
How cool can one MC be?
Ya'll still envy me, cause I'm MVP
Cruise through Harlem in a bulletproof MPV
Man, you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
Word!
My style is rough like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick, ugly bitches get the wrong number
I stay droppin' like April showers
Give me BET's address, so I can send Rachel flowers
And I'm rap most livest cat
Gettin' stacks while you asking niggas: Do you want fries with that?
Try to tax me, and watch the nine mil' burst
I've been off the scene over two years, and ya'll still thrist
To hear L drop a ill verse
And all you unsigned rappers that wanna battle, get a deal first
I'm quick to smoke an ounce with my thugs
This be that party shit that make you bounce in the clubs
I defeat creeps, with techniques, on elite beats
Always front row, never sittin' in the cheap seats
Boo, I got too much cash for that
I never date rape, I get too much ass for that
And do I walk around the streets broke?
No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the O.J. trial
Yo, my Harlem World playas, ya'll can shine with me
Got my own label now, so ya'll can sign with me
Ya'll can take it from the bottom and climb with me
It's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be
I'm in charge of all
Just threw a party at the Taj Mahal
Cause The Mirage is small
We gonna build like construction, real hot production
No playa hatin', just congratulatin'
And I'm known to taste a chick
Take her to my Harlem hideout and lace her quick
And believe me, I know the right place to lick
As long as I got a face, ya'll got a place to sit
I'm a true Don, from here to Huston
Strong like a Yukon
No more jelly, strictly Grey Poupon
Pretty ladies wanna see L
Fellas wanna be L
If I go to jail, you'll wear shirts saying: Free LYou might also like1Embed
