M.V.P. Lyrics[Verse 1]
A-yo, spark up the Phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick, money grip, 'fore your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightnin'
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? A'ight, then!
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparin' yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolet
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm sayin' hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah! 'Cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw 'em, they come back
I'm comin' straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin' In The Crates, and I'm MVP
[Hook]
If rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C
A-yo, if rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again, the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time I'm jammed, I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flyin' saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buyin' Porsches
Comin' straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C
Yo, if rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C

Battles I lose none, I make crews run, I get fools done
Got ten fingers, but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around, you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays, girls want you for your money
I'm like Heav' â€” I got nothin' but love for you, honey
And since I'm lookin' slick, and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my... (Chill!)
I'm comin' straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C
Yo, if rap was a game, I'll be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M-I-C61Embed
