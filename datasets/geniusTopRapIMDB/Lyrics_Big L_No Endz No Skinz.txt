No Endz, No Skinz Lyrics[Verse 1: Big L]
Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother tip
When ya sportin' jewels and drivin' in a groovy car
All the hoes gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets — that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich, then them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke — you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough — you get a hoe with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone, she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losin' all your bucks
Soon, you broke as a joke and outta luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your hoe's gone
"So long, dear, I'm outta here", a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play
[Chorus: Big L & Showbiz]
If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots

[Verse 2: Big L]
Girls in the '90s ain't nothin' but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets, not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leavin' brothers for the next man 'cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak, but always askin' for a dollar
And if you pushin' a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah! As long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours
But as soon as your dough go, your hoe go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes sellin' jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin' 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you're dead broke, the girls stopped speakin'
'Cause nowadays, girls want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play

[Verse 3: Big L]
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money-hungry girl A.K.A. gold digger
It ain't even funny!
Some girls don't even know me, askin' me can they get some money?
I'm lookin' nothin' like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl asked me for a ring, and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo, Showbiz, I'mma break it down like this

[Chorus x2: Big L & Showbiz]

[Outro]
It's like that, y'all, and that's a fact, y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack, y'all
It's Big L, y'all, I'm livin' swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got endz, girls be frontin'
If you don't got endz, they ain't givin' up nothin'
If you don't got endz, all the girls ignore you
If you don't got endz, they act like they never saw you
If you don't got endz, if you don't got endz, if you don't got endz...18Embed
