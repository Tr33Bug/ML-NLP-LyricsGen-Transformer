Platinum Plus Lyrics[Intro: Big L]
Yo yo what the fuck man, Big L takin' over the streets
Flamboyant Entertainment

[Hook 1: DJ Premier]
"What y'all bout to witness"
"Big L, Big L, Big L"
"My-my-my-my, my whole crew wild"
"The game is called rap"
"Other MC's ain't got a chance at all"
"My-whole, my, my whole crew wild"
[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I'm straight loco, to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with coco, strong as bolo
I pack a fo'-fo', platinum ro-ro
Anti-homo, that's a no-no so fuck po-po
I push the seven-fo'-oh and not the Volvo
C-Town push the six-oh-oh, I’m with a bitch or I’m dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I, buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds
My underground niggas, y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be

[Hook 2: Big L]
Gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us
Gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us

And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends, let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game, block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you - the fuck you gon' possibly win
I do it, "Booty Calls" on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like Ready Whip
Heavy with, styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places, chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasier's, I'm the bodacious
Body parts are big and like Schwarzenegger's
Smokin' Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you, block the cash, we lockin ass
I'ma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now - exhibit, styles I kick with it
[*COUGH*] Pardon me, but I'm fucking sick with it
[Hook 2: Big L & (Big Daddy Kane)]
A-yo; gats we bust, (backs we crush)
Only hot tracks we lust, (and crazy stacks we clutch)
And we need plaques to touch, (that say platinum plus)
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now, (is wack to us)
A-yo; gats we bust, (backs we crush)
Only hot tracks we lust, (and crazy stacks we clutch)
And we need plaques to touch, (that say platinum plus)
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now, (is wack to us)
