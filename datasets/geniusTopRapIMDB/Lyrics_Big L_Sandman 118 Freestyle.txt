Sandman 118 Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Aiyo, check it out 1-2, 1-2
It's the Big motherfucking L and I'm 'bout to catch wreck on this Dirtman shit
Yo, check it out
This is that Sandman 118 shit
And it's the B-I-G L straight from 139 in fucking Lenox, Harlem, the Danger Zone
I gotta represent it, somebody gotta do it
You know what I'm saying?
Aiyo, I got a new single out, it's called MVP, the Most Valuable Poet, you know what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm the most valuable poet when it comes to this shit and I'ma prove it right now, check it out
[Verse]
My clique is quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
You shoulda known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest, in a slug fest
We sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums of greed, known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed, cause I got sons to feed
And it's a must that my toast smokes, I'm not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties, I carry ghost-notes
And it's a must that I commence to slaying
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
I'mma smoke Pataki ass, and Rudolph Giuli' like a wooley
I keep a tooly for any moolie who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L, to hell is where I'mma send em'
After I skin em' and spit some venom in em'
I run with intruders, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddahs and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Yo, I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
When I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends, like there he go!
Never had rules to follow, none of my jewels are hollow
Try to tax mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games, I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib, stressed the fuck out, with suicidal thoughts
All my life I've been a lady bruiser, a wrong chooser
School refuser, drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I'm better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward, and fronting on me, I won't allow it
I'm high powered, fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front and get your belly torn, I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom PÃ©rignon
On the ave I pump rocks, quick to give a chump knots
You ain't tough, the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick, ugly bitches get the wrong numberYou might also like17Embed
