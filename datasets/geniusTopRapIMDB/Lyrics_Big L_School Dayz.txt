School Dayz Lyrics[Production by Showbiz]

[Big L: Verse 1]
Ay yo, hookie, is a game that a fool plays
I'm sitting here reminiscing about my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
Scoop the chick, stupid prick, get the digits and the address
Yo they was jocking, cause I was clockin fast cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thang, let me explain
I hit 'em up, get 'em up, and put 'em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses, I cut the whack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat (hey)
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was macking females in my school days
[Hook]
Yes yes, y'all (here we go, here we go)

[Verse 2]
Ay yo the school I went to, a whole bunch rhymed
That's why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain whack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you couldn't hear the bell ring
One of us froze then dozed, to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
That's why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left emcees and they whole crew phased
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I first got inside high school, I wasn't known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman, in other words, a new jack
When you mentioned Big L, brothers was like "Who's that?!"
Then I made the master plan, now I got a batch of fans
So when you mention my name now, "Oh, that's my man"
You see how, it's all about me now
All the girls scream "Ow" whenever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me can't do a thing to me
I used to move alone, now my crew's fat
I went from a new jack to a new mack, that's true black
I'm cutting rappers like soufflés, I came off like toupées
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days
