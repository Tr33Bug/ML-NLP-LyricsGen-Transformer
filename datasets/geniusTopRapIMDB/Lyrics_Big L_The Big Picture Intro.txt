The Big Picture (Intro) Lyrics[Intro]
One-two, y'all know, y'all know
[Foxxx] Alright, we gon' keep it moving
[Primo] Check this out though
[Foxxx] We gon' keep it moving, we gon' keep it moving
Get 'em up, y'all know what time it is, get 'em up
[Primo] Right you are
[Foxxx] You a true underground head
You know what this mean right here baby
This ain't motherfucking LL Cool J, get it up
You know what this mean
It don't mean lazy motherfucker either, get it up aight
[Guru] You ready Prim
[Foxxx] It don't mean
[Guru] Everybody keep your L up like that
[Foxxx] It don't mean nothing, but one thing
[Lord Finesse]
Throw that L up in the air
We gon' have you do this shit
All motherfucking night so get used to it
Get used to it
This is for my man Big L, word 'em up
Put your Ls up, put your Ls up
Put your Ls up, put your Ls up

[Verse: Big L]
You know the game plan
C-Town, that's my main man
We never bring luggage, we go shopping when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
L'll make your dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips, I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits
You know nothing about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfucking rap game without L?
That's like jewels without ice
That's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with, motherfucker
