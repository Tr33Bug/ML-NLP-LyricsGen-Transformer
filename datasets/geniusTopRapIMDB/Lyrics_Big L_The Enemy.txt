The Enemy Lyrics[Intro]
("Fuck who did I offend, rappers"
"Sit back I'm about to begin")
[Verse 1: Big L]
I drive up and down Harlem blocks, iced-out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if I'm drunk, but I'm sober
They wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo, you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year, I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names, try to hurt my pride
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talking 'bout, "Where the gun at?" I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pistol, my whole clique's wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks, I'm making hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breaking laws
I don't sell coke any more, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down, them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up, them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap, I doubt that
[Chorus: Big L]
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Aiyo enough's enough, Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga's soul, but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure, death before dishonor, I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing
Pursuing my dream till there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real, I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witnesses that you claim to have
Saying that I'm taking half, extorting New York and not paying tax?
I'm laid back playing the role, laying the low
But it's the same old Joe so don't get KO'd
Hey yo, I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

[Chorus: Big L]
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

("What would you do if a vicious enemy
Suddenly started coming at you
Armed to the teeth and ready to kill you?")17Embed
