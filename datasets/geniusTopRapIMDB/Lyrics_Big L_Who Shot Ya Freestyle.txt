Who Shot Ya Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo check it
My clique is quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
You shoulda known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest, in a slug fest
I'm sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums with greed, known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed, cause I got sons to feed
It's a must that my toast smokes, I'm not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties, I carry ghost notes
And it's a must that I commence to slain
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
I'mma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli' like a wooly
I keep a tooly for any muli who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L, to hell is where I'mma send ‘em
After I skin ‘em and spit some venom in ‘em
I run with intruders, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddhas and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
So when I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends, like there he go!
I never had rules to follow, none of my jewels are hollow
Try to take mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games, I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out, with suicidal thoughts
All my life I been a lady bruiser, a wrong chooser
School refuser, drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I’m better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward, so fronting on me, I won't allow it
I'm high powered, fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front, get your belly torn, I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Pérignon
Cause on the Ave. I pump rocks, quick to give a chump knots
You ain't tough, the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber, cute chicks get the dick
And ugly bitches get the wrong numberYou might also like1Embed
