You Know What I’m About Lyrics[Verse 1: Big L]
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hardcore life, I chose to explore
Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law
My only picture was a mug shot, slugs what thugs got
Pockets swellin' hot from sellin' tops on the drug spot
Gs was clocked, fat knots went in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
'Cause we could put the guns down and go one round
With the hands my man, I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style 'cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child, I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two tecs in case your crew flex
I wet up the set in a sec and yell "Who's next?"
To feel the wrath of a psychopath, shoots it up like Shaft
Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you're softer than jelly jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat
On one three ninth street, Malcolm X boulevard
It's full of hard brothers that's thick and quick to pull a card
I tell facts when the beat start
Listen here sweetheart, the Big L is street smart
I fuck ducks and they crews up, make 'em give the jewels up
For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up
I had beef with this nigga named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
A beat down from Big L, that's what all pranksters get
Like Al Yankovic, I'm on some real gangster shit
I'm never fuckin' with no handicapped or crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed, I'm a villain admit it
I'm the type to murder you then tell your moms I'm the kid who did it
Peace and love is somethin' that I don't rhyme about
Fuck what you heard, you know what I'm about
[Hook]
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
You know what I'm about!

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
It's the man with the rough flow
Some niggas don't like me but I don't give a fuck though
Cause I'm in command y'all
I'm smackin' niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I ain't the funny type
To joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin' money right
'Cause I got the right game
Definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
I'm rolling numbers with no practice
I'm snatchin' up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes
'Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin' head crack trips and makin' all the brothers mad at me
Word, I'm taxin' shit
I'm shittin' on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin' to earn props I ain't the one to see
You clowns'll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
Ya gotta find a better way
I'll pull ya card, your file, shit, plus your resume
'Cause I don't play clown
I gotta get mine that's why my face stay frown
I don't smile, don't try to pull my file
I'll lay your ass like tile, you know my motherfuckin' style
So just slow down 'cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a nigga's makin' dough now
And I'm livin' better troop
And I'm makin' more noise than a fuckin' heavy metal group
I'm a cool man, a brother with a smooth plan
That's why I'm seein' more papers than a newsstand
So peep it, don't try to run around or speak it
Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret
While niggas are packin' steel, actin' ill
I'm on the D.L. with a female and I'm stackin' bills
How I'm livin'? Everything is well
'Cause a nigga like me, yo I'm ringin' bells
Without doubt I got clout
Yo fuck that shit, yo you know what I'm about
You might also like[Hook]
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, you know what I'm about!
Yeah! C'mon!
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
You know what I'm about!

[Outro: Big L]
