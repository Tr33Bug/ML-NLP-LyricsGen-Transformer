[Tony Sunshine]
Ooooooooooohhhhh.. Puerto Rico

[Big Punisher]
Toma

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine]
Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Puerto Rock Puro, not Menudo no I'm not the one
I'm studyin' Judo, you don't know if I got a gun
It's Pun, from the X side of things, baguette inside my rings
Everything I want I gets, bada-BING
It's mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town, Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound, to the ground no pity
Watch the sound, fo'-pound twenty round milli'
Get smacked silly, for coming out your mug
I'm known for bouncin' thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Don't matter, put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs, have you pissin' in a plastic bag
That's a drag now you abnormal
Don't make me grab the Rambo
And put some motherfuckin' stabs on you
The night is young and I'm already fightin', hidin' my gun
Promoter buggin' screamin', who the fuck invited Pun

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine]
Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
You might also like[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
From San Juan to Bayamon, I'm the Don Juan beside the Don
Live long, get your party on
Don't let the liquor fool you, cause I'll stick it to you
Somethin sharp to the heart, or somethin big to move you
The Desert or the shottie, whatever you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe, must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come
You see that? I'm like G. Rap, 'Pac, Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me I'm the one that's cockin' the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine]
Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
[Tony] It ain't over
[Pun] I thought you ain't like the beat
[Tony] Te digo que no se ha acabado

[Bridge: Tony Sunshine]
La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo
Aha aha aha aha..
Es un jardin florido de magico primor
Aha aha aha aha aha aha aha...
Un cielo siempre nitido, que sirve de dosel
Y dan arrullos placidos, las olas a sus pies

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine]
Pronto llegara, el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we won't stop
We always knew we'd make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
