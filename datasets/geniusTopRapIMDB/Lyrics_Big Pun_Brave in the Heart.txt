Brave in the Heart Lyrics[Verse 1: Triple Seis]
I'll battle you all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis: the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed by my Squad
It's odd y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the Beamer sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before: rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Nawmean, do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail, blazin' like Rasheed Wallace
What's today's knowledge?
Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money, son, that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low, tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas' we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt
[Verse 2: Big Pun]
We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps: state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low; business, never personal
Just some words to know if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state; If death is my fate, then cool, I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me Aight, crew? (no doubt Pun)
Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto god
I rip a nigga's heart out his frame
While I scream: "Terror Squad!"
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she’d starve if I die, understand I’m a god in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin: that's mi hermano

We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God

[Verse 3: Prospect]
You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a 9 steady
I'm John Blazin when you see the arms razin'
Shit, crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers: how you more ready?
Switch quicker than Marbury
I'm a cherry, you a strawberry
If you lost that, mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose
I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

[Refrain]
We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God
[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Make way for scrill', I don't play, I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glock—that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast, 'cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post? Then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad: shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the Earth
I'm dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip: either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seekin' to flip19Embed
