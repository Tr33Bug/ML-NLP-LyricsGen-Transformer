Fast Money Lyrics[Intro: echoing dialogue between Big Pun and (someone)]
Mad stressed
(Yo, just chill bro, chill man)
Nah, nah, I gotta get this money
(Yo, chill you got everything going for you, man)
I ain't got nothing, right now, man
(Niggas calling you and all that, man)
Nah, that shit was down
('Bout to blow soon, you know?)
Niggas ain't for real, kid. That's a dream, kid. This is reality. This is reality. This is the real world. Nah I gotta get this fucking money, kid. Word up. Fuck that, nah, fuck that
(Whatever, man)
[Verse 1]
I got the sweetest heist, million in cash, another three in ice
Who can I trust? Cuban'll bust plus get beef tonight
Here's the plan (plan), we nab the man, bring a camcorder
Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
"Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin'
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels"
It's settled, better put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance, I've only got one, my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge, jury and Johnny Cochran

[Chorus]
Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place

[Verse 2]
Ayo the plot thickens, I'm pickin' the locks in the back entrance
Payin' attention, not tryin' to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got the popo locked with a Don "The Rock" Muraco chokehold (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin'
Inspectin' the vault for weapon's assault, second of course
It's poison, it sprays, boiled and baked in Epsom salt
Reppin' New York is the cat burglar, the fat murderer
Slippin' the clip in the MAC, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holdin' heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like De Niro mob flicks
Back to the topic at hand, the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shine almost blinded my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban, started movin' for the back, let's go
That's when I heard the sirens, hopin' that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin'
Pointin' at the building screamin', "I can see them, kill 'em!"
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside, nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Cuban said, "Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns"

Oye castigador, saca el fucking cañon
Vamos pa la guerra, vamos señarlo!
A castigarlos!

[Chorus]
Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place
Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash the niggas' shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place

[Verse 3]
Ayo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about the brighter day
I cock the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock, it was diesel
Said, "See you in Hell coppers" and started poppin' like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin' out of ammo, I got about a handful of Black Rhinos and two Rambos strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, "Move your fat ass faster motherfucker, they gaining"
I gave him the case, told him, "Go 'head, save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave 'em Hell"
For real, that's when I heard the tires screechin'
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin'
