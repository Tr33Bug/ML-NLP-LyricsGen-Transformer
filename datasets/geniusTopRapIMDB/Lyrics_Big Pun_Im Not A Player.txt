I’m Not A Player Lyrics[Intro]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
You're my darlin' darlin' love
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Ooh, you're...

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em
Sendin' them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin' attitude
I'm just showin' you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it
Bustin' it out—nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em
Bitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em
Fillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache
[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition

You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And "Put it in Her Mouth," like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?
[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby.."
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm no player, I just fuck a lot

[Outro]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
You're my darlin' darlin' love
You're my darlin' darlin' baby11Embed
