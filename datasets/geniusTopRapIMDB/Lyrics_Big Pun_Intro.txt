Intro Lyrics[Extract from the film Fresh]

[Kid 1]
Bam, Spider-Man go down
Bam, Daredevil go down
All them niggas is going down
Punisher be taking they ass out

[Kid 2]
X-Men take out the Punisher
[Kid 1]
X-Man baby stuff, homes
All their costumes
And powers ain't shit
Punisher the real dope, homie

[Kid 3]
Word, I seen a seven-foot-tall
White Terminator nigga...
With twenty guns on my roof
Just the other day

[Kid 1]
Punisher be takin' out
All your stupid heroes
He be sayin'
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Take out that nigga!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!You might also like2Embed
