Legendary Cypher Lyrics[Yasiin Bey (Mos Def)]
Fake, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter wind, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioned in the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
Gentlemen you got a tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling, making em WOOP
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me?
[DMX]
Yo, niggas don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
When I bark, when I hit, scratch like a Pit
We both know you pussy but you stay talking shit
What I'mma have to do dog, run up when you rest
Catch you while you comfortable with one up in your vest
One up in yo chest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'mma go platinum... You gots to be kiddin'? (Nah!)
I'mma go platinum! No bullshittin'
And I'mma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows
Strippin' ho's, gettin dough, let me go
And niggas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is, the rest is or might as well be helpless
I'm wreckless cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
And then go from like midnight to breakfast

[John Forté]
Yo, yo, my Alma mater is the rooftop, back in '85
With summer cookouts to crack lookouts
Mega-hookers with pocketbooks out
The corner's where we hung out, my uncle that was strung out
Beef during the drought and all the guns that we brung out
Niggas hustle for cloud, Brownsville street type bouts
Blackouts, ultra-lootin', door to door army recruitin'
Drug lords continue shootin' in weathers, and come Novembers
Sleep in red snow, where niggas bled so, the spot control
Gold-chains with diamond-links makes product in kitchen sinks
Think tanks matching to banks, stuck up bitches actin' stank
Gun-play without provisions, went on twenty-type collisions
Weed spots getting took when po-nine run the jooks
Crooked beats crooks be lurkin' hurtin'
To catch a body workin' to say they perks when
It's a nigga head they burstin' first and last
I'll lock your block then smack that ass
Cum-laude and street-wise, slide fast
You might also like[Mic Geronimo]
Alright, I'm in fascination with the shorter words, turn to audible
Put a little more to it try to blow through
See it's like the way you think and I've been made to endure
I floored rap like [?] [?]
Gangs, straightaways moving out of buckets, some change
Paralyzed while I hit you like Colombian King
And I'm soaring, killing words they couldn't explain
Spark flames, so it burn slow, feeling me every bit
As much as Dutch know though, a ransom, my thumbs crush
My motivation lands where the guns bust
I know myself and the law we might trust
Mic like a cold-brush, goin' front porch to the street
Movin' through this life of speed
Tryna square and exonerate, they're here to eat
Besides that, dude you got me feeling the beat
It's like this, freestyle off of the cap
With my nigga Big Pun, cause he bust mad raps
That's DMX, we rock this shit, no doubt
With my nigga Canibus, let me show you how
Now we get down to the specifics, the Heineken
I be grabbing up the mic before we rhyme again
What time again? Don't talk to brainless such
People around the way tell me that I smoke too much
I'm rolling in the Dutch, that's the thing I do
While I'm chilling with my niggas from the Q.U
The zoo niggas ride, we like gorillas and such
While we ripping you through cause we just too much
Freestyle off the top of my brain, I maintain
Showing the motherfucking stress in the game
Still I wouldn't break, the flow fast, Speedy McSlow
Geronimo, I get the dough nigga, what?
[Big Pun]
I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carving my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine
Off the board-head, reverse that, I curse at the first whack
Nigga with the worst rap cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rapping and tongues packing the ones
Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised mañana in the rotten manzana
C'mon pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite; anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
I'm pure adrenaline uncut, straight to the gut medicine
Raw cure for pain, I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'mma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava, the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver can put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, clutch with the pipe design
Plushed out, both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, get the fuck out
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished, say goodnight
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settling beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, your dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb and mine is on stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard, desert bird player, you outta bounds
You could ramble out the mouth, like you Rambo
But you slouch, if we battled you'd be out
Without a shadow of a doubt and that's the ugly truth
Killers walk with muddy boots
Once my dogs cut me loose, that's a bullet in your bubbly-goose
Fuck is you talkin' like you crazy? Barkin' like you wady
I'll have you crawlin, walking like a baby
Don't try to play me cause I'm not a playa
Aiyyo I shot the place up and pass the heat off like a hot potata
I'm 'bout to make a million dollars but still I'm rowdy
So I hope I'm rap and rhyming before I have to kill somebody
That's how it is in the stone jungle if you known to own a bundle
Guaranteed a nigga gon mug you
And no one love you when you broke as shit
Focus kid, commercials don't lie, curse you to die
Coke is it, rob your life away, that's a big price to pay
Forgetting to teach his kid how to ride his bike today stupid

[Canibus]
Let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homosexual rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body ‘cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me ‘cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While ninety-nine percent of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z
Now you want to fuck with me? Nigga you crazy
You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start
Give me the respect that I deserve or I'mma take it by force
Blast you with a fourty-five colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
‘Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth
God bless his soul rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself ‘cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you something: you might got more cash then me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse... fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Clap, clap, now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Stick you in the groin, kick you in your Vanguard award
Stacks a Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third-born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I say "Naw, he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is"
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off-hand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
Fuck that! ‘Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'mma make the world see it too
Straight-up and down

[Canibus]
Canibus and the Punisher
The ultimate executioner's dream
Swinging the guillotine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Fuckin' with Canibus the human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles, to bar stools, fruits, and foods
You got a album out? You get hit with your CD, too
Runnin' outside lyin', cryin', denyin'
That you ain't The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him
What's the difference? Y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin' your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
So wicked, I got Satan ejaculating all over his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin' white, living the hype, he ruined his life
But I'm a MC of a different type, yeah, that's right
So make sure your grip is tight or I'ma snatch your mic
Word up, like that3Embed
