My Dick Lyrics[Intro: Tony Sunshine]
What's the deal baby?
Some for you dick ridin' motherfuckers
You non-believin' ass motherfuckers
To all my niggas, I love y'all
Ai yo pun, what's the deal, baby?
Cuban, Raoul, whaddup mas?
Joey Crack, what's the deal?
T. Squaders [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] chance-a-million [Incomprehensible]
Didddown for liddddife
[Verse 1: Tony Sunshine]
I threw on my vest
Loaded up the Smith with the hollow tips
It's time to flip
And blast my way to the top ten list
Me and pun real fly
Arrogant and we love to puff lye
Lord, you should see my wife
She's enough to make all the bitches cry
Oh yeah, be on my dick

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine & Big Pun] X2
Get off my dick
My dick
My dick
My dick
My dick, my dick, my dick
Get off my dick, my dick, my dick, my dick
Get off my dick

[Verse 2: Tony Sunshine]
I just wanna take time
To talk to everybody
Who ain't showed me love
To let me rock the mic at the party
Now you gonna get what you deserve
That's my dick in your mouth
'Cause me and Pun
Is gonna show you what it's 'bout
You might also like[Verse 3: Big Pun]
Youse a nasty fuck
Makin' a song talkin' about your nuts
Don't want nobody on my dick
Lest I'm about to bust
You doubted us
Cause we weren't tearin' up the streets
Them the same niggas on my nuts
Like they have a fucking seat
I love my peeps, I'll die for my amigos
But I ain't fuckin' with freaks
Tryin' to free ride on my bicho

It's like perrico
(What? )
One taste you're gonna like it
Just ask Mike
(Mike who?)
My dick

[Chorus: Tony Sunshine & Big Pun]
Get off my dick
My dick
My dick
My dick
My dick, my dick, my dick
Get off my dick, my dick, my dick, my dick
Get off my dick
[Outro: Tony Sunshine]

When I stressed you know I puff that
