Nigga Shit Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah..
This is for my peoples on the street, y'know?
Gave me love since day one..
Y'knahmean? When I was puttin it down
Battlin for mine, y'knahmsayin?
Battlin - projects and neighborhoods
Just to be heard, y'knahmsayin?
Y'know cause y'know I used to do everything y'know?
From that hardcore shit..
To that commercial shit..
To that party shit..
That thug shit..
That live shit, that cry shit..
That love shit, that hate shit..
I do all that shit..
You know what's my true love?
[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
That nigga shit, smokin weed with my moms
That nigga shit, slingin D and heroin
That nigga shit, no love for the cops
That nigga shit, gettin my dick sucked with my pops
That nigga shit, gettin drunk with my Twinz
That nigga shit, swearin to God I'll never drink again
That nigga shit, gettin drunk again
That nigga shit, three days in the pen
That nigga shit, talkin loud at the flicks
That nigga shit, fried rice and rib tips
That nigga shit, lookin fresh with no ends
That nigga shit, beatin on my sister's boyfriends
That nigga shit, yellow tape and white sheets
That nigga shit, whoopin my kid's ass in the streets
That nigga shit, Iverson crossover
That nigga shit, cheese doodles, grape soda
That nigga shit, playin in the last car on the train‚Äù
That nigga shit, hot sauce on everythang
That nigga shit, nugget gold in the 80's
That nigga shit, iced out in the 90's
That nigga shit, shoot the place if you play me
That nigga shit, Pun to run til they find me

[Outro]
