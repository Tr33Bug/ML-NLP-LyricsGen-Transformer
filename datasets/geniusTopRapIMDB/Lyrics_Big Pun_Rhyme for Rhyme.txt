Rhyme for Rhyme Lyrics[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Enter my world of doom, consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and the moon and curl the planets
I'm bell Atlantic with lyrics expanding for galaxies
Battle me mathematically, I'm giving your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowing, controlling the time, jump over the line
I'm blowing your mind, with just a flow of the rhyme
I'm Hogan in his prime, too strong and fast, niggas' could bomb and blast
C'mon, you still be on your ass
I'm satisfaction guaranteed, spit fiction like Quentin Tarantine
Kick you in your baddest dream, shit you haven't seen
I have to be perfectly honest
We should have an anniversary to acknowledge, the way I work the Ebonics
I verbally vomit on novice niggas' that try to kid us with garbage lyrics
My style delivers, outside the outer limits
I'm like the pyramids cause every point is precise, now you know me for life
3 pound Cuban studded with ice
[Verse 2: Cormega]
Yo as d.e.a predicted, I'm in my PJ's waving a biscuit
Cops raided my lab, and enslaved my mistress
When I speak, you listenin'. The way I rhyme I leave precision
Until your mind freak your mic out in each position
The 5 40 out piped out with deep dishes
Check the flow, never test it yo
I manifest it like drug connects pitch and blow
Destined for greatness, check they way my necklace glow
Fake niggas' hate this. You think something sweet about me?
Come taste this, 9 in your face kidYou might also likeEmbed
