Still Not A Player (Clean Version) Lyrics[Intro: Joe]
Don't wanna be a player (T.S.)

[Chorus: Joe and Big Punisher]
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thugs (I don't wanna be), for my thugs (I don't wanna be a playa no more)
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot
[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
Hey yo, I'm still not a player but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, French countess, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My, my, I'm big huh, I rip my through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my  with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about getting' loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get HOOF

[Chorus: Joe and Big Punisher]
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot (No more)
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
Uptown baby, uptown
I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot (I don't wanna be a playa)
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush tonight

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the
Long as you show class, and pass my test
Fat and breasts, highly intelligent bachlorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna ghetto brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'm let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
"You nasty Twin!" I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make a chick (come)

[Bridge: Joe & Big Punisher]
(In the) hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like "Don't stop, get it get it"
(In the) hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like "Don't stop, get it get it"
[Joe]
I don't wanna be a playa no more (Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher)
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for (Punisher, ooh, Big Punisher)
I don't wanna be a playa no more (Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher)
But you know Big Punisher still down by law (Punisher, ooh, Big Punisher)
Who's down to crush a lot

[Joe]
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena

No more rollin' with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad
Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher
Punisher... Joe and Big Punisher

Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morenaEmbed
