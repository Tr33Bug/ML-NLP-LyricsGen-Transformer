Super Lyrical Lyrics[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Ayo, my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles your back and shackles and laughs at you
That's a mathematical madness I'm on
The savage, the strong
The marriage and bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on, as if Picasso laced you
There's lots of hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school
That's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you, I'm battling Jesus
If he passes through my label I'm snatching his halo
God, I'll trade you, if you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, with brain-booster chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable
[Chorus]
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Black Thought, the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats, they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up, like uppercuts
Newfound ways of ripping shit up, I develop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some old next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph, somethin' like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, 'cause what?

[Chorus]
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
You will lose, I must break you
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm supposed to represent

Ayo, peace Roots, East Coast niggas reppin' the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those niggas that'll lift your mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothing you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser, emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers
Just call me Baby Jesus, 'cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavory
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I'll leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress
Approach this ferocious up-closeness

[Chorus]
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm supposed to represent

[Outro]
Lyrically
It's suicide
Lyrically
You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically
You can't win
Lyrically
It's suicide
Lyrically
You've seen him, you know how strong he is
Lyrically
You can't win
Lyrically
You can't win
Lyrically
You will lose
Lyrically
I must break you
