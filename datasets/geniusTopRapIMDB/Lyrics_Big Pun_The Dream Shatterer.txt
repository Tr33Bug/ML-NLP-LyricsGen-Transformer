The Dream Shatterer Lyrics[Produced by Domingo]
[Verse 1]
Ayo, I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed, you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rappin' in tongues
Packin' the ones; Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised ma√±ana in the rotten manzana
Come on, pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin', I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

[Verse 2]
I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to the gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain, I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'mma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava, the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver, could put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it, I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, clutched with the pipe design
Plushed out (No doubt), both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished? SAY GOODNIGHT!
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the "Benjamins" beat
But it won't matter, your dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb, and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard; Desert Bird, player, you outta bounds
You might also like[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

[Verse 3]
You know the Pun'll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the Desert Eez tongue-kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in your ear, crystal clear
"Come here, let me kiss your tears!"
Everything you fear is here, you ain't gotta search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse birth, every verse hurts, every curse word's
Already more offendin' than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin' his game's tighter IS A GODDAMN LIAR!
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out ya brain and leave ya insane in the dark
The King of New York, lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town with the MAC, hoodied down
I'm no joke, I'll soak your face with a sweeper
Die, you a disgrace, or face your death through the speaker
[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination23Embed
