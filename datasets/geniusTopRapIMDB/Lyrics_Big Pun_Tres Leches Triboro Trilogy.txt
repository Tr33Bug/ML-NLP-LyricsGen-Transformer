Tres Leches (Triboro Trilogy) Lyrics[Intro: Roc Raida & Prodigy]
"Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned..." "Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned..."
"Wake you up and as I stare in your..."
"Wake you up and as I stare in your..."

[Chorus: Prodigy]
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember P, the one you got your whole style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember me, the one you got your rhyme style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember P, the one you got your rhyme style from?
"Yo it's the P" *cut and scratched*
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, disperse from off this, who the culprits
That claim to be the newest, rappin' bullshit
My rhymes get Ruger endorsements
My song boost Intratec sales through the ceiling
Let's talk with guns, convos 'til the po-lice come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit stuck on some wild out shit, all about it
We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the clique-ah sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin', write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga

[Chorus: Inspektah Deck]
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember me, the one you got the technique from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember me, the one you got your freestyle from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember Deck, I told y'all, Protect Ya Neck

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Fake one, take one, no ultimatum, face one
There's no escape from
Straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver - you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove Bowery suits and purple gloves
Me and you can have some fun, make it a blast
You couldn't take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood, veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war, still tradin' slugs, gettin' major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin' with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone, move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You privatize, home in but can't seem to clone

[Chorus: Big Pun]
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember Pun, the one you bit your whole shit from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember Pun, I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
Remember Pun, the one with over a thousand guns
"You start to suffer" *cut and scratched*

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
Yo, Big Punisher's ready
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB ("Shaolin") and Bronx trilogy
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth, swing on your world's piece
Foil your plans, boil your grams, take your shine
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin', got the nueve right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger
I do it to live niggas and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldn't survive, nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through?
My lyrics practically rose you from the grave like The Crows do
I told you a long time ago, don't ever fuck me
'Cause if I leave you half dead, consider yourself very lucky
Very ugly from the face up, leave you laced up
Joey Krillz, Pros, Cuban Link, Triple Seis, WHAT?!

[Scratches: Roc Raida]
"Soon you start to suffer"
"The RZA"
"The Inspectah Deck"
"Yo it's the P"
"The Punisher's ready"10Embed
