We Donâ€™t Care Lyrics[Cuban Link]
Yeah, the foundation, L.G.P
Latins Goin Platinum baby!
Yeah yeah, yeah..
Uhh, year 2000
Terror Squadians (Terror Squad)
We rock the party and (you won't like me when I'm angry)
(I guarantee you, you won't like me when I'm angry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.. Terror Squadians
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (uhh, yeah)
We rock the party and..
[Verse 1: Cuban Link]
YEAH, I tear the club up, pull up in the Hummer with Pun
My fuckin brother, makin motherfuckers run for cover
The number runner son, I'm nothin but a hustler
Burnin rubber with drugs, stuffed up in the muffler
Shut the fuck up! Bust a slug through your jugular
Plus suckers get fucked up with golf clubs, never front on us
T.S. baby, straight out the B.X. baby
So if they B.S., we deeper than the U.S. Navy
You ain't crazy - laid up in the club like WHAT?
With all the ladies - showin us nothin but LOVE
Guzzlin 80 - proof to truth, straight to the GUT
In a Mercedes - Coupe fucked up doin a BUCK
If Jakes chase me - I'm cuttin off trucks, pressin my LUCK
It's all gravy - puffin the blunt, blazin it UP
Maybe you hate me - cause your baby mom's on my NUTS
She wanna rape me - just because I'm sexy as FUCK
So nigga WHAT?

[Chorus: Big Pun and Cuban Link]
[Pun] Tear the club up!

Yo
I'm livin in madness, given the Spanish props
I got to have it
Loadin and bustin' up mad clips, gettin' up asses
Grabbin' the girls on they asses
Duck when the mac hits or be dead before your body falls
Cause when my shotty roars we ignore Giuliani laws
My trigger got no heart nigga, I'm blowin apart liver
And holdin the Glocks, call to the cops, I'm blowin the spot
Baby better head for the hills, my niggas wild for the night
My lead ready to peel this shit really real
My clip really filled, your chick better chill
My dick fit to kill, we fittin to ill
No survivors, frozen Godivas or roses and flowers
Sour the grapes of those opposin the Squaders
Thrown in the garbage, like funky pajamas
Word to my junkie mama
I'mma keep it funky for homies up in Elmira
You fuckin with scholars, street knowledge
Carter kids stuck to the projects
Go ahead keep checkin that ball
N' me n' Cuban gon' keep doublin our chips
Keep talkin that thug shit like you bored
In a year? when you gonna buck shit?
Whether there's hundreds
And what? this count as more shit
[Chorus: Big Pun and Cuban Link]
[Pun] Tear the club up!
[Link] Cause we don't care
[Pun] E'rybody strip
[Link] Yeah we don't care
[Pun] Shoot the place up!
[Link] Yeah we don't care (nuh-ah)
We don't care (nuh-AH!)
We don't care!! (NAHHHAHH!)
[Link] Yeah we don't care
[Pun] T. Squaders
[Link] Yes, yeah we don't care
[Pun] Fuck you nigga!
[Link] Nah we don't care (nuh-ah)
We don't care (nuh-AH!)
We don't care!! (NAHHHAHH!)
