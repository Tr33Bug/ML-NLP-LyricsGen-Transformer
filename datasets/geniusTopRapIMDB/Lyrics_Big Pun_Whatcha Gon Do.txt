Whatcha Gon Do? LyricsYo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo...

[Verse 1]
It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame
My college terrain was the rugged streets from Harlem to Queens
Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
That started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as a crack
That'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
And start it from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin days
I have left, to the form of flesh
Should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin to persuade, my mind to try to be brave
And not give death the satisfaction of seein me dyin afraid
That's why I rise from the grave singing church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ ba-rum-pum-pum-pum
[Hook x2]
Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes?
Knockin' at ya front door
And he wants waaaaaaaaaaar.. ooooh (holy shit) yeah
He ain't a rapper he'll kill you

[Verse 2]
Till my last breath I'll have death before dishonor
(come on) and welcome drama (yeah)
Wit open arms and a code of honor
My whole persona equals that of gods
Definin' matters hard and more before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to
Fuck it i'll blast you, tell the devil it was Pun if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin' um'
Show 'em my emblem, the tombstone, the throne, every millennium
A child is born that can perform at a level beyond
The expected 4 minute 30 second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in ya dream
Wit the "kill anything" grill, chillin' beside the guillotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get they neck hacked loose in the crowd, move from the aisle
Don't make me have to prove that I'm wild
Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggas shoot in the clouds
(Who's in the house)
Punisher's straight from hell. Who's in the house
(Terror Squad motherfucker we the real)
What's the deal, now you know that's how we roll
Hard core like BO bring in the chorus baby broYou might also like2Embed
