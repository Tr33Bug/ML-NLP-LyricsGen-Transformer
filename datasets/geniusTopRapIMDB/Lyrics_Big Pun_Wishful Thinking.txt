Wishful Thinking Lyrics[Hook]
[Fat Joe] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Kool G Rap] Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
[Big Pun] First I get the money then I get the power
[B-Real] B-Real love to kill, eliminatin' the cops

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Thinkin' of takin' a plane
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle ten pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number one smuggler in the area
Got enough weight to fill up an aircraft carrier
Herb slanger, Hasila Incorporated
State to state and overseas gettin' faded
The Buddha king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of herb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one Chocolate Thai bud
Niggas, let's get high in the sky, hit the blunts
And the bongs fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get to smoke up the crops
I give props for all the soldiers in the war
Yo, what would you do if the world was yours
[Hook]
[Kool G Rap] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Big Pun] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[B-Real] First I get the money then I get the power
[Fat Joe] Joey crack twistin' caps, enemies I devour

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It was only a dream, 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's
Lying pendants with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with a vengeance
Having blocks on in the livest parts dome
My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
Dime droppers will give your fad time if you sleep
But my mistake will be mastering heat on city streets
And in the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the throne like Calderon in this heron arena
Lacin' the china with Menida
This felony repeater will be a leader
Like a preacher but so much deeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nicky Barnes
Come on, I be the top extortionist
Adopt a dozen foster kids right out the motherfuckin' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
All my peeps on the streets know I speak the truth

[Hook]
[Big Pun] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[B-Real] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Fat Joe] First you get the money then you get the power
[Kool G Rap] G Rap bustin' the gats and slangin' last by the hour
You might also like[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
No doubt, I be the crime story of all ghetto territories
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like Glory
With pharmaceutical lavatories
Majored in chemistry, PhD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H₂O with matter from crack batter
Residue molecules scatter
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind brighter than Einstein's for crime
G equals the MC that ain't near the square, son I gets mine
But yo the kill will fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real, you know the deal
If the stakes ain't too high for me to grab it
I gots to have it, stack all the cabbage
From conducting a drug traffic
Police'll chain me and tryna find a new plot to frame me in
They rein me in so I resort to evil thoughts like Damien
Display my fury to the DA and the jury
One hundred grand, the judge's hammer slams, I'm a free man

[Hook]
[B-Real] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Fat Joe] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Kool G Rap] First you get the money then you get the power
[Big Pun] Big Pun's the same son, bustin' my guns for the dollars
[Verse 4: Big Pun]
Yo, I walk on water, spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the gods
Be larger than life, twice as nice as your idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you straight to hell like the Bible
I'm liable to start manipulatin' minds, infiltrate and climb
Out the pitfalls of life, entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I dream I'm in a nightmare
I fiend to live in a world where mothers and queens of men would fight fair
[Fat Joe:] Hell Yea!
I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit, not just the hood
Yo, I'd change my life, make my wife forget the tears from the pain and physical abuse
Give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky to my heart's content
Repent if thou shall be forgiven
How could we be proud to live in a world
Which condemns man, child, and woman?
Child and woman2Embed
