You Ain’t a Killer Lyrics[Verse 1]
The harsh realities of life have taken toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
Take control, I'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
JO's, they lust my flows, but ayo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent
One of the last livin' still-in-action general assassins
Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any TEC, smashin' any chest
Passin' any test; Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up
Shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Joe
We follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and silence your screams
And even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
[Verse 2]
You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table
When I raise the stakes
The pain is great, but only for a second
It starts strong, then lessens
Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (T.S.)
Blessed him with no regrets (yes)
Welcome to Hell, son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze your person
You get laced for certain, leavin' Jakes no trace to work from
Close the case like curtains
I'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothin' more satisfyin'
Than when you cryin', screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name
Bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse
To hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination
You might also like[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

[Verse 3]
It's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
We recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
D's in undercover cars
Takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie
I'll body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition
Properly a stats magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strictly out for cream
Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heaven's kings
Down to the Devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest
[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer...14Embed
