A One Two Lyrics[Verse 1]
A one two, a one two
A one two, a one two
I'd like to introduce myself
My name is Biz Markie
My MC name is Shan
And Shant√©
And TJ Swan
My DJ is Marley Marl
We down with Mr. Magic
My manager's Fly Ty
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And the Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody, uh like this
[Bridge]
Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up

[Verse 2]
What goes up
Must come down
You are amazed
By how I do the sound
I'm, the, human orchestra
My name is the Biz Markie

[Outro]
