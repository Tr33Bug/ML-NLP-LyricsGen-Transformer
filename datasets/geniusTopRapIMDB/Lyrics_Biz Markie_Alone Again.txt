Alone Again LyricsI was on my way, to 125th
I saw this def Benz, yo that's my man Cliff
As I flagged them down, he pulled to the side
At this moment I had to swallow my pride
Cause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift
But it was cold as hell, and my legs was stiff
He said, "Hey Biz, what you want, a ride?"
I said, "Hell yeah," he said, "I can't cause my girl's inside"
So he jetted off, leavin two tracks
Not at one time did homeboy look back
It took me an hour, to get where I was goin
And to top it all off, it had to start snowin
My sneakers was old, and my coat was thin
But my determination kept me goin within
I had nobody to help me as you can SEE..
I'm alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally

So I went into the show, and started maxin
People came up to me, and started askin
Whassup wit me, and when I'm gettin on
And how many records is Shante gonna perform
I don't know, but now I gotta go
Cause Shante is callin me to do the show
First she was on, and then she called me out
I did a lot of funky beats without no doubt
I put the mic on my head, and began to riff
The crowd began to flip, cause I was rockin the shift
When we was done, I started to laugh
Massive people come to me for my autograph
After the funk was over it was time to break
If I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake
As I saw Shante, get into a limo
I had to walk home, I wrote it in my memo

I'm alone again, naturally
All alone again, naturally

Now I'm a-ight, nothin to worry
Wherever I wanna go, I get there in a hurry
That's right I'm big time, very well known
Now I'm sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone
Right about now, I'm gonna explain
It was Cool V, TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane
Doin shows all together, as one group
None of us actin big headed, or souped
Then after that, we all formed a block
I paid everybody, told them how they rocked
They all grabbed they props, and when they seperate
Swan said, "I'll see you later Biz, in a couple of days"
When people see me leave, like a mamma-jamma
It's like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour
But when Vaughn came home, he thought I was in somewhere
With a girl was in bed.. nah..
