Bodyrock Lyrics[Intro]
I had to be the first
'Cause it was me, Rakim and Kane as a crew
Nobody knew I had styles
Know what I mean? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You know it's ill
It's the B-I-Z Markie
With my man Chad Muska
Guaranteed to rock, like-like this
Like-like, like like this
Rock like rock like rock rock like this, y'all
[Verse 2]
I'm the humdinger, the microphone singer
Super bell-ringer, here to bring ya
The rhyme technique-a, the ill funk freak-a
Coming right out of your speakers
Never reaching a peak-a
Perfection direction, in any section
My style is kickin' like Chinese Connection
Most Valuable Poet, thirteen years strong
The island of Long is where I belong
Superb like Goldberg, iller than Godzilla
I scared Michael Jackson into writin' a-Thriller
The ginger ale sipper, the freestyle flipper
Never see me in a pair of Grand Union brown clippers
Funk my juice capone, down when I was bony
One of the funkiest masters of ceremony
Jam, jam, jibbity jam
Let me, let me, let me tell you who I am

[Chorus]
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
You might also like[Verse 3]
Gotta come all night long, well like my rap
Wanna get down, I'll make your hands clap
Every time you see me I'll be doing my thing
I'm Hello Fried King with the disco flow
You know it's satisfaction guaranteed
If you're messing with me, you will bleed
Listen to me cause I'm the
Original B e-e-e-e-e I, Z, M-A-R-K
When it comes after fries, they're like this is what I'll say
I'm like super duper dopin' open
Rock the microphone, you be scopin'
Killing the most, coast-to-coast in ya
I wake up and eat cheese, eggs, and toast
Guaranteed to rock, I don't got no children
I just know that I got to go

[Chorus]
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
New York, you don't stop
L.A., you can't stop
Midwest, you won't stop
(What) Hey, that bodyrock
[Bridge]
I bought a lot of things
You might see me on a lot of things, because
You know a lot of people fell
You know they grab all this stuff and all that
And then gully gully
We had they chew, they chew
I mean, I had a pop hit, "Just A Friend"
But I still stay to the streets
Where a lot of people get, they try to make a
Uh, a bubblegum hit
I ain't make that be a bubblegum hit, you know what I mean?
It just happened to happen (Yeah yeah)
For the next year, you still gonna hear, gonna hear

[Outro]
New York, L.A
Midwest, what, that body rock!1Embed
