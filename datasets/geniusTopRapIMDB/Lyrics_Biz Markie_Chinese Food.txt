Chinese Food Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, you know this is funky
I'd like to say rest in peace, to Aaliyah (sweet thing)
And 'Left Eye' Lopes
But, you know, shout out to my man Bruce Lee
Jackie Chan, check it out, Jet Li

[Verse 1]
I'mma bring it to you like this
Drop a three pointer from the corner like swish
Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap
Shell tops new and Space Invaders cap
Old school like bread and gravy
Me and Monty roll together like Fred and Grady
Ain't nothin' you can say to stop this mad man
Play Defender, Centipede and Ms. Pac-Man
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
In a house with no heat, just kerosene
Call Biz Mark, so you get the better connection
The type to wear Timbs to a wedding reception
I'm so smart I even got a GED
Plus a vide-oh-oh, BET, and MTV
I'm the best thing out now go ask your moms
Spendin' money on cars just to pass the time
[Hook]
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good
(Egg foo yung)
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice, that's good
(Fried one time)
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good
(Mix it, mix it up nice)
I need a coupe of egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good

[Verse 2]
I'm the Uptown rhymer, large like Big Momma
Keep three girls on the couch like "Oh Drama"
End every line with period, no comma
Hidin' out 'til I'm found like Osama
Walk on water, filled with pirahnas
Want the tie within coats with no liner
If I ever lose my girl, I go find her
If not, I got Shirl' and Tawanna
Right back on ya, yep the old timer
Any contract you got, I no sign-a
Don't smoke or use drugs, of no kind-a
Everything that I wear, is de-signer
Just like Dolce, hang with Gabbana
Biz Mark play his part, the show timer
Make any party hot like your sauna
Still keep the crowd controlled with no drama

[Verse 3]
It's the Mmah, Zah-aYYAH, Rrah, Zah-KaYYAH
When Guiliani leave I will be the Mayor
In the year two-thou', I'm gonna house
I'm still tryin to look up a girl's blouse
Got a Hummer for the summer, Benz for my girlfriend
When it comes to ice, I got a lot of diamonds
I'm hangin at the Rucker, watchin skip-to-my-loo
Girls askin me to do the {*puh, ah one-two*}
Weather is good, about eighty degrees
My X-Ray vision seein thongs and G's
Thankin the Lord for the beautiful day
I seen people sippin' on Tanqueray
Everything's the same in the new millen'
Seattle is where they got a Hip-Hop Museum
So listen to the way I rock the spot
Right about now I'mma make you hot
