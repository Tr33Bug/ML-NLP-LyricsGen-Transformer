D.P. Lyrics[INTRO: Cool V]
Uh
As we take you Uptown
Downtown
We got a little somethin for the ladies
Biz, break it down

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Once again it's Mr. Diabolical
Who have you pullin your hair out by the follicle
My posse's so deep, it could fill a bus
But this is for the dimes lookin good to us

And to that girl I met when I was in Texas
Got a name like a god - Alexis
