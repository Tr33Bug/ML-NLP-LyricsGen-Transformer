So come on Diabolical
Don't stop and don't you dare quit
Just get on the mic, sit on the mic
Spit on the mic and don't you dare quit!

[Biz Markie]
When I get on the mic, I guarantee
There's no better MC than Biz Markie
Everything I say, or anything I do
Will move yo' posse or your crew
When you me hear me say, and what I play
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
Well I'm too cold to freeze, too hot to burn
And I never miss a tag when it's my turn
Cause I can, rock the mic if you give me a chance
Cool V'll cut the record, make you do the 'Biz Dance'
I can - flip the crowd with a wave of my hand
I'm the Diabolical, "And you know this MAAAAAAN!"

[Hook]
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone

I'm the court jester, the manifester
I used to buy my clothes at A.J. Lester's
The rhymerator, the beat creator
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The dime repeater, the MC greeter
Knuckle bleeder, no need for a heater
The only MC in history
Who didn't even have to R-A-P
The bum destroyer, I'm comin for ya
Got took to court and didn't need a lawyer
Make James Brown get down (yeah yeah)
Made Beretta go get her (yeah yeah)
Made Laverne and Bill Cosby (yeah yeah)
Go change they sweaters (yeah yeah)
I fought Mike Tyson, dropped him in 4
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
"And this is somethin for the radi-ohhhh"

[Hook]

[Biz Markie]
Got ladies screamin STRANJE STRANJE
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex, I'd be a porno star
With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois
Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris, "I gotta go - gotta go!"
[Hook] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Sung ad libs before a quick fadeout]Embed
