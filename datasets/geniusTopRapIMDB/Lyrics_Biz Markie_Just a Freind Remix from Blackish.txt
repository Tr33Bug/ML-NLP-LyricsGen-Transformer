Just a Freind (Remix from Black-ish) Lyrics[Intro]
I'm on it
I just love co-ed baby showers

[Chrous]
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse]
I got friends and that's a fact
Like Zoe, Junior, Diane, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build upYou might also likeEmbed
