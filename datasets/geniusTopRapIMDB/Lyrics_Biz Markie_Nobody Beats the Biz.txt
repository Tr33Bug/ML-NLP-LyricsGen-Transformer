Nobody Beats the Biz Lyrics[Scratches & Samples]
"He's Biz Markie"
"The star of the show"
"He's Biz Markie"
"Hardworking"
"He's Biz Markie"
"Mr. Dynamite"
"He's Biz Markie"
"Mr. Dynamite"
"So fresh"
[Verse 1]
Yes, y'all and, to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and, what I am displaying
A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rocking parties I am a nympho
Maniac, brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and
You won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying
Down, with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I but the E
I came to have fun and, not be number one and
Just here to let you know, who's like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that...

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)

You know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and
I go for what I know doing a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toe-tapper always having fun
And when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I don't be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the Worldâ€™s Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking 'bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet
But you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing
That I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing
Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment
That's why...

[Verse 3]
On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail, before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like make you co-op-
-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give 'em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap

[Hook: TJ Swan]
