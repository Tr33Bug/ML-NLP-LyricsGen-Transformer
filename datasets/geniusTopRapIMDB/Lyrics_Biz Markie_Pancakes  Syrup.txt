Pancakes & Syrup Lyrics[Intro]
It's breakfast time!

[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time

[Verse 1]
Y'all know me, it's Biz with the beats
Guaranteed to rock out just like the E
Leave the M-A-R-K-I-E
Ain't no other MC say it like me
Every time I rock from here to Europe
You know I be makin' pancakes an syrup
Yup, uh-huh, I rub my tummy, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yummy
[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time

[Verse 2]
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, eat 'em up
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, yum, yum, eat 'em up, eat 'em up
Yum, pancakes, pancakes, syrup
Yum, yum, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up
Yum, pancakes, pancakes, syrup, eat 'em up

[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
