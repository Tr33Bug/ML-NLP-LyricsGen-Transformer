The Dragon Lyrics[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Now this is a difficult subject
About something that's crazy - oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing I'm talking about is an essence
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance

It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talking
It will be so close, you think it's hawking
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and
Everybody know what I'm saying
From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm saying
About the dragon

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventing this
Check your hygiene and your dentist
You might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness

But if you think I'm misguiding you
By saying there's something inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
And your reactions to it is: "pee you!"
You're sitting there baffled and puzzled
Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzled

But if you listen to me
The diabolical energetical B
The I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E
I'm tryina give you H-E-L-P
You might also likeSo I'ma end it off like this
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
His secret telling rumors, his right guard went left
And his band was playing a song that was funky to def
He was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
A sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with Sensurround
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was trying to diss him
I started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging
I said, "Yo Tock, you got the dragon!"1Embed
