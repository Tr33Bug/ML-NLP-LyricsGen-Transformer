This is Something for the Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is another hit from Biz Markie
Dedicated to the radio, not he or she
Be-cause it's time for them to get recognized
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
That's why I'm comin out my face like this
Far as negativity, you never get dissed
If it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

[Verse 2]
This rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's
That play all the hits on seven days
And even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin'
Without a doubt because everyone is unique-and
The way they cut the records, and be talkin
It sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman
To all the disc jockey's that's on the go
This is something for the radiohhhh
{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of "for the radio" randomly*}

Now I'ma kick it like this

[Verse 3]
I'd like to thank all the people state to state
For requestin' my records on the radio great-ly
Appreciate what you've done for me
And my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C
Straight up, I make the music just for you
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
As long as you're in good phy-sical health
Because you're the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
Like puttin' some salt and pepper and butter on grits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
'Cause they're the ones, the jam selectors
A couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player
On the radio I thought to myself sayin
If I ever get the chance to playin my stuff
I'm gonna make everything extra tough
'Cause radio will last to infinity
As long as my name is the B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say
Number one entertainment form in the like U.S.A
'Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

[Verse 4]
This is the conclusion of just the beginnin'
Of hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin'
Story and fightin', just to get the right and
Have our respect on a station that's excitin'
In about two years, I will be a superstar
Be able to buy anything I want, even a car
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

Yo I'd just like to say it like this
