American Heartbreak Lyrics[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah, America the ugly
This country is deep to say the least
Ask from Louisville  Kentucky, to LA to the East
Where the race been on, but recently I been makin' peace
With the fact that Black bodies are worth more if they’re deceased
Or trapped in a nine-by-twelve, awaitin' our release
Not takin' it upon ourselves to break away and teach
The next new crop before they face the next few cops
’Cause a traffic stop at night alone could get you pop
Nina Simone said, "What's the matter with you? Rock?
Is it my hip-hop? Hey, what's the matter with 2Pac?"
We will finish the journey from Mecca to pilgrimage
Build bridges over burial grounds, they filled with us
I grimaced upon a photo I found
A still image of a friend who said to lean on Him, like Bill Withers
I wish he was still with us
They issue moratoriums on the truth and label us 'revisionist historians'
Changin' the point of origin in all the events
Any prince with some kind of sense is all they're against
For generations, they ain't shown us that the American modus operandi
The holders, control us, and try to fold us
But, yo, watch your body
[Chorus: Ledisi & Black Thought]
Oh, America
Not gon’ bring me down today
Don’t wanna see another American heartbreak
Oh, you can't keep me down
Oh, America
Yeah, watch your body for me
I wasn’t built to breathe
I won't be another American heartbreak
My soul you won't take
You can't keep me down

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The beast brand is strong
To each man, his own
For every Tameka Mallory in the cold hand o’ Jones
Get up like Jayla Rose so they don't stand alone
Leaders understand the code
Pawns do what they suppose
In part, this heart of stone
Is for you to make it home
If I perish when you grown
I want you to take the throne
But when drivin', you a target
Don't be talkin' on the phone
You a alien, you might as well be walkin' on the moon
When you walk into a room
Never shrink so you can fit in
Your beauty and your brilliance ain't built to keep it hidden
Your path, more like division of Richard Wright
Was written too long ago to give him too strong to be forbidden
So whether saint or sinner, here's the tenor like Kamasi
I'm from the kinda posse that's down with Ta-Nehisi
Clowns could try to box me, the hate can never stop me
I'm a product of American heartbreak but watch me
I'm still a problem, liftin' my wings
Despite the system that vilified the victim, I'm still alive and kickin'
I'ma striver, a survivor, a husband and a father from the bloodline o' kings
I move different than ya, watch ya body
You might also like[Chorus: Ledisi & Black Thought]
Oh, America
Not gon' bring me down today
Don't wanna see another American heartbreak
Oh, you can't keep me down
Oh, America
Yeah, watch your body for me
I wasn't built to breathe
I won't be another American heartbreak
My soul you won't take
You can't keep me down

[Outro: Ledisi]
Built to last strong
Nothin' gon' hold me down, no
Power, yeah, that Black power
That's how I keep holdin' on, yeah
I'm holdin' on (Holdin' on, yeah)
Holdin' on, yeah
I'm holdin', I'm holdin' strong
Holdin', holdin', I'm holdin' on
Can't nobody bring me down
I'm holdin' (Stronger)
'Cause I've got that power (I've got that Black power)
Yeah, yeah (Built to last)
I'm built to last, ooh
My, my, my, my, myEmbed
