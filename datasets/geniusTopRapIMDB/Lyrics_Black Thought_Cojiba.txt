Cojiba Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was 25, and she was like 20
A stolen moment in time was paradise to me
She used to keep it shakin' like a pair of dice for me
Never needed to question what she sacrificed for me
She was caramel complected, with a body like heaven
How many years was we together, probably like seven
That Ethio Eritria Somali type lovin'
Shoulda knew I would never find somebody like—
Look on one Friday night session, a minor indiscretion
Almost had me like what Usher sing 'bout in "True Confession"
I was wishin' I could go back, make a minor adjustment
But I knew that kind of throwback simply out of the question
I knew love's not possession, wish I'd gotten a message
Instead of blocking my blessing, now it's gotten depressing
I gotta stop and address it, I ain't tryna stress it
If I could get you back, I learned a valuable lesson
Love
[Verse 2]
Had me thinkin' like
Ayo, lightning is hard to capture twice
When I was in my bachelor life and I was mad at life
Thinking I could see serious rewards without the sacrifice
I survived on beer and bad advice before I had a wife
I remember, knew a Tanzanian Zanzibar Swahili girl
The day we met, it was something from a Fellini film
She passed my table at brunch and made my Bellini spill
Then grabbed a napkin, I seen her arm was graffiti filled
I said I like your sleeve, she said I love your music
So much that sometimes it choke me up, I gotta fight to breathe
Don't judge me like a book's cover because looks might deceive
But if you'd like to sit and talk a while I'd like to leave
I told her you need not repeat yourself as bad as you are
We left and walked and talked 'bout everything that matter to her
Like foreign policy, race gender equality, climate change
Fashion, arts, the global economy
'Bout how the key part of a relationship is honesty and
How her virtue was hard is something she can promise me, well
I said I dig the fact you woke and you keep it a hundo
But rushin' in like fools do is something I've never done so
Since time is of the essence, if I enjoy your presence
Over time I might be so inclined to let have some lessons
I see it different 'cause my frequency is different
You can't be under wing unless you equally as gifted
That's yet to be determined, the jury's still pending
What's the use of pretending, it could be a happen ending when I—
