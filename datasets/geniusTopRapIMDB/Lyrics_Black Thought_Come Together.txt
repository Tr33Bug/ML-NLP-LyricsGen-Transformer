Come Together Lyrics[Intro: Malcolm X]
Of being in complete unity with each other, harmony with each other. And not letting the man maneuver us in fighting one another. Long as we practice brotherhood among ourselves and then others who want to practice brotherhood with us, we're for that. But I don't think that we should run around trying to love somebody who doesn't love us

[Hook]
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I was, uh, too young to care when my father died
I had to put one in the air when my mama died
Both victims of completely different homicides
It makes me wonder sometimes, damn, how I'ma die
I can't shake these memories, I'm haunted by
If it bring a tear to your eye then I apologize
When every child is born another shot is fired
How many hours is left before the clock expire?
I'm bothered by it, and placing the bricks instead of sound
Wondering how to move a nation of millions
Because they ain't felt the bass in a minute
Every minute hip hop is ever so patiently waiting to get it
Take a look into the sky and see 'em scraping the buildings
Or look into the mirror, see the face of resilience
My heart and frustrations is in it, when I spit it it's vintage
So molded into my own image, yeah
[Hook]
Come together
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
(Move a nation of millions, it ain't hard to tell)
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
(Move a nation of millions, it ain't hard to tell)
One thing, one thing I can tell you is you got to be free
(Move a nation of millions, it ain't hard to tell)
One thing I can te-te-tell you is you got to be free
(Move a nation of millions)
Come together right now
(Bri-bri-bridging the gap, yeah)
Come together right now
(Bri-bri-bridging the gap, yeah)
Come together right now
(Bri-bri-bridging the gap, yeah)
Come together right now
(Bri-bri-bridging the gap, yeah)

[Verse 2: Zumbi]
Uh, a sick cycle where we living revolved
Like we're one step away from forever sleeping tomorrow
Fighting for pieces of hog, my [?] is scarred
Hard to be godbody, niggas body your squad
Go against all laws, turn up the pressure from the neck up
It ain't all good, the hood really need a checkup
The blood and the veins, it seems it long ago changed
All addicted to riches, fame is a cold game
Dopeboys and rappers, that's the role models
My soul feel hollow, there is no tomorrow
We need to come together like X and King
'Fore we live another day all vexed in [?]
I got a sixth sense, homie, 'cause I'm blessed with this
Roots crew and Zion I Official messengers
But when the stress it get too much it might bust
Put the pain down, player, get together with us, yeah
