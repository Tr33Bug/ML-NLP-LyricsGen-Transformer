Conception Lyrics[Chorus: Reek Ruffin]
Where I go, where I go from here?
Oh I, know I, could be nowhere
And trust that all that money's good for nothin’ if you scared
Singin', yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Look
I am no fashion model but
I got fresh for photographers
The camo coat had the collar up
'Cause my emotions was bottled up
And though the ocean did not erupt
It turned up ’til it's loud enough
To just make somethin' out of us
Pass the shadow of a doubt in us
Godly, geometry and calculus
That I can move any mountain with
A nigga gotta be an alchemist
Tryna create another avenue of revenue
Or several because I'm in love with havin' you
Security is just a whole 'nother animal
I can't assume Xanadu had a panic room
I wish the man in the moon had a manual
And gratitude for the wishes I granted you
A lifetime, finally I'm understandin’ you
The lifelines that delines in a hand or two
And how it’s difficult to undo the damage you've done
Once the codes run under the scanner too
So if you capture the flame and it’s painful
You just charge that to the game
'Cause it's shameful to just fall back and complain
That you fractured the laws of attraction again
Focus on a more passionate plane
No conception's immaculate, man
[Chorus: Reek Ruffin]
Where I go, where I go from here?
Oh I, know I, could be nowhere
And trust that all that money’s good for nothin' if you scared
Singin', yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Once again to the well, I went
While the soul man screamed bloody hell out there
I'm tryna decode the meaning of the spell I'm in
And I don't even know what fucking hotel I'm in
I checked in as the monarch of mel-a-nin
The el-a-phant, my body is a shell I'm in
Piecin' myself together, teachin' myself to never
Let one loss divorce my devel-op-ment
Reminds me of Ego Trippin' like Nikki Giovanni
Wishin' the system might deliver me a body
Cum laude, the rug on the floor was from Saudi
The message I'd hung on the door was unrowdy
No dowry, the price of it all was one cowrie
Now we the last flophouse on The Bowery
Human traffickin', moving Africans
Still grappling with fantasies, fill the bracket in
And if you capture the flame, and it's painful
Then just charge that to the game
'Cause it's shameful to just fall back and complain
That you fractured the laws of attraction, again
Focus on a more passionate plane
Estimate a more accurate frame
Of time, a frame of mind attached to the sane
No conception's immaculate, man

Where I go, where I go from here?
Oh I, know I, could be nowhere
And trust that all that money's good for nothin' if you scared
Singin', yeah, yeah
Where I go, where I go from here?
Oh I, know I, could be nowhere
And trust that all that money's good for nothin' if you scared
Singin', yeah, yeah3Embed
