Good Morning Lyrics[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Yeah (Grind easy, bitches)
Hey, good morning (Woo)
Hey, oh, good morning (Woo)
Yeah, ayy (Good morning)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm from the home of the ghosts-es, water plugs and wokeness
Water bugs and roaches, drugs and overdoses
How you approach this? Philly is where the dope is
My uncles Reds and Willie is still the goldsmiths
Hold shit steady, we're close-knit and deadly as a heart attack
Trust me, the pitbulls is petty
Already infamous, limitless, Getty Images (Woo)
Foul temperament, you start shit, we endin' it (Woo)
It's mad last wishes, gas mask kisses (Oh)
The thin line between savants and savages (Oh)
Your life could depend on the laws of averages
The difference between Black and white is mad privilege (Fuck that shit)
For Lucifer, son of the morning
Who swore we'd ignored every one of them warnings
But try to run for cover under one of them awnings
'Cause here the storm come
Tell the Lord time for His encore performance
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Good morning (Woo)
Hey, oh, good morning
Yeah, ayy (Good morning)
(Good morning)
Fuck that shit (Hey, hey)
On the wakeup
Dreaming every day of tryna get my cake up
Yeah

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I got four million in homes, three hours apart
Drug dealer tastes, I think I glow in the dark
I only do features to keep hittin' my mark
And show you motherfuckers you ain't good as you thought (I am), let's go
Panamera shopping in the pandemic
The work got grill lines when the pan's searing
Give you the whole clip to let your mans hear it (Oh)
Them pallbearer next to them so they can all fear it (Oh)
Ulterior motives with the modus
Bulletproof package like I'm POTUS
I'm just cashing in on what they owe us
They say the coming winter is the coldest
Celine fur hangin' off the shoulder (Woo)
What's worse, the gift or the curse? (Hey)
The only way to celebrate a death is with a birth
That Maybach sink can be converted to a hearse
I mean every word, why you think it's just a verse? (Oh)
I'm gone

Hey, good morning (Woo)
Hey, oh, good morning (Woo)
Yeah, ayy (Good morning)
(Hold on)

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Just as soon as the sun rise, the night dies
You was building pyramids and African empires
Where pale-skin savages with straight hair and light eyes
Was still eatin' raw meat and barely could light fires
Before we ever sold cocaine, we civilized Spain
You are not the first Black man in the Mediterrane'
Shit, you lying to impress, you is just insane
I look at you with the disdain of an old shit stain
How you product of a God and you worship a man?
I was God in the flesh before I drove a Mulsanne
Five keys of gold sittin' on my neck in the frame
Surrounded by Black women, West African king
And I'm gonna go to Ghana to reclaim my name
While these chump rappers rap about the shit they cop
Man, I cop my block, and this shit don't stop
I'm the official, unofficial mayor of my city
Learned my lesson from the crack trappin' school of high thoughts
Push the D like Pusha T and kept my mind Black Thought
Michael Render is the ender, what the fuck you thought?
Michael Render, he the ender, what the fuck you thought?
God
[Outro]
(Haha)
Ayo, it's the blues, I don't know if the Crips even use it
Something 'bout your whole album is crib-cleaning music6Embed
