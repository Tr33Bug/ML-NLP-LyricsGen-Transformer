Hip Hop Nation Sirius XM Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uh, 215, yeah aight listen:
Up steps the one and only in the flesh
Senegalese, Sierra Leonian fresh to death
Big homie and them reps the best
Knew you knew me from somewhere
I get wrecked with Questlover
The brother get it on, bring a song
More brutal than Genghis Khan
Whose name ring alarms to fakes
You couldn't place but know I'm the truth
That's before you recognize it's the one from The Roots
Armed to the tooth, trying got take an eye for another eye
I'm from "we hear gunfire for a lullaby"
Yo forget it, who the hell am I?
Yo I'm the reason these MC's lives became nullified
The stuff of legend, so tell me what's tougher brethren
Well I'm the blast form the past that started the present
Vision of the future: me and the super producer
And I'm ten times as smart as I'm used to being
I'm still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters, Jimmy Choo sneakers
Real rap remedy man, a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if it's any last word
Besides "what", "when", "why" and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy, rabbit ears
Cause damn right it's on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment of time, you will be out of here
Scrap, get slapped for acting so cavalier
I'm from Philly and them cabbers don't travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there
They don't battle there
Itching to leave you in the pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help, but that's light help
Cause the bullets make flak melt
Then just imagine what it'd do to you, even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a gat held
On a block where there used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold, this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals, left a broken mold
Setting sights on the open road
I hit them anywhere and everywhere the realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on the honor role
That mean, whenever speaking my name
Begin that with "The Honorable"
T-A-R one I like a monocle
I bring the riot to a laugh, cause you comical
Look, get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
I'm psychological, jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa, if I don't work, then I won't eat
No, I don't Facebook, but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like it's a goatee
I'm kinda like a cellar door, lowkey
I used to mix bottles of champagne with OE
I'm Aristotle, I can't fail, I'm OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Ayo they got me on the pedestal, trophy
Got them singing "Damn 'Riq cheating like adultery!"
Sycamore, sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky, I'm on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is borderline robbery
And that's what it is, i'm jimbrowski
Certain circles call me the Big Lebowski
It would behoove you to find out about me
[Outro]

Agh, ahhhh [claps] Whoa hohoho
You whack rappers better step your game up!
Wow, give it up for Black Thought, one of the greatest of all time!
Man, man, man, man! Man dude...
I don't know if any dude got anymore lyrics than this dude right here
The Roots are here, we celebrating the release of their new album "...and then you shoot your cousin"You might also like2Embed
