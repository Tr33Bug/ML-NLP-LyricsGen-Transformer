History Unfolds Lyrics[Intro]
Ayo

[Verse]
I been pennin' the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey"
A premonition I really had, it was prophecy
Back in the kitchen, now where we at is monopoly
The mathematician, I entered the system properly
This officially a Philly jawn, once again, it's on
I was born ringing alarms like Tenor Saw
My track record is what I ain't got a blemish on
Unless I remember wrong
Well, either way I'm 'bout to finish strong
Redemption songs of a Genghis Khan
Revenge is sworn later on, though the gang is called
You hit the nail on the head, bro, we don't bang with y'all
Your team different, we don't move with the same decorum
What I reflect is still a real feel temperature
Symptoms show I'm physically ill and still emperor
Track whisperer, carbon-colored conquistador
Kiss the jawns and make 'em cry, it's not difficult
Woah, a lot of rappers is rollin' in fear of Trotter
They far from rock solid, they soldiers, Terracotta
Of my philosophy, I'm the father like Aristotle
I will put a end to your whole saga, you Harry Potters is soft
Your rhymes E-M-O, mines is non-G-M-O
I'm a vessel, a vehicle, y'all don't see it, though
I'm comin' for the riches you stole like King Leopold
And keep the whole world on watch while history unfolds
[Outro]
