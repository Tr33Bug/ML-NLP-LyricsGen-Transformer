Iâ€™m Not Crazy (Outro) Lyrics[Verse]

So 'til that day we expire and turn to vapors

Bia, Tarik and them'll finally be safer
I lay it all on the line, find me a taker
If any man is an island, I'll be probably Jamaica

A man called Portugal got with the oracle
We move from metaphorical to historical
