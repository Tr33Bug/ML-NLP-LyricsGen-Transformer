Nature of the Beast Lyrics[Intro: Black Thought]
Like sheep to the slaughter
Everybody's caught up tryin' to find
Something to be a part of
Livin' with our guards up all the time
Forever with a wall up
And breaking through it all never crossed the mind
The world seems smaller
And greatness is withering on the vine

[Pre-Chorus: Black Thought, John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Won't anybody take the lead?
It's ourselves we love the least
Everyone seems make believe
That's the nature of the beast
[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say, kid?
Everything ain't what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Ay, all I wanted was to be more poppin' and to see more profit
What's the detour options, ayy?
I feel like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, less Denzel Washington
When people are watching me
If the right amount of likes and follows can make me less hollow
I'd somehow be more complete
But people tend to be more toxic so we see more gossip
And there's tension on the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Black Thought, John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Won't anybody take the lead?
It's ourselves we love the least
Everyone seems make believe
That's the nature of the beast

Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say, kid?
Everything ain't what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit

[Bridge: Black Thought]
Everybody’s caught up trying to find
Living with our guards up all the time
And breaking through it all never crossed our minds
And greatness is withering on the vine

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say, kid?
Everything ain't what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are, we are, going through the same thing
Going through the same shit1Embed
