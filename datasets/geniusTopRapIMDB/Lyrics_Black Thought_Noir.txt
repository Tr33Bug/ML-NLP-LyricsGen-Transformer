Noir Lyrics[Verse 1]
A young inmate who knew his fate was truly great
Had to escape from the chains that brought him to the States
To save face he made more than a few mistakes
While back-tracing his roots like Henry Louis Gates
Respectfully, the trajectory, he remained in it
He tried to walk on water instead of wade in it
He went from cradle to grave, he's been a king of the slaves
The menagerie of America, he was made in it
Instead of waiting for Superman, his people had a plan
They were sticking it to the man whose energy was spent like solid gold
Uberman
'cause everything he did came back like a boomerang
A ruler without a throne, the ruins are not of Rome
Intruder without a home, a heart made out of stone
A blade made out of bone, the skin of a copper tone
A loner but not alone, the child that's got his own

[Verse 2]
The wave took some time to catch on
The spade was grey, he wasn't afraid to press on
Neither was his child because he embraced the weapon
That aimed at the same prize, his eyes were kept on
Surviving on soup kitchens, bread lines and newspaper clippings
When he was in the headlines for being degradated
Segregated and red-lined
For blue-collar crimes that could've got him fed time
Where funds is critical and sons is killable
That unfulfillable 40 acres, untillable
To make it in general would've taken a miracle
I pray for the Earth the day the meek will inherit you
A singer that says a Joyce but couldn't lift every voice
Deciding your life and death is making a heavy choice
Lifting a heavy weigh with so much hella hate
That every day I await is a reason to celebrate
N-O-I-R
