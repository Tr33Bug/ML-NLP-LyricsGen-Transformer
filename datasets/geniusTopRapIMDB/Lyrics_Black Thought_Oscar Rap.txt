Oscar Rap LyricsI'm hip hop like gazelles in a kango
They say I'm so off the chain like Django
I'm on a mission like Argo, I'm not insane though
I pick my movie tickets up at Fandango
To see Les Miserables with Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway
Them Beasts of the Southern Wild with Quvenzhan√©
I'm thinking one of the best was Lincoln starring Daniel Day
But then again the Life of Pi is definetely a candidate
What's that movie with De Niro? Hardly talked dirty
The Silver Linings Playbook or Zero Dark Thirty?
Even that chick flick Amour is still award worthy
The Oscars is airing live, I'd hit record earlyYou might also likeEmbed
