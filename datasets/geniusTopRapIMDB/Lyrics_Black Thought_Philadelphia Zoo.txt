Philadelphia Zoo Lyrics[Verse: Black Thought]
I'm from the Jam Boys army, Riq Gees
And I never been took'en out
I grill emcees like I'm cooking out
I'm like a south philly crack house in the eighties
I'm robbing them blind, crippled and crazy
I keep the whole industry scared and taken
All types of medicine, move on up like a Jefferson
And get yours, I keep raw shit in orbit
My game like the preacher on the pulpit
The killer culprit is back, that make you shake
Your necks will break, it's P-A state
Cheese steaks and tasty cakes
I lace this style, I mastered in
Niggas thinking fast, I'm far more faster than
I'm on that thing, you couldn't even hang with nooses
Fuck around and get stomped toothless
We in your face, Jam Boys in the place, baby
Niggas learning the way the tables turning right now
True emcees out the from out the Illadelph-bow!
Ch-ch-ch-ch mad styles, and that's word
I take ya'll herbs to the death
You better keep quiet as kept
Quit huffing and puffing, I let you know a whole blood clot lot
The J-B's in the spot, a lot of emcees came to my show down
Now I'm about to put your fucking ass, low down
As you can go, so slow your roll
Without a doubt, I never been taken out by a nigga who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga who couldn't figure
Listen, any nigga who wanna get too close
We the utmost, Jam Boys' tracks will attack any rap host
Introducing... Yo, fuck that niggas' name
Jam Boys far too complex, stop playin'
And when it rain, it pours
We the money making boys
Porn, Slim, North and Raw
The talent that I got will will riz-ock the spot
I been in it for a minute, but if ya'll forgot
Then whoa, oh-ho ---let me slow up with that flow
Cause' if I move too quick, you might not know
How I'm homicidal when it comes to the hard shit
Two-fifteen roll on the scene, you a target
They get taken out quick, cause' I done had it my nigga
You can suck my dickYou might also likeEmbed
