Play Game Lyrics[Intro]
Pl—pl—play—pl—play game
Pl—pl—play—pl—play game

[Verse]
Walk through Times Square, and what do ya see?
Ugliness where architecture used to be
Glamor and style are replaced by gaud
Like the sixty-dollar spectacle, it's all a fraud

That's the play game (That's the play game)
So why do I want to play the play game?
That's the play game (That's the play game)
I must be insane to play the play game
Even off-Broadway, it's no guarantee
That some MBA won't decide what you see
Just like America, lackin' innovation
Just gettin' by on glitz and reputation
Just like Amеrica, on the decline
Unconcеrned with the product, just the bottom line
Write for the movies, write for TV
So what if it's crap? At least you won't write for free
Make thousands of dollars for a first draft
Your life won't depend on whether Frank Rich laughed
So just forget Shakespeare, Beckett, Molière

[Outro]
That's the play game (That's the play game)
That's the play game (That's the play game)
That's the play game
Why do I care? (Play game, play game, play game)You might also likeEmbed
