Quiet Trip Lyrics[Chorus: Portugal. The Man]
Oh my, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come on watch the garden grow
I'll see you when you get there

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uh, alright, yeah, two fifteen, yo
Downtown for the win, woah
Sean C for the tempo, Portugal for the intro
This is Arctical Don Disco from the one choir
Calling shots like an umpire
Where I live, yo, man, I done lost mad kinfolk
Over gunfire through the window
As a young squire who become Sire
I had no way to tell what I was in for
I was 5'9" like Royce with the giant voice like Mikе Winslow
Never been quite likе them so I'm on my own time
Mind darker than a coal mine
Thoughts deeper than a gold mine
So I'm out here slangin' on this blade
Hopin' that I don't get cut by these police
Makin' raids on those of us who know what's up
My lil' homies, my lil' sons
Got them keys and they got them drums
Making superstitious runs on them insufficient funds
No more rules in this here shit, toddlers packin' a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber?
See you with that heater, you sweeter than peach cobbler
If it ain't about that paper, then man that ain't what Reek habla
Man, you know what's goin', they say, "Woke about that dope"
Ask them fiends about them keys, 'bout that coke, 'bout that smoke
Two fifteen my city, man, and we it from 'round here
If it's crazy where you at then, it ain't no different 'round here
[Chorus: Portugal. The Man & The Last Artful, Dodgr]
Oh my, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know (We all got away from you)
Come on watch the garden grow (We all got away from you)
I'll see you when you get there
Oh my, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know (We all got away from you)
Come on watch the garden grow (We all got away from you)
I'll see you when you get there

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, reminiscin' over old times, sip a little bit of Oban
When the wind blow like a land mine, balled up fist now
Who the fuck's this calling on the landline?
Back back like a hair line, I don't really want the air time
I don't wanna smile for the camera, damn, I just wanna see my fam rise
I can feel when a man lies, tryin' to grow old and wise
And I'm still fly like airlines, stay sharp like samurais
Dip low like Cam'ron, Big Show when it's slam time
Word to my nigga Anton
Bogarting through this door
Hopin' that it don't get shut
By these police makin' raids on those of us who know what's up
My lil' uzi weighs a ton, man, I truly ain't the one
My lil' junior straight from juvie, make a movie gangster run
Y'all confusin' this here shit with some television drama
None of y'all lil' mamas touching Mr. Trotter
Even with that heater, you sweeter than peach cobbler
Real ones out here winnin', you swimmin' in deep agua
Click, pow, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Been down with the get down
You ain't sayin' shit, sit down
This loud, twenty one pound, my town
Man, we it from 'round here
If they 'bout it where you from, then it ain't no different down here, listen

Oh my, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know (We all got away from you)
Come on watch the garden grow (We all got away from you)
I'll see you when you get there
Oh my, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know (We all got away from you)
Come on watch the garden grow (We all got away from you)
I'll see you when you get there

[Outro]
Yeah? Alright, I'll come home
At the end of the day, everybody got good and bad
In every culture, in every race
But you also gotta remember where your people at
'Cause you always should want to love your people unconditionally no matter what​1Embed
