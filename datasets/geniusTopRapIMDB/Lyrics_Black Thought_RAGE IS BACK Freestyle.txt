RAGE IS BACK [Freestyle] Lyrics[Produced by J. Period]

[Verse]
Don't even ask how the high feel
Ask how do I feel, probably how the sky feel
Jokers is coming in sideways like a sidefill
The grapes of wrath intertwined like a vine still
Physically I'm ill, walking through a minefield
With a straw sticking out a Molotov cocktail
Twenty one grams of soul on a rock scale
Probably burn like flaming coals on a hot grill
Yo, if the afterlife is absolutely not real
Then you diminish and you're finished, it's a done deal
Beyond that, my heartbeat is like a drum still
It's like I'm living on the run with the gun still
Well, bring the hero back, he's taking care of that
Cause his words get at the Ginsbergs and Kerouacs
It's all stuck inside your head like it's ear wax
Whole scene something out of Hollywood, Miramax
Hush, yo, don't nobody say a flocking word
Just put the sign on the door, the Do Not Disturb
I'm bout to show these people how to kill a mockingbird
You hit his whole network, like Mark Zuckerberg
Your witnesses confirm that gunshots occurred
Apparently the triggerman smokes lots of herb
And he could bring your demise disguised as a word
But guarantee that be the last one you ever heard
You deaf, dumb, and blind
I'm emphasized like I'm underlined
My definition is, I'm undefined
Cause I'm one of a kind, at the top of the line
At the top of the food chain when it come to the rhyme
And I'm cynical cause I'm at the pinnacle
Jokers is ridiculous, they the ones I ridicule
If somebody acting like they want it, I'mma get at dude
Have 'em in the middle of the drama like an interlude
Yeah, they weigh a buck ten, soaking wet, fuck them
Yo, I don't need new friends, I can't trust them
You best keep a weapon like a shirt tail, tucked in
Because I'm taking niggas out like Huck Finn
This news just in: mass destruction, boy
Presented to you by Black Inc. productions
Yeah, righteous hustling, trife corruption
Look how these OGs with the mics is muscling
I fight for justice, but minus the red cape
Dollar short, year late, suckers is scared straight
They know I'm hotter than a box where the bread bake
And brought J. Period to cut through the red tapeYou might also like9Embed
