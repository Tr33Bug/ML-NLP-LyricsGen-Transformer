Rest in Power Lyrics[Intro: Dispatcher + George Zimmerman]
Sanford Police Department
There's a real suspicious guy, he's up to no good

[Chorus: Black Thought]
Rest in power, rest in paradise
If I could change matters, I would spare a life
'Cause lives matter, there's clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
Rest in power, rest in paradise
If I could change matters, I would spare a life
'Cause lives matter, there's clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
[Interlude 1]
They say that, uh, time heals all wounds. It does not

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
In America, one tradition that lasts
Is black blood woven into the fibers o' the flag
Not addressing the problems of the past
To nowhere fast, but following the path
So called "leaders" on hire for the Klan
Still rapin' and settin' fire to the land
Well that's the climate, how can I become a man
If survival is a triumph and we got the underhand? Listen:
One killer, one child, one weapon
The shooter was unthreatened, seventy-one seconds
So many unanswered questions, I see reflections of myself
I feel like in fatherhood we are connected
Too long before the shooter was arrested
So wrong, worldwide, we've been affected
To them it's real, sins of the father remembered still
For every Trayvon Martin, there was an Emmett Till

[Interlude 2]
You killed my son

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
How many more kids will we wait for them to kill?
My tears collectin' like raindrops on the windowsill
If the wounds heal, the memories never fade
I wonder if you're in heaven's eleventh grade
Six thousand two hundred and thirty days
Too young of an early age, such evil and worldly ways
The thing in which we believe, the way in which we behave
The way in which we've evolved, the monster that we became, listen:
You might also like[Chorus: Black Thought]
Rest in power, rest in paradise
To all the babies too young to have had to pay the price
'Cause lives matter, there's clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
Rest in power, rest in paradise
Know as long as you still got somebody here to fight
Your lives matter, there's clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit lifeEmbed
