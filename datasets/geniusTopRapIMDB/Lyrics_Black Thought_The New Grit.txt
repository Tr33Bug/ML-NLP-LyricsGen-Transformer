The New Grit Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh, yeah, two-fifteen

[Verse]
I get on my jawn, when I perform I grab the bull by the horns
You probably should try to do it, I body you maricóns
My dynasty alliance, full of firearms, carriers
Kings who pull strings like a Stradivarius
His imperial highness is smart as smart appliances
Sharper than the academy of arts and sciences
Thought's a scientist, plus what tragedy to triumph is
Try, try again, I rule the night with an iron fist
An indication that you’re close to dying, I am this
The black Moses, black roses, black violins
When niggas go up against the choir, the sire wins
It ain't no way to try and cleanse true leviathans
I'm hard-wired but it’s barbed wire
I took that vanity, threw it into the bonfire
Some iffy shit transpire, them guns gon' fire
I never see my reflection, I'm like a vampire
Your empire expired, don't test the Esquire
I'm blessed, the messiah, no less than fresh
I am the best, you just tired, the fuck, is you stupid?
This is true grit, I'ma call it the new shitYou might also likeEmbed
