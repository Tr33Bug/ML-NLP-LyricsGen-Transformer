Thought is Like (Freestyle) Lyrics*Thought is like...*

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Kato 808 in my rhymes, the Green Hornet
At times I lean on it, ya'll just fiend on it
I'm cold fronting throughout the metro
Piloting, baby, the globe is my area
Yeah the most feared villain in America
Toss the trigger I use to hit the sheriff up
Now I'm convincing these dudes to get their lyrics up
Ya'll niggas bull' too much, ya'll niggas said enough
Sickin' competitors, heavily stressing this with ya
My medicine? Ya'll finna go see the therapist
I gotta settle it black, metal to metal
With these brothers on that bullshit pot, calling the kettle crisp
What could be better bitch? I'm rocking the flag with the green, black and red
And you're on the confederate, boy, you work for Merill Lynch
Ya'll ain't fucking with a brother hell bent on success, I'm living evidence
See it's really all about sensation and the fascination
We got to chase it: dreams
I'm trying to be the champ, you're in to racing
Cause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize
Something undetectable to ya'll naked eyes
Still its probably more real than ya'll recognize
I specialize in raw, carnivorous rhyming
Better silence it ya'll, you couldn't size it
The fourth horseman, give rise over the blade
Its going to cut you to a different size
In the days of guerrilla warfare
Making a change, like carfare
I want these chumps taken off here
Sip my morning coffee, kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend I'm gone until I save the world
Jump in my hotrod wheel, looking super thorough
Rocking an all black cape like the Duke of Earl
The essence of a movement on some smooth shit
Langston Hughes mixed in with some Stanley Kubrick
Sick, still yet I'm savvy, penning a nasty masterpiece
That convey my sentiment exactly
Black: I'm that nice son from Michaelango or Michael Eric Dyson
Slicing like a viking, dog, I'm white lightning
I'm caught with a bone, with a slight tick in my mind
It's tight frightening
The flow is part Mozart and part Malcom
Clearly you ain't fearing, you already know the outcome
Another victory, we're making history
I'm stronger than the walls in the penitentiaryYou might also like2Embed
