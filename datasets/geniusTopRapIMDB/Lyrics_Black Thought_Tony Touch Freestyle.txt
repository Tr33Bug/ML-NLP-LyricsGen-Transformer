Tony Touch Freestyle Lyrics[Verse 1: Black Thought]
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh
When I manifest
Hold up dog
Yo Tone it's the Jawn
It's the professional
I make your girl get extra low
I'm from south with a border like Mexico
Jaws talking bout they love me like x and o
Cause their man pop early like Plaxico
Not conceptual, unexceptional, hundred dollar bills filled of cocaine residue
Got you off your deed I'm ten steps ahead of you
Fresher than a 1985 fresh festival, live
One time for my hoods and my barrios
Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Trinitarios
In the hood staying dipped like Oreos
Even with a Moms on their shit like Marios
From the Illadelph valley side of things
And embalmed in my words in the Valley of the Kings
When I finish y'all, I ring alarms like Tenor Saw
And rage war with a Renascence, ya'll better get it far
Rest in Peace, J. Dilla
The Legendary Roots Crew from the city of Philla
Yup, mines the math
Though I rocks the mic and never got to past
But I got your ass
Listen, uh
Well, I'm a legend in my own time
Look at y'all, just a legend in your own mind
I let the drum talk to me cause it don't lie
A lot of rappers try to kill it but they don't die
Keep them coming back and feel it like a throatpie
La vida loca, from something toke to this
Grand Imperial, hall of fame material
Black, general 215, name rank and cereal
My thing highly flammable
I bang like a hammer do
Swine flu, bird flu, and every type of animal
I'm immune to Tamiflu
I'll be God Damn if you
Insane and bananas too
My bling is intangible
Well it's the Jet Li
I'm working on your requiem
Step in a party everybody scream, "That's him!"
I push a fast BM
Black gray Gatsby and
My gats be in the
Belfry that the bats be in
A box is what you never gonna catch me in
If this the last day and times nigga
Cash in
Yep
Looks like a job for a conquerer
Top mr third Mr swerve mr popular
You kinda finished
Can't see it with binoculars
Rather have a fish bone lodged in your esophogus
You ever heard of the world?
I'm on top of this
Still the most properest
Y'all know what the gospel is
Bless the child
I ain't wind up a x-file
After {???} self imposed exile
I reimerged cut from a different textile
They say i'm just wild
Waiting on my next trial
I've always been the nigga with the most fresh style
In '98 I rocked what you copped just now
I had dreams like Akira Kurosawa
And realized my meteoric rise to power
They say I drive 220 miles per hour
Sixteen bars: 220 thousand dollars
[???]About it
Reliant hypnotic
The game full of too many funny clowns and cowards
Look
Son of a'slam aleikum
I'm an abomination
A marijuana patient
With Grammy nominations
If everything and everybody in their proper places
Black Thought is out his mind he on that outer space shit
Spotted on the red carpet steppin' out a space ship
With a glass of shiraz and two around the way chicks
Nowadays don't nobody say shit
You don't want to see me get up on my modern day shit
Try to tell you Thought's dangerous
Can't nobody hang with this Great
Translated into 80 different languages
Websters and Cambridges
Every day the chamber switch
Grown-ass man
I don't know who the fuck you playing with
I Leave with heads in my
Take-away-from-dinner bag
Wicked grin like Mahmoud Ahmedinijad
Never been a nice nigga cuz they finish last
I'm a menace
That's what i'ma be remembered as
Fresh
[Talking and Q Tip verse]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Don’t even worry ‘bout it
My legendary stylin’
Between Harry Belafonte and Harry Allen
I’m from a city where it’s violent and it’s overcrowded
I put it on the map, y’all ain’t even know about it
I brought the poet out it
The soul flowin’ out it
Make it hard to figure how y’all managed to go without it
A mic with a cord, I never do a show without it
When dealin’ with fraud I lift ‘em up and throw it out
I know the way to go the route
Show you what a soldier ‘bout
Big boy arms I’m holdin’ out
Clips foldin’ out
Used to be a little snotnose but I’m older now
You can try what you want, I’ll tell you what I don’t allow
Fuck all the running round
You on a hunting ground
You spit a hundred bars
I spit a hundred rounds
You run a hundred yards
Trynna get outta bounds
That’s when I tackle y’all and show you how the thunder sounds
Bang ya, as we approach the danger
Rhymes that invoke your anger
And I ain’t know the music was supposed to change us
But when I start spitting it is so contagious
It smokes the pages
I literally spoke to sages
They said it’s no hope to save us
Because we the bad guys, you supposed to blame us
Cause nowadays everybody close to famous
But stop modellin’
The wild scholars in the wind like an halogen
Y’all motherfuckers can forget about challengin’
I blind rappers like a magnified Halogen
You trynna tussle with the truth, how about it then
I am lightyears beyond not behind the line
I will separate store from truly divine
Give me a crystal head vodka with a twist of lime
And watch rappers get smoked like a nick of time
I will put you in a body bag, pick a time
I will bring it to your doorstep, kick a rhyme
Niggas sick but they ain’t near sick as I am
Rappers is slick but they ain’t near slick as I am
I don’t give a fly
Niggas stop signifying
Stop cowering, be a man and die dignified
I’m that insecticide, pesticide, genocide
You in the morgue absolutely identified
But nope I won’t do it in the name of love
Until I’ve given it my all and it just ain’t enough
See even winters gettin’ realer than they say it was
Straighten up, who afraid of what?
Play your good and ball
Yeah
You work hard til you’re better off
24/7, 365 never off
Look at me I’m nocturnal I don’t sleep
Eyes, heavy bags and crows feet, we won’t be
Stopped, I don’t work then I won’t sleep
Time keep flowing like a river that don’t cease
In the mind of a super nigga there’s no peace
Can’t stop running like I’m ducking the police
Yeah
Cruely how they try to do me like cochise
Flow so obese, I’m springing a slow leak
I keep a crowd satisfied like bringing them cold heat
Yo, you’re the pits/Pitts like Angela Jolie
Stop, stop
You know the camera’s is goin’ see
Wolves lookin’ at me like them cannons ain’t on me
Please, you ain’t dealin’ with no amateurs homie
Philly ain’t known for cheesesteak sandwiches only
Yeah
Climbed to the top, man I was lonely
Everybody didn’t need mugging like Nick Nolte
But no, I won’t stop, won’t drop, won’t retire
I’m my own supplier selling goods to the buyer
The torch to the eye of the storm, on fire
Jawns trynna give me birthday sex, like Jeremiah
Hittin’ me up on Facebook
I replied, denied
Tell me I’m in the top 5
They ain’t never lie
Picture me in that Peking to Paris with a ride
It cost 2 to 5
Them doors suicide
Yeah
Testing Thought that will be your suicide
No matter which corner of the globe you reside
Listen
215, dumb shit aside
When it come to the job getting done, what am I?
I’m the god of the microphone praise the lord
Anybody disagree with me come raise your sword
I’m agent orange, poisonous amazing pawns
And the band keeps raging on
Well listen
And yo, I don’t stop
No, I don’t quit
No, I don’t stop
No, I don’t quit
No, I don’t stop
No, I don’t quitYou might also likeEmbed
