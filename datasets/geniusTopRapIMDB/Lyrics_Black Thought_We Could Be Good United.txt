We Could Be Good (United) Lyrics[Intro]
"I'm tired of this."
"What is it? What are you tired of?"
"I'm tired of you not being here."
"I'm here, I'm here right now. I'm here right now."
"The only time I connected with you is via social media."
"Listen, all you gotta do—"
"Are you never home?"
"I'm connected right now."
"You always down the streets, all you do is work, come home, shower, get dressed, and go the hell out"
Am I not a man, or another man, yeah
Just thought I'd be, yeah
All we can be
[Verse 1: Black Thought]
No one can always be kissin' undеr the mistletoe
Evеntually you'll be sendin' each other missiles and wonderin' just where this will go
Even considerin' splittin', but neither one of you wanna make it official, though
That pressure build in the kettle until the whistle blow
I know if ever I left you, I'd only miss you, though
Our love is in a place where there's no time or space
No time to waste on the outside of our divine embrace because of my mistakes
Sometimes we overcomplicate or undercompensate
I try to keep it namaste but you've just got complaints
I say you know me and you told me to get out your face
But you should know your crown is safe
And I'm proud to say I'd never just vanish without a trace
Who's countin' arguments? There's too many to calculate
I know it's a sweet and sour taste but when it's good, it's great
Energy and chemistry gets out of symmetry but we can be

[Chorus: C.S. Armstrong & OSHUN]
Oh, you can be good, baby, oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh, we could be good, baby, ye-yeah
We could be, we could be
But all you do is complain

I'm like Johann Sebastian, the Zohan of fashion
The slow mind, really showin' no signs of graspin'
Go find the caption to explain the neutron and proton attraction, that's
Got my wife at home, jealous of my microphone
Tellin' me, she's really been missin' the smell of my cologne
That I'm too grown to be livin' this life of Rock 'n' Roll
That all the tension is really startin' to take its toll
And not to mention I really should try to take control
Instead of breakin' and takin' her where she hates to go
I know it's because of the memory she cringes
The door was off the hinges, the curtain shredded to fringes
It's crazy seein' the same image through different lenses
I'd like to say the price we pay shouldn't be that expensive
If somethin' isn't righteous, it's making you apprehensive
But time is workin' with us, not against us, and we can be

[Chorus: C.S. Armstrong & OSHUN]
Oh, you can be good, baby, oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh, we could be good, baby, ye-yeah
We could be, we could be
But all you do is complain
[Bridge: OSHUN]
We both going to feel but we ain't gotta fight
You can be real, fuck tryin' to be right
You can be straight with me, never tell lies
Easy as cake, baby, we could be pi
Instead of us trippin', you flippin' all night
We could be trippin', jumpin' on flights
And we should just listen (Just listen)
We gon' disagree, shit, baby, we different

[Chorus: C.S. Armstrong & OSHUN]
Oh, you can be good, baby, oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be, we could be
Oh, we could be good, baby, ye-yeah
We could be, we could be
But all you do is complain

[Outro]
My soul can really feel your soul, you know what I mean?
Spirits or no spirits and our spirits agree​Embed
