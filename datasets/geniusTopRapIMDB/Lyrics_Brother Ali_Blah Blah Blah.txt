Blah Blah Blah LyricsGet yourself together now because it's hit time

You're known as the hit makers
Record breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you got a hole in your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
We gon' sing mighty loud and clear
[Brother Ali]
Ayo, the music made 'em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna contrast somethin fat, without lettin Ali touch that
Nothin' whack leaves his lips, youâ€™re not serious
I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, of ego 'reckin
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ahk so quit your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
So no

[Slug]
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Slug or, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
(Fuck that, sucka jump back)
I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame
(We call her hunch back), Ali run that

[Brother Ali]
From cats lips to gods ears
We line y'all punk bastards in crosshairs
Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared
Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)
You might also like[Slug]
Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that
Drippin' off her nuts, wait, why she got a nut sack?
You fuckin rappers are she-males
From the retail to the e-mail, defeat felt cause you need help

[Chorus]
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

[Brother Ali] (Slug)
(Rappers steppin to)
Ah yeah they get their shit spun
I throw a roll of quarters in cyphers and bet I hit one
(Yo I don't care were you represent son, where's your chick from?)
We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run

[Slug]
Listen, I know your mission, some type of magician that likes to go fishin'
On the mic with air tight precision, elitism, keeping tradition
When you ain't even keeping the rhythm the DJ is spinnin'
Calm down little camper, I've got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesn't matter turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp's for?
[Brother Ali]
I right wrongs, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go
But if I didn't have a wife, yo your kids'd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on without it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it

[Slug]
Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles, self taught
Communication, mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked

[Brother Ali]
Ha ha, You too drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name as if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there

[Slug] (Brother Ali)
I make a room full of punk rocks stop and do wop
Wrestle shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops
Who's you daddy, Fuck that, Jump back and act happy
(Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in your face)

[Hook]
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah1Embed
