Forest Whitiker Lyrics[Intro]
And yo, whatever comes up comes out
We don't put our hands over our mouth
And whatever comes up comes out
We don't put our hands over our mouth
Whatever comes up comes out
(Please mister bass-man lay it on me)

[Verse]
Ayo, depending on the day, and depending on what I ate
I'm anywhere from twenty to thirty-five pounds overweight
I got red eyes, and one of 'em's lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines, so I look crazy
I'm albino man, I know I'm pink and pale
And I'm hairy as hell, everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that ain't quite shaped right
Face type: shiny, I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like, and what I wear to work
I'm knock-kneed and got a neck full of razor bumps
I'm not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think I'm depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror, I see sexy ass me
And if that's somethin' that you can't respect then that's peace
My life's better without you actually
To everyone out there, who's a little different
I say damn a magazine, these is God's fingerprints
You can call me ugly but can't take nothing from me
I am what I am doctor you ain't gotta love me
[Interlude]
If you would please turn in your bible
To beauty tips according to Forest Whitiker
In the third chapter of the third line
Brother Ali would you please read to the choir for me son

[Hook]
I'mma be all right, you ain't gotta be my friend tonight
(You ain't gotta love me)
An I'mma be okay, you would probably bore me anyway
(You ain't gotta love me)
I'mma be all right, you ain't gotta be my friend tonight
(You ain't gotta love me)
An I'mma be okay, you would probably bore me anyway
(You ain't gotta love me)
I'mma be all right, you ain't gotta be my friend tonight
(You ain't gotta love me)
An I'mma be okay, you would probably bore me anyway
(You ain't gotta love me)
