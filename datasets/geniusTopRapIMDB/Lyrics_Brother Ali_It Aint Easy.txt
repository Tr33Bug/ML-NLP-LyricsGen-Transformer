It Ainâ€™t Easy Lyrics[Intro]
I did it again, huh? Yeah I know
I'm writing you a song though
It goes something like this...

[Verse 1]
You said one love, you can't unlove
I don't know what it is you're trying to run from
Like you just, you tryna unfriend me in real life?
I want it all real, nothing fake please
I don't want to wonder what your handshake means
I don't need to say everything I think I must
My ego's trying to ruin everything I touch
What I mean though or what my point is
That you're much more important than my point is
If I win an argument and lose your heart Lord
Hit the bullseye on the wrong dart board
Want to thank everyone for being patient with me
It's a journey that I'm on, I pray you take it with me
And to quote myself that's what this is about
"We live learn and figure it out"
Oh my God now...
[Hook]
It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

[Verse 2]
I want the real love, not the false kind
Not the one that need perfectness at all times
When it seems most difficult to keep me close
Is probably the time that I need you most
I let you down though, I didn't mean to
Even the people who try, we get weak too
And when you said we were family, I believed you
Because I needed so bad for it to be true
Now is my heart that way? Would I try to betray?
Is there any such thing as an honest mistake?
If what you need and what I have don't match
That's when we need the love thing to fill those gaps up

[Hook]
It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

(You tryna save the world, right?)
Yo I'm a hot mess and if I'm honest
It's not just one event but a process
If I'm tryna get out here and protest
Let me first save the world from my foolishness
Let me guard my heart from it's harshness
Try to rid my truth of it's falseness
If your beauty is closer than an arms length
You'd be hard pressed to tell me that it's far fetched
I know I hurt you though, you took it personal
But what's love if the essence isn't merciful?
And I see no need for us to live with regrets
I'd rather just forgive and forget
Oh my God now

[Hook]
It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

[Outro]
I was thinking maybe not debate politics in the pool
Nah, just because it's your daughter's birthday party I just.. You  know
No, I feel you
Yeah, word up, email me about that
You said one love, can't unlove
I don't know what you think you're tryna run from
You said one love, can't un-love, tryna run from
Said one love love love
Said one love love love
Said one love love loveEmbed
