Never Learn Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(My goodness, good morning)
[Verse 1]
You're still an apprentice
Every generation of MC **** with me, so I'm ill by consensus
You see what I speak
You touch it and feel it, all six of your senses
My mission is endless, I've been in this tent and I'm still as relentless
Now, build you a fence, if you're feelin' defensive
My power comes from the most high
Lord, God, of the globe sky
Soul vibration is so fly, I can walk on water, no lie
Champion author
Small fry rock of Gibraltar; Northside
Serving this culture
Might I confide that I'm here to assault ya?
I got some money in the bank that I did not have when I start[ed]
Got a little money up in my hand, I do not have money in my heart
I'm standing on champion greatness
I cannot claim it 'cause that's the creator
I stand up and state it
That's not braggin', it's prayin'
That's what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(Ya Hafidh, ya Wadud)

I was standin' on-stage when my hero died
Feel the heartbeat of my people's cry
Nation nineteen thirty-three, bow ties
Light of the DÄ«n gleaming in your eyes
Even when the tears flow down both sides, you know why I sacrificed your whole life
You can go ahead, let your soul fly 'cause the whole tribe bloodline flow through mine
Listen, we love to fight 'cause we fight for love
The poor, righteous sons, where the diamonds from
Libraries are transcribin' us, and our ancestors are more alive than us
Put down everything you're tryna clutch: your undying lust to see the climate just
Baby we ride 'til our time is up
That's just the divine in us

[Chorus]
I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(My goodness, good morning)

[Break]
[Outro]
I don't know where
Let it bleed
Get my head firm
Hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
Get my head firm2Embed
