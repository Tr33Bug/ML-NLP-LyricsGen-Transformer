Special Effects Lyrics[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
I don't want to see you in a screen
I want to feel you in the flesh and on the scene
I love all the words and what it mean
But it's so much to say in the spaces in between
I don't want to watch dots disappear
Listen here, first reaction is crystal clear
I want the uncut sentiment
Before you had a chance to second guess and edit it
I love you for the first draft you
All the technology on Earth can't improve
No special effects and no Santa Claus
Uncut, acoustic, and analog
A lifetime measured in breaths
The face is a mirror that the heart reflects
And when the eyes meet, they directly connect
And that's what you call true special effects
[Chorus: deM atlaS]
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
I don't want to watch your life in pictures
I'm trying to be right there with ya
We'll be so rich at the end of all of this
We can scroll through memories without any filter
I'm trying to share life as it comes
No timeline from the night to the sun
Crème de la crème and the crust and the crumbs
Type of love you can't type with your thumbs
Let me not hear your voice in a speaker
I'm tryna feel your breath when it leaves ya
Message received, you best to believe
Your real life friend is requesting to see you
I'm here to watch your story unfold
I don't really want to only be told
Everything I hold is pressed to my chest
That's what you call special effects (yes!)

Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face again

[Bridge: Brother Ali & (deM atlaS)]
Into me you see, I see
Inherent in here, I hear
I give fidelity free
See my peers appear, my dear
Into me you see, I see
Inherent in here, I hear, my dear
(Just to see your face again, just to see your face)

[Outro: Brother Ali]
Groove to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words, what?
In other words, huh?
Move to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words, what?
In other words, huh?Embed
