We Got This Lyrics[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Here we are together
Watching the world come down around us
I know my baby girl she counting on us
If she ask me about it I got be honest
Either they forgot about us or they got a target on us
And my niece is shooting amateur porno
Police shoot my nephews in the street like it's normal
But they've been doing that a century or like four though
It's horrible, still pains me to my core though
I know that when the dust settles and the smoke clears
And the wretched of the earth living with no fears
All we need is someone here who can remind us of how great it was
Before these people had their way with us
I know when I was on the street and struggling
You know you took me in to feed my hunger pain
And now you put me on my feet, look what I became
Even when we disagree that love remains
Listen these people they ain't trying to save our soul
So why we bickering about which way to go?
You know the words are incidental
The hearts are instrumental
As long as we're connected we can make it though
We got...
[Hook: Brother Ali]
Love
Should I ever call your name
I know that you can feel my pain
You'll be on your way to see me through
We got this
Love
Should you ever call my name
You know that I feel the same
I'll be on my way to see you through
We got this

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
I'm not grinning cause I'm at a loss of opposition
Lot of them don't want me livin'
Thank God it's not your decision
I don't hate for a minute
A drop in the infinite
'Cause hate got a small percentage of envy in it
My enemies are not my teachers
I'm not seeking to adopt your features
I don't want or need you
My heart has been broken into, but I'm not broken in two
Don't need you to acknowledge the piece of me that lives in you
The truth was never yours to give us, it's always in us
You cut your roots off, you're finished
Heart's missing and you're looking at the raw authentic
Ya'll been listening, but ya'll don't get it, just mimic
I'm grinning cause I hear my echo in it
When you whisper to your infant
I'm glad I could be of some benefit
God bless, but the voice ain't the sound coming out of the hole
That's from deep down inside of our soul
Something ya'll need to know

Late at night I find it harder to rest easy bruh
It's like this heartache has no intention of easin' up
Cause every twenty four hours is another homicide
And they keep telling me that being emotional is unreasonable
Now I'm just trying to find a way that I can maintain
So I turned this love affair with words into my main thing
Putting all the hope I got left in the vocal expression
And maybe the message will make the world amazing
And finally my daddy can understand me a little better
See why I gave up my B.A. for another set of letters
Cause if he knew to what degree I sacrifice for this road
He might be prouder of the life I chose to go get us
But time's too precious to be wasted on the grudge between us
Ain't no bond greater than the share of flesh and blood between us
And we can make it through the toughest times together
If we let our guards down and just allow our love to lead us rightEmbed
