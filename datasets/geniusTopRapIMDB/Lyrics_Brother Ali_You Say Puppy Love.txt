You Say (Puppy Love) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say I made you fall in love with me
Wish I could make you fall in love with you
You believed in the magic that us could be
And what that you and I means one could do
Every instinct you had said run from me
That this newfound touch is uncomfortable
And to truly stand naked in front of me
Or yourself for that then matter is something new
I take no pride knowing that
You avoid the mirror to shun what you despise
Never knew the beauty you came here with
Till the first time you caught your reflection in my eyes
Never you mind what I see in you
Grow because you're beautiful, not because I need you to
Grow till you outstretch every single piece of you
Heaven will see you through but you got to believe it's true
Go write your story
Even if in the end you might outgrow me
I'll always treasure the chapter that was mine
And twist through time with a smile knowing you're free
[Hook]
Puppy love is real to a puppy
I still want to feel you touch me
I'm not saying leave me, please just be free
I love you so much, I don't want you to need me
Puppy love's real to a puppy
I still want to feel you up under me
Not saying leave me, please just be free
I love you so much, I don't want you to need me

[Verse 2]
The sky all alone is glorious
We behold it but we can't hold it up
When god says that's it and hits the switch
It'll all come tumbling down when it's bored with us
Sweet you and all your radiance
I can please you, but I can't save you sis
I adore you and might even open up
But even I can't love you enough for both of us
Can't hold you close enough
Can't enter the holes you've boarded up
Close your eyes, concentrate on my voice
Want to make your love for me pure, make it a choice

[Hook]

The sky is there to behold
You just want to be held when you're cold
Just grow, stretch out your soul
And if you still want me I'll watch you grow old3Embed
