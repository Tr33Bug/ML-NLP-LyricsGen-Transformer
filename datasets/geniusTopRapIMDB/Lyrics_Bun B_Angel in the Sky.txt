Angel in the Sky Lyrics[Hook: Lil' Razah]
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh

[Verse 1: Bun B]
They say it's always darkest before the dawn (before the dawn)
And that you don't know what you got until it's gone (until it's gone)
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong
And that's why I gots to write this song, now c'mon (now c'mon)
Say man I thought it would of been a long time for us (time for us)
And many more years on the grind for us (grind for us)
I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter
We were super tight but finna be super tighter (super tighter)
I guess I just assumed we had more time
For us to make more music (music) and write more rhymes (rhymes)
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real)
You take away the glitter, the gold and the gleam
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean
Nothin without the people you love
Say man I miss my brother, but I know he's lookin down from above
And there's an angel
[Hook: Lil' Razah]
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It all began on Shreveport Ave., sittin off in the den
Makin beats and puttin paper to pen
We was determined to win, and you couldn't tell us different
Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippin (he kept trippin)
It seems just like yesterday sometimes
Sittin in ya bedroom (huh) writin dumb rhymes (man)
You makin beats on the insonic (sonic)
And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic (wasn't no chronic)
I still remember when we started the crew
It was me, Mitchell, Queen, Jamal, Jackson and you
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two
That's when we introduced the world to the U
To the G to the K, Underground Kings, DJ Byrd
Pimp C and Bun B, we kept it G, say word (say word)
Who woulda known back in '92
In 2008 I'd have to write a song sayin I miss you but it's true

[Hook: Lil' Razah]
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh

Just for the record let me go ahead and say
I love my brother Pimp C and man I miss him every day
Yeah my heart still hurts (hurts) and the pain's still fresh (fresh)
But I'mma put God first, to keep that pressure off my chest
And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him, as a friend (friend)
A ride or die homie that was with me 'til the end ('til the end)
Real talk, man we was closer than kin
And I know, that I'll never have a partner like that again (like that again)
So Chad Butler I just want you to know
I keep ya memory close, I'm never lettin it go (lettin it go)
And they gon' always remember that you was here mayne (mayne)
Cause I'mma make 'em remember, that's why I'm here mayne (mayne)
Yeah it's still hard (hard) and I still cry (cry)
But you and God keep me strong so I'mma still try (try)
Reppin this UGK now won't I (huh)
Cause through your music you live forever so Trill (Trill) don't die

[Bridge: Lil' Razah]
I know you're watchin over me
Last night I saw you in my dream
At the crossroads I'll see you there
At the crossroads, I'll see you there
My friend, my brother 'til the end
Can't wait to see you again
Save a place in heaven for me
Save a place in heaven for me
[Hook: Lil' Razah]
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh1Embed
