Chuuch!!! Lyrics[Intro: J. Prince & (Pimp C)]
Ah yeah, two thousand and ten and we still rollin
You know Bun, my dad used to tell me
Every time he thought he knew it all, something new would come up
So at this time, let's welcome - Drake (uh)
The newest member to the family
Whom my son, Jas Prince discovered
Make no mistake, the army's behind him
Now Bun, I've been labeled as a quiet storm and it may be true
But I've been watchin a genius at work on this album
And without further adieu, yo Pimp, give us your blessings
(Chuuch!)
[Verse 1: Bun B]
Yeah (yeah), I'm back baby and better than I ever was (was)
I got the streets on fire, so forget a buzz (buzz)
I ain't trippin on SoundScan or BDS
Easy to find with or without your GPS (S)
And now we ridin, ask Biden (Biden) or Obama ('bama)
Go ask the hustlers, the gangsters (gangsters), ask your mama (mama)
And they'll tell ya the best that ever did it
Is still in here doin it, you can't fuck with it (can't fuck with it)
And I'm a hit it on the head with a hammer (hammer)
Reppin H-Town like Phi Slama Jama
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready bro?
Well you already know, on your mark, set, ready, go (go, go, go)

[Chorus: Tekai Hicks & (Pimp C)]
I came to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothin but the truuuth (Tabernacle bitch)
I came to represent for the South
In the streets and in the booooth (Hold up, hold up)
I came from the bottom to the top
And I'm out here doin my thiiing
So if you're tryin to get it like I get it
Let the congregation siiing (Chuuch!)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Yeah (yeah), we back baby and better than we ever was (was)
It's UGK so quit actin like we never was (was)
You see the crew is "II Trill" (trill) and in effect ('fect)
And Rap-a-Lot is rollin with us (with us), we fittin to wreck (wreck)
So ask T.I.P., ask Hova (Hova), ask Diddy (Diddy)
Go ask Yeezy (Yeezy), Jeezy (Jeezy), ask 50 (50)
And they'll tell ya, I'm throwed when I spit it
And still in here doin it, you can't fuck with it (can't fuck with it)
And I'm a hit it in the chest with the Nina
Reppin H-Town like James Prince Sr. (ah yeah)
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready bro?
Well you already know, on your mark, set, ready, go (go, go, go)

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah (yeah), it's back baby and better than it ever was (was)
That dirty South shit, that you can only get from us (us)
That H-Town, slow down, chopped and screwed music (music)
And it ain't goin nowhere, so get used to it (to it)
Go ask Trae, ask Paul Wall, ask Ro (Ro)
Go ask Koopa, ask Slim, they already know (know)
And they'll tell ya they ready to represent it
And still in here doin it, you can't fuck with it (can't fuck with it)
And I'm a hit 'em low, chop 'em at the knees (knees)
Reppin P-A-T like a young Pimp C (C)
Am I hard enough, am I real enough, am I ready bro?
Well you already know, on your mark, set, ready, go (go, go, go)
