Fire Lyrics[Intro: Serani]
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Serani and Bun B

[Hook: Serani]
When the heat is on we burn hotter than (fire)
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than (fire)
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with (fire)
Whether life or death, guess we're far from (fire)

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Murder murder redrum - mami, I done dead them
Rude boy like Ashanti, take his motherfucking head from
His shoulders, this is Bedlam - mayhem, chaos
Competition cease and seckle already, they lost
Thinking they boss like the Triple C's CEO
Fuck them, they would be D.O.A ASAP, you see me, ho
Me, you, and D.O.G, that’s why the fuck they ducking me
Rude boy, now deal with the fuckery, we bucking G
The ghetto red hot, the youth and the care play
Pussy and lit up match shots now in the air
Motherfucker beware 'til I retire or expire
Cyanide in them, know that we are coming with more fire
[Hook: Serani]
When the heat is on we burn hotter than (fire)
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than (fire)
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with (fire)
Whether life or death, guess we're far from (fire)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big belly man, big belly man man
Big belly man, I'm that big belly man
Big black benz, 20% tints
100 niggas on my team, 20% friends
After four or five lines you know this organized crime
Me still buying jewels, I got on more than last time
This not a past time, this a landslide
And I'm bringing more fire, better get your hands up
Get out my beamer, you know I like my trigga finger crew
Get with a boss and maybe you could get a beamer too
Burning down the strip from Texas to Kingston
As a dime stand in line just dying to squeeze in
Ross

[Hook: Serani]
When the heat is on we burn hotter than (fire)
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than (fire)
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with (fire)
Whether life or death, guess we're far from (fire)

Who want to test this? Titty 2 necklace
Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe
Balling like the ESPY's, drinking on that Texas
Sexting. texting, aggravated flexing
Did it for the money and the fame came with it
Connect from the island and the 'caine came with her
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried off
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and I’ll Dash like Damon
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz

[Hook: Serani]
When the heat is on we burn hotter than (fire)
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than (fire)
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with (fire)
Whether life or death, guess we're far from (fire)3Embed
