Gone Away Lyrics[Chorus: Leon Bridges]
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go

[Verse: Bun B]
Now my brother was loud, but my brother was proud
And my brother made sure that he stood out in a crowd
Yeah, my brother wore glasses but he saw so clear
And my brother knew God so he had no fear
No fear of these haters, no fear of these clones
My brother wasn't concerned, and he made that known
Yeah, my brother was spoiled, but my brother was loyal
Late nights of hard work, me and my brother would toil
Yeah, my brother made me laugh 'cause my brother was funny
But you best not ever fuck around with my brother's money
'Cause my brother would snap and then that's all that she wrote
And it's a line under that, as my brother would quote
Yeah, my brother's a mothafucka if I'm tellin' the truth
But man he kept it 100 in and out of the booth
So when I talk about my brother, I smile and I cry
Because I know he's watchin' over me, sittin' on high
[Chorus: Leon Bridges]
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to goYou might also like1Embed
