Hold U Down Lyrics[Intro: Trey Songz]
Hey, hey, we keepin' it trill
Songbook, baby

[Hook: Trey Songz]
If you need love, I'm lovin', if you need a thug, I'm thuggin'
If you need a hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down
Need a lil' dough, we flippin', got somewhere to go, I'm whippin'
Be a love hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Bun B, I'ma man amongst men
My chain is white gold, my steel is tungsten
I'm made of tough skin, you gon' respect me
Take more than a average nigga to check me
I'm a rider 'til the wheels go ballin', they blow out
One hundred and one percent G and it's no doubt
That if you need a man to make you feel secure
Then baby, you ain't gotta look no more, I got the cure
You want money and jewels, you want clothes and cars
Wanna live VIP, rubbin' shoulders with stars
Wanna fly in G4's or sail the seas
Then your wish is my command, you can do what ya please
The lap of luxury is what you'll be layin' in
Just respect the player and the game that he's playin' in
I can show you a side of life you never seen
'Cause even the king of the trill need a separate queen
[Hook: Trey Songz]
If you need love, I'm lovin', if you need a thug, I'm thuggin'
If you need a hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down
Need a lil' dough, we flippin', got somewhere to go, I'm whippin'
Be a love hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
See all that listenin' to them hoes in your ear gotta quit
I see they smile when I'm around, when I leave, they talk shit
They just mad 'cause I got you flippin' jagos, poppin' tags
Brand new clothes, you can't tell by the tag
I don't mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hatin'
They just waitin' on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with Nathan
Then when I do that, they gon' back door and try to holla
Hopin' I'ma do them like you and drop them off some dollas
But I ain't 'cause I can't afford to go back down that road
I'd rather stay on my J O and stack a bankroll
But I ain't 'cause I can't afford to go back down that road
I'd rather stay on my J O and stack a bankroll
But if you real and you down and in public you don't clown
Holla at me, I'll be around, Mike Jones
But if you real and you down and in public you don't clown
Holla at me I'll be around, yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
If you need love, I'm lovin', if you need a thug, I'm thuggin'
If you need a hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down
Need a lil' dough, we flippin', got somewhere to go, I'm whippin'
Be a love hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down

I been puttin' it down, nigga and holdin' my grounds, nigga
From off the mound, nigga, we duckin' them clowns, nigga
Takin' they crown, nigga we shovin' the town, nigga
Rocks off the ground got the kush by the pounds, nigga
Ankle blingin', baby, wrist on freeze
Got the pinky on the ice, love a bitch with gold teeths
Hot girl nigga lovin' the G
Keep the work under the seat, she do it for me
Take a trip to port her off to the beach
Tell her homie hold it down 'cause we hustle to eat
And got me feelin' like I lost my Jones
I done lost my home so H town, it's on
And nuttin' change 'cause the palms got chrome
Nigga do this in the early 'cause we gettin' it on
And baby girl, you could shop alone
And fly the 4 to France and take a hundred bones

[Hook: Trey Songz]
If you need love, I'm lovin', if you need a thug, I'm thuggin'
If you need a hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down
Need a lil' dough, we flippin', got somewhere to go, I'm whippin'
Be a love hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down1Embed
