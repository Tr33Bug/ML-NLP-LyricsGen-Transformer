It’s Been A Pleasure Lyrics[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town
[Verse 1]
Set up the occasion
I’m up in the place and
If amazing was a young bitch
I'd be going to jail cause I'm fucking amazing
What's up for the taking
I’m ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like
I’m probably in your hotel tonight
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight
Yeah, just know we grinding till it’s light out
Show up in your city, turn that motherfucker right out
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don’t follow rules, stupid old things
I’m riding through the city in the coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfucking Super Bowl rings
Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure

[Chorus: Drake]
