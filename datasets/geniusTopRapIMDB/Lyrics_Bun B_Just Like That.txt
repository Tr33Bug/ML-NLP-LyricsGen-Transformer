Just Like That Lyrics[Intro: Jeezy & (Bun B)]
(Hahaha), yeah, (just like that)
Yeah, that real shit nigga
Yeah, Bizzle, Jizzle, H-Town
Bun (what's up?)
You had to go fuck with ya homie, right? (you know it G)
No easy ass niggas
'Bout that! (G-A to P-A)
'Bout that shit nigga, yeah, let's go
Yeah we 'bout that (let's go!)
[Chorus: Jeezy]
See y'all gon' give me my respect, cause I earned that
Even though it's 6 bands a pound, we still burn that
New Benz with the glass top; yeah, we drove those (those)
Know them things come out them glass pots? Yeah, we sold those
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
Just like that, you know we 'bout that
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
I said we 'bout that, yeah you know we 'bout that

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Say mayne I'm cleaner than a whistle, nigga sharper than a sickle (sickle)
My Cadillac is candy and my Desert Eagle nickel (nickel)
Plated niggas hate it (hate it), there's nothin they can say though
When I hit 'em with the pressure (pressure), they leakin out the Play-Doh (Play-Doh)
From way back in the day yo (day yo), they know I put it down
Had a +Pocket Full of Stones+, got to sewin up the town (town)
Been at it since the '90's in the ghetto with them pounds
And them bricks, hittin licks and fillin heaters with them rounds
Paid the cost to be the boss, I can show ya the receipt for it
Trillest in the game, every nigga in the streets know it (fo' sho')
Bun B and Jizzle back to business cause the sign on (the dough)
That's what the fuck we got our mind on, so grind on (let's go)

[Chorus: Jeezy]
See y'all gon' give me my respect, cause I earned that
Even though it's 6 bands a pound, we still burn that
New Benz with the glass top; yeah, we drove those (those)
Know them things come out them glass pots? Yeah, we sold those
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
Just like that, you know we 'bout that
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
I said we 'bout that, yeah you know we 'bout that

Sometimes I ask myself, say Jizzle how ya doin? (doin)
Yeah you know you be about the money you persuin (persuin)
Persue that paper like a yellow bitch from H-Town (H-Town, yeah)
Just take off the yellow tape (yeah, yeah), now ya sellin H-Towns (yeah)
Watch the beat break down (down), long way from breakdown
On my way to A-Town, long way from H-Town (haha)
Bitch I'm 'bout that, bitch you know I'm 'bout that ('bout that)
They say they 'bout that ('bout that) but I really doubt that (yeeeah)
You know I live this (live this), love this (love this), thug shit (thug shit)
Did a song with Kanye, still talkin drug shit (drug shit)
Even though it's drug shit (drug shit), still make the club shit (club shit)
Bitch you know I'm 'bout that ('bout that) and them bitches love this

[Chorus: Jeezy]
See y'all gon' give me my respect, cause I earned that
Even though it's 6 bands a pound, we still burn that
New Benz with the glass top; yeah, we drove those (those)
Know them things come out them glass pots? Yeah, we sold those
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
Just like that, you know we 'bout that
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
I said we 'bout that, yeah you know we 'bout that

[Verse 3: Bun B]
That's right, my mind is on my money and my fingers on a fat knot
Eyes is wide open and my ears is to the blacktop
Came up in the trap spot, posted with that crack rock
From the streets to the studio, now I got this rap locked (locked)
Back then they didn't want me (want me) but now they all up on me (on me)
Big licks they fall up on me, dime bitches crawl up on me
Yeah, I used to call ya homie (homie), now we just acquaintances ('ces)
You broke the G-code nigga, you need gangsta maintenance
Step ya game up, matter fact, get a escalator ('lator)
Somebody call the swag police to come arrest this hater
Butterfly Ferraris ('raris) and Porsches with the double doors (doors)
CTE, UGK, we hit you with a double dose
[Chorus: Jeezy]
See y'all gon' give me my respect, cause I earned that
Even though it's 6 bands a pound, we still burn that
New Benz with the glass top; yeah, we drove those (those)
Know them things come out them glass pots? Yeah, we sold those
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
Just like that, you know we 'bout that
Just like that, yeah you know we 'bout that
I said we 'bout that, yeah you know we 'bout thatEmbed
