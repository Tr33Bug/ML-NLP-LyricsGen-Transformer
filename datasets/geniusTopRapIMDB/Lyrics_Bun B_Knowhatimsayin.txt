Knowhatimsayin Lyrics[Intro: Big E Beatz]
It's a Big E Beat!

[Chorus: Bun B]
My paint is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My rims is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My trunk is like, "Hold up!" KnowhatImsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'? Texas and these boys ain't playin'
My roof is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My tooth is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
The truth we like, "Hold up!" Knowhatimsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'?  Texas and these boys ain't playin'
[Verse 1: Bun B]
This that "Man, hold up!" shit, that styrofoam cup shit
That 84s and vogue flows that niggas can't fuck wit'
Tippin' on fo'fos shit, slammin' Cadillac doors shit
That "Not only is it real, but it's realer than your shit!"
Woodgrain wheel and the candy paint mandatory
If you're from that Texas, you already understand the story
Money, cups and swangas (swangas), tops chopped with that trunk lit
Chunk a deuce with fingers (fingers), boy, we ain't on that punk shit
Gulfway veteran that ain't too many better than
Say he wanna dance with the devil, then fuck it, let him in
We don't bar niggas, droppin' bars while we on barre
Yeah, you might be on, bitch, but you know you ain't on par
When I pull up on a pussy nigga with that chrome boy
Shut his slab down, he gon' have to call up OnStar
Sippin' drank, candy paint, them Texas boys started that
Hate and I put one between your numbers like a quarterback

[Chorus: Bun B]
My paint is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My rims is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My trunk is like, "Hold up!" KnowhatImsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'? Texas and these boys ain't playin'
My roof is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My tooth is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
The truth we like, "Hold up!" Knowhatimsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'? Texas and these boys ain't playin'

H-Town, Texas, yeah, these boys ain't playin'
Underground Kingz, we the kings of this land
Stand tall for the trill, still rep the set right
RIP Pimp C, poppin' trunk, showin' lights
Still on that Westheimer, five gallons of the gloss
In Event, bangin' ol' flows from the Swishahouse
Wrist lit up, your bitch on my dick, hoe, get up
Drinkin' drank by the pint, tryin' to sit up, don't pull your shit up
When you see me, 'cause it's Fader, I'm in my drop 5/9 watchin' cable
Newest one out the stable, no labels, black-owned 'til I'm gone
Still comin' through Acres Homes like it's money on my phone
I'm a grown-ass boss, still like to floss
For two decades straight I've been pullin' out
Paint cost 20 grand, got 'em lookin' like, "Damn!"
Down in H-Town, I'm the man
Hold up

[Chorus: Bun B]
My paint is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My rims is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My trunk is like, Hold up!" KnowhatImsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'? Texas and these boys ain't playin'
My roof is like, "Damn!" Knowhatimsayin'?
My tooth is like, "Man!" Knowhatimsayin'?
The truth we like, "Hold up!" Knowhatimsayin'?
KnowhatImsayin'? Texas and these boys ain't playin'
[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
95 degrees in the city, the top vanish
L-Dog covered in chrome, my Lac's Spanish
Paint job still ain't right? Then keep sprayin'
'Cause I'm comin' through, drippin' that candy, knowhatimsayin'?
Martin Luther, call him the king, 'cause this is playground
Slab doors, leather and 4s, this why they hatin' now!
Roll up, guess who 'bout to show up
Pull up on they ass and make 'em throw up, hold up
Southside holdin', no playin'
Come through in that pretty muthafucka like, "Man!"
Texas niggas stand, bitch, I'm Don Ke
Ain't gon' never find another slab nigga like me
713, ain't no secret what I claim
Got a trunk full of speakers, niggas diamonds on his chain
Bitch, I go insane, crawlin' on them thangs
'Cause we twistin on that gas and we drinkin' purple rain
Hold upEmbed
