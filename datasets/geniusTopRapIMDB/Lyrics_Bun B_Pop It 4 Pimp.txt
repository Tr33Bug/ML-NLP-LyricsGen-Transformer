Now all my ladies to the dance flo', it's time to do ya thang
You see the piece & chain, you see the pinky rang
Now this one ain't a joke, and this one ain't a game
You got to twurk for my baby brother, now show no shame
You already know who you came fo' and why you came
And why you comin, you hear the 8-0-8 drummin
Let a hater hate, woman that's what they gon' do
Now pop it for the pimp, you see a trill nigga want you
But you gotta be down, to fuck with me and my round
You ain't gon' pop it for the pimp, bitch get yo' ass out of town
You got to take it off and let me see it, with no delay
So if you miss the pimp let me hear you say, c'mon
