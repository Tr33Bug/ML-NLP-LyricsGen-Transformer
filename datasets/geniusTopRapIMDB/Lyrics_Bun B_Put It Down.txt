Put It Down Lyrics[Verse 1: Bun B]
Now when it come to makin' money, I'm a printing press (Press)
And when it come to bein' trill, I'm the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test (Test)
And when it come to making history, I'm like Joe's son (Son)
A million ways to die and you already chose one (One)
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a good beginning ('Ginning)
We on the top, now go back and tell the hood we winning (Winning)
And while you're there, let 'em know I did it just for them (Them)
I made 'em cough the cash up and left em' just the phlegm (Phlegm)
Is that the King of the Trill? Go tell 'em, "Yes, it's him" (Him)
And his testosterone is up, who's got the estrogen? ('Gen)
I like your girl and I think she like me even more (More)
I hit her with that heave-and-ho and then I'm leavin' bro (Bro)
The Dirty South's finest, and Dirty South's behind us
Now, that's a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your Linus
You got a problem with us? You know just the spot to find us
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
I Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around

[Verse 2: Bun B]
They know I'm in a Port Arthur state of mind
Southern superstar status (Status), I elevate the grind (Grind)
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the Breitling
So exciting when you see the shine (Shine)
We on a level those before us never even thought of (Thought of)
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father (Father)
I helped the blind to see and kept it G just like I oughta (Oughta)
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water (Water)
We playing all four quarters 'til the clock expire ('Xpire)
So 'til I see the ref waving, I will not retire ('Tire)
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire (Fire)
Can't take your eyes off me (Off me)
Like when you watch The Wire (Wire)
And in oh-ten (Ten), we finna go in (In)
So let the opposition know that there is no win (Win)
And I am no friend (Friend), so put your hand down (Down)
And tell 'em, "Stand down" (Down) before it's "Man down" (Down)

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down (Yeah, ugh)
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around

[Verse 3: Drake]
Round, I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, maneâ€”Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; I'm quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, y'all just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends, she bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm riding clean, damn!
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around6Embed
