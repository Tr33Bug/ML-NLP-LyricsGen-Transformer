Recognize Lyrics[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold
Rose petals everywhere that I stroll, crown got the glow
Gin creep up super slow like
Popped up the trunk, dropped the top on the slab
Had the AK-had the-had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Popped up the trunk, dropped the top on the slab
Had the AK-had the-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
[Verse 1: Bun B]
Well my go mode is instant
Flow mode is infinite
Hoe mode is some pimpin' shit
Yeah, my wordplay is intricate
Influence significant, motherfuckin' magnificence
And my influence is integral
Charismatic essential, fuckin' up your centrifugal
With trill pumpin' all through my ventricles
Gladiators and sentinels, peep you through the peripherals
I see you pussy niggas out the optical
Catch your ass when it’s optimal, light you up like an Optimo
Got a little legal with a colossal flow
Fadin' me is impossible
Fuck boy so you gots to go

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold

Had the AK-had the-had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Popped up the trunk, dropped the top on the slab
Had the AK-had the-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence

Bitch, I'm old school like an Acura
Flip flows like a spatula, verses full of vernacular
Creep up on ya like a tarantula
Darker than Blacula, no speculation, I'm spectacular
And my insight is immaculate
Aim on me is so accurate, hoe, you don’t know the half of it
We gon' send you home with some fractured shit
When really though my tactics is deeper on some didactic shit
I'm just out here tryna educate
Build you up, mayne, and elevate, lift you up 'til you levitate
Expediate the shit up to a better rate
Ignorance tend to hesitate, fuck it then, we gon' let 'em wait

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
Everythang I touch turn to gold
Rose petals everywhere that I stroll, crown got the glow
Gin creep up super slow like
Popped up the trunk, dropped the top on the slab
Had the AK-had the-had the AK
The gin creep up super slow like
Popped up the trunk, dropped the top on the slab
Had the AK-had the-had the AK
Bitch, recognize a king in your presence
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hustle meticulous, so concerned with particulars
Hard as hell makin' millions and still remain inconspicuous
Bitches be so adventurous, they get wet when you mention us
Even the white ones, daddy hear 'bout it, they think of lynchin' us
Government plans, fencin' us in, life in the pen
For sellin' shit you put in our hood, no, I did not do it
We desperate, starvin' and dyin' to eat, die in the street
For a fraction of what I get now for a soundin' fly on the beat
Hmm, I'm the anomaly, honestly, you should honor me
But how can I act like I'm the shit like wasn't no one in front of me?
How can I not acknowledge all the pimpin' Bun had done for me
Okay, listen, fella, never ever disrespect the predecessor

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
