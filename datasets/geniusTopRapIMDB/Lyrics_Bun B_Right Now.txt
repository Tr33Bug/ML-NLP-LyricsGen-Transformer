Right Now Lyrics[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Ugh! She got the whole world, in her jaws
When she feel it tighten up, don't stop and don't pause
I got the whole game, in my head
Don't fuck for recreation but I'm good in the bed
Tony Snow, I keep big blow
My homeboy gal wanna fuck me on the low
But I don't wanna 'less she goin' out on the grind
Check-in with the choosin' fee and I'ma knock her from behind
I make a bitch bleed the block
With a certified knot and a platinum cock
The pimpin' didn't stop, even when the bids died
We just kept on gettin' high, puttin' dick up in they eye
Dick up in they ears, dick up in they nose
Ass, pussy, mouth, I'm fin' ta fuck in every hole
Put it between they titties and between they toes
That's how a gushy gush out when ya bitch get chose
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Eternally thug nigga, Hilfiger made by Tommy
So when I speak, hope to reach my boricua mamis
Oh, come to papi, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouthpiece until I cum, no one can stop me
My bump and grind'll do ya everytime
Come get a blast of this thug passion that'll blow your mind, hey
Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thang, fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' down hotties
And they, seduce my jimmy, out and screamin', "Gimme body"
Make 'em all scream my name out, gimme my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga, be at the cot
I'm at the Rican Parade, I'm watchin' caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit'll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend, now c'mon

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now

Look here shawty, lemme tell you what the game is
And while I'm at it, lemme tell you what my name is
Bun Beeda, big D up in my drawls
When I pull out my piece, it make the girls all pause
Y'allz, niggas, better recognize
When ya bitch choose me, shouldn't come as a surprise
Knew she was a freak, I could see it in her eyes
And I'ma bring it out her when I get between her thighs
God damn, that's what you call a home run
I knock it out the park when I give her the long one
It's on, I'm ready, it's strong, it's steady
First I'ma get me some becky and beat up the belly
When the sheets start shiftin' and the bed starts rockin'
And the headboard's bangin', playa don't come knockin'
It's a grown folks party, we don't need no kids
And I ain't tryna blow you up, but gurl yo pussy the shit

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now
