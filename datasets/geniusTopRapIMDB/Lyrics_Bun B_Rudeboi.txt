Rudeboi Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah you know
Oktober
Oh, I

[Chorus: Classik Mussik]
Bless, and you'll be respected (respect)
Respect the ways of the old
'Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance (has no place for acceptance)
The day Selassie I come
Hear me now
[Verse 1: Bun B]
Check, check, check out my melody
I got the killer flow, call it lyrical felony (lyrical felony)
I got more melanin than Melanie
So mothafuck what a fuckboy is tellin' me
I'm lit so they inhalin' me
Since I'm iller, no man be triller
No woman, no cry, fuck her, I didn't feel love (didn't feel love)
Past the plantain, take a shot of tequila
Selecta, come back, rewind, now wheel up
I get respect on every road that I travel on
'Cause me not deal with the fuckery of Babylon
Them haffi know me, I the don, no lie
So mandem back off when we walk by, Selassie I, come!

[Chorus: Classik Mussik]
Bless, and you'll be respected (respect)
Respect the ways of the old
'Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance (has no place for acceptance)
The day Selassie I come
Hear me now

[Verse 2: Bun B]
We comin' straight from the motherland (motherland)
And it's designed for the mind of my brother man
Who put it together, no other man
And we came to tell it to the world, we can't keep it undercover, man
Roots and culture, shaped up and sculptured
No, you can't have it back, you pussyclaat vulture
You're dealin' bombaclaat business, don't test me now
'Cause man a real shotta, bwoy, you no stress me now
Pass the ganja, inhale the flavor
Praise the most high, bwoy, respect your savior
Rudeboi behavior, second to none
Mandem run when I pum-pum-pum-pum, Selassie I, come!

Bless, and you'll be respected (yeah) (respect)
Respect the ways of the old
'Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance (what up) (has no place for acceptance)
The day Selassie I come
Hear me now

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Murder!
Grew up such a rudeboy, now me just a rudeman
I am not a human, pocket full of blue man
Walkin' 'pon the stars gets me higher than a moon man
Send him to his ancestors, family reunion
Young Mula, bitch, them no more run with mi squadron
Dem say dem some goons, what's a goon to a goblin?
Underground King, Likkle Wayne, dreadlock Rasta
She say she a queen, she play games, she play possum
Tunechi got no ceilings, yeah, but Tunechi got more millions
The snake on me two billion, the fuck with the reptilian
Hit you from your blindside, got goons in your peripheral
Bun B a legend, period, rest in peace Pimp, I sip for you
Bless

[Chorus: Classik Mussik]
Bless, and you'll be respected (respect)
Respect the ways of the old
'Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance (has no place for acceptance)
The day Selassie I come
Hear me now
[Outro: Classik Mussik]
