Sext Me Lyrics[Chorus: Just Brittany]
I'm lookin sexy, I'm feelin sexy
You wanna sex me, then take a picture baby text me
You wanna freak me all you gotta do is Tweet me
But don't you trick me baby treat me

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Yeah, well this is dedicated to the opposite sex, it's for
All the lonely ladies with no man lyin next to ya
Need a real trill man to rub and caress ya (ress ya)
Lay you down and undress ya (dress ya)
Put it on ya and bless ya (bless ya)
Baby look no further, I'm the one you need to say yes ta (yes ta)
I don't need nobody else up in this bedroom, just ya
Yeah (yeah) cause you and me we makes a hell of a pair
I like you scratchin my back, you like me pullin yo' hair
And I don't care - Black, White, Puerto Rican or Asian
European, Cape Verdean, Creole or Cajun
Domestic, international, even cosmopolitan
College girls, housewives, workin or you modellin (hold up)
I'm lovin all shapes, all colors, all sizes (sizes)
In the dark or in the broad day with no surprises (prizes)
I got a suite that's on reserve at the telly (telly)
Ready, willin and waitin so just hit me on my celly (celly)
It's goin down
[Chorus: Just Brittany]
I'm lookin sexy, I'm feelin sexy
You wanna sex me, then take a picture baby text me
You wanna freak me all you gotta do is Tweet me
But don't you trick me baby treat me

[Verse 2: Candi Redd]
Oh, Candi Redd!
2 A.M. and we gon' get it in, afterparty we gon' kick it off
Put your favorite dessert all over my body and let you li-lick it off
I'mma light these Roman therapy candles and grind slow while undressin
Move yo' way in this lingerie baby, come open yo' present
Up and down like a light switch, I ain't Just Brittany but it make me sing
I'm all over that night stick, keep beatin it up like I'm Rodney King
From behind with a tight grip, go on 'head boy do yo' thing
Tryin to let you hit it with that flex when you on yo' way to see me with that text

[Verse 3: Surreal]
I bet the neighbors know his name the way he beat it out the frame
Surreal ride it like an 8-0-8, that sex good, he know it's great
I work them hips, I work that face, throw it back and he daddy stroke
Put whip cream on that kitty cat, eat it up and it purr back
Pull my hair, arch my back, forget them clothes, throw 'em on the flo'
He grip my thighs I'm goin live; Miss Aquafina, he know I'm wild
What he do? Just text me, you wanna freak me? Just Tweet me
Hit the flex when you sext me; I'm on my way so he can sex me

I'm lookin sexy, I'm feelin sexy
You wanna sex me, then take a picture baby text me
You wanna freak me all you gotta do is Tweet me
But don't you trick me baby treat me

[Verse 4: TroubleSum]
I'm a sexting, model
Lookin like lemonade in a Coke bottle, 'llac with my left eye's followed
So boulders try to hit on me harder than Drago
W-T-F O-M-G; semi-colon parenthesis
T-T-Y-L on the screen (uh-huh)
Your girls'll say kick on the touch screen
Smart Phones, sleek, my presence make him hurry (uh-ha)
So they all wanna talk sweet to my +BlackBerry+

[Verse 5: RawLT]
I'm in my wife beater, +Boy Shorts+, laid back, comfortable
H-2-O, not RFL; flow so incredible
Candy sweet, edible, fo' G, digital
Tell me what you need but please don't call, gotta sell it back good, hands on
Rollin on kush, roll thin, they appetite large, V-12 engine
Scorpio, I handle my business, no tip but I stole what I finish
Roll like thick I got that holla back, make her wanna follow that
Look daddy, no hands - can you handle that?
[Chorus: Just Brittany]
I'm lookin sexy, I'm feelin sexy
You wanna sex me, then take a picture baby text me
You wanna freak me all you gotta do is Tweet me
But don't you trick me baby treat meEmbed
