Stop Playin Lyrics[Verse 1: Bun B]
I'm the one-man army, Bun B
I've never been taken out
I keep emcees breaking out
I'm bringing real rap back and taking the faking out
I'm clearing all the bullshit out the way to make a vacant route
OK, now let the real niggas roll through
It's going for you new niggas and the old too
It was some bullshit then and it's some bullshit now
So I'm just tryna keep the bullshit down
They say the rap game needs balance to keep it level
Just like the EQ with the bass, mid, and treble
And yeah, that's true but if you wanna point blame
Just be careful about the motherfucking way you aim
You blame radio, internet, and politics
But see, we all really know it's just a pile of shit
You not playing cause your music ain't hitting
The people don't like you, stop hating, start quitting muthafucka
[Hook: Bun B]
You saying you the man, that's the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do
It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Niggas be lying, talking about they bust a heater
Once I see him, they be more like Justin Bieber
Leave it, my rivals underground like Skyzoo's how I do
I have em laying on the ground bleeding
Butt naked with a bullet in his motherfucking head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in being in the place where
I'm wearing Gucci mane, getting white boy wasted
I tell a nigga break bread or take lead
I'm trying to get rid of this weight, K-Fed
Me and Bun got the gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime fame, to you that ain't the prom
I'm not a fan of no man, I'm not Stan
Flow like Niagra, that's why they go, God damn
I whip it up in the kitchen like pots and pans
I'm God-like, when I'm praying I should stand
You might also like[Hook: Bun B]
You saying you the man, that's the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do
It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing

[Verse 3: Redman]
No rapper can rap quite like I can
Now take your best-known rapper and make him a fan
I'm the man homeboy, been running the block
I make you say Go Reggie and do the wop, ha ha
And I'm Doc, the niggas are hating
My flow and your swag, it don't relate
Cause I'm grrreat, jewels like Frosted Flakes
Light-skinned, just one shade darker than Drake
I hold weight when the camera rolling
It's like golf how I got the US Open
Nigga I'm nice, I see you scoping
Think twice before you move that close in
That's my dosage, call me tomorrow
Look so fly when you call me a barber
Everything I write, call me the author
Baby I'm back, sorry I lost you
[Hook: Bun B]
You saying you the man, that's the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do
It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing2Embed
