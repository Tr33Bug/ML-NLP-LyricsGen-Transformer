Swang On â€™Em Lyrics[Intro: Enigma]
We ride, we ride 22s or better
We, we ride, we ride 22's or better
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em

[Hook: Enigma]
Now if I catch you at the light
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
That candy paint ain't lookin right
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We, we ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
[Verse 1: Bun B]
Now, if you come down to this Dirty South (South)
Better watch your ears
'Cause country boys talk with a dirty mouth (Mouth)
And they on them corners
And they hustling up that dirty D (D)
Better watch them dirty boys
Down South, we keep it dirty, G (G)
I know you heard of me
I got that work (Work)
Man, I got that white, and I got that purp
And I got that brown and I got that green
When I'm in your town and I hit your scene
In a candy-painted car that'll sit so clean
Trunk on pop with the fifth on lean
II Trill DVD playing on my screen
Sitting on cream, man, you know what I mean?

[Hook: Enigma]
Now, if I catch you at the light
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
That candy paint ain't lookin right
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We, we ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em

Now if you come down to this T-E-X (X)
Better show some love
'Cause homie, you don't wanna see me plex (Plex)
When we 'bout that paper
It ain't no shortstop in my cashier checks (Checks)
I get full of ana
And get to standing upon these niggas' necks (Necks)
Betta show respect
Or we pulling out them Tecs (Tecs)
Man, I got them Macs, and I got them Ks
And I got them nines, and I got them As
R-15s and them two-two-treys
Playa, when I ride, I'ma ride for days
No, I don't miss, and I sure don't graze
Bring what you got, and I bet it don't faze
I'm a trill-ass nigga, man, it's in my ways

[Hook: Enigma & Lupe Fiasco]
Now, if I catch you at the light
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
That candy paint ain't looking right
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em (Yeah! Lupe)
We ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We, we ride, we ride 22s or better (Better)
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em (Ha, yep, ugh)
[Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco]
Now I'm Chi-Town-born and I'm Chi-Town-bred
Call me Westside Lu
But I know about them Northside blues
And them Southside reds (Ugh)
I run the F-N-F crew
'Til my man Chilly Chill come home and he back on deck
My garage keep a very fast car
Keep a classy gold chain wrapped around my neck
Yeah, I came from the left, but I'm downright fresh
Speak on! How you on a song Bun B on?
Complete 180, how crazy has he gone?
How strong is the brand of the D that he on?
How come he do what he want
And never do what we want? (Woo!)
I'm Rick James, and this game
Is a white leather couch for me to plant my feet on
The Murphys didn't jump me, told me to get comfy
Even brought the loveseat for me to spill my drink on
Willie D gave me my stamp
Shout to Mike Jones and the Swisha camp
That boy Kyleon and the Rap-A-Lot Ranch
The Boss of the North and The People's Champ
Coolest nigga, what? Coolest nigga, what?
Getting swallowed by them city lights
Ball 'til I'm benched and I put it on the Pimp
F-N-F U-P, U-G-K for life

[Hook: Enigma]
Now if I catch you at the light
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
That candy paint ain't looking right
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We, we ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em

[Outro: Enigma]
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em
We, we ride, we ride 22s or better
Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em1Embed
