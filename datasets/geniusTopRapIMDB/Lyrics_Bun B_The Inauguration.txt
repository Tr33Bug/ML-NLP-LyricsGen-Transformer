The Inauguration Lyrics[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Southern States of America
We gather here today to bring you the beginning of the new era
And now the speaker of the South, J. Prince

[Interlude: J. Prince]
Aww yeah... Rap-A-Lot back in the house once again
With the trillest of the trill, Bun B
The new President of the South
Yo Bun, it's your time
And we dedicate this one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffered at the hands of the enemy
[Verse: Bun B]
It's been a long time comin' but it finally came
For Bun B to get his motherfuckin' shot in the game
I put mo' work in than an average trill nigga can put
And I'mma gangsta from my head to my foot
Blacker than soot, I got the hood behind me
The street's co-signed me
Head ported in the ghetto (man), you know where to find me
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment I run the South and everything down here
From the corners and cuts, trap spots and blocks
Whether it's rappin' or work, I got the shit on lock
I ain't wit' all that back talkin', sneak dissin', or plexin'
I'mma tell ya how I feel cause I'mma god damn Texan
'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the fraud
Cause this a White House of cards, filled wit' nuthin but broads
We gon' run them hoes out and put some trill niggas in
Cause what happened in New Orleans, should never happen again
They been sittin' on they ass, doin' much about nuthin
For too god damn long, and I'm tired of the frontin'
I'mma instigate a change from the motherfuckin' top
Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people gotta stop
So I'm here to make a stand (stand) and take up the slack
Dirty South, Prince, Deezy I got ya motherfuckin' back
It's a new king on the throne, and his crown is a hat
It say "Free Pimp C," now what's fuckin' wit' that?
Hail to the chief {*echoes*}You might also likeEmbed
