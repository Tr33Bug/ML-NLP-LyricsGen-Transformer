Trillionaire Lyrics[Intro: T-Pain]
I know they hatin on me, cause I'm the man (cause I'm the man)
I'm too trill homie (trill homie), I don't give a damn (I don't give a damn)
I'm a self made (self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
I'm a self made (I'm a self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
From the underground to the top, I came from the bottom
Trill niggas don't stop, man I'm goin harder
Self made (self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
I'm a self made (I'm a self made), trillionaaaaaire

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Okay, let's get this shit crackalatin ('latin), no more procrastinatin ('natin)
They told me Bun don't hesitate, don't keep these bastards waitin (waitin)
I'm puttin egos at check and I'm so emasculatin ('latin)
People stop to stare and say "damn this nigga's fascinatin" ('natin)
We blowin 'dro up in the air, you smell it? That's the fragrance (fragrance)
I got the focus, got the heart and I got the patience (patience)
You hatin bitch, get off my dick, look like you on some gay shit (gay shit)
I'm tryin to take this to the mountain top, Appalachian ('lachian)
But it's a rocky road (road) and I'm still movin up
And ain't no movin us, so keep it pushin, get to movin bro (for real)
You might be new to me but you know I ain't new to ya
Go ask the white boys, they say he's totally tubular (dude)
Fuckin bad bitches, rub my dick against their uvula
Everytime I hit the streets, it's like a fuckin movie bro (damn)
You know what I do to ya, send gladiators through to ya
They gon' leave ya chopped up, like they was DJ Screwin ya, hold up
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Yeah, I know they hatin on me (on me), cause I'm the man (cause I'm the man)
I'm too trill homie (trill homie), I don't give a damn (I don't give a damn)
I'm a self made (self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
I'm a self made (self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
From the underground to the top, I came from the bottom
Trill niggas don't stop, man I'm goin harder
Self made (self made), trillionaire (trillionaire)
I'm a self made (self made), trillionaaaaire

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Okay, let's get this shit poppin off (off), from the go know I'm a boss (boss)
I don't fuck with lames and do my dirt nigga without a loss (loss)
I keep it pimpin, fly ass hoes come in and out the loft (loft)
When you get fettuccine, you don't need a lot of sauce (sauce)
I gets my Gucci on, my baby likes a lot of Prada (Prada)
She go and shop until she drop, she know Don Dada got her (got her)
But she not shotgun in the slab, oh no I got a shotter (shotter)
He keep that shotgun in the slab and roll without a nada (nada)
He keep his eyes wide open, he's a hater spotter (spotter)
And when they roll up on me wrong, then he's a hater dropper (dropper)
And he don't mess around when niggas try to play Big Papa (Papa)
He keep it gangsta nigga, he go gone and sprayed the chopper (chopper)
Cause I don't roll with fake people and I never will (will)

Baby boy, it's about to go down
