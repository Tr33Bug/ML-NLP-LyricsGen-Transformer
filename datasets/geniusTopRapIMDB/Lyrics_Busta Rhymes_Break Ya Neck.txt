Break Ya Neck Lyrics[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, check it out, see
The only thing you need to do right here is
Is nod your fucking head
Yeah, yeah
Break ya fucking neck, bitches
Yeah, yeah
Here we go now
Where we going now?
Where we going now?
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Just give it away, nigga
Yeah, here we go now
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Tell me, what you really wanna do? (Come here, ma)
Talk to a nigga, talk to me
You look like you could really give it to a nigga
From the way you talk and the way ya try to walk for me
The way you really try to put it on a dawg
Doin' it like ya never did before for me
The way you break yo' back, and I break yo' neck
And the way you try to put it on the floor for me
(Come on) Come on (Come on), oh yeah
Tell me where my niggas is at (Okay)
Lemme address y'all niggas one time
While I lock that down and I hit you with that
(With what?) That bomb shit
Y'all niggas know all day we be making it drop
Y'all niggas know every time I come through
This motherfucker, where we always takin' the ride
(So let me do this, bitch)
Y'all niggas know when we come, we be makin' it flop
The way we makin' it hot'll make a nigga wanna stop
Get money, then cash that check for me
All my niggas just bust yo' TEC for me
Everybody from every hood, bang yo' head
'Til you break your motherfucking neck for me

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Just let me give you real street shit
To ride in yo' shit with
Recline yo' seat, rewind this heat
Keep bouncin' up and down these streets
So nod yo' head and
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Bang yo' head until you start to
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck

Come along now (Let's put it down, nigga)
When I bounce back and they know I done caught my breath
Y'all niggas all know how we do
When the way we bang niggas in the head, and we do it to death
(Reach fo' dem backwoods)
The fire boy, you know we bakin' a ounce
I know you love the way we be givin' you the music
Making you bounce
Now fuck it up just a little for my niggas
Every time we come through
Niggas know that we did it for y'all (Uh-huh)
And the way we do it for the people
Niggas know we always give it to y'all
I said, bounce (Come on)
In the day time or the night, when ya creepin' along
Well, just bang this shit up in the truck
While you break yo' neck, now, motherfucker, try to figure my flow
See the way we come right through
(When we come right through)
We be always blowin' the spot, again and again
And make a nigga really wanna stop
Better tell yo' crew, yo' peeps
All my niggas better put they troops on
And gather up your soldiers, nigga
You know you better keep yo' boots on
All my niggas in the place (Ayo)
Wave your hands high now, and the way we put it down
Make a nigga wonder what he really gonna try now
What ya really wanna do?
Just place your bet and put ya money where ya mouth is (Ah-hoo)
All my niggas in the street, just break ya neck
And keep on bouncing
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Just let me give you real street shit
To ride in yo' shit with
Recline yo' seat, rewind this heat
Keep bouncin' up and down these streets
So nod yo' head and
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga
Bang yo' head until you start to
Break ya neck, nigga
Break ya neck, nigga

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Here we go now
And you know everytime Busta-Bus be holding the fort
My nigga watch how we shutting it down
The way we put it on, coming through like a steamroller
Me and Dre, nigga, ain't no fucking around
My nigga (What?), yeah, what up?
Me and my team got a link
'Cause you know we stay chopping it up
And when we get up in the club
All of my niggas at the bar know we lockin' it up
And we get a little (High)
And we get a little (Drunk)
And we get a little crunk (Come on)
Lemme give y'all niggas some shit
That'll make you wanna bang this out yo' trunk (Come on)
Get money, then cash that check for me
All my niggas just bust yo' TEC for me
Everybody from every hood, bang yo' head
'Til you break ya motherfuckin' neck for me
