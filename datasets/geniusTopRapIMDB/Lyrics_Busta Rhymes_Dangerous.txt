Dangerous Lyrics[Produced by Rashad Smith]

[Intro]
Yeah, 'nother one of them Flipmode joints
Busta Rhymes, y'all, word mother, y'all (Uhh), check it out, y'all (Uhh)
Just swing to the left (Ohh), swing to the right
Make you feel good, make you feel alright
One time, feel good, yeah, y'all (Uh)
Busta Rhymes in the place, y'all (Come on)
Makin' you feel real good, y'all
Flipmode is the squad in the place, y'all
[Verse 1]
Buckwild to all of my niggas (Ha) who don't care
Floss like a bunch of young black millionaires (Uh-huh)
Makin' you run, me and my dunn stackin' my ones (Woo)
Floss a little, invest up in a mutual fund (That's right)
Blowin' the horn, a sense of every day I was born (Ha)
Never dream, I see a nigga landscapin' my lawn (Uh-huh)
Dangerous, my nigga shit be accurate (Uh)
Have to get, the flow (Hoo) be so immaculate
Ayo, ayo, watchin' my dough (Ha), sippin' my Moe' (Uh-huh)
Slippin' in slow, them pretty bitches sayin' "Hello"
Anyway go ‘head (Ha) and diss, play your Oil of Olay (Uh-huh)
Little honeydip within a little Cabriola (Ha)
I don’t mean to hold you up but I got somethin' to say (Right)
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us (Ha), you know this ain’t no game to us (Uh-huh)
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin' dangerous, come on

[Chorus]
This is serious (Uh-huh)
We could make you delirious (Right)
You should have a healthy fear of us (That's right)
'Cause too much of us is dangerous (Come on)
So dangerous (Uh-huh), we so dangerous (Alright)
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous (Uh-huh)
My whole entire unit is dangerous (Come on)

Hold your breath, we swingin' it from right to left (Uh-huh)
Word to Wyclef, nigga shit be hot to death (Ha!)
Stayin' alive, you know (Hooo) only the stronger survive (Uh-huh)
Holdin' my heat, under my seat, whippin' my five
Bassline (Haa) for all of my people movin' around (Uh-huh)
Gimme' a pound, all of my niggas holdin' it down
Cuttin' you up (Ha), the new shit ruckin' you up (Uh)
Fuckin' you up (Hooo), my black hole suckin' you up
Back in the days a nigga used to be ass out (Uh-huh)
Now a nigga holdin' several money market accounts (Hahaha)
Blaze the street and the I (Hooo) would just like to announce
Feelin' my groove, my jigga-jigga makin' you bounce (That's right)
Others is fair, me and my niggas breakin' the bread (Uh-huh)
Straight gettin' it, we got you niggas holdin' your head
Afraid of us (Haa), you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin' dangerous, come on

[Verse 3]
Feelin' the heat up in the street, rockin' the beat (Uh-huh)
Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat (Right)
Comin' around all of my niggas surround me (Uh)
So much bottles (Ha) of liquor, y'all niggas’ll drown me (What?)
