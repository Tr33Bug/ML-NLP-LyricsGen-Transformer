E.L.E. 2 The Wrath of God Lyrics[Intro: Louis Farrakhan & Busta Rhymes]
What up? (What up?)
I'm sorry, your time has come
No God is present today
They need to be afraid
You need to be afraid today because the God of justice is present now
That's why he said, "Vengeance is mine"
The battle is not yours, the battle is the Lord's and God has come
The battle is on and the plagues are coming down
And no, I'm not afraid, but you need to be and especially when you see what's coming up
Because as a man soweth, the same shall he also reap
And when you have done the evil that you've done to us
And done it to others
Did you never think that there would come a day
When you would have to pay for all that crap that you have done?
Thomas Jefferson said it right, brother
He said, "I had trembled for my country
When I reflect that God is just
And that his justice cannot sleep forever"
Well, his justice has awakened
And all over the world, the nations are turning right before our eyes
And that's why Trump is saying "We gotta make America great, how, when? Again"
Because she's not great today
People are not afraid
The world has taken enough of America's evil, so death is sweeter
The son been continuing to live under white supremacy and under tyranny
So, in all, I don't care nothing about them investigating me
Or arresting me, or even killing me
But I'll tell you what
I'll tell you what, I'll give you a little warning
You killed your last man when you killed Dr. King, you will not get that chance to do that to me
And if it pleases God that you do kill me, right after you kill me, all of you gon' die
'Cause I'm not here by myself, I'm not here of myself
You can see that God must be backin' me
Otherwise, where would I get the strength to say and do what I do?
No, man, it's our time now
[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
God has sent me to make you all feel the wrath and cometh
I'm here to heat up and beat the street up, I'm back to punish
While Trump is present with a mouth screamin' louder than trumpets
While you bow to the puppets, I'ma stand and stick around for the judgment
Use the world stage with a God crown to put it down for the public
The Earth's in pain with a large pound of demonic indulgence
These devil consultants, when our streets whine, I read minds of the culprits
Kind of repulsive to expose 'em through rhymes that I'm pumpin'
Shit's kind of disruptive when I talk now, line up the subjects
I'm tired of injustice from the popes, politicians and judges
When you witness the abuse of power, sometimes it's seductive
Then I question God, why create a creature that is so destructive?
Hold all your grudges and focus while you create expenses
Every man is free of choice, but no man is free of consequences
Hold your suggestions and listen closely, I study lessons
Causing rain, hail, snow and earthquake and travel dimensions
The ground'll rattle, the Earth will rumble like a stampede of cattle
Eleven hundred twenty feet per second, faster than sound travel
How many more protests? How many more marches?
Zero results, it's so grotesque, don't even get me started
Then count on my mama, she knows best, fight for the dearly departed
God is the armor, we so blessed, let's zoom in on a target
From a certificate, a merit down to a felony
For one's actions of these, justices will reward a penalty
Pants too tight, nigga, it's been part of the plan, fool
They fucked around and made the demasculinization of man cool
Appreciate my pop, never stop 'til the death of me
Raise the silly men and I'll never disgrace my legacy
Fuck following trends that don't make us men is the recipe
Care for your women, your mother and children, it's necessity
In the last couple of years, you niggas look like you need therapy
Mentally it appears as if the imbalance is chemically
How you gon' try to stop God's work?
That could never happen, even after I'm back in the Lord's dirt
I'm here to present the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2
I'm only here to present and bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2
