Light Your Ass on Fire Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
What you say your name was?
Well, um, lookin' real sexy right now
You and your girls are lookin' good
Look, why don't y'all take off y'all jackets?
What's your name, baby? Word? Okay
Tell your friend right here, this, this my man Busta

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Ha, I know you starving for this shit
Baby, I'm feelin' your hunger
I'm so clean, call a nigga Felix Ungar
So what if I said it? Baby, I'm still gon' tell ya
I hope your ass bigger than Willona and Thelma
Listen, it's Busta Rhymes, bitch, I ain't never fail ya
Your ass all over like paraphernalia, hmm
See, the police gon' jail ya
For walkin' around with the kind of ass that'll kill ya now
Don't worry 'bout it, I got money to bail ya
Shorty stackin' like a mule, type of shit that'll scare ya
Headboard bang, bump the side of ya head
Watch how ya ass spread spill all off the side of the bed now, hmm
Now what you do to the dread? Baby, your ass really changed
What he initially said, because a nigga dead
But fuck 'em, 'c-c-c-cause now we vibin' and talkin' and shit
I love to hear your ass go (ga-ga-goon) when you walkin' and shit
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
I'll light your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
Bitch, I'll light that ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Bust it, baby, I know you probably really
Need a tablecloth to cover yo' ass
Diggin' in your pocket while you're rubbin' yo ass
Shit so big, just put the club in yo' ass
Prep the H2, park it right in front of yo' ass
I see your little gap between your cunt and yo' ass
And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt with yo' ass
I'm sayin', hmm, the shit'll spread like a rash
The way they ass wiggles, see I got the shit on a smash, now listen
I light the L, smell a whiff of the hash
And bag all the bitches, now watch you see me zip in a flash
I'm sayin', hmm, now I'ma put you on blast
Just like a tint window when you put your shit on the glass
Bust right through the window then it sit on the dash
And have a nigga drivin' reckless 'til you makin' him crash
(Ha, c'mon) We makin' money and shit
Now pop your muffin while we be watchin' you shakin' your shit

Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
I'll light your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
Bitch, I'll light that ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Welcome to Hot-and-Hazyville
It make you wanna dance 'til you break your heels
I know you love the way the God make you feel
Now watch me get deeper than a Navy Seal (Navy Seal?)
It got a crazy feel, shit feel like you in a danger field
Hypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real
That's exactly why we call this one Hazyville (Hazyville)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Baby, just shake ya ass 'til you spread on the floor
I noticed that your ass too big for your drawers
You need a, a chiropractor just to marry yo' ass
To tell the truth, you need a tractor just to carry yo' ass
Fo' real-a, you motherfuckers probably think that I'm playin'
All bitches love to talk and all that other shit I be sayin'
And goin', hmm, see how you puttin' it down
I love the way you shake it, throw it around
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, like your ass on fire
Like your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
I'll light your ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
Bitch, I'll light that ass on fire
Move, girl, I'll light your ass on fire
