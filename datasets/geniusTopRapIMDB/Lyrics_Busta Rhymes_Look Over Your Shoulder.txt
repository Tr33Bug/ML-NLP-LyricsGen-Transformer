Look Over Your Shoulder Lyrics[Intro: Michael Jackson & Busta Rhymes]
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, I know, it's been a minute
Don't you know?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Michael Jackson]
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the Chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah, yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah, yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
My share of deeds and R.I.P.s
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
I'm 'posed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons, the diamond rings
I'm full with time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the gold, the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream)
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya (Woo)

Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, yeah, you need me (Woo)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes & Michael Jackson]
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo)
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas, completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your broad up (You guinea pig)
See me, now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder, boy, and wonder (Woo)
[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Nikki Grier]
Don't you know, baby? (Ooh, woah)
Don't you know, baby? (Mhm, oh, yeah)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me (Whenever you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me

[Outro: Chris Rock & Michael Jackson]
That's right
He got catalog, you understand? (Just look— Just over your shoulders)
This is the motherfucking human iPod out this motherfucker, okay?
He can go all day (Go all day)34Embed
