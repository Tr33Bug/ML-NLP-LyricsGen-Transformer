Pass the Courvoisier Lyrics[Intro: Busta Rhymes + Diddy]
Oh, yeah!
I like this
We bust this
Feed 'em some more
Ladies and gentlemen;
It's star time!
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
The time you've all been waitin' for!
This is a Bad Boy-Flipmode collaboration!
Ha! Ha ha ha!
Come on
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes + Diddy]
Shake ya ass (Come on)
Watch yourself (Okay)
I'm the man (Let's go)
And no one else (Come on)
Rawr, rawr!—like a dungeon dragon
Still king of the flow, while my mink be draggin'
I said I'm sick with the flow, stick a dick in ya ho
Make them shut down the club, we threw a brick at the door
Shit, I'm the number man, hot, like Summer Jam
Slick like Fonzarelli, and Rich like Cunningham
I stretch 'em like rubber bands
I make 'em say—
Oh, shit, the bitch got up and left with another man
(Say what!?)
What is you talkin' 'bout?
There's nothin' to talk about (See?)
You just a walk-about
I light a long L, just blowin' the smoke about
See, we serious with it, there ain't nothin to joke about
And while I scope it out, I love the way you bounce (Come on)
Shake ya shit, tuck in ya ass, and poke it out (Come on)

[Hook]
Give me the Henny, you can give me the Crissy
You can pass me the Remi, but—
(Pass the Courvoisier)
Give me the ass, you can give me the dough
You can give me 'dro, but—
(Pass the Courvoisier)
Give me some money, you can give me some cars
When you give me ya bitch make sure you—
(Pass the Courvoisier)
Give me some shit, you can give me the cribs
You can give me whatever, just—
(Pass the Courvoisier)

We got these hoes lovin' it
They gettin' familiar man, they screamin' out my government (Sean John)
I like them in twins like Doublemint (Don Juan)
We be bangin' all types of chicks from here to (Hong Kong)
The best dressed bitches actin' all cute to my shit
And get the wlyin out they actin like a boot to my shit
Sorta go a distance from yours, we holdin Jewish money now
Down to the credit card different from yours
It's the law for me to get in ya drawers, I run the city, of course! They call me Mr. Diddy, the boss
You know me, the only G to willy a Porshe
We get dough in all land the size of Philly, of course
Can imagine the price that my jewlery really would cost
We go to clubs with a briefcase and a half milli to floss (Damn)
Fuck around and you can really get tossed
Ken Griffey flow, call me Alaska 'cause I be the king of the frost
What you can do is—

Give me the Henny, you can give me the Crissy

[Verse 3]
Five thousand boomin' watts
I got a thousand karats all over my watch
Travel lighty, flow back easy
Back with the Bus-a-Bus and the P.D
We stay livin at the top of the charts
The shit we be spittin' be state of the art
We rockin' ya block shit, wildin' like rock shit
Strapped with the gun and the street corner hot shit
Now we sittin' in the drop top—pretty
Knock, knock; who is he?
—Bus-a-Bus, I put it down in this, I get busy
(Ahem, excuse me Bus-a-Bus)
We controllin' the city, if you ain't know, and—
By the way, my name is Puff
Yo, it ain't my fault ya dame corrupt
We went from Henny, to Remi, to Moe, to Belve, to—
The game is us
We gettin' money, muh'fucker, in the game we trust
Everytime we put it down, reppin' the name is a must
(Flipmode!)

[Outro: P. Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just pass the Courvoisier
Yeah, pass me that Louie, that motherfuckin', that, that iron groove
Nineteen vintage motherfuckin' medieval
Ow, bitch, yeah, just pass the courvoisier
That, that shit make, that dark shit just me, make me wanna fuck
Straight up, I just need to know
Just make a nigga dick hard as—
