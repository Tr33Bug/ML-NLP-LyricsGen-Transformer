Touch It (Remix 2.0) Lyrics[Hook]
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, start – format it
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, start – format it

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh, now you know who the God be
Back runnin' the city
And you know who the squad
Flipmode
Look see ain't nothin' changed
Back with the remix
With the Queens
(TURN IT UP!)
When you see me in the spot
Better respect each other
Y'all already know where I'm rep
Ain't no reason to check it
And I know that
You ain't messing with me
Just for the record
So instead
I'mma let Mary J. Blige
Come and set it
[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
(Get Low Mary)
Maybe you can guess
Who it is
Mary J. Blige, I'm 'bout to
Handle my biz
I'm on my grown woman
Still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my peoples
Doin' a bid
(TURN IT UP!)
Now you know
Who's really the Queen, deliver the mail
Seven Hundred Thirty Thousand
First week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch
Lookin' all pale;
While I'm on a yacht, overseas
Doin' my nails

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
(Get Low Digga)
Now he sittin' there, lookin' stuck
He thinkin' cause he spent
A little dough, "I'm 'gon fuck."
If money ain't a thing
I'm sayin' let a chick know;
Type to empty an account
How far you willin' to go?
(TURN IT UP!)
Now he hoppin' on the jet
He ain't wasting no time
Told me all expenses paid
Any place I could find
Hit the islands in the Winter
Trickin' all on his dime
Ain't no alpha in this world
Who is better than mine
They wanna
You might also like[Hook]

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I'm jinglin' baby (Go Ahead 'Mami)
Don't I look charmin'
Put your lips up on me
Kiss it, touch it, good
Yes I wish you would (TURN IT UP!)
You like to see me
When I dip, baby, dip
Don't I look like I got Beyonce's hips
Lookin' like I could be Nia Long
Boy, you smokin' that
Cheech and Chong

[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks]
I know what it feels like
I been gone for a minute
But I'm back
Chinchilla on with a fitted
Everybody talk money
Everybody gon' live it
That bowl of bread smaller
Than the arm
(TURN IT UP!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing
It's blue in the ring
If you had it like this
You probably do it the same
But you won't cause you broke
All you do is complain
After the club, I'mma put a few
In the range and let 'em
[Hook]

[Verse 6: Papoose]
Five boroughs of death
You don't understand
I got New York City
In the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist
And let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world
With a New York Nemesis
(TURN IT UP!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky
Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle
Finger screamin' F you
Rock Ice in Manhattan
So there's the ring finger;
You know I had to keep
Brooklyn on the trigger finger

[Verse 7: DMX]
Swizz is the monster, X is the beast;
Fuckin' with Bus, everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets
I'm tired of talkin' to y'all niggas;
I'm stickin' a fork in y'all niggas
(TURN IT UP!)
When I hit 'em, man
That truck come get 'em, man
Roughed up how I did 'em, man
Ain't no remorse for the corpse, truth is
Can't I.D. the body, nigga toothless

[Hook]

[Verse 8: Eminem]
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact, BOOM on the track
Contact! (Shady!) Guess who's back?
Everybody in the place take a look at the face
I disappeared without a trace, he's a little high, ain't he?
New year, ooh yeah, who's here, new gear
Full gear, spookier, AAH! AAH! AAH!
I'm 'bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I don't even know why I'm screamin', AAH! AAH! AAH!
And I'm screamin' on the wrong part of the song
Bus, you did it again, let's turn it up more
Let's turn it up loud, let 'em know we ain't playin'
And I don't even know what the chorus is sayin'
(Touch it, bring it, pay it)
Just give me the beat, Bus, with THE BIG BANG!3Embed
