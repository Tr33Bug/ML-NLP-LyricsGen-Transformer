Why Stop Now Lyrics[Intro: Chris Brown]
Turn my fuckin' beat up
Turn my fuckin' beat up
Turn my fuckin' beat up
Turn my fuckin' beat up
SAK PASE

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Uh, yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
(Now!)
Every single time I get up in the buildin'
And I touch it and I get it poppin'
You can never stop it and how long it got 'em hung in
And they're wonderin' on how my nigga does it
When I'm blackin' every hood and every street and then I flood it
Makin' every DJ wanna bring it back and then they robbin'
Makin' other niggas starvin', ain't no food up in the cupboards
See the way I got 'em spittin', now I got a nigga runnin'
From the way that I be gettin' on the beat and I'll be
Dumbin' (I'll be dumbin')
Shit, I want see y'all do that on YouTube
Lemme gibble in and dabble with the flow
Lemme show you niggas how I really mix it up (Yep)
I'ma slow it down a little
Naw, think ya better mean to flip it up (Kill 'em)
Switch it up, I'll probably pitch it, never wanna see ya
Bottles in ya hands, nigga, get it up (Ho!)
Throw my money all around until it hit the ground
I'm makin' shorty work before she pick it up (Woo!)
You know the shit was kinda dead 'fore I had to
Step up all up in the spot and really lift it up (Damn)
And soon I bust a nigga head in and then I throw a little
Coke up in the street until they sniff it up
And see they love it when I come and hit it up
I kill it 'til the nigga 'bout to get to steppin' up
And need to betta know that I can do anythin' that I want
Niggas already be knowin' I'ma give it up

Yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Alright, I'ma let you niggas calm down for a minute
And get your shit together
This what I need y'all to do
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, let's go
Okay, come around, see me put it down just a little bit
Bowl and I'm heavy y'all already know exactly what to do
Somebody better get the crown when a nigga spit (Hurry)
Make sure you polish it a little 'fore you bring it to me
While I lock it down with another hit (You already)
And you ain't even gotta ask
When you already know another bang is what you gonna get (Yeah)
Better bounce when a nigga say so
It's like magic when a nigga spit, presto (Ha!)
And if you're really with me and you ready, let's go (Huh)
Ride with a nigga like we on the metro (Oh!)
Y'all already know I'ma kill anyone
Anywhere, anythin' from the very intro
And I beat the most everythin'
And you should have knew that from the very get-go
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
(Go!)
Just watch â€˜em close, see how them bug on how the god delivers
Now we're blackin' in this bitch, until the police come and get us
Watch it, you can see it (The Conglomerate)
Who fuckin' with us?
I could shit and fart all on the beat and kill a couple niggas (Oh!)
Everybody know what the fuck it is (True)
And then I bang and I'ma beat them in the heads
Niggas 'til I split a couple wigs (Boom)
And you know that when I got him
And I hit him from the bottom
You don't want it, nigga, really though
And I'll be doin' anythin' that I want
It don't matter where we're at, I'ma let it go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
