You better keep my music bangin 'til it disconnect
Woo-Hah! Got you all in check
Architects gettin' money let me cash my check!
Woo-Hah! Got you all in check

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes | Ol’ Dirty Bastard]
Busta Rhymes up in the place with the ODB
Busta Rhymes, you rhyme first, yeah, you rhyme after me (Oh, word!)
The ODB was nominated for a Grammy
Congratulations Bust with your solo LP!
Putting scratches in my lyrics like my name was Kid Capri
Blow up the spot regardless of your nationality
And I'm the Dirty Dawg can't fuck with me!
This, this, this nuh took Mariah on a fantasy!
Yo, I had a wet dream that I was bonin' Jody Wately
Doin' what children ain't allowed to see!
But we 'bout to blow up the spot momentarily
Woo-Hah! Ran stupid all throughout the country
And for youse to kill me? That wasn't meants to be
I know it feel good! Motherfuckers want the recipe!
And whose the vigilante in the place to be?
The ODB, Busta Rhyme, real qualityyy!
My top priority is to be the voluntarily
Nigga that rip your ass for free (Ha! Haha! Ha!)
Yah, yah, yahhh, yah
Yah, yah, yahhh, yah
Ooh, baby, I like it raw, get with me!
Baby, it's pure ecstasy!
Yo, everytime I design a flow, you see in 3D
Flawless victory knock a nigga out! One, two, three!

'Cause Flipmode is the squad that controls your set
Woo-Hah! 'Cause I got you all in check
We on some outta space shit like you watch Star Treeek
Woo-Hah! Got you all in check

Woo-Hah! Got you all in check

[Bridge: Ol’ Dirty Bastard]
*Inhaling*, dibby-dibby-dah, *inhaling*, then I pass a lot
*Inhaling*, let me get more hot, *inhaling*, represent the spot
A mad squad when it comes to the art of rapping
I gotta keeep your hands clapping!
Yo, when you look at me, *inhaling*, the type of guy I be
I'm a dirty dancer, making girlies panties move
Let them fly so I can blast up the twat!
Girlies watch sayin' "God, stop getting me hot!"

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes | Ol’ Dirty Bastard]
Niggas talk shit, yo, kill the yapping
Word is bond, baby, tell me how you look so smashin'?
Now I got your head hurt, you need an aspirin
Bashin your head in the wall, time for some action
If you want a small piece, well, here's a fraction
Of shit that will bust your head quick, peep the transaction
Of how we keep motherfuckers constantly crashin'
They flyest whips, think no shifts, now whose the champion?
I bring the wicked flow, like the latest fashion!
Satisfaction, baby, keep your camera flashing
I was busting the sperm cells mixed with Old Gold
Fungus mold, 'fore-you-should-list slum gold
Played for a wild Irish rose
Fat ass nigga, slim bitch with no clothes
In the backseat of a 'back sixty-nine Oldsmoz
Are your soles and toes in the windows? Oh, my hoes!
Hey, believe me when I say so
You're in need ofarealnig-c-ca-ca-ca-crambone
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes | Ol’ Dirty Bastard]
The Flipmode is the squad that controls your set
Woo-Hah! 'Cause I got you all in check
We on some outta space shit like you watch Star Treeek
Woo-Hah! Got you all in check
You better keep my music bangin 'til it disconnect
Woo-Hah! 'Cause I got you all in check
Architects gettin' money let me cash my check!
Woo-Hah! Got you all in check

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
