10,000 miles Lyrics[Intro]
Lookin' up out my Benz
Killa Cam nah nah nah
Killa Cam nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I need to say sorry, y'all already knew it
But my pride won't let me do it, though
Heard that, it's pride, won't let me do it though
Best girl in the world, I might've blew it
Like a small condom, I'll get through it though
I'll get through it though
Heard that, we can do it though
I cheated, another one in the books for me
She clean, roll weed, and cook for me
Ain't hear from the kids, she would look for me
Now she so mad that she won't even look at me
Damn iPhones and cameras, nights in Atlanta
Tried to bring you gifts, she said, "You ain't Santa"
I'm just showin' manners, she reachin' for the hammer
She ain't got ears, they replaced with antennas
Hard to believe I messed trust up
No good or bad, just tough luck
I looked her in the eyes like, "I fucked up"
Gripped up, my life had to monetize
Made mistakes, I apologize
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Dinner, movie, a date, you know, maybe that
Some dudes relate, I want my baby back
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
I tell you a million times, I'm sorry
Wild life right here, no safari
I'm dressed up, I 'fess up
I messed up bad...
[Chorus]
Later on that night, I bought a kilo
To sell it or sniff it, man I don't know
'Cause I got pulled over by po-po
Oh no-o-o-o-o-o

[Verse 2]
Day-to-day life dealin' with reality
Lawyer got me off on a technicality
All I think about, we was Mickey and Mallory
Nothin' left but increase my salary
Uh, now money is the focus
Hustlin' president, POTUS
Anything else right now is bogus
Real estate opened up, I gave notice
Murder was the case, Calvin Broadus
Blue magic though, hokus pokus
They forgot that my dope's the dopest
Made a mil' in one week, yeah it's poppin'
Retail therapy, out shoppin'
Pulled off the lot, top droppin'
No legs on the car, but it's boppin'
Speakers in the door, so it's knockin'
I got all the keys, so I'm locked in
Felt above the law, Johnnie Cochran
And I'm off the rebound, Rodman
Woo! Let's get this money, baby
Let's get this money, baby
Ain't nothin' funny, baby
La-la-la-la-la

Later on that night, I laid in my bed
Them birds was chirpin', so I'm countin' up bread
But I can't get her up out my head
Oh man...  damn
Later on that night, I laid in my bed
Them birds was chirpin', so I'm countin' up bread
But I can't get her up out my head
Oh man...  damn2Embed
