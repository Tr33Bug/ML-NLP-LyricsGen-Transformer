Come Home With Me Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron]
Ayo, come on home with us, man
Harlem World, USA, man
Take a walk with us on our block man
See how we live
Dipset

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, yo, uh
Come on home with me, early '90s
It wasn't pearly and shiny, I was certainly grimy
'Cause I ain't have no fresh clothes
Or jewelry with the X-O's, my house had asbestos
I'm fixing up a sixty pack
Where the kitty cat? Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home with me, where my mother found my crack platter
Threw it away so I snapped at her, back slapped her
She picked up a bat like McGwire
For that matter hit me, I was back at her
Come home where I ducked the DTs
Line around the corner, but I'm getting the free cheese
Come on home with me, where I stand on my post
Playing my toast, dinner there was mayonnaise and toast and pepper
Many nights I done slept with a heifer
Any beef came, it left on a stretcher, Killa
Come on home with me, where they rap and be flossin'
Where I begged Kim to have the abortion
Money bring back extortion, caution
Ain't no tracking an orphan, relax in a coffin
And the bitch know I'm serious, 'cause I'm never scared, ma
Unless you miss your period, so come home with me
Where the girls wanna come home with me
They say "Cam, if you need dome, hit me" (Fuck out of here)
Love to see the chrome whippy
The car a quarter mil', on the wheels I done blown fifty
Dice game blown fifty, Jones loan sixty
Head cracks thrown swiftly, took it home with me
So come home with me, where a nigga make star bucks
I'm about to cop a Starbucks, I reversed all my hard luck
Now I'm at the dealer buying cars, trucks
Aw shucks
[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Come home with me
To the streets, the slums, the ghetto, that's home to me
Every night my girl crying, "Come home to me"
No, come home with me, where it's so many cops
The block is boiling and the food is spoiled
But that pot with the rock is boiling
Same pot mommy cook with, left the oil in
Come on home with me, where these bitches is frauds
Niggas don't listen to broads
They have you sitting in court for kids that ain't yours
Come home with me, where every day the Glocks go pop
Where the front door's broke and them locks don't lock
Come home with me, dog, where the beef is seeking
Kids don't trick or treat, they get tricked for treating
Come home with me, where the pistol squeezing
Niggas twist ya cheek in, rip to pieces
Our kids get even, come home with me
Don't leave your condoms behind
'Cause them bitches leave the martians behind
Pray to God that I'm fine, come on home with me
Come on zone with me, come on walk through this cold city
Where these kids need food (That's right)
Niggas need guidance and bitches need rules
Come on home with me, where niggas living off they last bucks (What else?)
Phone is off, rent is backed up (Uh-huh)
Come home with me, niggas strap up
Hit the street, gats up, clack up and get they money back up
Come home with me, every block got a crack in it
Every hallway got a nigga with some crack in it (What else?)
Don't get trapped in it

Uh, come on home with me
Where my parents would, um
Leave me alone, so early I was free to just roam
Seven keys to the home, Eleven trees to the dome
Thirteen, I ran the streets with the chrome (Boom)
Come on home with me, where the buses don't run
And my dogs stay busting they gun (Brra)
Think that getting caught by Justice is fun?
Keep a blade up in they gums
This is Harlem, where the fuck is you from?
Uh, come on home with me
Every few minutes, was a knock at the door
Fiends coming copping the raw, clothes, kicks, socks on the floor
Mommy like, "Be quiet 'cause I really think them cops at the door"
"Is them locks on the door?"
Come on home with me, where grandmothers is thirty
One gram of that butter is thirty
Four grand is my cut from the birdy
School, cutting it early
Don't stutter, motherfuckers you heard me, uh
Come on home with me, these are the facts
Steve Francis and Latifah got jacked
Mike Tyson punched Mitch Green in the face
Sarge snatched by the Feds, we was the case
No shit, he still pleading his case, come home with me
Hoes say, "That's Jones with you?"
"What, I wouldn't take him home with you"
Come home with me, get stoned with me, be zoned with me
The chrome you see, the Jones you see
Dipset, come home with me, uh
[Outro: Jim Jones]
Dipset nigga, Jim Jones, Capo status
Killa, Freekey Zekey, Juelz Santana
Blaka the don, Diplomatic
We comin for y'all, two double one, brra
For life, hold that down and what
Harlem, Harlem, Harlem, uhEmbed
