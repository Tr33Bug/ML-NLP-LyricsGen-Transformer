Curtis (50 Cent Diss) Lyrics[Verse 1]
The truck or the Lambi, Cam be stuffed in some candy
This ain't a label Curtis I'm fuckin with family
See my squad done waited right behind them bars that's gated
Hopped out the casket bastard, reincarnated
Yep, so have a seat, this gon' be a masterpiece
I have to beef, he look like a gorilla, with rabbit teeth
Bugs monkey, act hard, with a crack god, that mack broads
That video ain't Queens, it's your backyard(Connecticut)
Curtis, it's messin' with your head bad
You that mad but dag that's security with red flags?
You bangin' five shootin' rocks and signs my way
Fine play I keep it neutral but my family's nine, trey
Soo woo, my A-alikes, that stay to fight, from day to night
When I smack the Lighty brothers Dave and Mike
Huh, believe me ho, you can't be me though
Jimmy ain't the President, he the C.E.O
Zeek is the President It's evident he'll cock and spray
Santana underboss, I sign off like Dr. Dre
I fuck with Zoe Pound too what up? Sak Pase?
Grab the coco my cock, so zozo rockaway
I extended the clip, never be friends with you pricks
Shout to a real Queens dude, you know Kenneth McGriff
He ran from police, you run with police
You ain't from Southside, you 'bout to get ya mouth wired
[Hook]
Curtis!!! (Rewind it DJ)
Curtis!!! (You ain't 50, 50 Cent from B.K.)
Curtis!!! (Yep, he deserve to be nervous)
Curtis!!! (Damn, show some courtesy Curtis)
Curtis!!! (Uh! Rewind it DJ)
Curtis!!! (You ain't 50, 50 Cent from B.K.)
Curtis!!! (Yep, he deserve to be nervous)
Curtis!!! (Damn, show some courtesy Curtis)

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, check the tail girls break they neck and nails
Just for me to sex they tail but let's talk record sales
Juelz eight hundred, Jim fo' hundred
I copped more cribs, more cars, got more blunted
Yeah I rocked The Roc so stop it, doc you coppertop
My niggas watch 'em ball, your dudes I watched 'em flop
Yep, so beware, dog I'm tryin' to be clear
Banks bricked, Mobb bricked, Buck ain't been out for three, years
Let me be fair, I hop up off a sweet Leer
Right to Lennox ain't no sand, but I'm on my beach chair (What up Hov)
These are not tales, and dog we not frail
You don't club in New York you party out in Scottsdale
Huh, I can't be clowned, beef dog, God damn we down
How you livin'? You live in Tyson's hand me down
Plus you can't be found I'll have you taped, gagged, and bound
Ask around, I never liked the circus so I clap a clown
You might also like[Hook]

[Outro]
Aiyyo man, thanks for all the shoutouts, for my dudes
You keep shoutin 'em I love it baby them my brothers
I ain't hear you say Banks name in a minute
Talkin' 'bout Koch a graveyard you just signed off for Prodigy to go there
Aiyyo P he a sucker, get away from that dude B
You ain't got no swag with buck teeth
You know how you ain't got no swag?
Whoever let you sign off on them G-Unit tank tops is stupid just like yo dumb ass!!!
Them is brassiere tops, whoever wore that outside was a homo, gay ass nigga!!!
Aiyyo stop callin' my probation officer to, why you talkin' 'bout my probation?
You tryin' to get me locked up Curtis?!
Aiyyo Curtis you really tryin' to get me up?
You said somethin' about my probation on your song
Next thing I know my probation officer call me today said he need to see me
Aiyyo if I go to jail, Curtis put me in jail!!!!
It's crazy I gotta go report to probation, next Thursday
I ain't supposed to report for three weeks
I gotta go Thursday and he mention my probation
Aiyyo let me get off this mic now cause I know how you get down, rat ass nigga!!!
That's true story that's not even a joke I'm dead serious...Probation4Embed
