Daydreaming Lyrics[Intro: Tiffany]
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Look at my mind
Floating away

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
I know **** with a crook is whack
I lied, cheated, still took me back
What I do? Turned around, asked you to cook me ****
Boof my work with a jerk, to tell the truth, it hurts
'Cause you even asked me to come through to church
What I do? Act second rate
I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate
But I'm ready to change, you got my heart, plus you smart and the sex is great
And you hate rap, I like that, girl
I argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl
You jumped right out the car to fight that girl
You beat her ****, you ain't have to bite that girl
And my baby got the best thighs
And my whip, she ain't never got to test drive
Copped her the X5
You paid attention when no one acknowledged me
This is my public apology, holla, B
[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
We could get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
Where you wanna go?
Where, Italy? What, Sicily? Tell me, girl, Disney World? Huh?

[Verse 2: Tiffany]
He's the kind of guy that will say, "Hey, baby, let's get away"
Let's go some place, oh
Where I don't care
He's the kind of guy that will give it everything and trust your heart
Share all of your love 'til death do you part
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it, whenever he needs it
When he lonesome and feeling love starved, I'll be there to feed it
Loving him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say

[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
We could get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
Where you wanna go?
Where, Italy? What, Sicily? Tell me, girl, Disney World? Huh?

You helped me work when we was twelve and a half
You said, "Cam, what the ****, dog? We twelve and a half"
Now that house cost millions, twelve and a half
But I still got them ****, twelve in the stash
You can't even get mad, say what the hell, just laugh
Standing there beautiful, like what I'm gon' do with you?
You wanted me to go to school and just play ball
What I do? Go to school with that ****-ball
Here come the ****, here come the ****, yeah, I dealt that
I'm a hustler though, I can't help that
You was there when I flipped my first birds
Now we gon' see my son take his first words
And um, absurd, I ain't wanna be no singer, ma
I just wanted eight karats on your finger, ma
Since were young, you thug me, I thugged you
You hug me, I hugged you
You love me, I love you

[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
We could get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
Where you wanna go?
Where, Italy? What, Sicily? Tell me, girl, Disney World? Huh?
[Bridge: Tiffany]
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it, whenever he needs it
When he lonesome and feeling love starved, I'll be there to feed him
Loving him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say

[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
We could get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
Where you wanna go?
Where, Italy? What, Sicily? Tell me, girl, Disney World? Huh?
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
We could get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight
Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh
Baby, can we?
Where you wanna go?
Where, Italy? What, Sicily? Tell me, girl, Disney World? Huh?
