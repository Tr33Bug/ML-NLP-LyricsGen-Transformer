Family Ties Lyrics[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Killa, Dipset
Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflé ya toupée and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me
[Chorus: Nicole Wray & Cam'ron]
We in a zone, our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we 'bout to make the drums cry
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
We hold our own, don't think you can move us or push us
We step to the side, that's why I call this family ties
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa! Uhh
From the back of the cop-ride
To black-on-black, black when we cop rides
I will not hide, "hi ma, hot thighs"
Dick on her nose...now she's cock-eyed
From whippin' the bacon rolls to outside whippin' the bacon Rolls
Sanaa Lathan knows, I'm rakin' but makin' dough
80 holes in your shirt, there: your own Jamaican clothes
I ain't talkin' the Poconos, I'm talkin' the Aspens, to slopes we go
You get the "okey doke", play me, baby I hope he know
We break noses, call him baby Pinocchio
(Fuckin' liar), I hold him with blue mittens
2 pigeons, "what the fuck are you pitchin'?"
1 house, 2 kitchens...who's bitchin'?
I bring the diesel, won't see the Fu-Schnickens
(And I don't trust a hoe)
That's mother to baby-mother
Motherfucker, you look like a lady-lover
I'll touch slap her, dap her, plus clap her
Tell her drink, come get drunk, it's nut cracker
And it's well known that Rell home
Yup, hit E.T up on the cell phone
As your family dies, and my family rise
Call the network, Dipset, Family Ties (Killa)

We in a zone, our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we 'bout to make the drums cry
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
We hold our own, don't think you can move us or push us
We step to the side, that's why I call this family ties
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
They see me in that lavender tank, you'd rather just faint
I was Fort Laudi, you was Saint Latter-Day Saints
Whips get lathered in paint
Rap with the rappers, scrap with the actors, cap back: abracadabra
And I'm appalled think that we at all comfortable
Me in Mauris, these rappers all Theodore Huxtable
They mother's a lawyer, they father's a doctor
Auction coke to the coppers, Glocks in the locker and
Who you supposed to be? Get hung from the rosaries
Call me "C.O.D." - that's coke and them Os of D
Some OD'ed, B off them Os of D
I ain't give a fuck as long as they ain't close to me
Put ya drugs in the air, give a toast to me
Pump that Dip in ya veins, get dope like me
Fuck Kerry and Bush, you should vote for me
For real, nigga, on the real the last hope is me
[Chorus: Nicole Wray & Cam'ron]
We in a zone, our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we 'bout to make the drums cry
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset
We hold our own, don't think you can move us or push us
We step to the side, that's why I call this family ties
Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset, Dipset17Embed
