Get Em Daddy Remix Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron]
See the problem is I ain't goin' nowhere
Can shoot at me, can stab at me
Take your best shot (this is the remix)
Suck a dick no homo
Dipset, remix, let's go!

[Verse 1: Hell Rell]
My flow is Novocaine, my bars is hurricanes (Katrina)
I got hella 'caine, MAC in the melon Range
Hop out and shells exchange
I wanna see these niggas die die, make they mom feel hella pain
Walk around like I got a broom in my pants
Nah, that's a fuckin A-K, heavy tool in my pants, damn
Man, these cowards better stay in they lane
And if they ain't getting the picture, it ain't in the frame
VVS's stay in my chain (bling), they in my ring (there they go)
You must've wrote your will already if youâ€™re saying our names
Hell Rell, Mr. Ruger Ruger, I'm a shooter shooter
You hung with the girls you double dutch or hula-hooper (faggot)
Hop skip and jumping, block clicking and jumping
Glock clicking and dumping, it's the mighty Dips
[Verse 2: J.R. Writer]
Listen I'm quite known, nice chrome, a cyclone, niggas
Your sight blown, right-o, my white stones glitter
Left hand bling, the right one shiver
Stallion, medallion, a ice cold picture
The white stone flipper
That white tone, nights home, getting rid of the weight like lipo mister
This psycho sicker
That ain't cracking ya pimp, you got a rat as a friend like Mike on Thriller
This ain't nothing to me, a scrapper at its best
No rapper could impress, man I'm crack right out the 'jects
You rapping indirect
But it's looking like a movie shoot
How they sending all these damn actors at the Set

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
It goes get 'em daddy (Goonies)
Soul niggas they sick and flabby (they washed up)
Young fly rich and every nigga with me pack heat (we balling)
Somebody snapping pictures at me (watching)
Plus I know I got the F.B.I. sick of me
The cash, the jewels and how we buy exquisite V's
Don't get ya brains fried to a fricassee
My vest and my heater, breath full of reefer
And ya boy stay fly like he was dressing for Easter
The big Pachorte, Capo the heffe
Packing 4-4 court case to drop on expressway
It's Dipset, Byrdgang, we fly high
And chart the G-4 we getting high in the sky, you fuckers

Killa, Killa!
I'm Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Bob Backlund
Part-acting, ha ha, who they think they car jackin
You dump and a dump, I slumped and I slump
They mad my car's like an elephant, the trunk in the front
See ya dude react, Hud 6 threw me back, a few they clapped
But I ate those, them shits is Scooby Snacks
I ain't see stars, I'm a G pa
Threw the Lam' in 6th, drove to the ER (true story)
Had to make it hot
Feel like Pac, I know a set up
Them old niggas know I'm 'bout to take they spot
Ain't no A.B. - I.O.U
Y.B., that'll get 'em up in I.C.U
Like I see you at the BP, shot 'em off GP
Guns from VA, PA, down to D.C
D.O.A. if you short up on my P.C
C-74 switched 'em over to P.C
Like Chuck D, we the '06 P.E
Fuck me why, I'm in the '06 G.T
All about them G's B, we the B.G
Byrd Gang Dipset, D-I-P see
Like KRS-One, the great B.D.P
You wanna join the crew, then you must see me, Flee
Uhh, Killa!
[Break: Cam'ron]
(Get 'em daddy) Got 'em mommy, you my Gotham Bonnie
'Cause I'm Batman with the pump, Johnny Johnny
(Get 'em daddy) Honey smile, don't act funny style
In one ear, yeah yeah, 220 thou'
(Get 'em daddy)

[Outro: Jim Jones]
Yeah, you heard what he said, nigga
Huh, we still balling
Them shits was Scooby Snacks, fucker, huh
(Get 'em daddy)
But repercussions is a muh'fucka
When we catch that ass, flat line fucker, huh
Hey Killa, we back, huh
(Get 'em daddy) tell 'em the city is ours
No disrespect to you other motherfuckers
But Jimmy Blanco
Killa the Don, King Jaffe Joe
(Get 'em daddy)
Juelz Santana the Prince, Hell Rell
Hey J.R., I see you motherfucker, huh
(Get 'em daddy)
You know who we are, Dipset, Byrd Gang
The most powerful movement in this motherfucker
We ride high, nigga
I wish you would, bang bang, nigga!
