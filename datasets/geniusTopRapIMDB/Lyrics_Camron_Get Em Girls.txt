Get â€™Em Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Killa.. let's go
I get the boosters boosting, I get computers 'puting
Y'all get shot at; call me, I do the shooting
I do the recruiting, I tutor the students
I nurture their brain, I'm moving the movement
Whether Buddhist or Buddha, that's Judas or Judah
I got Luger to Ruger, hit from Roota to Toota
Chick from hooter to hooter, I put two in producers
I'm the real ball story, the loser of "Hoosiers"
I rock mostly dosey, I roll mostly dolie
I'll leave you wholly-holey, you'll say holy moly
Here come the coroner, get em, play Rollie Pollie
I'll tell you true stories, how I coldly hold heat
When it's repping time, I get on extra grind
Fried to fricassee, Pepperseed to Pepperdine
Jeff Hamilton, Genesis, leather time
Bitches say I'm the man, I tell em never mind
[Chorus]
They getting nice, they got some ice
Let's get the dice and roll em (get 'em girls)
They getting chips, they flipping bricks
Get the rots and pits, tell em (get 'em girls)
She acting feisty, getting sheisty
Call the wifey, tell her to (get 'em girl)
Just lay back, get your face slapped
We at the race track, eight stacks (get 'em girls)

[Verse 2]
You acting funny nigga
Come... dumb, dummy nigga?
Killa keep twenty blickers (I'm getting money nigga)
So you should move away, or join the dude 'n play
Hey, so you can say (I'm getting money nigga)
First pile up in the rear, I style up in my gear
Stallion of the year: medallions in my ear
Whips on my fists, houses on my wrists
Your budget on my neck, your spouse on my dick
Posters on the wall, posted on my balls
Dick in her mouth, I tell her "I'm gettin money niggaa"
Y'all faking the fizzle, I'm caking for shizzle
Fuck a Sizzler steak; my estates, they sizzle
Ate, boom-boom, my ace boon coon
Shake, bake, skate, vroom vroom (We gettin money nigga)
7 to 8, zoom zoom, boom boom tune
'Fore I get life, that boom boom room
(I'm gettin money nigga)
Wrecks 'n Effects: zoom zoom in poon-poon
Since the movie Cocoon, had my Uzi platoon
(I'm gettin money nigga) Killa

They getting nice, they got some ice
Let's get the dice and roll em (get em girls)
They getting chips, they flipping bricks
Get the rots and pits, tell em (get em girls)
She acting feisty, getting sheisty
Call the wifey, tell her to (get em girl)
Just lay back, get your face slapped
We at the race track, eight stacks (get em girls)

[Verse 3]
My team is the Goonies, we were seen with buffoonies
Toonies, best dressed, stay up in Neiman's and Bloomies
Want to hit it from the back, she agreed that I'm looney
But proceeded to moon me (I'm gettin money nigga)
"Baby" b.s. and "honey" do, Cam V.S. 1 and 2
I'll help you get your son out of P.S. 22
Get him a Mauri flow, from the Mauri show
Fuck around, y'all gonna be up on the Maury Show
He in bootcamp, you on food stamps
Welfare, no health care, a true tramp
And I'm lokie-lokie, leave you pokey-pokey
No Rice a Roni, that's the okey-dokey
Me and Toby homie, make you do the hokey-pokey
Pull the pound, up and down, turn yourself around shorty
Here's some weed, burn yourself a pound whoadie
Here's a map, go learn yourself the town, sporty
I was down 40, now I'm up 50
Buck 50, but quickly: who could fuck with me? Killa9Embed
