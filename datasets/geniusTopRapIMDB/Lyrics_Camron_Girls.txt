Girls Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron]
Killa!!
Dipset, Charlemagne
Jim Jones, Santana, Freekey
Let's go!
What they want sing

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
Girls just wanna have fun
(Oh girls)
Girls just wanna have fun
(Girls just wanna have)
[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Killa!
Damn chump passed, he a dumb ass
Call J.R. (why?), get a fun pass
Yeah she come fast, so she leave quicker
'Cause she cum faster, skeet skeet nigga
We be with her, me, Jim, Zeek hit her
Then she's a flea flicker, Don Chi Chi with her
P.E. with her, wee wee, easy, ol' me, OG little me lick her
So she need liquor, never seen sicker
Nigga, if rap was head, she could be Twista (fast)
Had her alley to alley, Hawaii and Maui, and Cali the Valley
Up in white Lotus, dog you might notice
That you type bogus, me I'm quite focused
And hope is hopeless, disappear in the air, hocus pocus
(Killa, Killa)

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
Girls just wanna have fun
(Oh girls)
Girls just wanna have fun
(Girls just wanna have)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Goddamn he stuck like stucco
Cut low, slut no, here he come uh oh
Man see what the fighting do, that's why I'm piping boo
Ain't even liking you, I'm exciting true
Just right I do, heels high, wheels fly, real fly Nikes are new (Air 1's)
And a righteous view, from night to new, day, hey play
Catch a flight for two (first class!)
And you thought you a baller, a baller?
Hawker, dog you a stalker! (you a stalker)
Upset cause what she wear showing (that's see through)
Aww man you ain't in gear for knowing
Ask questions in fear of hoein (what's that?)
Who you with? Where you at?
Where you going? (where you going?)
Where you going, I'm flowing, she blowing
Sky high like a Boeing, got pies like it snowing (slinging!)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, uhh
Females better twirl on yours, better curl on yours
'Cause I swirl on shores (then what)
Come back to a pearl golf course (who you)
I'm Kurupt, 'cause "Girls All Pause"
And the world is yours, honey sip sizzurp earl of course
And you know I'm in the building mister
With the Olsen twins, or the Hilton sisters
And I haul 'em in to the Hilton mister
I milked them, I killed them, you quilt her, you missed her
You held her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
Girls just wanna have fun
(Oh girls)
Girls just wanna have fun
(Girls just wanna have)
Girls just wanna have fun
(Oh girls)
Girls just wanna have fun
(Girls just wanna have)1Embed
