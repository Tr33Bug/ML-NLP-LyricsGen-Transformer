Hey Lady Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron {sample}]
Uh, Killa (Dipset)
Jim Jones, my man DJ Nasty in the house tonight (c'mon)
Let's get ready to do it, ma {hey lady}

[Verse 1: Cam'ron {sample}]
I know you heard me in British Raj
But I get you bracelets 'til ya wrist is throbbed
Just kiss the knob
And put your meat on my stick like a shish-kebab {hey lady}
Out mingling, heard that I blingy-bling
But I run the circus like Ring-a-ling
I'm the king of things
And your man, he a homo like Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg {lady}
That's life, hit 'em with the pow-ping
Pow, pow, .45 loud thing
Look wild thing, I do wild things
Make China stretch like Yao Ming {hey lady}
Ching chong, ma ga hai ah, Chow Mein
I'm bilingual, ma, I don't need a nickel, naw
Oh, you tickled, ma? 'Cause your nipples, huh?
Coming through your shirt, nearly ripped your bra {hey lady}
[Chorus: Freekey Zekey {sample}]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}

[Verse 2: Cam'ron {sample}]
I know it's school and work, but you need to be schooled in work
Put my tool to work
I'm feeling your shoes, your purse
You get low on dough, refuel the first {hey lady}
I don't need you high like I'm high
But shit, I need you fly like I'm fly
Fresh Louie Vuitton ankle
Pastel Louie Vuitton rainbow {hey lady}
Threw on the Kangol, threw on Durangos
Not from the 'nati but threw on the Bengals
Moved on an angle
Like a bull and matador, the two gon' tangle {hey lady}
Shake your body, mami, move your body, hottie
Its true I'm kamikaze, I move in a Maserati
They all polly-polly, rude boy, dolly-dolly
I don't talk like they squalie, mami {hey lady}

[Chorus: Freekey Zekey {sample}]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}

Killa..
Lady, dry your panties
Damn, she wanna write her family
Tell 'em that I'm a diaper dandy
And I got all type of candy {hey lady}
Whats that? Victoria Secret?
Here's La Perla, come peep it
This lingerie that you could honor, ay
Wonder Woman, woo wee, go on, play {hey lady}
Like Cam watch, like Cam ring
Like Cam chain, like Cam bling
Heard Cam sing, if a damn fling
Goddamn, ma'am, not a damn thing {hey lady}

[Chorus: Freekey Zekey {sample}]
I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}3Embed
