Horse & Carriage Lyrics[Intro: Mase]
Uncle Manson
Cameron Giles
And I'm Mason Betha
And this Untertainment
And we're gonna rise to the top
Jacob the Chancellor
And Troy Topper

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, you might see Cam in designer underwear
In a reclining leather chair, reminders everywhere
How we pull up in whips, the minors start to stare
And when it comes to girls, they behind us everywhere
I mean, when I hang up on 'em, they pressin' redial
I mean what the fuck is it, why you stressin' me child
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial
You not my wife, so if I ask head I be foul
You better be down, the only question better be 'how'
Threaten' me now, bet me a thou, no girl deadin' me now
In the SC we're gone, are you sexy in thongs
If you'll sex in the Lex and your head be the bomb
I'll get you that stuff that Gretzky skate on
(What you mean "Gretzky be on"?) Ice
(Oh you're gonna buy me diamonds?!)
Bitch, Shut the fuck up!
[Chorus: Mase]
Mamacita
Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage, see my love's for hire

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo
Hey yo, I love when cats think they bigger than a sumo
That's when I hit 'em with a little Puerto Rican judo
Oh, you don't know what that is
That's when I say "ju don't know who gat this is"
(And ju don't know) Yo' guns is hand me downs
(And ju don't know) We'll put you where you can't be found
(And ju don't know) You better toughin' up
('Cause ju don't know) Nigga we'll fuck you up
(And ju don't know) Baby, we don't need you
And when it comes to 'Jimmy,' my name's 'me' too
'Cause when he got cash, I was like "me too"
And when he got ass I said "me too"
And when he got the drop I was like "me too"
And when he almost got shot I said "me too"
What you get now is just a preview
We all tinted out, your car's see-through
I see you
You might also like[Chorus: Mase]
Mamacita
Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage, see my love's for hire

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ayo, I pull to the hotel with my shit on blast
Tell the valet "Motherfucker don't hit my Jag"
Seen the bell boy, nigga he can kiss my ass
Just show me my room nigga, and get my bags
So the girl, that's my hon, almost dropped his glass
I guess he was shocked when I touched her ass
It really wasn't nothin' she was peedy aight
"Does that say Harlem World?", yeah you readin' it right
And we havin a party, be there tonight
Like Phil Collins have her in "The Heat Of The Night"
'Cause Cam rocks the party (All Night Long)
'Til when? ('Til the early morn')
It don't stop (and uh), it don't quit
(And uh) drop six, (and uh) we pop Cris'
Right now too tipsy to drive
But I got my horse and carriage right outside

[Chorus: Mase]
Mamacita
Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage, see my love's for hire
Mamacita
Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We gonna rise to the top
Michael Foster, Huddy Combs
Jimmy Jones, Mason Betha and Bloodshed for ever
And we gonna rise
And we gonna rise
And we gonna rise
Andre Thompson
