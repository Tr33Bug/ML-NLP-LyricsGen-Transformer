I.B.S Lyrics[Intro]
Let me tell y'all a lil' story about myself
This right here is a true story, check it out though, uhh...

[Verse 1]
Ulcers hurt my salary, alter my personality
Give it to you real, I can't feed my culture no fallacy
You know my attitude: arrogant, cocky, rude
Eating off papi food, used to be a stocky dude
Weighed two-twenty, with two honeys, I move money
It's true dummy, dunny need a new tummy
I become berserk, it was no fun to work
Every day my stomach hurt, ripping off my undershirt
The pain was no comparison, stomach started cherishing
Throwing up in public, yo fuck it, it was embarrassing
Regurgitating: green, yellow, burgundy, boom
But came my urgency soon, (what) the emergency room (oh)
In there, no salvage, treated like a cold savage
They said pimping symptoms, huh, a dope addict
There you have it, but they ain't find no heroin
Coke, crack, dope, just weed, but that's my medicine
[Chorus]
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again

[Verse 2]
Never mind stunting, dime puffin, doc spent his time fronting
He like a bad detective, he ain't find nothing
Besides that though, I can't enjoy a movie dinner (why is that?)
My son growing up, I'm looking like the movie Thinner
I'm thinking suicide, do or die, sit and cry (oh)
What hurt my baby moms asking if I'm getting high
She gonna play me a thug, I told the lady I love
If it ain't hustling ma, please don't relate me to drugs (at all)
I'm losing weight though, every day pounds of muscle
Gotta get off my ass, hit some towns and hustle
Bein sick, huh, it get sickening you know
I was too sick to do shows, but still equipped to move O's
You know my attitude, get it how I get it
If I can shoot, I turn around (then) I'm off my pivot
And oops, I thought I had it mapped
Weight started to gain again, it was just a game my friend
Dame mane I pained again
You might also like[Chorus]
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again

[Verse 3]
Killa!
Ayo, god body, I'm hard bodied, word mommy, vanishing
Had to go low, The Mayo Clinic, Minnesota
I couldn't get cake, a rock in a hard place
For me, that's a odd place, I'm only here by God's grace
Like a lab rat, them tests dishonor Cam
Ultrasound, MIR, CAT scan, sonogram
Laparoscopy, endoscopy, I be stressed (I be stressed)
The prognosis, diagnosed, IBS
And that's irritable bowel child, I had to spit it y'all
Kick to y'all, so it ain't my fault if I shit on y'all
Get it, get it, get it, get it?

[Chorus]
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again1Embed
