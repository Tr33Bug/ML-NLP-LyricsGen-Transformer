Itâ€™s Killa Lyrics[Intro]
Killa...
You know I can talk about what I wanna talk about
Them statute of limitations is up for them drugs
Far as them murders, I never knew nuttin' anyway, haha
I was sleep, haha yo

[Verse 1]
Yo, '97 huh, drugs I moved a big amount
Chick in my crib, her ribs I'm 'bout to dig it out
Then Ma$e called, said "Yo, I'm stuck inside some bitch's house"
Her boyfriend at the door, could I hurry up and get him out
Aight, what's the address? Homie said "Kingsbridge"
That was great I had some niggas right on Bainbridge
Yeah, we play but believe it ain't no game kid
Hopped off the elevator, aimed it at that lame lid
I ain't give a damn, yeah Cam I was gung-ho
Got this nigga home and he passed me a hundo ($100 dollars?!)
Told him straight up I ain't feeling him
Let me curve this nigga 'fore I end up killing him
I would make 80k on a lazy day
Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine
At this time I'm moving heroin in Maryland
They both died and this nigga turned reverand!
Had the hood hot, FBI agents 'round
We need a referee, shit, that shit a flagrant foul
Fuck it, kept it moving with my true manoeuvres
On the highway nigga moving that Eukanuba
[Chorus]
When them drum fly, when them drum fly
Make your son cry, say hi to the bad guy
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker, that's Killa, motherfucker, that's Killa
From your tour dates, from your tour dates
To your court case, dressed in the North Face
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker that's Killa, motherfucker that's Killa

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I smoke pounds you clown, homie, you heard the bluff
All your murder stuff, man I heard enough
NFL murderers, you heard of us
This when Herb McGruff used to serve the dust
Task force, homicide, DT's and other NARCs
My jewelry, well that's frozen like my mother's heart
Bless her heart lord, me I'm some other shark
But the way I get money that's another art
Where should a brother start? How I used to pump in parks
Or how I parked niggas on the side of the barber shop?
Give me some Skittles, beast mode, I'm hard to stop
My life's cement, not wood, so it's hard to knock
Niggas get knocked off get knocked, the bill paid
From that 212, two-twelving with that 12 gauge
God's child, you owe me money? See hell's raised
You got two weeks and my two weeks is twelve days
You might also like[Chorus]
When them drum fly, when them drum fly
Make your son cry, say hi to the bad guy
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker, that's Killa, motherfucker, that's Killa
From your tour dates, from your tour dates
To your court case, dressed in the North Face
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker, that's Killa, motherfucker, that's KillaEmbed
