Lean Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'ma warn ya
In your circle don't mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner, 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
"I plead the fifth," "Hell no," and "No, your honor"
So the streets honor me, humble, believe I'm on it
I grab my momma, I'm headed to a different genre
They couldn't understand me, now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L, all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy, crack, greed, homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body, changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight, nothing recent
But I'ma call the state for back pay, they owe me grievance
And you can't knock that, block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta, I got that
[Chorus]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For It won't be long, til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
Lowlifes with no knives, niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
That's power, I play my post, one day
You're the best thing since sliced bread, the next day you're toast
I can never be toast, hell no
I get money in lump sums, yea, I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast, as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it, "Keep going girl, you're terrific"
Yeah baby, see I'm Clyde and I'm looking for a Bonnie, mami
To get a Gucci ghost, watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth, humble beginnings, hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice, me or drugs, he chose angel dust (damn)
And the mother, some was living more dangerous
Tax season, the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak, this bracelet you could hold that
If I'm needed, know that you can

[Chorus]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For It won't be long, til im gonna need
Somebody to lean onYou might also likeEmbed
