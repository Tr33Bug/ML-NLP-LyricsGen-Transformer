Live My Life (Leave Me Alone) Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron]
Niggas be on (Uh), point, game tight (Killa, Killa, uh)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight
Thug niggas be on point, game tight (Harlem, Harlem, R-O-C, uh)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight (We gon' set this bitch off)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight (My ambitions as a killer)
Yo (Huh)
Yo

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Soon as I get here, niggas wanna wrap the Roc up
Nah, bag, slab, wrap the rocks up
Gats, back the block up
Cop killers, clap the coppers, blast the choppers, pass the vodka (Vodka)
Listen, don't ever mention Dash or Hoffa (Never)
It's a Harlem thing, dog, you will clash with mobsters (Uptown)
Remember me? Got jumped on TNT (What's beef?)
Next week, back pump TNT (What's beef?)
All my niggas got M16s, kid (Yeah)
And all we do is watch MTV Cribs (Why?)
Learn not to infury the victim
Purely stick 'em, break down your security system, Killa (Uh)
Stop frontin', you was never a menace
Never a hustler, no, we could never do business (Never)
Business is business, money is money, hustle is hustle (Hustle)
Stupid is stupid, you the dumbest of dummies, Killa
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Cam'ron]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life (Yo)
That's the sound of the police

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
All I do every day, dog, blunt after blunt
Stunt after stunt, they all cunt after cunt
Like that I'm shiesty, look at his shoes, like my Nikes
Know I got a girl, like my wifey, like that I'm rude
Come here, let me pick with your chest, dick on your breast
All they say, "That nigga's a mess"
You heard me, fam? All worthy of this dirty, man
Take it in your ass? How about thirty grams, ma? (Huh?)
Go upstate, come back downstate
Next time around me, you might get a pound cake (Do that)
Fuck it up, she understand that I might slap her (Slap her)
I'll be damned if I worked for some white cracker (Shit)
White batter, prize in the pack, fiends hug it
They love it, call it Cracker Jack, Killa
Where the crack is at, watch me get them dice
Throw 'em hard, let me live my life, Killa

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Cam'ron]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life (Yo)
That's the sound of the police
You might also like[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Fuck this life as a rap star, you dealing with crack gods (Gods)
Cooking the crack hard, lead the crack jars
All of the chips, the crib with the backyard (Yard)
Pull out the gat, pa, a block of black cars (Uh)
And I'm scary with the fifth, compare me to a gift
Yellow diamonds, canary on my wrist
Dust, juice, get wet up and weighed
That'll be the day Killa Cam mess up some yay, shit (Why?)
Thug niggas be on point, game tight (Game tight)
Cop a brick and re-up in the same night (Uh)
And to get that trife, I flick that knife (Knife)
Doggy dog, let me live my life, Killa

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Leave me alone, let me just live my life
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me just live my life
That's the sound of the police

[Outro: Cam'ron]
The block is hot, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest
Killa, Killa1Embed
