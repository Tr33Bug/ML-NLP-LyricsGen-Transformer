Lord You Know Lyrics[Chorus: Jaheim]
Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
With my muscle you'll be dazzled, but hustlin's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face-to-face through the glass
On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-11, but it was 9-1-1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dumb
[Chorus: Jaheim]
Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Ayo, them niggas from the three two, said I can't breeze through
The 40 if I cop bottles, we can't believe you
Me who? Please boo, landin' in that G2
Same color as beef stew, favorite letters: GQ
That's me, true, peach/blue, Hebrew
Lawyer on my side keep me out of jail the fees stew, steep? Woo!
But it might lead to that R2D2, the mobsters creep through
We the new PE, shittin, pee-ew
To the hood: y'all don't need me, I need you
'Cause my mission's insane, you couldn't vision the pain
Always a snitch in the game, what you want: prison or fame?
Either one, dun, long as my digits the same
He lookin' frigid, dig it, make sure them digits get changed
'Cause I can't be in Hell's cell, shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell, Zeek doin' 3, he even fell, hell
He comin' home on '07 and 12 cells
'Cause you must have known, I can't trust the phones
For the dough you'll be like Doe, stuck at home
You might also like[Chorus: Jaheim]
Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Nowadays dog, they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze 'em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost ark
I'm like a ballplayer, shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box
More props, R.I.P. my poor pops
Can't see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers, you'll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers, cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches, Nana to watch Grandma
In pajamas I snuck out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa, you gon' watch Santana

[Chorus: Jaheim]
Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know
[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate, little fence - I climbed over
Little scrapes, little dents - I got over
That was just the beginning it's not over
It's been a long time comin' Cam
It's been a long time riding and a long time running, man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino, Gee Money, The Carter, and the Duh-Duh Man
It's no longer a New Jack City
It's "cop fast and move that quickly" or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap, man, I'm coming up this road
I'm talking crack, man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I receive it move it and roll
I was comin' from the Q, Zeek was comin' from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the paper-run
Yeah, waiting for a change to come
Now look: the change has come
The 7-Pick Up, Yukon, the Range is come
The day has come, Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers
In this game, we remain, it's a shame cuz6Embed
