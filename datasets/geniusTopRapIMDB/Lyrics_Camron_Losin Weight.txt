Losinâ€™ Weight Lyrics[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life depend on what I'ma do today
Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?
Niggas screwing me; 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots, 1 toolie, G.. 1 eulogy
My mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world, uh
[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
When I was 11 got the toolie thick
My uncle pulled me to the side
And he schooled me quick, told me some gooey shit
You can't get paid in an earth this big?
You worthless kid, nigga don't deserve to live
Go and get it motherfucker, if you murder kids
Bottle up carbohydrates and preservatives
He got hit up that same night
But ever since my dough, my flow, and my ho game been tight
Puns of pearls, yo tongue will twirl, looka here
Booger bear, I'll have you up in hooker gear, I swear
I was doing, Lex pursuing, niggas be wired like Western Union
Short like next to Ewing, head for truant, only set was ruined
Phony checks was fluent, listen hear me out
I'm from a cocaine block, with some plain clothes cops
And the sun don't rise, but the rain don't stop
The pain don't stop, but my brain don't stop
Ain't no lockouts, the game don't stop
Every month you change yo' locks, change yo' spot
Get a little smart, want to change yo' tops
Rearrange yo rocks you got a gang of friends, money
You got Ben's arranged money, have a Benz or Range money
But if I get knocked, I ain't got no bail
But I come on the weekends, Pablo jail
See I came a long way, that's living the wrong way
That's sniffing the po-na, that's sipping the cog-na, hey
You wanna be a star, you have ya own day
Where they play ball, drink and get a buzz
Reminiscing, what a good kid he was
I don't know what happened, all he did is what he loved
That's when you opposing me, Killa get the rosary
Fuck this rap shit, I die for mine, motherfucker

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life depend on what I'ma do today
Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?
Niggas screwing me; 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots, 1 toolie, G.. 1 eulogy
Make sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Gather around y'all, it's going down y'all
Murder rap, clown niggas back down no
Straight like that, y'all niggas fuck around yo
Bandana P, blow thirds, the fourth take you up off
This thug shit, I keep a beamed out fifth
Is you fiend out now, nigga? Catch a clean bullet
I live the street life, ya heard? Guns, money and birds
Get dead armed and dead on your jewels and pearls
Where I was placed, talking the wrong style thun
Capital P, y'all know what's the outcome
Could 'bout some but rather pull out the stout guns
Don't let ya mouth get you in some shit ya legs run from
For all the killers and the 100 dollar hoes
For real bitches check me out though
We be the most ill, more drama than Denzel
More liver than the park fights at Sunny Carson
Me and Killa Cam, live at the Carbon
It's crazy, bitches throwing they pussy
Niggas flash razors, you crazy
[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life depend on what I'ma do today
Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?
Niggas screwing me; 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots, 1 toolie, G.. 1 eulogy
Make sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life depend on what I'ma do today
Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?
Niggas screwing me; 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots, 1 toolie, G.. 1 eulogy
Make sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the worldEmbed
