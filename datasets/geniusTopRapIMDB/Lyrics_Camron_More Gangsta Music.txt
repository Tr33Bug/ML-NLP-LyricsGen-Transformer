Gangsta Music, part two
Dipset
Killa, Heatmakerz, Juelz Santana (C'mon man!)
Let's do it

[Refrain: Juelz Santana]
Can I get a (Jeah!) here! (Jeah!) There
Everywhere a (Jeah! Jeah!)
Up, down, left, right (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
Shorty's moving again (Jeah!)
Shorty's loose with the pen (Jeah!)
Shorty do it to win (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
TEC on my left, gangstas with me ready to step (Jeah!)
I like a chick with big breasts on her chest
Not flat, looking like somebody stepped on her chest (Jeah!)
What! (Jeah!) Shit! (Jeah!) Fuck! (Jeah!) Bitch! (Jeah!)
You so crazy! (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
My niggas spit the Glock (Oh-so-slow, whoa)
Rudeboy, lick a shot (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
Never seen a thinner pot (Hold so much coke!)
Cook it to a bigger rock (Hey, hey, oh, whoa)
And I be with them gangstas (Jeah!)
I creep with the gangstas (Jeah!)
Crack a Dutch or Philly and chief-chief with the gangstas
I stay with a lady (Jeah!), she stay with a lady (Jeah!)
They making me crazy (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
I spray 'em with babies (Jeah!)
In they face 'til they hate me (Jeah!)
And I'm making 'em crazy (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
And they like when I do it (Jeah!)
They like when I move it (Jeah!)
They like when I work it, they like when I hurt it
I stay icy on purpose (Purpose), like icy preservers
More than likely, I'm the nicest you heard of! (Jeah!)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I'm moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)
He's moving, moving, moving (Ayy!)
We moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)
Stop moving (Ayy!), shots bruise 'em (Jeah!)
Two more for Cam for taking over the Roc
(Jeah! Jeah!) It's my year, so
(Jeah!) It's like the whole Byrd Gang's in here
Like Kurt Cobain was here (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)

You waitin' to die (Ayy! Ayy! Ayy! Ayy!)

I go throw lead around, my hoes throw head around
They DTPs: deepthroat professionals
My D-I-P's, we so professional
Got weed, coke, and ecstasy, lean, dope, and wet to sell (Sell)
We blow jars of the dank (Yeah), like Bob Marley was wake
Real shottas, fuck you foreigners stay? (What?)

Like Kurt Cobain was here (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)
[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa! I'm on the south side of Chicago
Looking for a real hoe (Real hoe)
I don't see a touchdown; arms up, field goal (Field goal)
Got some ill gold, diamonds that's still low (Psh!)
Lil' dick, you a dickhead, nah, dildo (Dildo)
I chill though, pipin' in the Range
All this icin' I'm ashamed, look like lightnin' in the chain
Who was first that moved with they fam? (Who?)
Ask you: tattoos on they hand (Who?)
Slang all the white (Who?), cruise with the tan (Who?)
Pink on they back (Who?), blue in they band (Who?)
Yellow on his ear (Who?), steam on the rock (Who?)
Purple in the air (Who?), green in his pocket (Who?)
I ain't dissing you, dog, I'm dismissing you
Get the R. Kelly tape, and see how we piss on you
That's Kool-Aid, Mountain Dew, and Cris' on you (Uh-huh)
Your family will be missing youâ€”mwah! There's a kiss for you (Jeah!)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I'm moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)
He's moving, moving, moving (Ayy!)
We moving, moving, moving (Jeah!)
Stop moving (Ayy!), shots bruise 'em (Jeah!)
Two more for Cam for taking over the Roc
(Jeah! Jeah!) It's my year, so
(Jeah!) It's like the whole Byrd Gang's in here
Like Kurt Cobain was here (Jeah! Jeah! Jeah! Jeah!)2Embed
