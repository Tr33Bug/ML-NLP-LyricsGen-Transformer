More Reasons Lyrics[Intro: Cam'ron & Girl]
Oh this is my *beep*
The reason that we here, shut the *beep* up man
The reason that we here, *beep* you can't sing
You shut the *beep* up, what can you do?
We been ridin' in this car for 5 hours
What you gonna do?
I ain't doing *beep*, I'm gon' ride this car
But I'ma tell you a story though, let me you somethin'...

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, uh, I rock baguettes with hoodies, it's like extra goodie
I couldn't break dance y'all, or electric boogie
I was obsessed with Cookie, I wanna sex her cookie
She said forget her nookie, wipe my nose, go get them boogies
I gave Cookie nuggies, with the girls, got known
This my two brim hat, call me Sherlock Holmes
Whole world got blown, so I tell hoes
Fuck Lee's and shell toes, these KangaROOS are Velcro
(Know I kept a little two dollars in the zipper part, right there)
Timberland moccasins, dimes in them penny loafers
A-train, one bus, sure I had plenty chauffeurs
Uncle, plenty holsters, dolgers, soldiers, hostess
Not golf but like golf, he had plenty gophers
Can't get paid on an earth this big?
You worthless kid, Cam don't deserve to live
Back then I played for Gauchos, went over the Riverside
Young life, turned left, we back over the riverside
Blood played for Stone Gym
That's when I told him and Jim
We ain't balling for real, where's the stone gems?
Where's the chrome rims?
That's when you changing lanes
Here we change your lane, we'll gain a sprain
Change the game, and not naming names
But 'caine fame's like Dana Dane's (cocaine)
Rolex for lifers, the TEC kept us righteous
'Cause yes expect the crisis, when it's connects and prices
I had to hustle harder, move up my muscle merger
Seen New Jack City, cop me a couple Carters
And that's word to my father, send a bird to my father
Dove love, R.I.P. on his early departure
I'm just merely an author, but I'm purely a baller
Every Friday, 'cross the street, and I creep with Ms. Parker
[Chorus: Jaheim]
Get the whips, the kicks, and clothes
(All of the reasons)
So we can get with the models (all of the reasons)
And hit the strip with the Dip, we're 'Set to blow
Now you know, all of the reasons why we chase the dough
(All of the reasons)
Get the whips, the kicks, and clothes
So we can get with the models (all of the reasons)
And hit the strip with the Dip, we're 'Set to blow
Now you know, all of the reasons why we chase the dough

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa! Uhh
I'm that nigga man, let me break it down real simple for y'all
Uhh, listen, yo, and I'm very prestigious (very)
You have various leases
All my pieces, painted them, cherry and peaches
Chics, Cherry and Peaches
They had cherry deheaters
Info on the toast, hustled up various reefer
Ithaca, Indica, hydro, Y-O
Haze on delivery, live hoes, five fo'
But kept the fo'-five, for wise guys with eyes low
Pick me up from fo'-five, CL-55, whoa!
Playin' Grand Theft Auto, they like Diablo
My crews' the triad, Zeek, Santana, Capo!
But they some slimmies who
Can rock a Jimmy Choo shoe
Next day velour sweatsuit, construction Timmy boots
Don't be no guinea boo, you rock that Fendi you
You drinkin' Henny too
Coupe color is Winnie Pooh
And they skinny who, they had my favorite rum
Not a six-fo-five-fo, but made in jump
Shout Che Che La Funk, he keep the K in pump
He ain't never scared, never scared, raise the trunk
We'll just lay and dump, play the punk, spray the chump
The way they running I GUESS they could relate to Gump
Forrest, that is
You might also like[Chorus: Jaheim]
(All of the reasons)
Get the whips, the kicks, and clothes (all of the reasons)
So we can get with the models (all of the reasons)
And hit the strip with the Dip, we're 'Set to blow
(All of the reasons)
Now you know, all of the reasons why we chase the doughEmbed
