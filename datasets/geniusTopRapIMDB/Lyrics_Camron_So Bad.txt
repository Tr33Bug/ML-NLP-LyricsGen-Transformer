So Bad Lyrics[Hook: Yummy]
I really thought we could've worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldn't stop playing around
Didn't understand, but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad, baby
So sad
Look at all that we could've had
Just too bad
[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, baby
Let me rescue you from the residue
I don't know what the rest'll do
But this is what the best'll do
Take you to a better view
Do things we never do
Pleasure you, treasure you
Don't skimp and measure you, girl
And they scrutinize cause you get the coupe to drive
But you caught me cheating and in stupid lies
Yeah we argued a little -- no need to pout, mama
I changed, I ain't about drama -- Scout's honor!
And you forgave me; that's why I behaved, b
You don't have to bathe me to love that you gave me, it's gravy
Grade me -- would I get a A, B?
Maybe you my lady, but you my baby

[Hook: Yummy]
I really thought we could've worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldn't stop playing around
Didn't understand, but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad, baby
So sad
Look at all that we could've had
Just too bad

Yeah we made love; man, I wish I ain't acknowledge ya
(Wish you ain't acknowledge me?) Wish I ain't acknowledge ya
Acting like drugs -- if I do, I would have bottled ya
Bitter on Twitter, following my followers
And I don't like a follower, uh
I heard enough complaining
You getting chilly, I'mma let it burn, Usher Raymond
That's where game was served, let me explain my words
You like a app in my iPhone, a angry bird
Screaming Cam name cause I do the damn thing
Forget a low down dirty, it's a damn shame
Cause you a thug cutie, Louis, snug booty
Ooh-wee, but the attitude on Judge Judy
[Hook: Yummy]
I really thought we could've worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldn't stop playing around
Didn't understand, but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad, baby
So sad
Look at all that we could've had
Just too bad5Embed
