Soap Opera Lyrics[Chorus: Smokey Robinson sample]
If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?

[Intro]
Killa! Uhh, this the ghetto soap opera right here, man
You from Harlem you already know
You on that hustler's mission; you trying to get that paper
Wifey like it one minute next minute she don't, man
You know they at home watching Lifetime or on the Internet
But you gotta do you, I got it
[Verse 1]
Uhh, yo my mommy Toy was my pride and joy
She would drive the toys, plus ride the boy
To supply the boys I got it live from Croix
Yes a nine in boy, wore a five in boys
Over the chick shit I shoot five with Roy
Now I load the 4-5, shoot five at Roy
Ain't like my job or guys I employ
Lifestyle I enjoy but I'm the livest doy (doy)
A hustler and Cam famous, you damn anus
I don't know but I can't change it
Can't paint it; pop it, champagne it
Stop it, car: drop it - it look dull, damn, paint it
She would throw a pout how I'm showing out
How I'm outgoing but don't be going out
It's things to know about when you got dough and clout
Ways to move, know the route, "Baby girl, close your mouth"
Cause I feed you well, every sneaker, hell
You eat Louie, shit Gucci, breathe Chanel
Karl Lagerfeld acting like Gargamel
For the car cop the cell in the bar stop at hell
"What's wrong with you?" She said, "what's wrong with you?"
Always got a song to do can't get along it's true
So I skipped marriage, bought her six karats
Rather die that nigga than to live average, Killa (Killa)

If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, uhh...
Looking back on school: art and crafts
Fucked half the staff, beat up half the class
I was like Dr. Dre, though, I have to laugh
Nigga with a attitude, meet me after math
Had a "half and half"
Not a drink -- two chicks that flip acid fast
The half a tab
You could ask her ass, I would dash and laugh
You after me, huh? I'm after cash
I'm on I-80 though with my baby
Whole ride hazy tell her don't drive crazy
I got plans for you look in the sky baby
Fuck Sara Lee, Mrs. Smith; you the pie lady
Fly lady, G2 fly baby, gee you why baby
Please boo, what's your size crazy
Don Juaning when I'm in a foreign
Almond drop top, my charm is alarming
I was alerting her just to reinsert in her
That I will leave earth with her
Huh, I can't interpret her
She got mad I leaned over, I'm nursing her
Said when I do dirt with her
The only time I flirt with her
Not to be V.I but this is B.I (B.I)
Me and G.I be watched by the P.I's
See why we can't finish together
I'd rather do business than pleasure
And that's real (Killa)
[Chorus: Smokey Robinson sample]
If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna ride?Embed
