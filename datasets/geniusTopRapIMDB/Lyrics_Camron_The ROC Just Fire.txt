The ROC (Just Fire) Lyrics[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Cam'ron]
I wanna welcome you to extravaganza
Something incredible that's about to take place
World renowned
Roc-A-Fella, holler

[Break: Memphis Bleek]
Yeah, yeah, niggas
Just Blaze in this shit, ya heard? (It's your main man, I'm back, niggas)
Holler (Yo, yo)
[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
My break, I'm fresh off it
I never change, I'm stuck in these ways, Nike Airs, sweats and Taurus (Huh?)
But I'ma do it for my enemies
They wanna end my chill, wanna see what that villa be
Now, what that sound like?
Plus, they know what a clip get down like
Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, pain and pills
'Cause you fucking with a nigga that'll jump out, wave the steel
I live this way, it's real, dog, it's no joke
Blow smoke in your bitch face, piss on your wheels
Slap your custies, clap your worker, dead the strip
Stick your connect, yap your bitch
So let it be known, I'm back on my grizzly
The sergeant, the cap, the MAC holds sixty
For rookies and vets, I'll bang 'til it click (Click)
So run and tell your dude that the Ruger come with two clips, dog
M-Easy, won't leave, my hood need me
Pop for sheezy, who don't believe me?
We all criminals, but live like a diplomat
We get low, when the dough low, get it back

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel & Cam'ron]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man for Killa Cam
Me and my Roc killer fam, top billers, man (Man)
We run the spots, drop ceilings, fam (Fam)
Hit the wall, drop ceiling fans (Uh)
Listen, boy, man, I show you how to fill a van up with killers, man
And line the trunk, keep a stash box for the nine and the pump
The coach walk you through and he grind you up
What you want, the dope or the weed?
How you wan' package it, in the cap or the bag?
How you want me packing, with the MAC or the mag?
Yeah, that Bent' get back, but listen, scrap, act real fast
And keep a wack that'll gag your back
Block style from your swagger, your swacks
It's the Broad Street Bully, bitch
Bully niggas on the broadest streets
I house niggas on the narrowest block
Know my rules when the barrel get hot
When the gun blows, and the shots fall, and the smoke clear
Man, I be hearin' you were murdered (You ain't here)
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (You ain't here)
Nobody be missin' your loss 'cause you deserved it
South Philly niggas kill at will
I keep my MAC-milli chilly chill (Uh)
On the really real 'fore I make you niggas feel this steel (Killa, Killa)

Go 'head, stupid niggas, go fuck with them chicks (Yeah)
I'm the third little piggy, I'ma fuck with them bricks (Bricks)
Better yet, the bakery, I got pies and cakes (Cakes)
Nigga think doublin' is turnin' five to eight
I turn eight to twenty, twenty to a hundred, hundred to thousand
That to a hundred thousand (Thousand)
In front of housin' (Housin')
Closed the mall down, dog, no one's allowed in (Allowed in)
I'm coppin' everything, I'm done with browsin' (Give me that)
It's the top don, Glock palm, dot com
Get your shit rocked, mon, like Hasim Rahman (Rahman)
And I'm extra scary
CEOs, all the frontin' ain't necessary (Why?)
I fuck your secretaries
All for information, it ain't necessary (Nah, mon)
They in love like the 14th of February (Huh)
Play 'em like April 1st right before I slide off (Off)
It could be March 2nd, sound like July 4th (Blatt)
Halloween or Memorial Day
At your memorial be one year from today (Today)
All y'all think it's peace and peachy
I leave you reesy piecy
All my bitches rock Christian Dior, BCBG (Uh)
'Round phony niggas, get the heebie-jeebies
Hungry hoes say, "Killa, feed me, feed me"
Calm down, ma, easy, easy (Easy)
Talk greazy, please me, get my man Weezy
Still rock Ellesses to squeeze, appease me
He ain't no tease, but measly
Not Doggy's Angels, Killa, please believe me, uh
[Outro: Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek & Cam'ron]
You're now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Niggas wanna despise the team (Roc-A-Fella)
When shit goes down, you know who's doin' the poppin'
Killa
Si-Siegel-Siegel
M Bleek
Fuck those who disagree (Yeah), my bullets, you get 'em free
Roc in this mother-mother-motherfucker3Embed
