Killa, killa, killa, killa, killa, killa dog

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
What means the world to you
Cause money mean the world to me
I'm a shine for the world to see
Pearl the V twirl the key
F, kick back and twirl the weed
(Ma) Wanna roll wit a top gun
Hot one done pop one scrub not one
Wanna ride shotgun wanna shoot shot guns
And I got hot one's
But I wanna chick that'll hop up on a stick
Wit a porno flick
(Uh) Make sure my cum, she's gonna lick
More to sip but screw that
Where my thugs with the hollow tips
Girls that acknowledge it
Polish it after that swallow it
Stand by baby where you at huh?
Raise ya hand high
You dont suck what that's a damn lie
Got red rye my man ride my fam tide
So I need a real chick
Someone to keep it real wit
Someone to rob and steal wit
Someone to share my meal wit
It's that there look wit you
And be out for your revenue
Then even at you and she'll be blessin you
Caressin you startin that mess wit you
But you always good for now and plus no feds around
So girl jus come lift up that dress for now
And give me some points for now talk to me ma
[Hook]
What means the world to you my money, my doe, my hoes, my clothes
What means the world to you my money, my doe, my hair, my nails
What means the world to you some sex, some mex, and a little bit of head rah
What means the world to you to sex is sweet wit a cat who eat
What means the world to you lots of cheese shopping sprees
What means the world to you diamond rings shinin things

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
My cousin tandelese see the girl type honory
But the girlfriend was real real real fond of me
But the girl put her on to me and I'm like why
I mean come through wit her she drivin that alumina
I'm not even thinkin bout screwin her
Let alone pursuing her
I got a girl she like what that got to do wit her
Get through wit her mess around my gurl come down
And put two in her
But I'm in a heavy case like the type that pepsi make
Who you fake got pies like betty bake

Damn, in Harlem I'm Sammy order or so
