2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus) Lyrics[Verse 1]
My offense is a mixture of Mike and Muhammad
Knock a nigga unconscious and talk shit
In bare-knuckle boxin', speed is the object
Weavin' and dodgin' with defensive blockin'
So in the ring, you cannot win
The top ten become nine dead if I ever decide to hop in
With the one-two, one-two shot to the chin
Knock you out, like ten shots of vodka and gin
The beautiful blend of power and strength
From the top of my head, down to where my toe cuticles end
I verbally burn a nigga, lyrically hurt a nigga
Put a voodoo verse on a nigga, Kennedy curse a nigga
Who can spit the words quicker than the average man?
Who can embarrass a man? Bite you with fangs
And mangle your hands on candid cam? The Canibus can
The Canibus can, with the stamina to damage a man
[Hook]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!

[Verse 2]
Yo, I spit for it, rhyme for it, live for it, die for it!)
Back out the 9, commit a homicide for it
If I'm handcuffed with the right to remain silent for it
I'ma blow trial and do the federal time for it
You mad at the last album, I apologize for it
Yo, I can't call it, motherfuckin' Wyclef spoiled it
But this time for '99 I got 5 on it
You should double up and put a dime on it
Matter of fact, triple your nickel and put 14.99 on it
I'ma shine on it, watch Flex drop the bomb on it
About ten times on it, watch people call a request line for it
Cipha Sounds keep pushin' rewind on it
Look out for the album with the Canibus design on it
12 o'clock in the morning you'll be standing on line for it
I'm a live poet, with a sharp ear and eye for it
‘Cause I tear down mics and put a out-of-order sign on it
You might also like[Hook]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!

[Verse 3]
Yo, I rip shit with the ballistic characteristics
Of a hollow-tip at point-blank distance
I flip shit when I spit shit; Father, forgive Bis
I just snatched the Jesus piece off some Christians
‘Cause they sounded like idiots
They went from silver to gold to platinum
After the millennium they'll probably be wearing Iridium
They so gassed, if a bitch sucked they dick
They'd probably cum helium
Y'all niggas can't be serious, I was nice before ice
Before Christ, before the words, "Let there be light"
And a light took over the night, I was born with a mic
Lord of the mic, before all plant and animal life
Took this rap shit to new heights
Before the Wright brothers took flight
Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes
Before MC's picked up pens and started to write
Before promotional marketin' and posterlights
The Can-I-Bus'll bust up mics, punch out lights
Punch out your motherfuckin' eyesight, for the title bout fight
Ask Ty Fyffe, I snatch the track for half price
The Canibus is too nice; give me that mic!!
[Hook]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)
So come on, (Hold on!) hold on!Embed
