4, 3, 2, 1 (Original Verse) LyricsMethod, where the gods at? Redman, where the squad at?
Yo L, is that a mic on your arm? Let me borrow that
Who's the God of rap you saying is nice?
I'll beat a dead nigga to death and beat a dead nigga to life
If you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough and then I'll call your bluff
Let's see how many rhymes you got
I can go on for more Millenias than Mazdas got in a car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I'll call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take them in all shapes, sizes, and forms, spit on
Any emcees who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to 60? I'm already doing a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Your head will spin so fast, you'll catch whiplash
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
Make your hard drive crash, the C colon backslash
And I'll go back to the booth to school your whack ass
Because the object of the game is to spark every cell in your brain
At degrees hotter than blue flames
Propane gasses, it incinerate you into ashes
I got you breathin' harder than girls in Lamaze classes
Stop bitchin' about if it's written or freestyle
Got the whole Spanish community saying I'm muy mal
Charging niggas with booty styles $50 fines
In addition to $25 for whack punchlines
â€™Cause I'm the top dog running the yard
And I represent cause I never chained to the fence
Hence to battle me is impossible
I'll put your whole crew in the hospital with IVs all in their nostrils
Stop sleeping on me, I ain't a mattress
Put you through more drama than a soap opera actress
Don't even think about pulling out and opening fire
Gunshots wound but I remove bullets with pliers
I aspire to kick the fattest that you've ever witnessed
From a far side, that's even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge
I'll make your head nod 'til your neck runs out of cartilage
I think it's obvious that I can bring the ruckus
Scream on your crew like a military drill instructor
When I come through, niggas stand stiller than statues
If I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nervesYou might also like1Embed
