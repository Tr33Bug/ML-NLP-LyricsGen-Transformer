Canibus /\ Cambatta Lyrics[Verse 1: Canibus]
I'm a nine-dimensional being spitting photon directional beams
CBD serve my medical needs
Move your ass, nigga ain't got no gravitas
I'ma tell you one time, me and you are not sized
There is no secret for patience, the key to being patient is sacred
And those results are not easily taken
You want to build? Do it for real
Unite, brother, steel sharpens steel
Listen to me, just (breathe)
Yea, I be old-school growling, communities by the thousands and counting
Coming down off a Mingledorff mountain
With books and tube pouches and million dollar equipment vouchers
Education, you ain't shit without it, how about it?
They took the game make it hard to support that lane
YouTube views probably bought that fame
I'd rather go to bass shop pro than deal with yo ignorant ass, yo
'cause our people are always last to know
Rap music should have been had unions, but it don't
Try to get 'em to stop the confusion, but they won't
And now here we are, 2018, still got the same problems
Chaos a prelude to conflict
You know necessity is the mother of ideas
And a bad idea is the father of all fears
The black and loud herd mentality crowd dreadlocks
Be looking like some dirty ass black and mild's
If you ain't melanated? Black or brown? You ain't down
How that sound? Who's possessed by the spirit of a savage now?
You better check them false facts in your files
Division'll have your mouth starving looking for a hand out
Man down, everybody fan out, it's your fault the plan went south
Say the word you the big man now
I don't think so, they move every way the wind blow
Kimbo, purse snatch a bimbo don't get shit though
Homie, these niggas lonely and phony
Crowd-funded for groceries, some of these Hotep niggas is hungry
I germinated the waters, you just tasting out of my faucet
You like the taste? We created the sources/sauces
The Jamaican mason cooking Cajun bacon with a fig-leaf apron
With the information to raise a nation
The green is the Ankh, the black is the God
My gold staff is a stick that makes buckets of lard
Lord Have Mercy, that nigga got bars
James Bond with a turbo-saw, but still they resent the God
Spit bars til my voice goes hoarse, circular saws slice jaws
No novacaine but take twice as long
I am the monk of Mingledorff, I mutilate every single song
My drum machine cut your fingers off
Let's talk; I see where you went wrong
You was smoking embalming fluid out the morgue and held your breathe too long
Yea, I'm floored but my God is an awesome God
Meanwhile, your paws are too short to walk with dogs
Mt. Rushmore Olmec face; your security clearance not up to date
So I'ma have to stop you at the gate
Thermovision whistles and bells, your superheat smells
So on your way to Hell let me give you this cool gel
Sound off, let me hear you yell; who you gonna tell?
When I was proof-reading the grail? You was learning how to spell
Talk to my abbot; I hooked the dragon up to your wagon
2018, you talking about horsepower, you lackin'
Layerin raps, matching, you still mackie-board four tracking
Rip the Jacker got all the action
Canibus, Cambatta classic, Full Spectrum Dominance
Triple blackness, release the albino kraken
[Verse 2: Cambatta]
On the bible, I swore solemnly
Lord watching me, born of a moor progeny
Source of a pure prophecy
Before Constantine, travel to Nicaea and courted a core following
Modestly, freedom before sovereignty
I don't believe in the theme of a war policy
Amistad, land of the street and like four blocks from me
Cinque speaking and God orator pompously
My phrase couplets change the way brains function
Hard metal skin brown 'cause it's rain rusted
Tie ropes to your limbs then i play puppets
Cut a hole in your stomach then i make munchkins
I ate tongues to taste tastebuds
If you taste my tastebuds you'll taste bud
I showed up at gunfights and gave hugs
Make em put they guns down
Shoot em with the same gun, blame drugs
Failure is the best lesson
She didn't know my name but she kept guessing
I told her gold string makes the best threading
When I rump, my steel skin deflects weapons
Teflon chest vested, lungs burning
Breath ganja, sweat resin, ep-lep-tic (epileptic)
Before the beginning I knew the best ending
Thought of the answer before the next question
Soothsayer, earth sun moonmaker
Born instantly, mother never knew labor
Shroom taker, Obi with the blue saber
Legend King James left out like a new maker
Who's greater? I draw a circle on a Etch A Sketch
No birth defects but I got death defects
Exhale, reach out, catch the breath
We inhale it back in before the second breath
Melchizedek, hope is like a god that I never met
Sleeping so hard that I rest erect
I found a treasure chest
I'ma carry as much as my hands hold then I'm leaving you whatever's left
I rotate the earth with my feet
Like I'm running on the top exterior of a hamster wheel
He's the Morpheus, I'm the Exile
In the simulation, we got the keys and the pills
Dr. Seuss talk to Zeus
Jump up, grab the sun, alleyoop
Break the chain to the subconscious loop
Prophets' moms are commonly prostitutes
God's recruit, lies are the honest truth
Crabs are big spiders in lobster suits (cute)
Pen sharp, when I write cut a desk in half
My writtens are better chiseled than metal slabs
Lift iron, my sceptre's a magnetic staff
Long blade hidden inside like a machete has
Repenting penning a pentagram in a pantograph
Fresh up out the pen in a pentagon with a weapon stash
Get it past, sleight of hand, Penn & Teller fast
Fast like the Pentium i9 that Dell'll have
Heavy like appendix that Adele'll have
White singer, Lightbringer, let the devil cast
Horse legs, Annamite figure goat head attached
Born Siamese till I ate the second half like a breakfast snack
Colorblind, only see things in the three that my spectrum has
Green, red and black like the Kenyan flag
Every fella Helen Keller ever met is black
I love neck so much I bought a pet giraffe
Bang arm like funny bone and then I laugh
Fist iron, beat sand out a heavy bag
Right jab, right jab, tip to the left and jab
Left body uppercut, head hit the leather mat
Hopefully he wakes up after ten seconds pass
I hit him harder than gettin past a depressin past
I throw my du-rag in the sea and trigger a three
Hundred and sixty degree tidal wave
We are each one cell in a giant brain
Life a game, self is the boss in the final stage
Compared to the Nephilim, Yao Ming's a dwarf
King of lords with double door to Mingledorff
Cambatta, Canibus, bring a cross
Carry it up a mountain till we exhaustYou might also like1Embed
