Channel Zero Lyrics[Intro]
Approximately fifty years ago, under the direction of President Harry Truman, and in the interest of national security, a group of twelve top military scientific personnel were established. This group's primary objective was to desensitize us to the truth, and to suppress the material evidence that our planet is being visited by a group of extraterrestrial biological entities called The Grays

[Chorus]
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero

[Verse 1]
Yo, sometimes the road to the truth is so elusive, it's confusin'
And reality becomes illusion
If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was goin'
I'd shatter the social balance of the world as we know it
I'm talkin' 'bout the grand deception of 1947
When our souls were sold to the heavens
For technologically advanced weapons
Crystal enhanced, brain implants, and mind control methods
MJ-12 is not majestic
And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic
You can accept it, or be stupid and be a skeptic
And fail to recognize the secret society's death wish
Ninety-seven percent of our Presidents were Masons
Responsible for launderin' trillions of dollars from the nation
For the construction of underground military installations
Abductions and cattle mutilations
Experiments on human patients
Can take place in several subterranean bases
A hundred and fifty storeys below a basement
With knowledge of genetic information, you need to fear science not Satan
'Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents
They create strange creations
Top secret special operations
Low frequency sounds and lasers, people like Carl Sagan
That didn't believe in the Drake equation
Were tryin' to keep Western civilization on the need-to-know basis
Well, you need to know that this is a game
And we're bein' betrayed and played in the worst way
[Chorus]
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero

[Verse 2]
Yo, the Holy Script from Genesis 1:26 says
"Let us make man in our image under our likeness"
First of all who's "they?"
You see if God was truly a single entity, that's not what He would say
We as the Elohim, Gods and Goddesses
Possess a marvelously monstrous subconscious
Lifeforms that speak, in very high pitched sounds and squeaks
Short staccato clicks and beeps
A highly advanced form of speech
Even though to us, it seems like they only chatterin' they teeth
They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath
'Til they fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep
Then they evolved into mammals with feet
And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach
They used gravity, 'cause it's actually the only force around
That could slow time and the speed of light down
The energy grid network opened the gateway from Earth
To any point in the universe
Livin organisms and various geomagnetic gravitational anomaly areas
Space expedition teams in the lunar regions
Reported seein', decapyramids and tetrahedrons
Liquid filled shoes, is what they used
To walk across the moon without leavin' a clue
Of where they been for the past twenty-three billion years
Before life on the surface even appeared
I hope you become aware what I'm spittin' in your ear
Was intended to stimulate your left brain's hemisphere
I know it sounds weird, all these motherfuckin' answers
And questions to the grand deception
