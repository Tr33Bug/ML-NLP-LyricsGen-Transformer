Dead by Design Lyrics[Intro: Professor Griff]
Canibus
Throwing melanated molotov cocktails
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Ripping the jacker, ain't nobody nastier
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
Canibus the lyrical adjective killer

[Verse 1: Canibus]
My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets
Come take a walk with Canibus
Ardipithecus Ramidus, what the fuck is Melatonin Magik Bis?
I still ain't understanding this shit
Okay, my brain is a microchip
My two balls with a cane is a macro-dick, I rap so sick
I created swine ploo out of an infinite mix
You tried to diss but can't even spit, you just stand there and wish
With your hand on your hips, man you a bitch
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent
I ain't heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized, can't nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
So yes, it's immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being misled
There are forces above them that feed off our stress, suffering and debt
I am Dead by Design, cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
You tryna to plan a great escape? You're a coward
They gon' march into a gas chamber make us think we're taking a shower
Mommas and babies is crying
The children of Zion belong to Skynet, nobody knows who's behind it
So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either
But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer
In the metaphysical aether, you listening to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher, empirical speaker
After this album they gon' call me a leader
But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like Pac
Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive
If it's like that, then fuck Tiamaat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standing there staring, fuck everything on this planet
Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens
Acting like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us
Just come done and help us, I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy, crunchy, black crawling out of Hell's pit
You scream for hardcore, I felt it
But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit?
You won't do a motherfucking thing
Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit
Cause if my Brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they ain't ready for their own freedom neither, they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat 'em
Like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus
How many meters? Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even
That's where the biggest demon is
It's no secret, but nobody else sees it, so they won't believe it
But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps, wow
Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown
I didn't mean what I said, please don't kill me now
My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle
But at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad
I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag
What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like?
Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
They still ask me about 'Second Round' even now
(Interviewers voice) Canibus can you tell us of what happened again? - Look at this fucking clown
Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question
And act like I was the one promoting it, hang up on 'em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate, twelve years later I'm on some other shit
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships
[Outro: Professor Griff]
After this album they gon' call me a leader but I'm not
The Illuminati just gon' murder me like they did Pac
Blood sacrifice or not
It's Professor Griff the ex-minister
