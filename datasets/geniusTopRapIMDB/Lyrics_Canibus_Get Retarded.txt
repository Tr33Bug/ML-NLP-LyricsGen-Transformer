Get Retarded Lyrics[Intro]
"I-I-I want you..."
"G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
"Get re- Get re- Get retarded"
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
"I want you..."
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"

[Verse 1]
Yo, niggas is phony, fronting like they Master of Ceremonies
None of you suckers are even remotely close to me
To be nice, I sacrifice things like no sleep
I keep a library of lyrics on microfiche
Creating concepts so deep niggas quote me
They rewind then interpret my rhymes to they homies
I've advanced beyond your flows eons ago
It's inevitable in '98 I'ma blow
Ever since '84, I've been in it to win it
But see back then we used to battle by spinnin' on the cement
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved
I travel to the end of the Universe and beyond
Parsecs out of range from a cellular StarTec
From the galaxy of Andromeda
I puzzle niggas like crop circles and other unexplained phenomena
[Hook]
Ayo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless
"Get re- Get re- Get retarded"
Ayo, I came to see that hip-hop is never tarnished
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
So I
"I want you..."
"G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"

[Verse 2]
Ayo, all I really want is you niggas to stop bitin'
All I really want is you niggas to start writin'
All I really want is you niggas to be original
And start spitting some lyrical shit that I could listen to
You haven't written the perfect rhyme yet
You don't even know the sequences to the Human Genome Project
You haven't come to terms with your god yet
And you refuse to believe in Unidentified Flying Objects
When I bomb shit, I get retarded, probably more than you bargained
I'm talking 'bout rip a mic off your arm shit
Hype shit, blow up a mic shit, you might get
Beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick
To the British, I'm Gandhi
To the Japanese, I'm an American pilot flying over Nagasaki
To the AIDS patient, I'm your last antibody
Sitting and waiting for a cure from modern biology

Ayo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless
"Get re- Get re- Get retarded"
Ayo, I came to see that hip-hop is never tarnished
"G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
So I
"I want you..."
"G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"

[Verse 3]
Yo, I be looking directly into the human eye to see if you pussy
And completely ruin your ability to lie to me
I pull a nine on a bully, cock back the cannon
God damn it, I don't think you fully understand it
Ask nine out of ten niggas on the planet
Who the best is, the question will go unanswered
Till I step up to the front line with rhymes
Revving my engines like they were powered by Le Mans
Murdering niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA's double-helix
I leave you in troubled spirits
I'm absolutely the purest breed of MC
From the United States of America to Europe I deserve it
However you wanna word it, I'm perfect
Touch my microphone on accident and get murdered on purpose
Motherfucker!
