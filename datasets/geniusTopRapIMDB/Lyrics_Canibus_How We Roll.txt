How We Roll Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never freestyle for free, without chargin' niggas a fee
It'll cost you a brain cell just to cypher with me
I'm the type of MC that rocks for the glory
I don't give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me
Freestyle or written, spittin' with infinite ammunition
For anybody tryin' to go the distance
I promise ya no less than a hundred-thousand kilometers
My bomb threats'll have you evacuatin' your continent
I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric
Hittin' you with lyrics that separate your body from your spirit
This is for wack niggas doin' shows and shit
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin it
(Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holdin it)
[Hook: Panama P.I.]
I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas

[Verse 2]
We savages, snatchin' microphones from amateurs
Cause like women who get abortions, I ain't havin' it
I rip you, my metaphor content, will split you
Into little powder-like crystals so I can sniff you
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian
Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias
Have you any idea what I do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career, I ran through?
Comin' after ya, blastin' ya
With the shotgun like a front seat passenger
You must be askin' for some sort of a massacre
I'll attack ya cardiovascular
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses
Rip your speaker to ashes, and kick a hole in it
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin it

[Hook: Panama P.I.]
You see I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas

I'm the illest lyricist in America
MC's can't see me 'cause I'm too quick for the human retina to register
I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves
At a Speed that would confuse Keanu Reeves
So ask yourself, who am I?
I'm the illest MC that you ever seen in your fuckin' life
I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme
Till the meter says nine, nine, nine, nine
Line for line I battle any kind of MC at any time
Whether they signed or unsigned
With many lines, more lines than a million pair of Adidas
More lines than the Bible quoted from Jesus
More lines than a African herd of zebras
Niggas just ain't fuckin' with the Canibus sativa
This is for all you niggas doin' shows and shit
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it
(Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holdin it)

[Hook: Panama P.I.]
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced nigga!2Embed
