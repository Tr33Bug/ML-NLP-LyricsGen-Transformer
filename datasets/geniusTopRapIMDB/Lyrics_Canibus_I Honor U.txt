I Honor U Lyrics[Chorus: Jenny Fujita]
We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart, I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Ayo, boy meets girl, boy really likes her
Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her
Girl has no clue that boy is a liar
And he has no honor
So she dates him regardless 'cause she thought he was harmless
And he had her believin' he was the man she wanted
To spend the rest of her life with
The words "I love you" are priceless, unpredictable like rolling dices
Nonetheless, in spite of the frightenin' repercussions you might get
People still risk they necks
Of course it's nice, the feeling of courtship, roses and stuff
Women never get it often enough
And the reason people love they mother so much
Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust
It's a five letter word, that should only occur between him and her
Before the bees and the birds, word
[Chorus: Jenny Fujita]
We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart ,I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I heard a soft moan in the middle of March
Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart
"On your mark, get set, go!" I was off
Flagella was my propeller wigglin' back and forth
Then I set a course for the border
Mother Nature's karma callin' me to the Rock of Gibraltar
The competition tried to be smart, but I was smarter
My competitors were swimmin' fast, so I swam harder
Submerged in water, prayin' to my Heavenly Father
If I don't make it through, I'm a goner
Screamin' out "Death Before Dishonor"
Because I'm awesomely stronger, my stamina lasts longer
I was destined to be a son instead of a daughter
XY is the male chromosomal order
One'll stay alive, and survive, the rest'll be dead
Cause I'ma be the one to fertilize that egg

In the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Ayo mommy, I'm up in your stomach buggin'
Whenever you rub it, I love it
Like a comforters covers you warm as a oven
Your husband - stubborn, how can you love him?
Smokin' cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that I'm comin'
Bad move, you hopin' that daddy improves
Knowin' in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel
You've been abused, used, you've got, wounds and scars
Think with your mind not with your heart, let's go to Grandma's
Terminate the lease, call the landlord
Give your job two weeks notice, pack up the car, and go to New York
What part? They got a little borough called the Bronx, mom
And I heard that's where hip-hop is gonna start
Hell yeah! I think we need to be right there
Four months in your stomach and I already chose a career
When you cry, I hear and I wish I could dry your tears
But I can't cause I'm stuck in here
Five months from bein' able to lay against your chest
I can't even hold you in my arms 'cause they ain't developed yet
But I swear to you, as to God's Almighty Truth
I'ma be there for you, I'ma be there for you
[Chorus: Jenny Fujita]
We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart ,I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets1Embed
