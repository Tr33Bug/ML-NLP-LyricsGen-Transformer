Levitibus Lyrics[Intro: TV Sample]
"You want power...but you're not big enough
So you steal it piece by piece, tainted and spoiled
And you're weak... step by step you'll weaken and the power...."

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I harness the power of the chakra, remote viewing into darkness
Describing what I see in the process
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
Geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of polaramine makes it feel like a dream
The dream state is the playground for the supreme
Critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
To create a universe all I need
Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees
Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber
Keep the noise down so I don't arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened Coca-Cola can
Showed the whole plan in coded program
Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band
Hold up, let me load it in
[Hook - samples from Outer Limits and "Exertions (Remix) by Jedi Mind Tricks]
"Put a curse on you"
"You want to take over"
“You clash with cyanide gas and die fast”
"Another mystery" "Are you gonna put a curse on me"
"There's no need"
“Rhythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas”

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
You diss me out of pride, but when you're finished
Talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes
Even my worst album was sublime
If I don't slow down, I'll distort the timeline
Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again
A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon
The grand architect
Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet
No regrets, you live and you learn
I'm through giving advice, I just give concern
Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs
And try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned
I prefer modesty over controversy
But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me
Jealous because they can't rhyme like me
And they never had a scientific mind like me

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm above average with verbal semantics
The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad
They look at me like, "Poor bastard
Why can't you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic?"
No matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw I grabbed it, obviously that's the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness
When I wrote that Stan shit
But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
And I'll come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls
If you can find a better flow?
Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
Hey, you shouldn't fall for the naivete
Lyrically I'm the illest but my beats is okay
Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
I'm ahead of my time or so they say
I guess that's why I already feel old and grey
OK, that's enough knowledge for today, I'm killing them
You better not forget it 'cause this is Levitibus
