Lyrical Noir Lyrics[Verse: Canibus]
Gimme some more slack on this rope
I run your boney-ass throat over in a zodiac boat
46 degrees north, 6 degrees east
The Large Hadron Collider gave birth to a beast that speaks
They quote my speech, vocal motifs over dope beats
All lyricists know me
That’s why the industry’s debunking my lyrics
With digital trunking equipment, they don’t want you to listen
The Ripper’s language won’t appeal to the masses
Because they look past it
Only the masters know the seal of the scarab
Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances
You organic piece of shit, you substandard
But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status
It’s up to you to find the right questions and ask it
Research leads to results, sometimes we find meaning after
Other times they’re just meaningless babblers
Don’t believe these rappers fake unbelievable bastards
Comet Elenin is coming straight at us, don’t believe NASA
Take matters into your own hands
Stop being slow and acting like hoes, get with the fucking program
Hip Hop is the greatest genre known to man
If we focus, the poetry is so advanced
We can overthrow any plan and control man
You got soul? Let’s Jam! Lyrical Law, I’m the Canibus Man
What’s the buying-minimum? 88 sales, program
And the number of stores, I don’t care no more
This is Lyrical Law Noir, hardcore raw
Metaphors for you and yours, you can’t say you wasn’t warned!
Thousands of bars, them dummies couldn’t stomach my bars
They rather conform, they throwing up their pompoms
You don’t wanna wrestle with Armstrong
We sever blood vessels tryna mess with the gods' poem
Damage any motherfucking beat that I rhyme on
Connect to the gods' thoughts, project your iPod, I grind hard
Intellectual hardboard, take it back to Hip Hop style wars
Grunting like a pack of wild boars
Power source Lyrical Law my bomb squad full force
Call ‘em off we got too much torque
Nitrous Oxide Bars pull a bull off course
Pitchfork to your neck just to prove I’m raw
Iron horse, smack DVD, battle rap boss
Slap you with the flat part of the sword, now you back for more
Passing yourself off like a rap star, but you support whack bars
That’s why rap is lost — fact!
You a Cool J crack whore
You snitch like police labradors tryna sniff out Sasquatch
Man up, no more lip-service and backwalls
Stand up! I’ma break off your back paws, thor’s hammer crack jaws
Attack y'all, fracture your scull
Mountain man axe to your loins
Self-employed like Donald Goines
Cash cows on steroids
I don’t fall for deceptions or decoys
I’m a beast and I’m clairvoyant
Yo soy gon' tear the beat up, whether or not you appear on it
Double trouble dear promise
Fuck you and your comets
The chairman and Lyrical Law will be honored
The last man standing, after the internet is abandoned
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
The cops brainwashed Hip-hop
And they came from Saturn
They were the first alien race of rappers
They landed in North-Africa
Their teeth be gnashing
Their names look like acronyms
They released the kraken
They live in underground cabins
They sliver fast through the inner-earth labyrinth
They move in S-patterns though deep planet chasms
I chase ‘em and trap ‘em
Detailing the action
For try’na desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master, faggots
I laid them on top of each other like Abu Ghraib
They spacecraft look like the Eiffel tower in Paris
They pray for my downfall and orchestrated hip-hop’s imbalance
They underestimated my talent
I hold the globe up like Atlas
They lied about Canibus — ask ‘em
I’m the world’s greatest motherfucking rapper!
They slandered my character through the public propaganda
They tell the people I’m Dr. Doppelganger
They ask me shit, did they know I’m not gon' answer?
Extinction level event, they can’t stop the disaster
Cocksucker stop the camera, cause you know that I’m a miserable bastard
I crack lens, break microchips and melt plastic
You Canibus? – Who’s asking?
That’s Captain Cold Crush to you maggot, You a lyrical has-been
Lyrical Law’s a classic, they can’t get past it
The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
Lyrical Law’s a classic they can’t get past it
They beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
The microphone assassin ’bout to get at ‘em
The Dragon of Judah breathe fire ’til its last breath
Full battle-rapper in action lyrical metal jackets
Coming through, with several new attachments
Computers is crashing, hackers is laughing
Rapid eye movement, try to keep up with the captain
