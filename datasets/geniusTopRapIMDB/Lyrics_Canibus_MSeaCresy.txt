M-Sea-Cresy Lyrics"Those who create literature know first-hand
Just how difficult creating music can be..."

"..There are no options now.."

"...If I weren't a writer, I think I'd be a total psychological mess"

[Canibus]
Out of the Umbilicus Mundi, this is lyrical lunacy
From a human being to speak so fluently
Bars of poetry without precedence
Complete par excellence, listen to the Levitibus Testament
To understand me you need help
You gotta see the film "The Day After Trinity" written by John Else
To understand that, you must know thyself
You should keep listening cause Canibus flow might help

"...But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps"
"...other's say they're bad, but they're buggin'"
"...Never that, I'm constantly comin with clever raps"
"...Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict"
"...I'm not an emcee who talkin all that junk"
"...Please, a lot of suckas would like to forget me but"
"...The incredible, lyrical, and original"
"...I grab the steel with the chrome on top"

[Canibus]
To find the answers that we didn't know, maybe Edgar Allan Poe's
Description of El Dorado is not so
See the reason there's no light at the end of tunnel
Is cause we're really not in a tunnel, we're trapped in a bubble
The government hierarchy and the dregs of society
Can you explain why you believe hell is fiery?
We're suffering from symptoms of drapetomania
Slavery isnt over, it just took a new alias
The data repository established for the maintenance
Almost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens
Why write lyrics when I make a better livin
Sellin freeze dried venom to wildlife clinics?
Cause I hate the thought of bein a predictable bore
Once you get used to me you won't love me no more
The final soliloquy of the internal paramour
What are we all to do when rap music is gone?
I hope God and the imagination are one
A golden tongue can achieve synchronicity with the sun
Transcended beyond the flesh and the blood
Cause this is level one, after this album my message is done

[Canibus]
But you can't battle me, so you'd rather embarrass me
I maintain dignity in the face of calamity
They reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly
But I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky
A student so overzealous I motivate my trainers
I'd rather get some now then get some later
Take a break from writin rhymes on paper, recondition my character
Change my nature with seven days of Vipassana
Let go of the stress, man I was deeply depressed
So famished in fact, I needed a rest
To regenerate my mind
Bless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn oil and wine
Then see the light, an illuminous paradigm
It became more apparent with time
All I had to do was follow the signs
To be a better man, I need help
I've just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself

[Outro]
"People are usually terrified of poetry
And they don't realize that its just speech
It is language that is sometimes extraordinary
But there are ways to deal with it without worrying about it the way they do"Embed
