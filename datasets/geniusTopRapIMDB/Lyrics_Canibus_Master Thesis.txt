Master Thesis Lyrics[Verse: Canibus]
This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
Color is vibration, vibration is sound
Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, South West, East
North, North East, North West
And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
The Best of Bis orbitally rearranged
Monoatomic elements with adept intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
Before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidean in form
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria
With processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
And thhey burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
Said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'll think about going
The process was slow and the dough was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I ain't never travelled that far from home
But I heard about the beauty of Cydonian snow
Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass
I'll be crazy to pass
I like Algerian Jazz
The blue twilight band that plays, tunes from a laser black sax
It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Oh how I miss my nautilus
I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist
You have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now and death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Use the aphrodisiac to get a female
Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale
Grand Marnier for me, scotch on the rocks for you
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton
Reminiscing about the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turned into applause
My jaw's stronger than the Caninde Macaw's
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
Don't want to rap no more, it's been so long
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
I'm out in the bush and the sticks humping a 100 clicks
Dr Scholls gave me a good fit
Me and him went to school together back in '86
When I was really ill
Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
You wanna laugh now and cast your belligerent doubt
Show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhoea, nausea and dry mouth
You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out
Before the community of real MCs die out
College students say to me, "You ain't smart"
Record label A&Rs say, "This ain't art"
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
Listen to my chest beat, tell me this ain't heart
You gotta be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus
