Phuk U Lyrics[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, okay

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, ayo, nobody can flow with Bis, rock a show with Bis
Or go toe to toe with Bis, none of y'all can coexist
We livin' in an Ice Age and its cold as shit
A hundred thousand dollar price range, niggas is frozen stiff
All I know is this, my felt tip hotter than hell get
A hundred eighty-six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh
Give a nigga a tan
Aerosol cans expand and explode in my hand
While I promote that new Canibus jam
Niggas feel it underground with stalactites hangin' from the ceiling
I'm out on tour with 30 city trips
Every state it's like bitches be bulimic for dicks
Screamin' the chorus half-unconscious, I hold my cordless
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest
While the people go insane for us
I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us
Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I ain't payin for it
I freestyle the whole set
Kickin' a hundred bars, nigga fuck who's on next
Fuck you!
[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, okay

[Verse 2]
(Fuck) Them extra niggas that's always around you
(Fuck) Niggas that talk about you and try to clown you
(Fuck) Niggas you run into that never did nothin' for you
(Fuck) Niggas thats lyin' tellin' people they discovered you
(Okay, fuck) Niggas that's jealous cause you nicer than them
Don't give a (fuck) who you offend, you gotta fight 'til the end
If you (fuck) a groupie chicken when you out on tour
Smoke a little bit of weed with her then (fuck) her some more
Tell her to bring three friends so you can (fuck) all four
Menage-a-trios, what the (fuck) she expect you, a dog?
Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls
So if you like to (fuck) pussy, that don't mean that you wrong
Unless you (fuck) it raw dog
I (fuck) a nappy dugout, bust in her mouth
Kick her the (fuck) out
She'll cuss me out like

[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

Yo, yo, your superstar status don't mean shit to me
Lyrically, sucker emcees still get fricasseed
Try to diss me now, how you sound?
Yo, whoever signed you must be runnin' the circus 'cause you a clown
You a rapper with a drug habit, hidin' the truth
Camouflaging ya needle tracks with some colorful tattoos
You was never equipped for this, never equipped to spit with Bis
I'm swift as shit, let me point out the main differences
You magnificent, I'm mic-nificent
Yo, I'd even go out on a limb with it, say you write a little bit
That don't make you a tight lyricist
Cause you don't practice or stick with it
Look at the 60 hour shifts I spend with this
I never quit, I got a gift for the art
A low maintenance cost, no physical movin' parts
In '98, niggas thought I was God, how the fuck did that change?
I'm still one of the illest niggas in the game
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see
If you see a hungry nigga then you lookin' at me
And its aight if you don't trust me 'cause I don't trust you
As a matter of fact I'll probably buss you, motherfucker
Fuck you!

[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you (for real!), fuck you (nigga!), fuck you (bitch!), fuck you, okay1Embed
