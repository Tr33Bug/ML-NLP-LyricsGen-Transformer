Second Round K.O. Lyrics[Intro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man
[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin' that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin' clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin' off your body 'cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You drippin' with wack juice and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Interlude: Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all
[Verse 2: Canibus]
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack-ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul; rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is somethin' different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you somethin', you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verseâ€”fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say "Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is."
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
Fuck that! 'Cause like Common and Cube, I See the Bitch in Yoo
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds, Can-i-bus

[Outro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus man, you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man, you in-and-out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right, you got to eat, man
That's your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you, but dig right
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's
For lunch, breakfast, dinner; that's your agenda, baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence, they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever, Mike Tyson, on the def11Embed
