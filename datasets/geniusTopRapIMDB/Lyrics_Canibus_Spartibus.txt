Spartibus Lyrics[Intro: Canibus]
Spartibus
Yeah, this is Spartibus
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Canibus]
You wanna spar with Bus, then let's get started, cuz
Atomic thrusts turn you into cosmic dust
Bomb your borders with Japanese Spigot mortars
Recompose your composition to sawdust
Time is breath, breath is life, life is light
Light is no less than capital C on the mic
Beneath the mirage of night, I'll attack you twice
Prepare the river sacrifice for my ritual rites
Reinforce my habitual likes and dislikes
Then diss you on the mic 'cause I'm sick of the hype
No one's ever written what I write, compare the calligraphy type
Tell me yo, how can I not be nice?
The royal semen of Caesar frozen in a cryofreezer
On sale for seven figures per milliliter
Lethally illegal, I speak to the people
In the form of an eagle on top of the Thebes Cathedral
With boundless knowledge like hairless Dalai Lamas
With linen garments neatly wrapped around armpits
With monasteries in the mountains
Trumpets have already sounded, you can't denounce my crown bitch
[Hook: Rakim sample]
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods

[Verse 2: Canibus]
This game is Chinese chess
Countless issues need to be addressed before the East nukes the West
Totalitarianistic cause and effect
Run the words through a decompressor, recompress the depth
Canibus is the most explosive next to meth
The inconsistency of the text makes me complex
Pay attention to Bis, my intention is this
Leave you spatially adrift, suspended in the abyss
Marijuana plant owner, smell my aroma
Contract scirrhous carcinoma and retinoblastoma
Confederate federal general, the electric general
FCC, omni-directional antenna poles
IFF, identification friend or foe
This areas restricted, don't let 'em through
He'll mock your style, rock you to the ground
With the bite force of a Sarcosuchus crocodile
Travel a fiber optic mile before you can smile
So don't ask me why and don't ask how

Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Until I'm impressed with the print, I can hear a pin drop like Sprint
Once it blends I can stop right then
Quantum coupling mechanisms and technical shit
Confuses you, but I don't think you're any less of a dick
Just define what is poetry and what is rap
I demonstrate how to effectively bridge the gap
The answer is simple in fact
If the protons don't attack the retina, all we'd ever see is black
No ability, no extraocular motility
Silly MCs can't see me lyrically or visually
They'll never be better than me
I'll triple team 'em with a trinity severed in 3 and give 'em 9 enemies
Climb back to periscope depth in 2 hours
Surrender and throw in the towel
The amalgam of the ultimate album, this is Spartibus power

[Hook]
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the godsEmbed
