Bernie Got Berned Lyrics[Produced by C-Doc]

[Intro]
"They're not sending their best, they're sending people that have lots of problems."

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Who
Gots the damn nerve to pick a winner
Artillery ready to kill you and me, who deliver-
Ing, this camp pain from the campaign
WTF, OMG, back to what the fuck they saying
Counted down, ain't listening to me
Check 1-2, gotcha vote, media TV
But now after the math come the aftermath, y'all
Wall Street got ya streets by the balls
Beyond Trump, Hill, swallow this bitter pill
Political machine had its Listerine
Killer Mike informed to Bern the platform
Ran them jewels then them banksters swarmed
Secretary of Hate, neocon Satan
E-mails got the USA government mass debatin'
Evolution meltdown, fifty states
So the revolution just gotta wait?
[Hook]
Bern, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned

[Interlude]
"I feel sorry sometimes for the young people, you know, believe this..."

[Verse 2: Jahi]
Two system party is on its last leg
Bernie got burned, yeah, you heard what I said
Now we got Ms. Killiry and Mr. Daffy Dump
What the fuck is going on, I smell a stink bomb
More trickery and thievery going on
Bernie had the people, they was coming on strong
But they burned out that fire, all a pack of liars
Trying to put the clamp on us like some pliers
Think it's a game, smoking that Demo-crack
Repulsive Republi-crackas stay the hell back
It's war to the core, more war on the poor
More "put your hands up and get your ass on the floor"
Bernie couldn't even save the day
Apple pie and poli-tricks, it's the American way
Tax, loopholes, and e-mails, what the hell
Had a better candidate, but smell what I smell?

Bern, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned

[Verse 3: C-Doc]
Welcome to the circus, tell me how to jerk this lever to vote
Though I gotta wonder what's the purpose
I gotta choose between no choice at all
I can't call when they open their mouths and I'm appalled
And Bernie got burnt, and who's left in this
Like I gotta choose between two flavors of shit
On can't Miss TV, the farce fillin' my screen
And how did we get to a point this obscene, wanna scream?
My team got booted in the playoffs
So hear me 'cause I wanted Team Sanders playin' in the World Series
Instead I gotta watch 'em run the country up the flagpole
One's a politician and the other is an asshole
Neither can be trusted in the least
Election 2016 not between a beauty and the beast
For Commander-in-Chief as they lie to my eyeline
I'mma take a stand for Sanders while I'm standing on the sidelines
Burn
[Interlude]
"It is our job to figure out what happened, and everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again."

[Verse 4: Marcus J]
Let me get this straight in my head
You knew the questions before they were said
You knew the questions before they were heard
Politics be the Theater of the Absurd
Knew what to say before you took the stage
These kind of lies make America rage
Again and again, we still haven't learned
So we felt the heat when Bernie got burned
Our leaders seem to love playing with fire
But 100 percent won't admit they a liar
Perhaps they simply misremember
Fuck that, I'mma stay gone 'til November

[Hook]
Bern, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned, Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned

[Interlude]
