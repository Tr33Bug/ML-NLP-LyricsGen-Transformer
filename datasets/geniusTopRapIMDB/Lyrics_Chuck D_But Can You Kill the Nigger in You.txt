But Can You Kill the Nigger in You? Lyrics[Intro]
"When I was a lad, we had indentured bond servants. Stout Cornish men and Scotsmen."
"Indeed sir, indeed. And if one of them runs away you couldn't tell 'em from any other Englishman."
"But take our black slave sir, and no matter how far they run they're always black."

[Hook]
Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
[Verse 1]
Quiet as it's kept, some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror, black, turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some of y'all if you was my right hand man
I'd cut it off at the wrist like your name was Benedict
Enough lead to threaten fifty niggas dead, you said
'Cause niggas is back to perms and relaxers all up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh, embarrass, can you catch it?
Nigga fever, new season of modern day Step-and-Fetch-It's
1990's niggas be 'fraid of the noise I made
'Bout their master crackers giving out disasters in the hood
Phony-honeys be gone when they money's be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests'
Posin fake hair and high dresses

[Hook]
Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?

[Verse 2]
Mad niggas hittin' shit but they health be quittin' it
Clothes and car makin' the men havin' counterfeitin' fit
Seizing niggas be praisin' Benz and Beemers when they got 'em
Shined and Simonized foreclosed but they grills be rotten
Simon says, "Niggas, jump," and they jump for these Hilfiger's
Tommy hates niggas high priced styles, white as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin' in hell and the negroes pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher, he don't reach, yo my nigga roll a seven
Niggas be forgettin' trips about those slavery ships
"Niggas wasn't there," they claim
Fuck that, nigga bring the pain
Niggas be dealin' narcotic but don't get the money, my nigga
Women or the fame, my nigga, or the motherfuckin' game

Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
One, two, but can you kill the nigga in you?

[Outro: Isaac Hayes]
Yo, yo, brothers, I say to you
Become literate, study your history
Then you know where you need to go
Don't get socialy anesthetized, thinkin you got the rock
When you got the pable
Learn who you are
Come together and survive
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to stand out and be near
Think about your history
And free it from your misery
Learn to love again

Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two
It's time to learn to love again
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
It's time to learn to love again
Now you wanna kill me, that may be true
One, two
It's time to learn to love again
Now you wanna kill me 'cause my lyrics is true
Learn! To love againEmbed
