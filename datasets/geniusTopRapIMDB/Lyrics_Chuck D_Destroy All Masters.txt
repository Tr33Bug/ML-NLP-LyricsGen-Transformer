Destroy All Masters Lyrics[Chuck D - intro]
Stop the presses! Stop the presses!
Hear ye D for court 'dresses!
The court is now in session
The Rakliq is now here for the '9-5
The new Terrordome from the underground to the old zone
And if it's beats ya want, it's beats ya got
Here it is, want ya nigga for, eh is it not?
My man Melquan, Son Slaughter, Dopey and the group
Also representin the Punk Barbarian, 5-0
Once again the Rakliq comin to ya for the 9-5  (This, is, Ab, normal)
Comin to you, destroyin all masters, destroyin all masters, for the '9-5!
					        (Abnormal Beats)
Give me no stress, hahahahah
		   (Sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha
		   (I'm fairly sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha
		   (Sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha
		   (I'm fairly sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Yeah, stress!
Instead of takin chances, I'm bein truth advances
Sometimes snappin bitches turns into slappin (STRESS!)
In the club, see there ain't no love lost
For those steady lookin for that rub-a-dub (This, is, Ab, normal)
Some only in it for the money
Fuckin two-headed dog on the prowl, hear the GROWL-OWL!
In the world turned upside down
A paralytical, now stick around with a frown
What is a beef? Beats the hell out of me
Flippin thangs to swang, neither here or neither there, yo
It's what they hear as a man, the murder music
Interpretation, invented the script, who isn't Nations (This, is, Ab
Normal)
A back lash hit the black fast
The straw monsters will pursue to find out what a nigga wrote
But pull my people for a track
Look forward to the black reparations for us to get the money back
Cracked in the back, don't give me no stress
Gonna make you accountable, your crime is surmountable
A full chick without chicken, just sucker you can stick it
Where the sun don't shine to kiss the back o' mine

Don't give me no stress, hahahahaha
		   (Sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha
		   (I'm fairly sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress, hahahahahaha
		   (Sure I'm comin after, destroyin all masters)
Crack ya in the back, don't give me no stress
This is Melquan

Yo Chuck it's time for rip down, block lyrics get chopped vicious
My flow position like their waistline shiftin
Ain't nuttin different, y'all pit fall, the dungeon
Witness the drama comin focus splungin, finishin, where's the lungs?
Send a swifter hurricane, frozen dope vein wicked
Minds get lifted like the cross nails is broke off
Ya flippin once it's slow court, the street talks, we eat back
With poison on the track, can't avoid that, rhythm we bring noise at
(Bring the noise) This chapter son is Melquan's scripture
Vision adrift, the mind kid is blinded, but rhymes be on a science climate

[Chuck D] Here he is, BAM
	    My man Son Slaughter bout to slam

Proper, the planet rocker
My brain fluid vodka, lyrics influence the proper membrane
My first begin blended with strength vain to strike earth
My mic work wonder, soul with thunder
The Son Slaughter mission will finish script
Strictly number number number number
