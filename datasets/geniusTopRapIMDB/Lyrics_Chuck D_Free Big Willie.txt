Free Big Willie Lyrics[Verse 1]
No mistako, not some wacko from Waco
Crazy, I'll plead insanity just to save humanity
Be good like no Johnny, never liked no Giuliani
Cause they never could stop me, not their imaginary Rocky
Get me then acquit me attack me, what a shock to Pataki
Here here, watch a brother duck the chair
I fear only the one upstairs who got no peers
I'm not part of the clique, it's whatcha see is whatcha get
My reality's personal, many times rhymers forget
Some ain't heavy like others but they still be my brothers
And disgusted at the other folks laughin' at us
With the ashes to the ashes, the blunts to the blunts
A chip off the whole block, I shock and get the word in
Maybe that's why a brother like me shoulders the burden
I smells between the white sheets a hell of a beast
In the back lurkin', don't front step to the circle
[Hook]
A plan to that man no doubt
Although I’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie (yeah)
Cause to some it’s a dream
But to the rest it’s a nightmare

[Verse 2]
More time in the air than a flight attendant
The rhyme got winded on the way up on what I thought was a lay up
These two-cent criticizers can't size
We don't realize we all under a microscope of a nation of other folk
So all this nigga callin' is we fallin' attitude
Have we forgotten? Entertaining is today's way of picking cotton
So that the younger G’s and B’s think all we can be is a big dreamer
In order to get a Benz or a Beamer
Some stuck in that '96 Lexus per minute shit
It's that same old story that bores me, ignores me
My metaphors be over that head of even heads
To some I'm prophetic, but to the rest I'm pathetic
I led a movement of mentals against the feds and point spread
On beats, mad noise, and funky instrumentals
There once was a time we fought the power with a rhyme
Now the attitude goin' round, no use tryin'

A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright

A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie (yeah)
Cause to some it’s a dream
But to the rest it’s a nightmare

[Bridge]
Yeah..aha…c'mon… aha,right…
Ride on, ride on yeah
We don’t need to be no Big Willie
Last verse check it out
(To some it’s a dream, but to the rest it’s a nightmare)

[Verse 3]
Got more hits than Pete Rose had for the Reds
Now they be on anything Deion intercepts
Except I’m in a zone now get wreck, I get around
Can I get down like Craig Mack, how can I get down
Back like rock ‘em sock 'em robots who forgot it was him
Who parlayed the styles of KRS & Rakim
And brought it to a different level against the so called devil
Who had the nerve to throw a bell curve and test me, arrest me
Lemme go, let it grow, no, i’ve been through the afro
It’s been a long time so my childhood's retro
Unlike today as we be watchin us pay
The price that bugs me knowin that God don’t like ugly
Got a free pair of lugs to run quicker from the slugs
But slipped from the mad dirt that was swept under the rug
A lil’ down, but not out, not what you thought it was
It’s just peace no beefs, I gets love
[Hook]
A plan to that man no doubt

Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some it’s a dream
But to the rest it’s a nightmare
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although i’m feelin alright
It’s feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some it’s a dream
But to the rest it’s a nightmareEmbed
