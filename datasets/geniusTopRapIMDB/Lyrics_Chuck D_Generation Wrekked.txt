Generation Wrekked Lyrics[Hook] x2
If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me

Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up
They don't know what's next
Generation Wrekked

[Verse 1]
See I'm hangin in like Sam Sever
To all you Johnny come latelys
Who didn't recognize how great and
Clever some of those rhymes be
Think quick
Been flowin over domes
Mad vocab to silly crabs
Before Metaphors be passin
Your ass like taxi cabs
Hit my toll free number
To hear bombs I dropped
1 800 7654321
You don't stop
I need my noize like Patrick & Barkley need rings
Like Griffey gets swings
1st time rhymes played me off like Sacramento Kings
3-6 for the 9-6 1 move my rhymers with the times
Wit no crimes or pantomime
No great pretender spenders
20 years got mad tears leavin tears in they beers
From the rear old school getting theirs
You getting scared
It is on & on and 3 steps ahead
Hot topics shock in the house
Fulla heads
Getting burned while you learn on a hospital bed
Madd kids never checkin for what I said
Jack be quick
Jack be nimble on the brain
I'm stay'n simple
But the sound remains insane
Same mad pain no gain getting getto on the table
No stories no fables relax I'm cinemax to the blacks
No cable
Round & round here I go
Putting this sound down
But some a y'all got fears and scared to get
Down
[Hook] x2
If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me

Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up
They don't know what's next
Generation Wrekked

Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up
They don't know what's next
Generation Wreckked

[Verse 2]
Now I'm the one who flew over the Cuckoo's nest & tested
And wasn't ever bullet proof vested
Resurrection of the one man vocal section
Spirit in your dark ass direction
For your mind body and soul protection
Reality checks keep it real
Bring in real checks
On & off the road been through
1100 sondchecks
Those influenced under the influence
Getting mad hits from truants
Dazed & confused hangin wit crews
Who livin blues
A million doomed consumers
Who say they know they black
Threw they medallions back
In exchange for 40 dozen six packs
Born under a terrible sign in 1969 comin
Blind
Livin inside hard ass times
Getting kicks offa wack karate flicks
He kills but gots no fightin skillz
It's getting ill so many funerals
Stylin now its gold plated medallions
I didn't know under fros
We got so many black Italians
