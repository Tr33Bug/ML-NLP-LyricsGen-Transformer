Itâ€™s So Hard To See My Baseball Cards Move On Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, Tom, break out the Stratomatic
Man, salute, an homage
Let's go

[Chorus]
MVPs, Hall of Famers, big time gamers
Bring out the big guns, strikeouts and home runs
Real dream team now restin' in peace
A play by play on top of these beats
Take a ride to that ballpark in the sky
A field of dreams, can't forget Charlie Pride
So I'm goin' way back in my mind 'til I'm gone
So hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
[Verse 1]
Say the field of dreams, you may not believe it
2020, Bob Gibson versus Tom Seaver
Line up today stacked bottom to the top
The lead off hitter is the great Lou Brock
And a pitch on the way, single stolen base
And the second on deck, Joe Morgan at the plate
MVP two times, the big red machine
Better get him out now before the Astros wipe 'em clean
Bob Watson scoring a million runs
Up next, Jimmy Wynn AKA the toy cannon
Line drive, Al Kaline and they all come home
Ahead of the throw by Jay Johnstone

[Chorus]
MVPs, Hall of Famers, big time gamers
Bring out the big guns, strikeouts and home runs
Real dream team now restin' in peace
A play by play on top of these beats
Take a ride to that ballpark in the sky
A field of dreams, can't forget Charlie Pride
So I'm goin' way back in my mind 'til I'm gone
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on

[Bridge]
2020 threw us all a heck of a knuckle ball like Phils
2020 threw us all a heck of a knuckle ball like Phils
2020 threw us all a heck of a knuckle ball like Phils
2020 threw us all a heck of a knuckle ball like Phils

Ground ball to second, to the Cubs, Glenn Beckert
Replaced by Tony Taylor, the Cuban legend
Pinch runnin' replacement Horace Clarke
Dick Allen two run blast high up out the park
Don Larsen got perfect, tough to handle
Hal Smith struck out then Oscar Gamble
Llndy McDaniel in relief of Whitey Ford
Got Bob Lee lookin' on three strikes, Lord

[Chorus]
MVPs, Hall of Famers, big time gamers
Bring out the big guns, strikeouts and home runs
Real dream team now restin' in peace
A play by play on top of these beats
Take a ride to that ballpark in the sky
A field of dreams, can't forget Charlie Pride
So I'm goin' way back in my mind 'til I'm gone
So hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move on
It's so hard to see my baseball cards move onEmbed
