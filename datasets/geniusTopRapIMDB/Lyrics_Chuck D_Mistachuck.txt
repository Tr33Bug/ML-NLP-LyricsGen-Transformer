Mistachuck Lyrics[Intro]
"...No job, no eight cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest, Demerol, for sess"
"Yo, yo, Chuck D is the bomb, dog"
"What? Man, get the fuck outta here"
"Fuck what you think, Chuck D ain't shit"
"C'mon man, that nigga Chuck D is assed out"
"You know what I'm sayin'? ...motherfucka"
"He a bitch ass nigga, man"
"How the fuck this thing gonna say Chuck D the hardest rapper?"
[Chuck D]
Yeah, uh huh, up top, beware, set it off
Mista (Yo P, yo Slick)
Line 'em to you
Yo Bob
They call me Mista, aight to you
This about report to the commissioner
To you
This about that time, set it off

[Verse 1]
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought and thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on the thirty-two tours
From last year's "Give It Up" goin' back to "You're Gonna Get Yours"
Thirty-eight countries in the name of hip-hop
Never stopped, seven continents, attackin' governments (All over the world)
Political rhyme practice I gave cause you lack this
Serious sense of time and world geographics
Bring ya brain outside Philly, East to the West, North to the South
If you're black, we can't all be Big Willie (Never)
And to be judged by a hit by some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit, 'cause I'm cool like this (Yeah)
Now how I get my swerve on, I keep hittin' nerve bombs
Relax the saluting arms, carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself, I never stopped the hip-hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself (Uh!)
Good God

[Verse 2]
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Now I'ma show you a waste is a terrible thing to mind
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter (Gutter)
And all this talk about the street we stay in & playin'
Is a fish tank by the hated you thank
And you say, "Ho hum, another story to bore me"
Maria, take a letter tell Mayor have a freeknik in Marietta (Yeah)
Here comes the half-stepper, hypocrites, and advocates who care
But be crashin' like US Air
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones, I hate it
One on one black CNN keep it from being in the Cartoon Network
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Got you lookin for the loot
Is down down to the one & shoot
50 fought to the cracker so for all y'all I gets blacker (Blacker)
[Hook]

Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (Rhyme animal)
If you don't know me you can call me mister

[Verse 3]
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high and I feel 'em gettin' over (Over)
Land Cruisers, Isuzu's or new shoes
Man, them notes is heavy, that's why I got a couple Chevy's
Low budget I am, believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
I ducks the cakewalk and all that BS talk
About what's fatter, West coast, North, South or New York
It don't matter, it don't matter

[Hook]

Yes...and you...and you....for all y'all)Embed
