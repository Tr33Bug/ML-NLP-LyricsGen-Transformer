Niggativity...Do I Dare Disturb The Universe? Lyrics[Verse 1]
No Buddha bliss, she musta missed it
Still bangin' with the anger, kissed a soul sanger
Class of '78, Sunset Strip 'cause I been outta high, twenty years
With thirty something-ish peers (Soul)
What a trip, never drank beer with the boys
But the love we shared was the art of noise
Dump puffs a smoke, make me cough (Baugh-augh)
But I'm not a chimney, so you can't call that shit soft
What turned me off, swore their breath stunk
Plus, I never got outrhymed by a drunk
Now, a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said it's getting suited (Suited) 'til your brain's polluted
I ain't playin', this main-stain stayin' rooted
Instead of bein' pimped and then prostituted
Won't be the last time 'cause it ain't the first
So do I dare disturb the universe? (Universe)
[Chorus + scratching]
Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
"Goin' down, down, down
"Diggy-diggy down"
(You don't wanna get shocked!)

[Verse 2]
No U turn, I pump up, hittin' switches
But all this talk reflect the niggas & bitches
Where did that come from, only labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit 'em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what they've done for me lately but hate me
Attack me, might as well be damn Pataki
This hip-hop's in me, so they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin' all elements, destroyin' all irrelevant (Yeah!)
It all comes down to this
What good is talkin' about the hood when you got motherfuckin' madness? (Madness)
Am I ringin' those senses?
Brothers drinkin' worse shit than they're be pourin' in their Benzes
I give a damn, so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe? (Universe)
You might also like[Chorus + scratching]
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
"Goin' down, down, down
"Di-di-diggy-diggy down"
(You don't wanna get shocked!)

[Verse 3]
See, I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind, brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
It's what he does, what he's left, and what he's takin' care of
A brother like me annoys 'em
But I'm cool, G, when I rap about 'em, it's poison
Everybody wanna be Big Willie, chasin' down loot
Dole and Newt, who do you shoot?
I'm fingerin' targets while ya figurin', "Figaro, Figaro"
Soap opera for the Niggaro
I ain't chasin' no movies like Jason
Or Lollapallooza 'cause I ain't no loser
Rough stuff to the babies spread like rabies
To the heads of heads, but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus, verse to the verse
But do I dare (Dare) to disturb the universe? (Universe)
[Chorus + scratching]
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity
(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity

[Post-Chorus]
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down
