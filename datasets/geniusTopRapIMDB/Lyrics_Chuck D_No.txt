No Lyrics[Produced by Mr. Elite]

[Intro]
Yeah some of y'all flip like wills never got
What we gon' do right here is go back
Way back, back into rhyme
We gonna do a song that you never heard before

[Verse 1]
No comeback stories, no corny choruses
No glories, no hallelujahs, no Land Cruisers, no drug users
No grins, no trends, no phony ass friends
Who begin with ends and end with no ends and no estrogen
No gas-ups, no soups, no Lex Coups
No crackers, no backers, no niggas for the blackers
No triple teams, no mainstream dreams
No stress beams, no accusations, cop chases, court cases
No rape charges, no Sarges, no DeBarge's
No lightweight bouts up in the air, shoot outs and no sellouts
No Negroes with egos, no mo' shows callin' women bitches and hoes
No thoughtless flows, no woes
No singin' voices, no Rolls Royce's, no wack choices
No volunteers getting peers of career years
No solutions, no problems, no more vinyl revolving
No happy campers, no offense, no funk samples
[Hook]
The easiest and the hardest word to say is no
Only got two letters, only takes a second to say it
No meanin' no, no contest, no stress, no second guessin'
No bodyguards, no question
The easiest and the hardest word to say is no
Only got two letters, only takes a second to say it
No meanin' no, no contest, no stress, no second guessin'
No bodyguards, no question

[Verse 2]
No succotash, no "Girl, I got the cash" raps
No sex traps, no Rolexes, no unprotected sexes
No false hopes, no hand ropes, boats, no car notes
No killers, no vanilla, no bigger Willie's, no Wilma's
No jail time, no fuckin' lil' kid rhymes, no studio terrors, no mirrors
Look ma, no spelling errors
NO absent pops, NO sweatshops, no pork chops
NO justice NO peace NO please please please
NO legal freestyles NO willies, NO
McCovey
NO industry rapes, capes NO suits NO
Ties
NO stars NO over paid A&R's
NO body guards gold teeth
NO east coast, west coast beefs
NO dumb looks, NO one sided books
NO special cooks NO finesse NO mess NO struggle to progress
NO hittin sprees NO HIV NO lies
From NO TV's
NO contracts NO tracks with NO mechanicals
