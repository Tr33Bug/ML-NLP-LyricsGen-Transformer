Spread The Words Lyrics[Verse 1: Chuck D]
A wise man once said, "Keep the laws
I'll write the songs, make the world applaud"
To the word unheard, social cause
Raptivism, the evil on pause
Praise the loud, pray the Lord
Spread the words, spare the sword
System flawed, lock all the doors
Here come these damn rappers, so hit the floor
On art and artist, there's a difference
Between censorship and senseless shit
And I swear to God some don't know the difference
And everybody swear they comin' with that different shit
Bustin' caps but ain't captured it
Without really doin' it, and so they spit
Disturb so-called heads only hear the heads heard
Plus they spread the words
[Verse 2: Jasiri X]
Chuck D is president, hip-hop is medicine
And Hot 97 it is never been a resident
We represent the president, definite, we the measurement
My right to be hostile's gospel the New Testament
I'm a disciple of that Golden Era cycle
With P.E.'s "A Nation of Millions..." is like the Bible
2Pac taught me my Hail Mary's
And Mobb Deep showed me that I was in hell already
Rakim told me that the third rail was deadly
A ghetto bastard in this treacherous world so we held machetes
Nas told me cut the grass low to see all snakes
So I don't need to check my Instagram to see y'all fakes
Lines on composition paper, that means we all straight
But what's a God MC to a evolved ape?
In the beginning was the word so we spread the message
Honored I'm at the table breakin' bread with the legends
Jasiri X

[Verse 3: Jahi]
Some spread word like germs, let me get it disinfected
Misguided, misdirected, ears disrespected
Protect your dome and your children from the garbage
Words are seeds, I'm plantin' a new harvest
Just because you make words rhyme, that don't make you a MC
Digital clones in 3D
When I flow the power of Nommo word to Dogon
Some rappers need to pack up, get up, and get gone
No space and time for your fast food lines
Stinkin' up the airwaves smellin' swine
Verbal pollution without no solutions
Dancin' to the beat of mayhem and confusion
My war cry over break beats
Eatin' up bean pie, readin' up "Mohammad Speaks"
Teach them to flow snares and samples
Show 'em a better way and lead by exampleYou might also likeEmbed
