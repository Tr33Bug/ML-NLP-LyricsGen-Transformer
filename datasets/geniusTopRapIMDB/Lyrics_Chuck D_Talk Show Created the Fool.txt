Talk Show Created the Fool Lyrics--On my next show:
Gay pet's--
--Laziness is in the house
Slob wit no job is in the house--

[Verse 1-Chuck D]
See my rhymes be hot like soul food spots
I don't give a damn Jenny Jones
A 100 million homes
Grown folks doin anything
To be some known folks
Go tell Montell he gotta sue to
Get like Donahue
Between soap operas and bras
Commercials sop opraahh
Gossip by their own admissions
Failed smoke emissions
So enquired minds wanna know
How low can we go
On a TV show Hoochie and the Blow
Reverses the race
Cursed the nation the doom generation
The next voice you hear
Says get the fuck up outta here
From pyramids, to hearin what he, she or they did
Ain't no bizness on the screen
If you know what I mean
--Lazyness is in the house
Slob with no jobs is in the house--

He say she say they all got beef
Dragin their business all over in the street
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool

[Verse 2-Abnormal]
They tryin to portray themselves like
Their movie stars, big Willie style
Francin a mansion and fancy cars
But in real life they live in projects
And trailer parks all the bullshit they talk
Makes me wanna spark L's
Looking at channel zero from hell
They frontin like they saying something
But they ain't sayin nothin
Players & hustlers, hookers and druggy's and racist
I'm tryin to face this
The poison that they feed in this my mind
I'd rather be watchin BET Rap City
On my big screen TV believe me
When I say it
They do it for the greed of the fame
Following the trends of the Hollywood game
It a shame
Sellin their souls for 50 beans
Looking like fools on the tube
Just to get the damn cream
You might also likeDragin their business all over in the street

[Verse 3-C.Brewser]
Talk show host really TV evangelist
Bringin the most scandalous folks
With lies they can't handle it
Mad Drama trauma coming at you out to harm ya
Infect your mental with an infectious type of insomnia
Lies in disguise about women who really guys
And guys who really women like that's such a big surprise
You lies it's just like this whole world enterprize
Best understand black man is infinite potential wise
Realize TV amazing confusion type illusion
Brought to your brain cell
Giving you mental type dillusions
It's all brain wall syndrome
Sending you in a cyclone
Plus had for your health so best leave it alone
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool

[Verse 4-Chuck D]
I be crawlin in that head like a virus
You say lemme try this
Way back when medicine
Scaring some of our children
Soul brother number one
Is back in black in you kitchen
Tell granma to chill on those chitlins
Make no mistake Ricki Lakes eatin mad steaks
Off your bad breaks
Funerals and wakes
Some of that shit is fake Yeah!
She said He said
Baby/Mama stick it
All for TV time
Hotels and airplane tickets
Embarrass our asses and degrade
End of the day ain't that a bitch
Geraldo's getting paid
--Laziness is in the house
Slob wit no job is in the house--

He say she say
They got beef
Draggin their bizness all in the streets
Bad things is some of them think its cool
TALK SHOW CREATED THE FOOL
