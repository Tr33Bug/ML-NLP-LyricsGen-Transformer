Tear Down That Wall Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody's souls been exposed in this house of blues
The real emperor without clothes has much to lose
Road weary troubadour
Maybe I'm an ambassador not to be confused with some spook or bastard by the door
Before I got paid by the word now it's deferred
New Dust Bowl poet, you ain't heard it, now you heard
Showed y'all I ain't tired, damn sure ain't quiet
Plenty of things to teach about, I'm reaching to the choir
Damn, my man, one at a time
This beat's fire, face told me Brent you be bombing the place
The Bob to the Bob, the Bob is back, weaving, bobbing and spilling
Like Womack, Marley and Dylan
Deep songs front page of your life, this is you
Invasion of your mental vacation and your crew
This ain't brand new just because y'all ain't never knew
I spit politics on that wall where the people get screwed
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop supporting non-stop sweatshops
So you can retail your ass off without fail
Then some of you get setback
Blame this immigration exploitation with your the lack of information by yelling, "Wetbacks"
Somebody acting Forever 21
Can't hide, can't cry, can't run
Blame it on the crack, or fight back without a passport
Millennium Gestapo border control the new contact sport
Y'all call them immigrants and take them to court
But look at your hood and your lack of support
Some of these DJ's have no idea what they're playing
Some of these rhymers don't realize what the hell they're saying
So I let them chase the cash honey without a plan
Forget Johnny was the man in black, but I'm the black in man
This is modern day slavery and part of the plan
With all due respect, sir (Tear down that wall, man)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Understand these pressures in this so-called recession
For the Black, Brown, Woman, and Man; it's depression
Roster of the stricken, Bernie made off with the money
Now the hidden hand is bitten, and now it ain't funny
I beg your pardon, who's saving you? You're calling them laborers
Walk on by and never say hi or consider them neighbors
Some got the nerve to live in Texas, Arizona, Cali, and not know
Even missing the cue in "New Mexico"
Diss the Brown brothers and sisters on what they done did
This side of the Earth, they built pyramids
My passion comes and what I know and who I am
I refuse to lose or to be confused by this new scam
Scarred by sarcasm, Uncle Sam's racist orgasm
Was just a spasm scared of enthusiasm
Of the Black and Brown planet, the jealous say, "Damn it"
Stupid ass wall, you can't stop us all
