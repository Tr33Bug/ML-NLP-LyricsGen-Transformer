Wake Up The Sleeping Giant LyricsGather 'round us, join with the band
Together we're stronger, together we'll stand
Say what can you do, well, we've got a plan
And we're gonna take you to the promised land

It's time to remember, it's time to move on
They've pushed it too far, they don't know what they've done
If it's a fight that they want then it's a fight that they'll get
We never lose, honey so place your bets

Long ago and far away
We had a voice, you know that we had a say
We won't live for yesterday
Ready or not, we're gonna have our way
CHORUS:
We got the numbers, yeah, we got the might
We got the strenght and we got the right
We got the reason, yeah, we got the night
So wake up the sleeping giant

Not one more minute, not one more day
We've waited too long, can't let our chance slip away
We won't stop 'til we get it, we won't stop 'til we're done
We'll bite and we'll claw until they've lost and we've won

We took all we're gonna take
It's got to stop, you know there's too much at stake
Who the hell are they to say
What we can do and how we can play

REPEAT CHORUS

Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant

Solo - Eddie

Let's push to the limit, so let's push 'til we're home
We've been good too long, they wouldn't leave us alone
It's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
So rally the troops and let's start the attack

Whoa
We got the numbers, you know we got the might
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant
Whoa
We got the reason and we're ready to fight
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giantEmbed
