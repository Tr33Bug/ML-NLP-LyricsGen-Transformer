Ghetto Dreams Lyrics[Prod. by No I.D.]
[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the hood
[Verse 1: Common]
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the hood

I don't even say shit, she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me a me of my, of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose
[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the hood
[Verse 3: Nas]
I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
