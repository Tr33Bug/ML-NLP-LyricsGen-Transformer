HER Love Lyrics[Intro: Billy Preston & Syreeta, Common]
(One more try)
(We have come too far to stop now)
Yeah, Dilla
(One more try)
(It is all that we have got)

[Verse 1: Common & Daniel Caesar]
Two DJs, one microphone
We freestyle, we write at home
It don't, it don't, uh-uh, we go on
You the one I can't leave alone
You grown? I know you groan
When I'm in you, I feel home
We in the house of love, no lie
Appreciate you more as time goes by
When it's truly true, it don't die
I see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y
I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi
I hear you when JAY still make the song cry
Truthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one that gave me that confidence
You the one that told me 'bout consciousness
And said see beyond my metropolis
You put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this
We too far, ain't no stoppin' this (We're too far, now)
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are

[Verse 2: Common]
Here, here, here, here, here, here we go
They say that, that love makes you grow
You've been sen-sen-sensational
Instrume-e-intational
In my life, you've been vocal
But at times, I felt like I didn't know you
Now I know you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you
We all change, for what it's worth
You an angel and still down to earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did, to me you listen
Gangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em
No matter, you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'
And gettin' people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle
That's why we all love you
You might also like[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are

[Verse 3: Common]
You gave me a voice in the world
It's been hard to choose another girl
They trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing
But you gave us a chance to dream
In young thugs, you see a future
You recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya
At 21, you knew I was savage
But you said, "Common, you will never be average"
It's a cold world, we need JAY
If you could dot com, you could dot K
You rock two chains, keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG
You told me I'm the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth
Before me too, you said, "Ladies first"
Things get rocky, you there ASAP
Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic' with words
With no name, I was a hard MC
Love and hip-hop, on some Cardi B
Now you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style
A future ain't odd to see
Free spirit, with young will like Jaden
When I see you, you never agin'
Made in America, for the world to see
You everybody's but you my girl to me
I'm forever yours, to the tic-toc
I'm still talking 'bout you, hip-hop
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are

[Outro: Common & Daniel Caesar]
