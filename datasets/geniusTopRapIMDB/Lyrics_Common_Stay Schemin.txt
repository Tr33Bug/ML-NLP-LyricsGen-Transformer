Stay Schemin’ Lyrics[Verse]
My motto is: Chicago, bitch
Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is
Don’t play dumb, I’m the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch, I imagine what your father is
She said, “How you make your opponent
The rapper of the moment?” His style, he don’t own it
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon’ mess around and make me catch a body like that
Awwww, don’t do it
Cause every song you make, Joe, is really ho music
I heard you said you wasn’t a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that’s eighteen
Can’t say my name but rap about a nigga’s wife
You so black and white, trying to live a nigga’s life
I’m taking too long with this amateur guy
You ain’t wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry
[Outro]
Soft nigga. Make no mistake, I’m talking to Drake
It’s the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that ho-ass nigga
No, man-to-man, don’t hide behind them other niggas
Nah, this man-to-man. You can’t run behind them man
This is some real man shit right here
[Destiny’s Child sample]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain’t running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Better say my nameYou might also like14Embed
