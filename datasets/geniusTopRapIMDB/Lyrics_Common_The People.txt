The People Lyrics[Produced by Kanye West]
[Intro]
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, yeah
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, yeah
Yeah, it's for the people

[Refrain: Common]
This is street radio, for unsung hero
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Preemo
'Ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people
[Verse 1: Common]
And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga?
While people on the low end tryna ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
Law, we ain't trusting them, thick broads, we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see 'em struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The people

[Hook: Dwele]
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then you'll find

[Refrain: Common]
This is street radio, for unsung hero
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Preemo

The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Hook: Dwele]
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then you'll find

This is street radio, for unsung hero

My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Preemo

[Verse 3: Common]
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then you'll find15Embed
