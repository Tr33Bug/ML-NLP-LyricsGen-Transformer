Aâ€™Yo Kato Lyrics[Intro: DMX]
Uh
This go out to my dog Kato
Rest in peace, baby
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato

[Verse 1: DMX]
Started off two dogs with the same goal (Uh)
Nothing but two dogs walkin' the same road (Uh)
Two different cultures, but had the same heart (Yeah)
Enjoyed seeing the light, but lived in the dark
Fifth album, bumped heads in the parking lot (Aight)
Was a quiet brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct (Uh), when he came, gained respect
So I gave respect (Uh), we shared the same respect
To name regret, in our own circles (What)
Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you (Yeah)
Know how that dirt do, hittin' four corners
(Arf, arf, arf, arf) Right back upon us
God tried to warn us, but sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like, "This can't be
Y'all niggas is bugging
Got the wrong information or something
Please tell me these niggas is frontin'"
God no
[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)

[Verse 2: DMX]
Ayo, K', let me kick it with you for a minute (Yeah)
There was things left unsaid, dog, we wasn't finished
Never got to say thank you for being a friend
Dogs for life, and you rode to the end
Held dog down, didn't let a day go by
Every time dog came to the Chi (What?)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambler squad
Now I come back to Phoenix and like, "Damn, it's hard"
To accept the fact (Uh) that you won't be coming back (Uh)
But I hope you coming back (Uh) 'cause I won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa (Yeah), that's just how we did
Remote control cars (What), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase our day (Yeah)
So I'm not gonna say goodbye my nigga (Uh-uh)
Instead I would rather (Rather)
Focus on the time we spent together, that's what matters
You might also like[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)

[Verse 3: DMX]
I need you to save me a spot, next to you and the Lord (Aight)
I don't know when I'm coming, but keep checking the door (Aight)
But while I'm here, knock on wood
I'll make sure your kids remember who their father was and Val is good (Aight)
Understood how real niggas move
We don't talk, but you gon' always have family in New York, believe that (Yeah)
From where you at you can see that
We dogs for life and to death and I mean that (Vato)

[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
[Outro: DMX, Magic & Val, Val]
Yo, "Where the Hood At" is banging right now, man
That was your favorite joint, ya know what I mean?
We miss you, Kato
It's going just like we thought it would, baby
We miss you, Kato (Yeah)
We miss you, Kato
I'll always love you, K'40Embed
