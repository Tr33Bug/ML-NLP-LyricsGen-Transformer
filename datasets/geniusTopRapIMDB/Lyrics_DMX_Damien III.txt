Damien III Lyrics[Verse 1: DMX and Damien]
Hey yo, D! It's your nigga D!
What the fuck, you forgot about me?
You've been eatin' real good lately
Didn't get a shout out on your last album, what, you hate me?
Said I was your dog
Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Said I was your mans and them
And any problem that you had I would handle them
Ayo, dog, it's like this, I fuck with you lightly
‘Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me
Get mad at me, send niggas wantin' to fight me
Whole time you fucked with me you didn't like me
Dog, where you hear that? Pssh, niggas talk
Plus you know how shit flow in New York:
Walls have ears, buildings heard
Supposed to be shhhhhh, but spill the word
[Hook: DMX and Damien]
Everywhere that I go, everything that I see
Every place that I touch, I feel him fuckin' with me
I'm gonna fly…
Why you lie?
Told me it was Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly…
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie?

[Verse 2: DMX and Damien]
Now, dog, you know me better than that
I could put you ahead of the pack instead of the back
I could have niggas sellin' tapes instead of the crack
Could have niggas fallin' down with lead in they back
Ain't much that I can't do when I want to
I don't really need you; nigga, fuck you!
WHAT?!
Nah, I'm just playin'; got a wife and kids?
Good thing they ain't come across them triflin' kids...
Yo, what you mean by that? Mean by what?
You'se a grimy nigga f'real, I see what's up!
I don't even know why I fucked with you from the door!
‘Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I could've got it from Him! But you would've had to wait!
But I wouldn't have the weight! C'mon, don't hate!
What happened to the right hand, Light Man?
Nah, that's Dark Man! Well, let's get it right then!

Why you lie?
Told me it was Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly…
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie?

[Verse 3: DMX and Damien]
Now I see you for who you are, it's like I know you
So I can't trust you as far as I can throw you!
Oh you don't know, you are the reason
That I go through what I go through? Let me show you!
Didn't I promise you a Benz, lots of friends,
Countless pairs of Timbs, endless ends?
Yeah, but what did it cost me?
My life to be taken softly; man, back the fuck up off me!
Don't fuck with me like that when I fuck with you like this
Don't come at me like that when you know that you might miss!
Go on about your business!
If any cat you send my way, ain't gon' be no witness!
Lord Jesus, C'mon, dog, look who you're fuckin'
Please help me Whassup, dog? Man, you buggin'
Keep the Devil Thug life, thought we was tight
Out of my life!  I'll be back, aight? Psych!
