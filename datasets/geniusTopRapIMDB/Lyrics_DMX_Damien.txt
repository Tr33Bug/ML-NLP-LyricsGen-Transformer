Damien Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, Def Jam
Uh, Ruff Ryders
My nigga TP
Creep with me!

[Verse 1: DMX, DMX as Damien, & (DMX as his son)]
Why is it every move I make turns out to be a bad one?
Where's my guardian angel? Need one, wish I had one
I'm right here, shorty, and I'ma hold you down
You tryin' to fuck all these bitches? I'ma show you how
But who…? Name's D like you, but my friends call me Damien
And I'ma put you hip to somethin' about this game we in
You and me could take it there, and you'll be
The hottest nigga ever livin', that's a given? You'll see
Hmm, that's what I've been wantin' all my life
Thinkin' about my little man so I call my wife
Well, your dada is about to make it happen
(What you mean, my nigga?) I'm about to make it rappin'
Today I met this cat, he said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend
(You mean like Chuckie?) Ha ha, yeah, just like Chuckie
(Dada, looks like we're both lucky) Yeah
[Chorus]
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Verse 2: DMX & DMX as Damien]
Ayo, D, whattup, D? You's a smooth nigga
I seen you when nobody knew who pulled the trigger
Yeah, you know, it's always over dough
You sure? I coulda swore it was over a ho?
Nah, nah, that ain't my style, nigga, you stay frontin'
But you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'
Got some weed? Go 'head, smoke it! Go 'head, drink it!
Go 'head and fuck shorty! You know I can keep a secret (aight)
I'm about to have you drivin', probably a Benz
But we gotta stay friends, blood out, blood in
Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?
Hmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose
Got me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, nigga, I floss G's
For that nigga I would bleed, give him my right hand
Now that I think about it… yo, that's my man!

The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Verse 3]
You like how everything is goin'? You like what I gave ya?
You know if you was goin' down I'd be the one to save ya
But yo, I need a favor, these cats across town hate me
Plus their behavior hasn't been too good lately
What? Anything for you, dog, where them niggas at?
38th from Broadway, aight, let me get the Gat'
Run up on 'em strapped, bust off caps in four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month then killed two more niggas
Now I'm ready to chill, but you still want me to kill
Look at what I did for you! Dog, come on, keep it real!
Aight, fuck it, I'ma do it, who is it this time?
Hey yo, remember that kid Sean you used to be with in '89?
Naw, that's my man! I thought I was your man?
But yo, that's my nigga! Hey, who's your biggest fan?
Either do it or give me your right hand, that's what you said
I see now ain't nothin' but trouble ahead
[Chorus]
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Outro]
In the fog, the fog, livin' in the fog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
