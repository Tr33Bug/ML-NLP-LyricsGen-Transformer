Get It on the Floor Lyrics[Intro: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Let's get it on
We don't give a what-what
We don't give a what-what (Shit)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)
[Verse 1: DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Here to spark a nigga, pick apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you wanna get blessed to the chest
With slugs from the Smith & Wess', rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty 'cause I play dirty, the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point duckin' down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fuckin' clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

I'm at the crossroads, look, but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play the low for what I did the other day?
They on their way, the flow got me strikin' this random
I can't stand 'em, fake-ass niggas wantin' to be the Phantom
Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
Extort shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, with the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't with sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him with a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth, bitch-ass nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)
[Verse 3: DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I smoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is manslaughter, kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I've been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does, and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'76Embed
