How’s It Goin’ Down (Album Version) Lyrics[Skit: Faith Evans & Guy]
(*Dial tone*)
I don't believe it
(*Dial tone*)
Hello?
Whose dick you sucking?
Don't call me with that bullshit, alright?
You lying, you lying to me, B
Yeah, exactly
Whose dick you sucking? Come on B, I just heard some shit about you, some foul shit, fuck is the deal?
Suck my fucking dick, you bitch-ass nigga, I don't—
No, you explain it to me, bitch, you know what I'm talking about
I don't know nobody up here, y'all don't fuck with nobody up here, and I ain't been fucking with nobody here, I don't know nobody in fucking Yonkers
Lying-ass bitch, you ain't shit
Do I got to holler his name too?
Who the fuck is he?
Bitch, you fuckin' him
[Intro: Lovey & Schamika, DMX]
All I want is you, all I want (Uh, uh)
All I want is you, all I want

[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]
What type of games are bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want)
Is you with me, or what? Think I'm trying to get me a nut (All I want is you)
Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what? (All I want)

[Verse 1: DMX]
I'm politicin' with this chicken, wonderin' if I'ma creep her
Little hoodrat bitch from 25th named Tenika
Comin' through, like I do, you know, gettin' my bark on
Knew she was a thug, 'cause, when I met her, she had a scarf on
54-11, size 7 in girls
Baby face, would look like she was eleven with curls
Girlfriend (What?)
Remember me from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at (Woo)
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up (Aight)
Hit you on the jack later on, see what's up
Talkin' to shorty make me wanna do somethin' nice (What?)
Lookin' at that ass make me wanna do somethin' tonight (Uh)
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight
And she bite, better give a nigga the green light, we might
You might also like[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm gettin' at shorty like, "What you need? What you want?" (Huh?)
Want for nothin', 'cause I got you, but you front (True)
I see you with your baby father, but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter (Woah)
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I've done kept it more than real, boo, can't lose with me (True)
Heard he smacked you 'cause you said my name while y'all was sexin' (Woah)
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin' (Uh)
You know I ain't even with that, so he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (What?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, well, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 1-5-0, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, and we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that, you with that?
[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Ayy, yo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves 'cause she's smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, gets the dues (Aight)
Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real (Uh)
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal (True)
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if he squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down, like, "What?"
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be "Yeah"
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me (Uh-uh)
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me (Uh-uh)
But we gon' always be best of friends (Ha-ha)
Mad love, boo, 'til the end (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]
