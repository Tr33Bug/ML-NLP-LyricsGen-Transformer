I Can Feel It Lyrics[Intro: DMX]
Sometimes
Sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on
[Verse 1: DMX]
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, there's somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you'll see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends
Cats I fuck with are real, but hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door, this one here good as done
You thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah, it's gettin' closer

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2: DMX]
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that and hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
It takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'
It's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?
What have you been provin'? Just that you a fuckin' clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father
For a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night, come on

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 3: DMX]
There's a lot of shit that I let slide 'cause it's outta my hands
Lot of niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
That a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, (Ah-ooh), the howlin'
(Grr), the growlin', (Shh), the prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug
But hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house
While they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide
But you and I both know the truth'll never die
Listen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared for the morgue
'Cause you dead up in the fog and that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there
This is hell and we're both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on58Embed
