I Donâ€™t Dance Lyrics[Verse 1: DMX]
Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'mma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care
[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells get it crackin', y'all play chess
Kells gets to scrappin' and y'all just flex
Why is y'all rappin, when I got next
You roll with them and I'll rock with X
Eastside motherfucka, Cleveland Brown
Burning leaves in the gutta, make it Cleveland loud
All I know is when the beefs on, the beast comes out
EST is in the buildin, we run this town
Ruff Ryders, you got a problem come find us
Hop up like the sand man right behind ya
Like where the cheese bitch fuck lasagna
Pair of shoes size bags, loot stuffed inside 'em
Grimey, bare hand, no tool beside me
I don't talk online, hater come here find me
Me against the world, underdogs new Rocky
Givin a fuck if anyone co-sign me likes that uh!
You might also like[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'allI ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Verse 3: DMX]
Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick
I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog, and you not
[Chorus]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

[Outro: DMX]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all24Embed
