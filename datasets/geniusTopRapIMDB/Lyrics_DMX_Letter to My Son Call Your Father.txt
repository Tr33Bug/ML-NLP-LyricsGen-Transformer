TranslationsTürkçeLetter to My Son (Call Your Father) Lyrics[Intro: DMX]
Huh, rrr (Woo)
Ooh, rrr
This is one of those
You already know what it is
Rrr

[Verse: DMX]
Dear son, I look in your eyes, I see my own
You look in my eyes, you see my throne
As many times I tried to talk to you, explain to you
See it didn't mean a thing to you
Love you, but right now I wanna bite you
I wanna give you a hug, but I might bite you
Be a man about it, we can admit when we're wrong
Come on, get off that kid shit you on
If you'd have paid attention, you'd have saw it coming
But you a man lookin' through the eyes of a woman
Always gon' love your mama (Always), we just drifted apart
And my kids, y'all my heart
And you got more brothers and sisters
Because I got more kids, and hey, it's just what it is
You the oldеst, I known you longer, but I don't love them lеss
Had to get that off my chest
And I don't know what you thought about my use of drugs
But it taught you enough to not use them drugs
When you were a kid, you play with toys, okay
But you a man, put them toys away
What I'm saying is stop thinkin' like a child
'Cause what if it's when I'm gone (Damn)
That you gotta realize you're wrong? (Damn)
And we could've been best of friends all along
But it would kinda defeat the purpose of the song
917-915-4804
Give me a call, I love you boy (That's the truth, call me)
[Chorus: Usher]
Yeah, ay, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your father

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Brian King Joseph]
Dear father, should've been there when I needed you
Should've been there when the devil had a hold of your soul
(Hold of your soul, hey, hey)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Usher]
Ayy, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late (Not too late)
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your fatherYou might also like5Embed
