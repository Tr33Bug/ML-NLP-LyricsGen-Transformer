Party Up (Up In Here) Lyrics[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I gots to bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick (Aight)
All your mans that been to jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with dumb quick
How the fuck you gon' cross the dog on some bum shit? (Aight)
There go the gun click, 911 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit?
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club
'Cause every time you come around, it's like what?
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now 'cause they miss you
Shit, a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 2: DMX]
Off the chain, I leave niggas soft in the brain
'Cause niggas still want the fame off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fucking with me, and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on
That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick or the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? (Hmm), let's add up all the factors
You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?"
"I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go"
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it all on the strength of the hands with them, man

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 3: DMX]
I bring down rain so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking, put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking, 'less you tryna end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Bridge: DMX]
One, two, meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my Ruff Ryders gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my big ballers gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my fly ladies gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my street-street people, meet me outside
Meet me outside, outside, motherfucker
