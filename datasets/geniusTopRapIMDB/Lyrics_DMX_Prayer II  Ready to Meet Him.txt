Prayer II / Ready to Meet Him Lyrics[Part 1: Prayer II]

Let us pray...
I thank you, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed
I thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is your house
I thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen
[Part 2: Ready to Meet Him]

[Intro]
We each walk the path that we've chosen (Yes)

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 1]
Lord, You left me stranded and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special, that's what You told me
Hold me, stop actin' like You don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent You away from me?
Not only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?
"My child I'm here as I've always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say?" Follow Your word and be true
"What did you do?" Well, what I wanted to do
"What have you seen?" Darkness and hell at a glance
"What do you want?" All I want is another chance
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 2]
"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock"
You see, I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and I'm still not able to stand
"I gave you a hand." Well but I was lookin' the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
"Thou shalt not steal." But what if he stole from me?
"Thou shalt not kill." But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
"Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain"
[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

[Verse 3]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
"What have you learned?" It's better to tell the truth than to lie
"What have you learned?" To love my life until I die
"What have you learned?" Violence isn't always the key
"What have you learned?" You can't always believe what you see
"What have you learned?" It's better to forgive and forget
"What have you learned?" Give as you expect to get
"What have you learned?" That I can't go on without You
"What have you learned?" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

[Outro]
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him61Embed
