Prayer III LyricsLet us pray
Lord Jesus it is you who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love, this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you Lord; I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'
I stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection
Beggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only havin' one life to do it, instead of two
