Stop Being Greedy Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
[Verse 1]
I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me (What?)
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me (What?)
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever (Uh)
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill? I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
Four-four, that's what I get sick with (Grr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grr)

[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk past the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dawgs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the—, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the—, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm drunk so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black

[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
[Verse 3]
When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their health
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go

[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate80Embed
