The Rain Lyrics[Intro]
Next stop, Chicago
It's such a long, long train ride
It's such a long lonely ride back home

[Verse]
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothin' but bein' true, but
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is, you say it is
Just because for the past 20 years every day it is (What?)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin' about comin' to conflict with the law, 'cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I follow Him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the words that you can see, 'cause
Now I know (C'mon) only I can stop the rain
We get away with it everyday shit
But everyday shit catches up with you and when it does you can't say shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I don't, you will, what I won't, you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill, when
Now I know only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I gave it to you straight
Don't mix it, twist it (What) up for some slick shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I don't have to talk to it anymore
I don't have to walk to it anymore, I'm out the door (What)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the Lord
I don't wanna find a beast with the sword, I can't afford to
Now I know only I can stop the rain
When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight between wrong and right
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I thank you, Lord for my life
I thank you, Lord for keeping it loose when things got tight
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain, stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
I'm outYou might also like59Embed
