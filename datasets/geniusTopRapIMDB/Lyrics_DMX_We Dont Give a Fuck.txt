We Don’t Give a Fuck Lyrics[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Verse 1: DMX]
When it rain, niggas get wet, so stay dry (uh)
Don't cross me, I can peep a snake eye (woo)
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark (uh-huh)
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow with the spark (UHH)
Blew your shit apart -- now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga!
Stupid is as stupid does, cocksucker, (WHAT?)
And look what being stupid does: gets you shot, sucker!" (WHAT?)
I let you get too close and you bit me (uh)
I closed my eyes for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me (uhh)
Well you might as well forget me 'cause from this point on (uh-huh)
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone (c'mon!)
I'm still mad at myself for lettin' that shit go down (UHH)
Somebody shoulda told me I was fuckin' wit a clown (aight?)
And I think they found them lil niggas drowned...
.. you know how shit get around
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Aiyyo X fuck them niggas, them niggas ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit em?
You can't trust niggas no further than you can throw em
You don't wanna murder the niggas, then you blow em
He usin yo' style, that make him yo' child
Then he shouldn't make a move til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes - runnin wit dogs
Tell them ain't nuttin like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God
But if they wasn't your niggas I woulda BEEN hit em hard
Niggas look like they phony (what) sound like they phony (huh?)
Run around actin like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes, we bringin the duct tape
And the broomstick -- them bitch-ass niggas is gettin raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin to be blind, fuck eye for eye
Cause we only takin yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker

[Verse 3: DMX]
There was always somethin there, but I just couldn't touch it (uh-huh)
Wasn't somethin that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it!" (uhh)
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride (true)
Now that you done killed it, I'm glad that it died (AIGHT?)
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin (uhh)
Til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan (c'mon!)
That's what you get for hatin -- FUCK YOU FAGGOT! (WHAT?)
I never did trust you faggot -- I'll bust you faggot! (WHAT?)
What you done forgot about the streets is this: (uhh)
You do a grimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch (AIGHT?)
You just STOP fuckin wit him, you got no more rap (uh)
No more, "Yo whassup D?", no more dap (uhh)
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P. (WHAT?)
AND WHAT? Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me (woo)
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson:
Next time think twice, or get iced wit the Wesson, nigga! (Nigga!)
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
