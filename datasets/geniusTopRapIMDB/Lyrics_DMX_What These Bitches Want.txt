What These Bitches Want Lyrics[Intro: DMX, Nokio the N-Tity & SisQó]
Uh (DMX, SisQó), yeah

Check it out, know what I'm sayin'?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Ooh (Ruff Ryders), DMX, break 'em off
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Break 'em off somethin' (Oh yeah, and by the way, it's the N-Tity)

[Verse 1: DMX & SisQó]
Ayo, dawg, I meet bitches, discreet bitches
Street bitches slash Cocoa Puff-sweet bitches (What?)
Make you wanna eat bitches, but not me
Y'all niggas eat off the plate all you want, but not D (Uh)
I fucks with these hoes from a distance
The instant they start to catch feelings, I start to stealin' they shit
Then I'm out just like a thief in the night, I sink my teeth in to bite
You thinkin' life, I'm thinkin more like, "What's up tonight?"
Come on, ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight, I'm not gon' jeopardize my life (Aight?)
So what is it you want from a nigga? (What?)
I gave you, you gave me (Bitch) I blazed you, you blazed me (Come on)
Nothin' more, nothin' less
But you at my door willing to confess that it's the best you ever tested (Aight)
Better than all the rest, I'm like, "Aight, girlfriend, hold up
I gave you what you gave me, boo, a nut" (Tell me)
