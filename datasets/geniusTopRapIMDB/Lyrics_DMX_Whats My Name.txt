Whatâ€™s My Name? Lyrics[Intro]
This is the fuckin' shit I be talkin about
Half rappin'-ass mothafuckers
You think it's a game? You think it's a fuckin' game?
Come on (Uh, uh, uh)
Come on
What y'all really want? (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
What y'all really want? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
What, DMX (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Come on, ride or die (Uh, uh)
Ayo, ayo, ayo
[Verse 1]
What's my name?
DMX and I be the best, you see the rest?
They lookin' like they need a rest (Uh, uh, uh, what)
One more time
I'ma spit at you some shit
That's gon' get at you and be fuckin' with your mind (Uh)
Stop talkin' shit
'Cause you out there runnin' your mouth
And really don't know who you fuckin' with (What)
Here we go again
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas?
I have no friends (Come on)
You still actin' up
Runnin' around here like some brand new pussy
That's about to get fucked (Uh, uh, uh, what)
The game don't stop
I'm still gettin' down for whatever, whenever
That's why my shit is hot (Uh)
Can't keep it real
Now, some of us do, but most of us don't
That's just how a nigga feel (Come on)
I shed blood
For my people that'll keep you lookin see-through
If ever you try to creep through
You might also like[Chorus]
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want? (What)
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want?

[Verse 2]
You still playin' games
You gon' think it's a joke
Until they no longer remember your name (Uh-huh)
That's how we do 'em
Make cowards disappear into thin air
By puttin' shit through 'em (Ooh)
Never comin' back
Last time you saw that nigga
Is the last time you'll see that nigga (Alright)
No more deaths
'Cause in a minute you gon' have grandma bein'
The only family member left (Come on)
Bust my gun
If I gots to kill a nigga
But I'm always down for the one-on-one (Alright)
Dog for life
We gon' get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night (Uh)
Stop, drop (Uh), open up shop (What)
Fake up-north niggas screamin' for the cops (What)
Ride or die
And what that means is that I'll tell a nigga bye-bye
Then pop him in his right eye (Come on)
[Chorus]
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby (Uh)
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want? (What?)
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want?

[Verse 3]
Look at all these off-brand niggas (Uh-huh)
Runnin' around yappin' 'bout
They be holdin' figures as big as Jigga's (Come on)
That's that bullshit
Don't they know that around me
Talkin' about what you got will get you hit (Uh)
I'm not a nice person
I mean, I'd smack the shit out you twice, dog
And that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute, I'm cool, the next minute
I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga, leave you all bloody, nigga
Service with a smile (Uh-huh)
Suck my dick
And all you niggas that been to jail before
Know that it's about to get thick (What)
Let's get it on, baby
You gon' be goin' against four niggas in one
And you think you crazy? (Alright)
I've lost my mind
And I'm about to make you lose yours, too
From far away, one time (Boom)

[Chorus]
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby (Come on)
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want? (What)
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby (Uh, come on)
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want? (What, what, what)
DMX
'Cause if you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga, we with it
All you gotta do is set it, baby
Ride or die
What y'all niggas want?
Uh, uh, what y'all niggas want?
