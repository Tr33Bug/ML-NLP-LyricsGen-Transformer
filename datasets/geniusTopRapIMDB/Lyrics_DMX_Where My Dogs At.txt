Where My Dogs At Lyrics[Intro]
What?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?

[Verse]
You can try but I do fight, just can't seem to do right
Can't run with the big dogs, his jeans is too tight
I've been doing this for too long, plus dog is too strong
Let you catch, fight me off the map with a new song
Man you know you wrong, trying that shit there
Yeah a nigga went there, all you do is sit there
I've been rapping for 20 years and you 20 years old
X back on the block nigga, you lucky if you go Gold
There's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected
You ain't gonna like it, but respect, nigga check it
I'mma get it in till the nigga wins with the dividends
We gon' walk these dogs 'til the bitter end
You like, oh it's him again, I knew that's how you felt
Pussy, I knew that's how you smelt
But you cats still playing around with just beats
Talking about what you got, ain't air in the teeth
You can put on a vest, but I'mma still stop it
Cause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter
And niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk
We gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump
Whether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready
Half from here to here, lookin like spaghetti
Pull out the machete, hack off the limbs
Bag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz, five cars deep
4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
GIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down
You can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst
You gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse
Niggas play poker, I play poke-her
Hit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!You might also like1Embed
