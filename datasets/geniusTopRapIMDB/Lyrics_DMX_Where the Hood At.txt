(Now I gotta deal with this shit)
Ayy, yo, y'all niggas must be out your fuckin' mind (Yo, yo, old shitty-dick ass niggas)
Thinking dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat (Yo, y'all niggas is fucking dumb)
Think I ain't got a trick up my motherfuckin' sleeve, you bitch-ass niggas
Fuck these niggas thinking?
Y'all niggas thinkin' I'm doing, just sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, niggas can't be serious

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
[Post-Chorus]
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 1]
Man, cats don't know (What?) what it's gon' be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
D to the M to the X (X)
Last I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex (Uh) with the same sex (Woo)
I show no love (Yeah) to homo thugs (Nah)
Empty out, reload, and blow more slugs (Boom)
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand (Aight?)
I don't fuck with chumps (Yeah)
For those that been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps (Uh)
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog (Woo)
I know how to get down, know how to bite (Bite)
Bark very little, but I know how to fight (Fight)
I know how to chase a cat up in a tree
Man, I'll give y'all niggas the business for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Verse 2]
Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam, blam, lungs is gone, sons will mourn
From dusk 'til dawn (Uh), night time belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue (Yeah)
Won't play with these cats 'cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats (Uh)
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats (Aight?)
'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed, but I ain't got the patience (Uh)
Don't want me havin' no patience, turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Trying to get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here)
You see them niggas? (Right where?)
Get 'em, boys (Right there)
That's how we do (Alright, then)
Yeah, this is for my dogs (Uh), this is for my dogs (Uh)
Yo, where we at, baby? (Creepin' through the fog)
From then 'til now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them niggas and hit every block on the job

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
[Post-Chorus]
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3]
I get apes doin' crime, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine (Yeah)
Five CD's with mad rhymes (Aight)
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin' (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face (Aight?)
Lookin' at you in your grill, it might be nice to cut (Uh-huh)
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt (Uh-huh)
Yeah, you right, I know your style pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it (Damn)
Since we all here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it (Woo)
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly (Woo)
Never heard that D be running (Uh), 'cause D be gunning
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they'll hit me with a three-to-nine

[Chorus]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

[Outro]
What?
Where the fuckin' hood at?
Ayy, no one's fuckin' with me, nigga (It's all good)
For real (It's all good, dog is the hood)
I am the hood (It's all good, dog in the hood)
I am the streets (It's all good, dog is the hood)
You bitch-ass nigga (It's all good, dog is the hood)
Take it how you want, motherfucker (It's all good)
I'm in the hood all day (Dog is the hood)
I think I'm, like, the only nigga, dog (Dog in the hood)
That can go to the projects (School Street, Home of the Brave)
By his fuckin' self and be good (Good)
Yeah, nigga, ask niggas on my projects (Yo, Y.O.)
When the last time they seen dog, motherfucker (Not too long ago, baby)
D, Y, uh (Y'all niggas is homeless)
