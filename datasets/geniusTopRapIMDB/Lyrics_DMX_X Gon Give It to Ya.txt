X gon' give it to ya (What?)
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
Go hard, gettin' busy with it (Ooh)

You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved (Uh)
Bitch, and that's on a light day (Give up)
I'm gettin' down (Down) like a nigga said "Freeze" (Uh)
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
Bitch please, (Come on) if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker

First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (What)

X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya
First, we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go
X gon' give it to ya (Uh), he gon' give it to ya
