X-Is Coming Lyrics[Intro: Kid]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, you better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
[Verse 1]
Who's afraid of the dark?
Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark, they hear the boom, but you see the spark
And I see the part of your head which used to be your face
Be replaced by nothin' for bluffin', what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine, picture that
Get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off, yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggas would've been fucked you
But then we in the streets, niggas should've been stucked you
Plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cut off
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cut off
And as for your man, don't you ever in your mothafuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit' a knife, aight?
And forgettin' you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Don't give a fuck about your family, they'll be resting with you

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late (Yes!)
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
You might also like[Verse 2]
You got yourself in a predicament, that you can't get out of
You already in some shit, but it's about to get hotter
Fuckin' with a nigga like you runnin' your mouth
Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
'Cause I ain't knockin' on the door, I'm comin' in the house
And I'm gunnin' for your spouse, tryin' to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older than 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the livin' room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? Wanna kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a little while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, know that before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, motherfucker
Click, boom-boom, see your ass in hell

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
[Verse 3]
When I speak you better listen, the harder it gets, the more follows
And I'm hittin' 'em with shit that they can't all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you, not seein' tomorrow
I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once, then I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
'Cause where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killin' means
Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'
'Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'
Niggas started somethin', but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cause I'ma win this shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax
Gimme slugs for my gats, gimme hoods for my rats
Gimme wood for my bats, then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late53Embed
