DEADPOOL is asleep in a jeep that's driving down a dirt road. He is sitting next to an African woman who is in her late 30s, ESIANKIKI. Deadpool suddenly wakes up screaming.

DEADPOOL
DON'T LET BEN CARSON OPERATE ON ME!
(then)
Where the hell am I?
ESIANKIKI
You were pretty passed out. In an empty Duty Free.

DEADPOOL
(remembering)
Oh yeah. You guys are the one's with the rhino?

ESIANKIKI
Yes. I'm Esiankiki Jepkosgei.

DEADPOOL
Esia...Esian-kiki? You know what?
I'm gonna call you, "The Greek Freak".

Esiankiki frowns. Doesn't seem cool. Deadpool ignores it.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Yeah...so y'all payin' me in
Bitcoin. I'm surprised. You're
the first to agree to that.

ESIANKIKI
Whatever it takes. We're surprised
you took the job actually. You
don't seem like the animal lover
type.Embed
