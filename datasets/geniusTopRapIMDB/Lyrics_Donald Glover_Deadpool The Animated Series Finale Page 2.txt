Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 2] Lyrics2.

DEADPOOL
Oh don't get me wrong, I'd rip
that horn off myself if a
poacher paid me enough. I'm Jeremy
Meeks when it comes to that bag.
(then)
But I also love everything rhino
ya know? I used to wear a ton of
Ecko back in the day. I was a huge
G-Unit fan. Had the whole fit. I
still got some shirts.
Beat.
DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
You want some Ecko shirts?

ESIANKIKI
No.

DEADPOOL
Yeah. Me neither.
(then)
So where's this big grey nutsack-
skin covered unicorn?

ESIANKIKI
We're hiding Sudan right now. He's
very weak. We've been doing all we
can, but if he stays in captivity
he will die. The problem is the
poachers. They're everywhere and
they've been waiting for-

DEADPOOL
OH MY GOD!

ESIANKIKI
You see one?!
DEADPOOL
Sanaa Lathan bit Beyonce's face!
(scrolls)
Wait.
(relieved.)
Oh thank God. It was Jennifer
Lawrence. I already hate her.
It's fine.

He continues to scroll and stare at his phone. Esiankiki
keeps driving awkwardly. He looks for a moment, then goes
back to scrolling.Embed
