Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 4] Lyrics4.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
I went from Johnny Depp in Pirates
of the Caribbean to...Johnny Depp
in Pirates of the Caribbean. The
ride.

Deadpool pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Where's this fuckin' rhino?
INT. MOUNTIAN TUNNEL - DAY

A large rhino stands eating by a rock wall. Deadpool,
Esiankiki, and Zachariah walk up to him.

ZACHARIAH
This is Sudan. The last male
northern white rhino on the Earth.

DEADPOOL
(waves)
Hi.

ESIANKIKI
When he dies. A piece of us dies
as well.

DEADPOOL
Pieces of me die all the time. Its
fine. Also can't you guys just
grab some rhino semen and make more
rhinos?

ZACHARIAH
We'd prefer to do it naturally.
But incase something does happen to
him in the wild, we did have semen
samples taken.
DEADPOOL
So this isn't even really the last
male rhino? Y'all can just Jurassic
Park this shit whenever you want?
This feels like a waste of my time.

ESIANKIKI
I assure you it isn't. Whatever
you'd be doing instead wouldn't be
as significant.

DEADPOOL
I'd be jackin' llama's from eleven year olds.Embed
