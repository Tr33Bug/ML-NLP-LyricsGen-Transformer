Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 5] Lyrics5.

Zachariah and Esiankiki stare: "What?"

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Fortnite? Hello?
(then)
Oh! "Jackin' llama's from eleven
year olds" sounds awful. That's
not what I'm sayin'. I'm not
Tekashi69.
(clarifying)
I'm an AMAZING rapper.
Zachariah and Esiankiki are still confused.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Wow. Nothing's landing. Our
cultures are very different. We
have so much to teach each other.

EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - DAY

A large flatbed releases Sudan out into the open the armed
guards rally around and make sure he's safe. Esiankiki and
Zachariah wave from the jeep.

ZACHARIAH
Be careful. We only need you to
follow him until he mates. Then
you can collect your price.

DEADPOOL
I gotta follow him until he mates?!
Man, fuck this job. This ain't
worth it.
(phone alert)
Bitcoin status alert.
(checks)
Holy Jeff Bezos!
(sincere to Zachariah)
I will protect him with my life.
CUT TO:

EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - LATER

Zachariah, Esiankiki, and the armed guards drive away.

DEADPOOL
So. I guess it's just you and me.
Should be a fun script.

Sudan just stands there chewing.Embed
