Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 6] Lyrics6.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Oh I see. This is gonna be a
"Castaway", "Wilson" relationship
where I just talk to myself through
you the whole time? Cause to be
honest it was feeling like an "Ace
Ventura: When Nature Calls" ripoff.
Which I was really excited about.
Sudan chews.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
He does come of a rhino's ass
in that. "Castaway" it is.

Sudan chews.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
What's the wifi?

EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - LATER

Deadpool and Sudan are walking through the brush.

DEADPOOL
It is very hot. Like damn.

Sudan keeps walking.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
You're gonna love me by the way.
I'm an amusing and charismatic
wingman if I'm telling the truth.

Sudan says nothing. Obviously.
DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
I don't know why I'm here either!
I don't think the writer's just mad. Or
bored. We'll find out I guess.
Together.

Sudan stops and defecates.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Good call.

Deadpool stands still for six seconds.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Most people don't think I wear a
diaper under here. Probably cause
I don't.
