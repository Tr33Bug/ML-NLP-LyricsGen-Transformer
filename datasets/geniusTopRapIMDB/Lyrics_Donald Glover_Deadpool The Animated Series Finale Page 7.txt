Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 7] LyricsDEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Listen, can you find a female in
like, the next fifteen minutes? I got Kings tickets.

Sudan just stares far off. Deadpool's Bitcoin alert goes
off. He checks.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Jesus. This isn't worth my time
again.
(alert goes off again)
JE-SUS! I'ma need that horn, bruh.
Deadpool pulls out his sword. Alert goes off again.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Oh wow!
(then)
You wanna go to a Kings game with
me?

CUT TO:

INT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - DAY

Sudan is chewing on grass. Deadpool is sitting against a
tree.

DEADPOOL
You know, I'm not mad about this
whole "cancelled" thing. I
actually think it's a good thing. I
mean, is it even a good time to
have a violent, gun loving white
man ranting on TV?
(hard sell)
Other than the PRESIDENT!

Sudan continues chewing.
DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
If this was "Last Week Tonight",
people woulda laughed.
(thinks better of it)
Woulda clapped.

Sudan turns and scratches a tree w/ his horn.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
I mean, I get it. Maybe they just,
wanna sell toys. And this style of
comedy isn't it. It's more "ha-ha,
but I'm mad". I get that.Embed
