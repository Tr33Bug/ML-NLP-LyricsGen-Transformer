Deadpool: The Animated Series “Finale” [Page 8] LyricsSudan shakes. Then continues eating grass.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Do you think they cancelled the
show...cause of racism?!

Sudan continues eating grass.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Yeah, but all the writers were
black. And the references were
pretty black too. I heard they
went over the lunch budget ordering
Jamaican food at least once a week.
Sudan eats.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
You're right. Black Panther.
(then)
Maybe we were alienating our white
audience?
(then)
No. We did a whole goat yoga
episode. Damn. What was it?

More eating.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Noooooo. The Taylor Swift episode?
Nah. No. They had to have loved that script.

Sudan walks away.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
Are you fucking kidding me?

Deadpool gets up and chases him.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
That episode's hilarious!
Sudan doesn't look. He just keeps walking.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
What? The Marvel stuff I said in
it? All I said was Marvel was
trying to sell toys to seven year
old boys and fifty year old
pedophiles. That's just funny.
They're cool. They get it.

Sudan just keeps walking.Embed
