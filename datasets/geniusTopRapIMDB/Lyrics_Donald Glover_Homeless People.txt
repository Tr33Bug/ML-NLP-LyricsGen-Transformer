Homeless People LyricsI'm kind of obsessed with homeless people
I really am
Cause, I don't know
We have a long history together
We do
We have a long history together
Like, when I first moved here
When I first moved here from Atlanta
Like, the only thing I knew
how to do to make money
was to babysit
cause my parents, like they ran a daycare
We had a lot of foster kids
So the only thing I knew how to do
Was take care of kids
So I had this job
I was supposed to pick up this kid
and I was running late
And I was leaving a message
on the phone
And I was just like, you know, talking
And I wasn't really paying attention
to where I was going
And a homeless man, punched me in the face
And I think he was like, schizophrenic
or something, cause he was like
"STOP FOLLOWING ME!"
and I was just like,
"AHH!" and I was just like
Just ran away
So anyway, I go and pick up
the kid I pick him up
Bring him home
Make him dinner
His mom comes home
She's like, "Hey."
She goes in the back room
She comes back out and she goes,
"Hey, are you okay?"
and I'm like,
"Yeah, I'm fine,"
I kinda forgot
She's like, "Are you sure?"
And I'm like,
"Yeah, what's wrong?"
And she plays me the voice message I left
And I didn't keep it
But I remember it very well
And it went a little something, it went like this
(imitates voice message tone)
"Hey, uh, it's Donald. Uh, I just
wanted to let you know that (sighs)
I'm running a little late picking up Ben
But I just wanted to let you know
(gets punched)
Why'd you do that?
Why'd you do that?
I gotta hide
I'll hide in this tree
Get away!
Get away!
Leave me alone!
(cries)
I wanna die
I wanna fucking die,"
That's pretty much how it sounded
So, thanks
So, I've a lot of run ins
with you know like, homeless people
and stuff like that
And you know I live in downtown LA
and downtown LA is kinda like
The 80's decided to stay there
They're like, "Oh yeah, you guys
go ahead and be the 90's
Go enjoy Ace of Bass
We'll be here,
practicing the moonwalk
and selling crack,"
Like that's everything
in downtown LA
And I, you know
I'm hanging out in downtown LA
and I would always have, you know
I would like, parties or something
or watch movies and stuff like that
and I'll have girls over
and I'd always have to walk them back
to their car
I'd have to walk, and they like
they ask me like, "Can you walk me back,"
I'm like sure, and around the 7th time
I was like like, "Wow, every girl who comes over
asks me to walk them back to their car,"
Like no matter what time
And I realize it's like, "Oh,
they're afraid they're gonna get attacked
or raped or something," and I was like
Oh my God, like that's ridiculous
as a grown man, I never think of that
Like that's never in my head, like
rape isn't right around the corner for me
Like it is for women
Which is so messed up
Like if someone
Like I'm an adult male
I'm a grown man
Like if someone was gonna rape me
Like if someone was attack me and rape me
Like they'd have to be like, like, real tricky about it
you know, like real tricky
Like I'd be like
goin in the movie theater
I got my popcorn
You know bout to go see
Like a movie with a bunch of explosions in it
Just like, "Hey, what's goin on? Sorry, man
Oh, sorry, man, sorry, just trynna get through
It's "The Expendables" sorry excuse me
Trynna, sorry Ok, alright
AHH!"
And then I see like
then a see like a man
dressed like a chair running
away and stuff
just like
"GOD DAMMIT!"
"What, man?"
"Nothing! Got raped again, man
Can you believe this?
No, I don't wanna watch
"Expendables," anymore."Embed
