SIblings LyricsLike I said, like, I grew up with a lot of foster parents
Foster kids and stuff like that
Like, I mean, like, my parents were my parents
I never had foster parents, but like, we had a lot of kids going through there
And that’s how I learned about all the stuff in the world, like sex and all that crazy stuff, 'cause they would talk about this crazy stuff
I'd be like, what? Like, I was so, like, sheltered
Like, my parents did a good job about that. Like, they did, like...
And it would be weird, because I remember we would have kids coming in
And Dimarco's like my little brother, and he’s adopted, but we had him since he was little, so he’s like, my real brother, for all intents and purposes, like, he was there since he was a baby
So, like, I would mess with him like he was my little brother
Like, I’d be on the top bunk and he’d be on the bottom bunk, I’d be on the top and be like, “Hey, Dimarco!”
He’d be like, “What?”
I’d be like, “When you fall asleep, I’m gonna piss in your mouth”
"Stop!"
And my dad would be like, "Quiet down in there! I’m trying to masturbate in the den!"
You can’t do that stuff to kids who have been in the system
You can’t do that stuff to kids who have been in… like, in house after house, like, because they’ve been in the system too long
They're too rough. Like, I tried to pull this stuff on this kid named, like, Teddy
I tried to pull it. You know, I was, like, on the top bunk and I was like, “Hey, Teddy.”
And he was like, “What?”
And I was like, “When you fall asleep… I’m gonna pee in your mouth”
And he was like...
"You piss in my mouth, I’m gonna bite your dick off."
And I was like, “Good night!” Like, terrifiedEmbed
