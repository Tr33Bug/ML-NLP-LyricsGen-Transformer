All My Niggaz Lyrics[Chorus: Decadez]
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

[Verse 1: E-40]
All we want is the money, the mozzarella, Galbani
I got more guns than the army, can't let no bitch nigga harm me
I got that purple like Barney, I got two bitches that's horny
They say they niggas is corny, they never there and they lonely
They bought a bottle of 'trony and now they ready to blow me
If you know me you owe me, that's what I told her for sho'
I'm a mac just like Goldie, me and my cronies and brodies
Rollies and stogies, stay with them fifties and forties
That's us if you smell smoke, cookies the antidote
Puffing that rope-a-dope, my partner's they kinfolk
They rap and they sell coke, bust ya head like a cantaloupe
In the summer, a peacoat, my iPhone is jailbroke
Leanin' like the Tower of Pisa, promethazina
Sweatin' like we under a heater, it's hot in here
All them suckers that's talking crazy, they not in here
Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear
[Chorus: Decadez]
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm up before the sun up, the work it be uncut
I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up
Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tongues cut
Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons touched
I'm up in the Chevy, we bangin' blow job Betty
I just whipped up the 80, so hit my phone when you're ready
Turkey bags of that loud, we ain't fuckin' with reggie
Tractor-trailer with pounds just touched down up at the Jeffries
Then I'm off, 'bout to hit another Lick
â€˜Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip
Gerber bottles of that lean, tax on every sip
'Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis
So I'm rollin', rollin', thizzin' off that molly
Stuntin', stuntin', no hands on the Ducati
My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi
Just a youngin and a muscle
Got the game from Charlie Hustle, come on

All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Pockets will advance, clear the room
If the bitch ain't with the shit, then your boy don't approve, see
Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party, aye
Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy, see
Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy
Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding
And that's your bitch, she flips like dolphins
See, we gon' work out and bounce the bed springs, ugh
No credit cards, just debit and large cash
Got a real big bag, smell like a forest, see
I used to sell weight 'til gastric bypass, ugh
Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass
Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties
And learned from Dude Dawg, he taught be greedy
King East Bay, E-40, boss leany, ugh
Money all there, ugh, your money Houdini
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Decadez]
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money9Embed
