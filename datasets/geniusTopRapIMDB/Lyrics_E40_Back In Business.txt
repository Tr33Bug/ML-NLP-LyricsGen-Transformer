Back In Business Lyrics[Intro: voice samples off a movie]
This sounds like the Jackpot

[Chorus 1]
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business

The time comes that a man's gotta stop running away and face things
The time comes that a man's gotta stop running away and face things
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business*
[Verse 1]
UH! Prepared for the hatred with my problem solver, my patriot
Goon up or get tuned up, rubbed off, erased-ed
Stay dedicated and faithful to my camp (What about your camp?)
Touch any of my loved ones and get stamped (Stamped)
Stapled, removed, soil tested and block approved
Really a good dude (Dude), but he can get true
From the school of hubba rocks and life savers up in his socks
Sprintin' and runnin' from the cops (Cops)
The cherries (Cherries), the sirens (Sirens)
The po-po penelope one time (One time)
The alphabet boys, the letters (Letters)
The sophisticated dog trainin' tactics, the K9 Shepherds (Shepherds)
In order to do some right you gotta do some wrong (Wrong)
Got hella shit goin' on (What else?)
The dusty (Dusty), the dirty (Dirty), the smirkish (Smirkish)
UH! I ain't paranoid, Iâ€™m prepared, I ain't nervous (I ain't nervous)
When you cookin' birdies in the kitchen
Can't be slippin' like a transmission
Gotta be on your peas and toes
It's hard to make an honest livin' when your kids ain't got no clothes
BIATCH!

[Chorus 2]
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
I'm interested in picking up a few hot dollars
I'm interested in picking up a few hot dollars
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business

[Verse 2]
Playin' the game how it was meant to be played
The way it's supposed to be
Money hungry and zany (Zany), soil savvy and brainy
Hard-headed and mannish, me and my Filipinos and Hispanics
Guamanians and Asians, Samoans, Tongans and Caucasians
California Bears, not no California raisins
All of us is fools (Fools), all of us is patients (Patients)
Ethiopians, Afghanis and Eritreans (Eritreans)
Africans, Jamaicans and Indians (And Indians)
Uh, ave animal, we some hood hysterians
You can tell by the way I carry it that I'm a block barbarian
A goon with the spoon, wrist game sick
Paid the neighborhood chef to teach a nigga how to whip (Whip)
A nigga how to whip (Whip), a fixture how to mix (Mix)
Counterclockwise twistin' it, drop it off, deliver it
Never half-step (Step), go for the jugular (Jugular)
Get yo money, mayne, don't be no couch potato hustler

[Chorus 3]
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
What I don't know I don't trust
What I don't know I don't trust
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business

[Verse 3]
UH! Family, you a solid dude, your name just came up
Bruh, you gon' live a long time, we just talked you up
"Well, what was the subject about? Was the subject good or was it bad?"
The subject was about how you made them suckaz back up like sea crab
When they raised the white flag, too many drinks they had
Disrespecting the boss, that's how you got fucked off
You mean something, you somebody, you really stand for something
They got big ass N on they chest (For what?)
For nothing
You know my homie with the two-toned Lex (What about him?)
He fuckin', a couple of them niggas' broads
They licked his sweaty balls
These hoes nowadays is dogs (Dogs), givin' up them drawers (Drawers)
Do anything for the cash (Cash)
Wipe their coochie off with a napkin and take a hooker bath (Bath)
Ain't none of my niggas captains, they gotta pay our mackin' ass
We be slummin' it, we be trappin'
In the slow lane and the fast (Fast)
Money, hugs, fame, and kisses (Kisses)
Alcohol, weed, and bitches, mayne, we back to fuckin' business
BIATCH!

[Chorus 4]
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
We're back in business, boys, we're back in business
