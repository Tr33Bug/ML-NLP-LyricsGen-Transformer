Bendinâ€™ Corners (Skee Skert) Lyrics[Intro]
Lil Bonez on the beat

[Verse 1: E-40]
This thing go, for sho'ly
Only bustas I like, is Buster Posey
And the Bay is so trashy, murkish and murky
Crooked cops, crooked dice, they'll do you dirty
When I enter the neighborhood, when I pull up
People gather 'round me like an ice cream truck
They say, "Uncle 40 waterwhat's the secret to life?"
"I'm trying to get on, I need some advice"
I give 'em some game and then I dip
Off to the next episode, money to get
Can't be slippin' and snoozin' and cattin' off
If you lag, you lose man, your loss
My Ruger won't stutter to put you under the cover
Or should I say "sheet," with a tag on yo' feet
Fetti' by the face ain't complexion as duct tape [?]
Then it's dark like shadows off the tree, bad apple
Cognac and Snapple sippin, spliffer twistin Swisher Sweets
Smokin and blowin and puffin on some Larry OG
Comin' around the corner, disrespectful-ass beat
Old peep can't sleep, call Johnny Law on me
I don't make it rain, I'm not a cloud
And I don't pay for coochy, coochy pay for me pal
You can find me double-fisted in the crowd, in the party talkin' loud
No harm, no foul
[Hook]
And I be bangin' this shit when I'm bendin' that block (bendin' that block)
Bendin' that block
And I be bangin' this shit when I bendin' that block (been in that block)
Bendin' that block
Hit the corner like skee, (skee) skert (skee skert)
Skee, (skee) skert (skert)
Hit the corner like skee, (skee) skert (skee skert)
Skee, (skee) skert (skert)
Skee, (skee) skert (skert)
Hit the corner like

[Verse 2: E-40]
No withdrawls, just deposits
Jordans and Foamposites
Yo house smaller than my closet
Nigga you oughta stop it
That's what I told the fraud
I ain't forkin over no broad
When you speak to me, watch the way you speak
If you feel froggish, leap
He jumped, so I beat him like an egg
Cracked his shell, got on his head
Throw in the towel or we can take it farther
I got more drums than Travis Barker
Or should I say the Blue Men
Two sticks in my hand
I go ape on a fake if that's what he want
I'm not a chump, I'm from Vallejo California, I ain't no punk
B-boy apparel, candy Camaro
Sharp like a arrow, hood like valero
Badges be on me, they like my strategy
They love my attitude and personality
Crown me like a cavity, recognize royalty
Kingpin, I say that with authority
(Ooh) She stacked like french toast, brains over beauty
She just so happened to be blessed with both
