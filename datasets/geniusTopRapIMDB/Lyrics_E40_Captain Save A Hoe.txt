Captain Save A Hoe Lyrics[Chorus: E-40]
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
It's 1993 and niggas need to miss me, be savin' these hoes
You know how these tricks be, be buyin' 'em clothes
Wanna taxi hoes on Vogues with the beat
And have 'em sittin' next to 'em in the front seat
But not B, see, I'm a hog up out the V
And my motto is fuck a ho and hit the throttle
'Til there's smoke, talkin' on my okie-doke
Worldwide I got a Clydes' up in Tokyo
[Verse 2: E-40]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
What's that nigga's name? Captain Save a Hoe, mayne
More faster than a speedin' bullet
To put on his cape, his card, I pulled it
Fake the-fake the funk-the funk
Not me, that's not the way to do it
Captain motherfuckin' Save a Hoe came to me
Flashin' just like a little ol' batch all up in front of my company
Had to check his ass with an ear check thump and punked him
Talkin' to him while I'm beatin' his ass, pumpin' fear, talkin' about, "Nigga, you gon' retrospect somethin' here"

[Chorus: E-40]
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved

[Verse 3: D-Shot]
Mr. Super Trick, Mr. Super Snitch, yeah
You wanna kill me 'cause I fucked your bitch
You should've had your cape on tight that night
'Cause a nigga like the Shot sure plugs 'em right
And now your bitch is straight callin' me, lovin' me
On the under for the porno star that I be
And don't you come in my face with that trick shit
You better try some more shit
You might also like[Verse 4: E-40]
I got the gift to grab any batch that I want, but I don't
'Cause batches now days'll get you caught up in some funk
Oh no, I'm not tryin' to save you hoes, and
How come when I was broke you wasn't brown nosin'?
The other day you see me smobbin' down Magazine
With some ol' nigga in your car lookin' at me mean
I stopped in the middle of the street, reached under my seat to grab my heat
Man, that's the same motherfucker that I got into it with at the club last week

[Verse 5: B-Legit]
Man, them niggas can't fade, they bitch made and so they start
But niggas with no heart don't want no parts of this
Nigga rollin' with the Funk Mobb
And when it's funk, the pump will spit them double-aughts
So what you doin' when we roll through you hideout?
Let my MAC get off and then I rides out
With your ass there smokin' like a incense
You savin' hoes, nigga, and that's bitch shit

[Chorus: E-40]
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved

[Verse 6: Suga-T]
I'm crossin' up niggas and bitches and even snitches just for my riches
Captain Save a Hoe, I ain't got no problem with that ol' shit
I gives a damn as long as he's payin'
It ain't my fault because he's sprung off my layin'
I'm takin' GA checks, go to the bank, Hank
If your breath stank, you gets ganked, mayne
Long as a trick comes fallin' down
That gives me all the sets to put on my suit and clown
[Verse 7: E-40]
But make that nigga take care of your kids
Make that nigga call your kids his
Make that nigga get out there and work
Make his ass buy you a Dooney & Bourke
It's all part of that, "Nigga, take care of me
Pussy-whipped nigga, come save me"
Batches out there be on the lookout
For Captain Save a Hoe 'cause he's savin' hoes

[Chorus: E-40]
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved
Uh-iz-I, uh-iz-I, should I save her?
I wanna be saved

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
I wanna be saved
[Outro: Captain Save 'Em]
Fuck that, what they talkin' about
Man, I'll save a ho, hahahaha
Yeah, baby, what's up? You wanna get your nails done?
Come on, let's go down to Lee to Kim's Nails, yeah, hahaha
