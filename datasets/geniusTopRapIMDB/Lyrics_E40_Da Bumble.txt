Da Bumble Lyrics[Verse 1]
I flipped a Lexi, speed up and catch me
Lexus of Concord, reached out and touched me
Some of you hoe cake ass niggas like broads be messy
I know some beautiful black intelligent women, that's sexy
E-40's back and actin' black and
I don't be balkin, nor even high cappin
You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven
Fade your pistolian, 30-ought-6 custodian
Special shout to Casual, Del, the Souls and Opium
About the town, the Valley-Joe
Just like a democratic, I'm for' the po'
Fuck the bumble, new Click Shit ain't no punk ho
Pedestrians stumble, sound like a gorilla
Tryin to get up out the trunk ho
Continue strikin it, hope you likin it
Filthy McNasties at the bus stop hitchhikin' it
Never reneging or feeling bogus
When it comes to spittin I'm ferocious
Mannish with it, cabbages, savages
Hangin' out the window of the sunroof, ham sandwiches
All day, everyday, 40 play
He say, she say, bieetch! that-a-way
Keep it goin though - don't stop
Shakin baking soda, forms a rock
36 zips on a triple beam scale
Burn the duct tape but keep all the ya-yo
Whip appeal, overkill, extras
Really real, apron specialist
(Drisidrisomina?) is the illest zaggin
59 clip kizzartridge you know I'm pizzackin'
In the mornin, cookin bacon
In the ghetto in the bullet-proof apron
Here comes the laws, batter ram crushin through my walls
Im in my drawers runnin from the canine cocaine-sniffing dogs
Some niggas hate me, some niggas love me
Some niggas shake my paw, some niggas mug me
I see ya tweakin, I see ya geekin
Your bootch is with me while you sleepin
A motherfucker ain't gotta be Flash Gordon
All up in front of a batch to get a batch
That Hector the hoe protector shit won't work
That batch just wants your scrizzach
Lettin' em know, portfolio zodiac sign Scorpio
Seeded and breeded soldier, V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Never show weakness to your enemy
Never leave your crib with out your pepper, beeotch!
I'm tryin' to get nigga rich
Open up a shop cotton candy and licorice
Cash in stashes, that's a must
We made another million and that's a plus
Don't get it twisted man, don't try to find me
Might be in Switzerland, or Hawaii
1-2-3-40, wheels new shoes scrappin toe to toe
Craps, blackjack and keno, strike sideways hit Reno
Ball cap tight, no smilin
Sittin lo somethin profilin, beeitch!
Fuck the bumble, new Click shit ain't no punk ho
New Click shit ain't no punk ho
