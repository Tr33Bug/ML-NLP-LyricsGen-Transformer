Episode Lyrics[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet, say, "Yeah" (yeah, baby)
Baby, touch your toes
We can get freaky, have an episode
Tell me, is ya with that?
Episode, tell me, is ya with that?

[Verse 1: E-40]
I don't like it, I love it, I wanna grip it and touch it
I'm tryna hit it and fuck it, stab it and stick it and stuck it
Get you to lick it and suck it and kiss it after I nut it
We can be friends, ain't gotta be seen in the public
I'm about that verb, that action, have that coochie havin' contractions
When I be smashin' and smackin' and sappin', thrustin' and thrashin'
Sit back and relax and have a glass of this bottle
Earl Stevens Selections, mango Moscato
Handbag by CÃ©line, it seem like I already knew ya
Beautiful girl, you so bad, look like somebody done drew ya
My eyes salute ya, you a sight for sore eyes, booty and thighs
You and your girls should get with me and my guys
Come and get a bar of this mackin', baby girl, get rid of that sap
He ain't real, he a fraud, baby girl, that dude is a cat
When he first intervened, he bought you flowers, no doubt
But once he got in good, he started doggin' you out, uh
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet, say, "Yeah" (yeah, baby)
Baby, touch your toes
We can get freaky, have an episode (yeah)
Tell me, is ya with that? (Ha, haha)
Episode, tell me, is ya with that? (Yeah, Bompton)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
(Ayy, ayy)
Okay, shawty in love with them gangstas, that's why she holla at me
Them country niggas, we whippin' up 15 thousand a key
You just be givin' her, gettin' her, I just fill her with D
Even though she cute and petite, freaky, discreet
She got extensions of booty with them tattoos on her cheek
Make me wanna take her to a island, we could do it for weeks
Girl, let me Birkin your bag, Jimmy Choo on your feet
Let me get you out of the Jag' and in that Bentley GT
I'm on the west coast, drop top ridin', fool
With E-40, Sick Wid It, we ridin', fool
Hustle Gang bang green, we tried them truths
Somebody told you otherwise, they lied to you
I bet it all, roll the dice, bet, bet
Quarter mil' on me in the bag, check that
Them suckas don't like it but they gon' respect that
Spend the night, have a episode, you won't forget that, check that
You might also like[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah, all the little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet, say, "Yeah" (yeah, baby)
Baby, touch your toes
We can get freaky, have an episode (can you get freaky for me?)
Tell me, is ya with that? (Oh, oh)
Episode, tell me, is ya with that? (Tell me, baby)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & E-40]
Girl, I came here with all my niggas and all this liquor
Said she want a threesome, I'm gon' lick her, yup
From the bottom to the top, I'ma take it down (take it down)
I'ma roll the weed but she gon' break it down
It's not my fault if that's your girl (uh uh)
'Cause she wanna leave with a real nigga (with a real one)
Pussy, I'm a boss, her panties in my car
Before your nigga call, you know I gotta get it (tell 'em Chris)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All the little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet, say, "Yeah" (say yeah, baby)
Baby, touch your toes
We can get freaky, have an episode
Tell me, is ya with that?
