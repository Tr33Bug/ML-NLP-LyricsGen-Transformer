Function (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
This is the remix
League of Starz
Trend on the beat

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function
[Verse 1: E-40]
Uh, I slid into the function (the throw)
Lookin' hella dipped (saucy)
Lit like a strobe light (like a strobe light?)
Hella diamonds on my wrist (bling)
You can call me Your Highness 'cause I'm hella high in this (bling)
Play with her mind like a shrink, like I’m a psychiatrist (skrink)
No dryness, I make your chick have a climax (cream)
Even nicer wet, she tellin' me that I'm the best (scream)
You don’t want her, I’ll take her off your hands and do you a favor (favor)
You might not regret it now but you gon' regret it later (later)
I'm about my paper, stapler right on the side of my hip (hip)
In case a hater want it, in case he decide to trip
Platinum plannin', shippin' and handlin', see these are digital sales (digital sales)
Used to push E up from the scale but now it's legitimate skrill
You ain't understand it? Tell this game evolved, I'm from the Hills (from the heels)
Vallejo, Cali-hari to H-I double L (biatch)

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function

Don’t compare me to niggas, I'm the last of my kind (kind)
Get forever through these bars, ever lastin' my grind (yeah)
If it ain't about money then you wastin' my time (time)
Mix the molly with the liquor now get out of your mind (yeah)
Gotta do this one for the town, it’s town business (ayy)
I don’t even fuck with these clowns, they clown niggas
In the city where the dealers go broke, they turn killers
And all the bad bitches got all the hoes, they like niggas (damn)
In the city where we gon' do broke, we like figures (that's right)
Get that bag then we goin' to work like Jay Bilas (woo)
We out here tryna function, tryna maintain (maintain)
So nigga, don’t judge me, told the judge the same thang (yeah)
So nigga guess who's up in the club with the four nickel? (nickel)
Man, I stay on the point like icicles (Young)
If I die tonight, bring me back at the Coachella ('chella)
Sick and tired of tellin' these hoes I'm that nigga, huh (yeah)

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Hahaha, yeah
Look, got bad bitches, they ratchet (uh, what? Ratchet)
Bet the ding make them sing like an ad-lib (yeah, haha)
And all this money, watch me flip it like a back flip (ha, ha)
I'ma go to work on a pussy, no practice (yeah)
Ha, all my real niggas in the photo (yeah)
Bottles in the air, we don’t care about no hoe, no hoe
Yeah, shout out my nigga D-Lo (yeah)
Girl, I know you want two but I need about three, four
Yeah, pretty girls in the crib (what?)
I know they all models, that’s just how a nigga live (do it)
I'm like whoa, when she do the splits (haha)
And when she throw it back, nigga, don’t act like a bitch
My niggas in the club with the .40
We just showed up with E-40, we like, "What’s happenin', woadie?"
In the function, ain't a competition, killin' opponents
And I be killin' the pussy but this is just for the moment, yikes

[Chorus: Problem, E-40 & French Montana]

Rockin' and rollin' 'til five in the mornin' (haaa)
She poppin' a pill then she bustin' it open (haaa)
Like, bitch, try this, I'm a high risk
A bankroll, 4-5-6 (cha-ching)
She chasin' the 'gnac, with a clip in the MAC
For my Oakland niggas that be pimpin' to rap (haaa)

Kept it in the hood, fuck the mainstream (haaa)
Wrist rocky, I'm talkin' Adrian (haaa)
