Function Lyrics[Intro]
League of Starz
Trend on the beat

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy bitch, try this
Guarantee turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function
[Verse 1: E-40]
We out here tryna function, bitch (Biatch!)
You're fuckin' off my high, get up out my mix
You're messin' up my vibe, I'm tryna get some crevice
Put her in my ride, take her to the Ritz
I'm toasted and sloppy, off of broccoli Bacardi
151 out my body, about that green like wasabi
Like Young Bari, we mobby, we bossin', back the fuck off me
Getting money my hobby, not getting money is not (Not getting money is not)
Only rappers I listen to is E-40 and Pac (E-40 and Pac)
I'm having my revenue, playa havin' this guap
I'm on my fly big nigga shit, man I stay laced and groomed
I spray myself with sucka repellent my nigga, not perfume
Anything you got I can sell it, a hustler think I can't
Gift of gab, sell the White House black paint
Word Candy, S-L-A-N-G
I'm thinkin 'bout takin' a million dollar insurance policy out on my mouthpiece
Biatch!

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy bitch, try this
Guarantee turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function

Right, yeah, haha, yeah
Ayy bitch, okay bitch
It's Uncle Earl and the HBK bitch
Mention the gang, they already know that we ballin'
I'm coming straight out the Rich, I got family down in New Orleans
Where you from? You say you're lying out here, we say that you jawsin'
You probably thought this never would happen, my niggas been called that
Alcoholic when sippin' that liquor, oh I'm drunk as hell
Fuckin' with a lil bitch over in Vallejo
Got a whole pack of pre-rolled young L's
And I'm never down to uno, pockets on sumo
Haters respect the pedigree, baller heavily
A phony homie, I never be for methamphetamine
That means it's crack ho, young G, hotter than Tabasco
I smash hoes, collect two hunnid and pass GO
My flow so Lamborghini, yo shit's so Rav 4
Now you understand why everything I do I gas ho
Suzy, nigga

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy bitch, try this
Guarantee turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function
[Verse 3: YG]
I’m out here tryna function, out here tryna function
Don't talk to me bitch if we ain't fuckin'
Yeah I'm a asshole, I don't give a fuck though
Skip the bullshit like, "What's up with some suck though?"
Tell a girl with too much, make you bitch choose up
Niggas getting mad, nigga what you gon' do?
If he think he too tough, you know I keep two tucked
If I don’t fight that mean I'm comin' back to shoot
Ridin' in the car, lookin' for a bad bitch
With some ass and tits, yeah she gotta be dumb cute
Got her number, text her phone like “Baby what you doin'?"
She was like, "Nothing much, you should come through"
I got dick for days, I got dick for days
Made her take off her work and gave her dick for days
Push it to my brain, to my temple bitch
And I don’t like these hoes, I give 'em dick and dip, whoop

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy bitch, try this
Guarantee turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin' man
We out here tryna function12Embed
