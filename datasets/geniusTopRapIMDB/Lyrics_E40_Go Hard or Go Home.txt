Go Hard or Go Home Lyrics[Intro]
Introducin (E-40) the almighty, 7-0-7
(Rick Rock, The Federation) We in the buildin, WAHHHH!
Go go go go go go go go go, hey, hey
(Go hard.. go hard.. go hard.. go hard)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh! Verbal vomit, I keep it one-hundred (one-hundred)
Dr. Scrill but you can call me E-bonics (Ebonics)
Sideshows goin nutty dumbin out
Take the wrong turn and get your roof stomped out (roof stomped out)
Old school vans doors open, me and my crew(uh)
We some stoners we get high like Shaggy from Scooby Doo (Shaggy!)
I'm whiskeyed, I'm hit, I ain't go no patience
Pimp and I'm a couple of tacos short of a combination (uhhh)
Get on yo' head like a shower from the gravel
Where them scandalous dope deals be goin sour
Recount, swivel, Gold Medal Flour
Want the fast quarter, fuck a slow nickel, six bucks an hour ($6 an hour?)
From the rooter to the tooter he's the driver, I'm the shooter
Don't be fuckin with my Gouda (with my gouda)
Ballergasms, side pots, and trill phones
Sidekicks and ringtones {​*T-Mobile ring*}​ go hard or go home (go home)
[Chorus]
Go hard or go home, go hard {​*repeat 7X*}​
Go hard or go home

[Verse 2: Goldie Gold]
From the womb to the moon I-coon like eyes bruise
My goons take no prisoners, what fool?
What's beef?  -- Beef is when E-40 own a Fat Burger
Swing 'em in the drive-through, smashed get further
Cattin' off, if you from the Yay, that's North
Open up the do's, go (go) four on low
Parvo, he's sick, monkey on my back
Psychos all on milk, won't let me go
Down my throat, yes (yes), cuz (cuz), buzz (buzz)
What (what), I (I), go (go), numb (numb)
Slap hoes like Droop beats
Put in thumb, run it back like Rick on the MPC - go hard

[Chorus]
Go hard or go home, go hard {​*repeat 7X*}​
Go hard or go home

[Interlude: E-40]
(Like I did it, originally)
We jumpin on the top of your scrape-ella deuce
Three or four niggas tryin to cave in your roof
You might also like[Verse 3: Stressmatic]
Little purple, cuss like a sailor
Hammer on my waist, Tim the Toolman Taylor
Get rich, hate bein po'
Cause my bitch keep askin for juicy couture
In the club, you know we strapped up
My white tee shirt look like coke wrapped up
Forces and jeans, can't wear slacks
Got good hair, no wave cap
So block, standin on the curb
Same niggas with me I been knowin since the 3rd
Tryin to get it, sucks bein bummy
("Never shoulda gave you niggas money!" - Dave Chappelle)

[Doon]
Bop B's, cross T's, drop H's
Grind more than Haitians or Jamaicans
Ain't about money then ain't got patience
Don't bring money then don't have relations (what else?)
Some like Hannibal, I'm a mammal
Hang with monkeys like Mike and Emmanuel
Change the channel, rearrange panels
Oh-seven like the perm on cavi
Your bitch babby, she don't bring patties
She can't ride shotgun in the Brougham Caddy
Put my nigga in, let him campaign
If you don't cut him off like Jay did Dame (I go hard)
[Chorus]
Go hard or go home, go hard {​*repeat 7X*}​
Go hard or go home

[Outro]
