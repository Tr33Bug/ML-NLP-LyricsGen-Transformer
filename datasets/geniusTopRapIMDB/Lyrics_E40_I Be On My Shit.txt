I Be On My Shit Lyrics[Chorus:]
Dat nigga so whack, why you fuckin wid a nigga like dat
Where you got dat nigga from, you need to take dat nigga back
She be in da club tryna fuck wid a nigga like me, yeah
Cause I be on ma shit, ain’t never low key yeah
I be on ma shit, I be on ma-I be on ma shit[x4]
I be on ma shit

[Verse 1:]
I stay strapped, in case I gotta lay a bitch nigga flat
Jus cause I rap, don’t think that I won’t bust my gap
I’m a thug from d mud, an I’ll play that sucka shit mad
Real niggz show me love, an bitches want my last name
I rather hang wid a broke real nigga than a fake rich nigga
Fools show dem true colours when they off dat liquor
I was raised in d trenches wit d grimeys an hittaz
Posted on the af wid a mouth full a spittaz
Talk bout the OGs neva let a hoe make us enemies
I’m solid as a oak tree, neva fallen off like loose leaves
[Chorus]

(Focus on ma fetti yo)

[Verse 2:]
Turned to d max, dabs a dat OG wax
Countin dese stacks, runnin game on a bitch like laps
I like to get fucked up, loaded an keyed off weed, mayne
D nigga bitch shows up, now she fuckin wit me now
If she knew better, she’ll do better an get rid a dat square ass cubicle
He’s featherweight, I’m a heavyweight, jewellry louder dan a musical
Ridin in summin foreign, she tired a him he borin
So I’m pullin up in dat Phantom, an ma ugly ass look handsome
Speakers throwin a tanrum, money like Richard Branson
Alcohol in ma hands (hands), cheers like Ted Danson
Congatulatin an celebratin, thanks for all d hatin
He asked too many questions mayne that nigga might be cakin'
