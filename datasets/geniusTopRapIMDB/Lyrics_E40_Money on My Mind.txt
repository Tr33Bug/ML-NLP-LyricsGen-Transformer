Money on My Mind Lyrics[Chorus: Bosco]
Money Money Money Money
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo

[Verse 1: E-40]
Money on my mind on my grind tryna catch a break
Gorilla for the scrilla, an ape about my cake
The rap game dont work I'm back to pushin selling weight
Got a family to feed, gotta put some food up on their plate
Sippin this jack and smoking this cali green turtle
Trying to relax and overcome obsticals and hurdles
Haters wanna hold me back because im solid and i'm laced
But if you spit in the wind, its gonna blow right back in your face
Bosses love me, lames don't like me
I don't want them around me anyway like poison ivy
I ain't in the way I'm out the way, but please don't try me
Throw a thread at me ? taking it lightly
Be careful what you wish for karma's a bitch
They shot him at 5 but he died at six
I'd rather be judged by 12 than to be carried by 6
What kind of ammo did they use?  5.56
[Chorus: Bosco]
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo

[?]
I've gotta get that to them
Revenue is dreamin and you know i'm never losing
Got money on my mind, big bank is on my brain
I keep on counting currency but I will never change

[Verse 2: E-40]
The more I teach them, the dumber I get
I keep it lit light a spliff, rub two sticks
I ain't soup and salad, I'm souper salad
Got more homies and prison than I do in college
Zoom zooms and wam wams, wam wams and zoom zooms
Every other week I'm in the visitng room
Dominos and pinochle, talking hella shit
? reposing, taking family flicks
Never hustle backwards, always hustle forward
Never live above your means, buy things you can't afford
I ain't shallow I'm deep, I will not sleep
Can't 7 days, can't be weak
Never get on the stand and speak when you're in the hot seat
Never play for give, always play for keep
There's enough money for all of us to get
We the cheese cheddar, weak when we separate but we stronger together

[?]
I've gotta get that to them
Revenue is dreamin and you know i'm never losing
Got money on my mind, big bank is on my brain
I keep on counting currency but I will never change

[Verse 3: E-40]
Bill collectors calling all day and night
Make me want to jump through the phone and take flight
I ain't paying shit, you get it when I got it
I'm about to spend this money at this motherfucking party
Bad bitches in the function and I gotta do me
Last night I hit two, tonight I'm trying to hit three
Make them buy me a room at the double tree
I've go the liquor, the condoms, and the broccoli
Bitch!

[Chorus: Bosco]
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I I've got money on my mind ooooooooo2Embed
