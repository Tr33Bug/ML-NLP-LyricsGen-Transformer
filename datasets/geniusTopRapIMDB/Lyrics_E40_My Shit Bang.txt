My Shit Bang Lyrics[Intro]
(To-to-t-tone Bone beats)
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Turn my-turn my music up, turn my music up
Turn my-turn my music up, turn my music up
Turn my music up, turn my music up
My shit bang, my shit bang
My shit bang, my-my shit bang
Nigga, my shit bang, my shit bang
My-my shit bang, my-my shit
Bang, bang, bang
My shit bang, nigga, my shit bang
My shit bang, nigga, my shit bang
Bang, bang, bang, nigga
Bang, bang, bang, bang
[Verse 1]
My shit bang, my shit throb
I'm a motherfucking beast, I'm a motherfucking hog
Pull up with the slump
Or should I say black truck
Sounding like I got a alligator in the back
Paint wetter than melted ice
Ralley and hockey stripes
Burning rubber at every light
Mean mugging like 'fuck ya life'
I be hustling all day and night
Pushing all night and day
Twisted and whipping yay
Getting my guapalay
Chalupa, my Gouda my pay
When I get in my way
From da Bay to L.A. to the A this nigga connected
Worldwide nigga this fixture have you beheaded
You ain't gotta like me but you gotta respect it
Woke up early in the morning and put one in the air
Got so high, thought about running for mayor
Slap myself, to make sure I was still there
Shit, showered, and shaved and then I cut my hair
Today I'm tryna get laid then put a pounding on the monkey
Tryna find me a bitch with an ass like a World Star hiphop bunny
Tryna get rich in this, collect and stack my money
You can tell that I'm a D-boy by my baller tummy
Sometimes I dress uppity
Sometimes I dress scummy
Sometimes I dress high class
Sometimes I dress bummy
If it ain't about no cash you can miss me
Most of the time you can find this hustler tipsy
Biatch! (Biatch!)

[Verse 2]
Uhh! I been running around all day try'na get my decimals up (Up)
Anybody that try to stop me I suggest that they duck (duck)
Cause when I get the bucket I can assure you it's nothing pleasant (nothin' pleasant)
My arsenal game is east but the west with all kinda of weapons
Even if you're wearing chest protection a trauma plate won't work (it won't work)
Cause I'm a aim at your helmet
I ain't goin aim at you shirt
A lot of these bitch ass niggas should be wearing a skirt
With a box of Motrin and some maxi pads in they purse
Pillow talking and biting pillows
Acting like some brizzles
Cause they're a whole bunch of that sucka shit a bunch of popsicles
I should of been a taurus cause I'm stubborn as a bull
I'm a different type of dude and I stick to the rules
I'm a real nigga best believe it
I live it and I breathe it
I tell it like it is and I call it how I see it
My potna used to be all sharp but now he on fee-fee
'What do fee-fee mean?"
Methamphetamine
I can't believe it, man, he disappointed me
I'm devastated, mayne, he lost coo' points with me
I'm standing outside of my crib with some gym shorts and a hoody
Talking to my nig on the celly smoking a philly
Sipping on a fifth of that oil cognac henny
A hundred wall on them bricks, he got caught with a key of candies
If you didn't go to jail by now he probably be dead
So instead he in there with his uncle, his daddy, and relatives
Uhh!
[Hook]
