[Verse 1]
Against all odds, weathered the storm
Built for combat and battle, young hyenas in uniforms
We play no games with the opposition, we active
Let the whistle be the bell we gon' get down
What we got mad at
Many have tried, but many have failed
The 49ers got the livest fans in the NFL
I tried to told 'em we back, and we never left, and we got heart
Levi's Stadium startin' to feel like Candlestick Park (uh oh)

[Verse 2]
Gold-blooded, my neck is frozen with diamonds
Front Row 40 be on the field with the linemen big timin (Fixture)
Niner Faithful old school like an Impala
Ask Merton Hanks, and the homie Ricky Watters (Take a picture)
Them was my neighbors in '96
RIP Dwight Clark, The Catch (Legendary)
I’m a Niner forever like Rice and Lott (Don’t forget TO)
Niner Empire until the world pop

[Chorus]
Who are we?
Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)
Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)
Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)

Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)
Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)
Bang bang Niner Gang (Niner Gang)
Bang bang Niner Gang (NINER GANG)
