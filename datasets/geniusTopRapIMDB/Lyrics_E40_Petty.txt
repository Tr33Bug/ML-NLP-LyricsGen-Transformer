[Verse 1: E-40]
Most of these bitches is petty (frivolous)
I'm handling my scrill and my fetti (privileges)
Only smoke gas, not no reggie (power)
Broccoli, organic veggies (sour)
Send him to hell not to heaven
Go through the Teflon FN57
Somebody call the ambulambs and the reverend
Teach a fuck nigga a valuable lesson
Scorpio thats my astrology (Forty!)
My Rover a autobiography (story)
Oyster perpetual presi (Ching!)
VS's all up in my bezi (Bling!)
Punk rock bitch, gold digging hoe
All up in the function with your best friend's clothes
Always starting something, you a messy ass hoe
Lil groupie ass bitch on the stage at the shows
As far as these niggas they petty too (irrelevant)
They hate on real niggas like me and you (relevant)
They jealous, conniving, and sneaky (sheisty)
Donâ€™t wanna be them, wanna be me (icy)
See me on TV, all over the net
They heart full of envy, butthurt and upset
They pockets is pennies, my pockets a check
You say you my enemy, I'm on your neck

Most of these bitches is petty
Most of these bitches is petty
Most of these bitches is petty
Most of these bitches is petty

Most of these bitches is petty

Most of these bitches is petty
Petty, petty, petty, petty, petty
Petty, petty, petty, petty, petty
Petty, petty, petty, petty
Most of these bitches is petty

[Verse 2:  Kamaiyah]
Awww shit
I guess I'm the one that they hate now
You bitches is played out
I made it, ain't got shit to say now
You bitches is spaced out
I made my own way out the Bay now
So my crib is way out
You bitches still riding the Greyhound
I pull up in Wraiths now
I got big money, all facts
Petty bitches can fall back
Got a Benz, yeah, I bought that
And I been the shit, yeah, I'm all that
Long money, I got tall stacks
I can stand on it, I can land on it
I got bands homie, rubber bands on it
Yeah, I got here 'cause I planned on it
I'm the realest chick to ever do this shit
From the West Coast, now I run this shit
I'm the same one that y'all keep on talking 'bout
But ain't fuckin wit'
Speak on me but the talk is cheap
'Cause y'all sneak dissing on some sucka shit
Kamaiyah be my name, hoe
When you speak on me, say my government
Don't be petty, bitch
[Hook]
