Savage Lyrics[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pulled up in the drop with a bad bitch
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
Pocket full of cash bitch, I'm rich
'Cause I'm a savage
Treat a bad bitch like she average
All up in her face with a bad bitch
See a new chick, try to bag it
'Cause I'm a savage

[Verse 1: E-40]
I was born with a rusty spoon
Now I'm a tycoon
I've been drinkin' all afternoon
Ain't finna stop, no time soon
Bad bitches matter
She want me to scoop her up like a spatula
She wanna get attached like an adapter
She think I'm a trash compactor, she want me to smash her
I'm a savage about my cabbage
All my life I been mannish
Establish practice what I preach
A barbarian, I'm a beast
Know how to maneuver in these streets
How to wiggle, get to the Gouda
Straight shooter
I'm super solid from the rooter to the tooter
Cali-foo-ya'll do ya
Don't let the palm trees fool you
They play with street instruments
And they'll bring the noise like a tuba
Pushin' the mainey life, travel the planet
Hard made the granite
Tax a bitch like a W-9
Bitch I'm a savage
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pulled up in the drop with a bad bitch
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
Pocket full of cash bitch, I'm rich
'Cause I'm a savage
Treat a bad bitch like she average
All up in her face with a bad bitch
See a new chick, try to bag it
'Cause I'm a savage

[Verse 2: Jazze Pha]
Y'all motherfuckers really need to hol' up
Phizzle got the hoes like controlla
Open my pockets, they swole up
Everywhere we go motherfuckers know us
Bitch you don't know nobody like me
I know your boyfriend wanna fight me
But you droppin' that ass on my IG
In the club, makin' movie like Spike Lee
Pull out with a Carlo
Nigga lookin' like, "Who did it?"
At the telly with the door closed
From the back like, "Who's is it?"

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pulled up in the drop with a bad bitch
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
Pocket full of cash bitch, I'm rich
'Cause I'm a savage
Treat a bad bitch like she average
All up in her face with a bad bitch
See a new chick, try to bag it
'Cause I'm a savage

If I'ma do it, I'ma run through it by tonight
Yellow bitch super thick in that all white
Ass so fat, need a lap dance
Maybe later on I'ma give her pipe
I'm the type to get it in the ladies room
Bathroom stall by the toilet paper
And she can make it to the green room
It's goin' down in the elevator
Trust me, touch me, she fuck with B-Le
Work the day shift, she tuck my heater
Savage 'bout mine, we smoke the ether
Put her in a Uber, I don't trust her either
Pull up in a drop with a rocket on
B-Lit smokin' jello outta loud bag
If she ever out of pocket homie
They ain't just somethin' you can pimp past

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Pulled up in the drop with a bad bitch
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
Pocket full of cash bitch, I'm rich
'Cause I'm a savage
Treat a bad bitch like she average
All up in her face with a bad bitch
See a new chick, drop the baggage
'Cause I'm a savage
Pulled up in the drop with a bad bitch
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
Pocket full of cash bitch, I'm rich
'Cause I'm a savage
Treat a bad bitch like she average
All up in her face with a bad bitch
See a new chick, try to bag it
'Cause I'm a savage
'Cause I'm a savage
'Cause I'm a savage3Embed
