Slappinâ€™ Lyrics[Hook: D.R.A.M]
This motherfuckin' 'gnac
Got me not knowing how to act
Bout to fuck on this bitch in the back
Yeah, get her ass fuckin' slapped
Yeah, and this motherfucker slap
Aye, aye, said this motherfucker slap
It's slappin
Said this motherfucker slap
What's happenin'?
Said this motherfucker slap
[Verse 1: E-40]
I got the mouthpiece of a ventriloquist
When I'm talking business, I barely move my lips
I don't want no suckers and counterfeits in my mix
I don't want them around me, I don't need 'em
If you find a real one like me, tell 'em I want to meet 'em
It all depends on how you breed 'em
And who they come up under
Your plug might be jealous cause you took his thunder
Let him know you recognize him as a factor
One of the rules of power, never outshine the master
Sluricane in my cup, category fifth
All on SnapChat, taking hell of flicks
Some of my fellas is sober, some of 'em smoking dope
Some of my fellas is older, some too young to vote
Rapper now but used to be a dealer (a dealer)
Got enough paper to have your best friend kill you
Release the silent ones up in the Benz
(What you yelling?)
I'm yellin' "real nigga over everything"

[Hook: D.R.A.M]
This motherfuckin' 'gnac
Got me not knowing how to act
Bout to fuck on this bitch in the back
Yeah, get her ass fuckin' slapped
Yeah, and this motherfucker slap
Aye, aye, said this motherfucker slap
It's slappin
Said this motherfucker slap
What's happenin'?
Said this motherfucker slap

Homeboy bought a rollie and his shit get taken
Invisible sets, rockin' like my shit went missing
When the ice hit the light, it twinkle and glisten
If my shooter get shot, then I'mma finish his mission
Currently on my second tour ever, this feels like heaven
They calling me the dude no Devin it's for my sevens
I'ma ride if I'm summoned, I abide by nothin'
I'm my own damn boss, I can put you onto something
And on tuesdays I'm rocking with my Uzi
Slappin' dumb hard tryna knock me off a Toupee
Yolo whippin' and product reppin' Crest Toothpaste
I flip a coin and take a life just like I'm two face
Elevated on my high horse now can't come down
My achievements speak loud I'mma lil' child
Water hit me on my cellular, like look Neffy knock this out
I need that blapper shit that slapper shit
Tryna blow a speaker out

[Verse 3: E-40]
Aye, aye, learn about it
Having so much money it takes me two weeks to count it
Baby girl got kicks, make her booty shake, she got talent
Hit it from the back, her knees shake and  she lose her balance
Woah, woah, hold up, thirty-six, twenty-four, she a double D cup
Doing splits on the floor, bust it open in the club
All them bitches jealous cause niggas showing you love
Popping my collar, drinking my drink, and making my presence known
Vanille Tobacco Tom Ford cologne I got on
You can tell by the way I carry myself I'mma star
These Cartier buffs my face cost more than your car
From a dollar man to a millionaire they stop and stare
Look at my IG, I'm everywhere
That and they just be liking on me cause they know I'm the guy, guy
Blowing this tree put it in the air like wifi
