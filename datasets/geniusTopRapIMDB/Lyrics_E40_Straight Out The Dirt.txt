Straight Out The Dirt Lyrics[Chorus: JPZ]
I went from nothin' to somethin'
I had to make the shit work
Came up from nothin'
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt

[Verse 1: E-40]
My granddaddy helped build the Carquinez Bridge
Gave my grandmama eleven kids
A gallon of milk and some eggs in the fridge
A pack of Top Ramen some bread and some grits
I got it straight out the dirt (the dust)
Checkin' more cash than a clerk (that's us)
Play with me you will get hurt (I'll bust)
I'll put a hole in your shirt (whoa)
The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin', I'm drillin'
Anybody that wanna stop me makin' millions (whoa)
The longer the barrel, the stronger the bullet, the trigger
I'll pull it, I'll have your family in their feelin's
One foot on the strineets, one hand on the bible
I pray for my frenemies, pray for my rivals
Got trademarks and entities, licenses, businesses
No female tendencies, niggas is bitches
From the concrete streets to the golf course (golf course)
When I'm in L.A. I'm at the Waldorf (Waldorf)
If I'm in the mood for an entr√©e
Napa Valley reservations at The French Laundry
Free all my people in the belly of the beast (of the beast)
Pay the tithes to my church and my priest (and my priest)
In the box, in the cage in the bing (in the bing)
If I went to jail I won't sing (I won't sing)
Biatch!
[Chorus: JPZ]
I went from nothin' to somethin'
I had to make the shit work
Came up from nothin'
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt

[Chorus 2: JPZ & E-40]
I played in the mud (I play in the mud)
No stain on my shirt (no stain on my shirt)
I'm whippin' the pot (I'm whippin' the pot)
I'm cookin' the work (uhhhhh)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt

[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
Whole lotta money, you know who it is
I ain't got to speak on the shit that I did
I got it straight up out the mud like a pig
Fuck police, no respect for the pigs
On the stage steady screamin' "Free Jig"
I go crazy every time that I hit
Send my yougin's for to break in your crib
I pay 'em double, just send me the bricks
Shooter like Scottie I ain't talkin' Yo Gotti
That white full of low I'm gonna come where it is
Get out yo body we gon' split your wig
I ain't no rabbit, them tricks for them kids
.40 and that Glock, I still walk with that sig
Ain't who he claim to be and I can see it
I'm who he wanna be but he can't be it
These niggas be dissin' but no I don't hear it
My youngin' that youngin' off Good Fellas
He don't got no name, he a cold stepper
I spent them racks on some Margielas
I signed my deal up in blood letters
My Cuban link half a kilo
Bitch so heavy I could use it as a weapon
All us getting' money
Nothin' but OG's thuggin' in my section
You might also like[Chorus: JPZ]
I went from nothin' to somethin'
I had to make the shit work
Came up from nothin'
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt

[Chorus 2: JPZ & E-40]
I played in the mud (I play in the mud)
No stain on my shirt (no stain on my shirt)
I'm whippin' the pot (I'm whippin' the pot)
I'm cookin' the work (uhhhhh)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I was gettin' out the mud
I put the hood on flood
I was bumpin' Danny Glover in the Chevy
I put the hood on thug
I put your hood on wet-wet
I put your life on the set-set
I put your goons on bedrest
I haven't lost a war yet
Anniversary to vets
Z06 with the pipes
My young bitch from the Bay
Pussy good, hella tight
Head stupid, hella tight
Slow it down, yellow light
She suck the dick like it's a contest
And thinks she's Scarface on that white
Matte white, white on white Rover
Bitch, I'm the plug like Sosa
Got loud weed, strong odor
Pay the plug up front, don't owe him
All four, got rich shit happened and I fell off
I ain't fall, stay down, runnin' up got a bill off
What I do?
I went from not havin' shit to havin' shit
Niggas sayin' I should write a tell-all
[Chorus: JPZ]
I went from nothin' to somethin'
I had to make the shit work
Came up from nothin'
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt

[Chorus 2: JPZ & E-40]
I played in the mud (I play in the mud)
No stain on my shirt (no stain on my shirt)
I'm whippin' the pot (I'm whippin' the pot)
I'm cookin' the work (uhhhhh)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt (straight out the dirt)
I got it straight out the dirt2Embed
