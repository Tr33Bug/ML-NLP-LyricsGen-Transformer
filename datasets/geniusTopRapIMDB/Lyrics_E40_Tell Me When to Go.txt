Tell Me When to Go Lyrics[Chorus]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from
[Chorus]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I'm off that 18 dummy juice
Nigga, Raggaman, labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super duper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
Pipey in your wifey, you don't like me
(Like me, like me, like me, like me)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet blunt, orange lace
(Let's go, it's dope) It's just some shit I wrote
My city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas with the bitches at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy
1800, Jose Cuervo
Yadadamean? Yadada I'm saying though?
You might also like[Chorus]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Outro: E-40]
Now let me direct traffic for a minute
(talk to 'em)
Now, let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the Bay
When I say something you say it right back to me, you smell me?
We're gonna do it like this right here
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Now gas, brake, dip, dip
Gas, brake, dip, dip
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Now thizz face, thizz face
Thizz face, thizz face
Doors open, mayne
Doors open, mayne
Doors open, mayne
Doors open, mayne
Now watch em swang, watch em swang
Now watch em swang, watch em swang
Go stupid, go dumb, dumb
Go stupid, go dumb, dumb
[Chorus]
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb11Embed
