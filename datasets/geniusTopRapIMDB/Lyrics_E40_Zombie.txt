Zombie Lyrics[Chorus]
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fi-
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Lynch, E-40
It's that season of the sickness, you're witnessing nigga sittin' spin
I'mma get you addicted when I spit shit, venomous shit, shit again
Shit so much I gotta go to Costco to get my toilet paper
Hit so much, spit so much, grip the pistol up, I'm a skitzo nut
Zeppo rape or keep her safe or he could take her
Chill pill, real deal, kill bill
I might be sick, but that ain't the reason that I still spit real ill
Niggas ain't got no lyrics when I hear it I'm like, "What's up with that?"
Everybody wanna copy me, so I'm choppin' 'em up, leave rotten meat
I'mma be drama free like my momma be
Suicide before I let a nigga ride on me, that ain't comedy
I don't get, I don't have to get it
Mini AK, I call him midget
And he got a sister heatin' 'em up, makin' his skin blister
I'm a monster you're a zombie
[Chorus]
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fi-
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend

[Verse 2: E-40]
I'm lookin' out the window and it's thundering and lightning
2 in the afternoon the sky is black and it's frightening
They're howling, lurking and prowling, growling
Back we're smiling, crowding around my place
Gimme forty feet and a ounce of space
'Fore I bust you in the face with thumper (thumper)
Pack three guns like a hunter (hunter)
Kick a nigga ass like a punter (punter)
Beat a muthafucka like a drummer (drummer)
Base play crazy, half a hate a hazy
Floor game like the Gracie's
I'm a monster, I'm a fiend on the microphone
Welcome to my twilight zone, play me foul get tombstoned
Send you to hell where you belong
Gonna wish you had a muthafuckin snow cone, no coat on
I got the wickedest flow
Serve a muthafucka take-out to go
Send a hubba head to a sucka front door
Lynch and 40 Water, Nina in this ho

If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fi-
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie see your lovin' every way Tech, Lynch and 40 sing
See ya gotta be conscious of what it means
Then I know that you're ready for what it brings
Do you know what I mean when I say Caribou Lou?
Then you're tellin' me Tech Nina go ahead and do you?
Do ya never get enough of Nina and you listen when you with the crew?
KC tea, you knowin' just what it do
Your ass probably startin' to mosh pit
Lovin' every minute of bangin' this boss shit
You throwin' up your set around all cliques
You never wanna be hangin' with a soft bitch
You know who you are muthafuckas

[Chorus]
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie
If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend3Embed
