2 Hard Muthaâ€™s Lyrics[Intro]
Eazy-E: Yo Dre, where's the goddamn drum machine?
Dr. Dre: Ah shit, I left the motherfucker with Pooh
Eazy-E: You dumb motherfucker what the fuck we gon' do now?
Dr. Dre: I don't know
Yella: Hey man I got some drums in the back
Dr. Dre: What the fuck is he talking bout
MC Ren: Do we look like we can play some fucking drums?
Yella: Man I can play the drums
Everyone: Bullshit!
Yella: Man I used to fuck it up at Compton High
Eazy-E: You motherfucking high
MC Ren: You fat guy
Yella:  Bullshit!
MC Ren: Give this nigga some sticks
*Drum roll*
MC Ren: Yo, fuck it up Yella
[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Yo we're two hard motherfuckers
Taking out any punk ass suckers
Can you believe this? if so be frightened
We're strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
Setting a mark of destruction, get it
So don't front, and say you ain't with it
You wanna rumble with us you can't hang
Because we're something like a two man gang
Starting some shit is what we do best
Just care about ourself and say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy (wassup), bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid motherfuckers the deal

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
I look you dead in the eye then I spit (yeah)
I tell you to your face punk you ain't shit (you ain't shit)
I don't give a god damn about feelings
I'm just happy just as long as I'm killing
A 187's in progress, nigga
Just as soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic heavily, I start firing
And the kids on the block, I'm the one they're admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and I'ma bust your lip
Now who you gonna tell that I'm making you soft?
The police ain't shit 'cause I'm paying 'em off
I move slow, always ready to go so fuck it (so fuck it)
And bitches on my dick, they know that they can suck it
I'm a hardhead, always having a fit
When I'm not allowed to tear up shit
I'm a hard motherfucker (I'm hard motherfucker)

[Verse 3: MC Ren & Eazy-E]
Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch
With a gangster profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck
To a pussy ass fool trying to press his luck
I'm ready to scrap that's if you're ready to go
I'll take you out going toe to toe
E will start a conversion and hit you from the back
While you getting fucked up by a ruthless jack
Critical condition is what you receive
Thinking of some back up to go and retrieve
But Eazy tell what would happen my man
They would get fucked up by a ruthless clan
So it's simple, we don't give a fuck, right?
So you and your boy can get the fuck out my sight
I'm on tilt with class getting ready to blast
Cause I'm a hard motherfucker

[Hook]
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
[Verse 4: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Eazy and Ren is fucking it up again
Scheming up a plot before we begin
Because niggas like to stare like a bitch sometimes
They say how could them niggas have some hell of a rhymes
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
When the two baddest motherfuckers step on the scene
Now this is some shit - Yo what are you saying
You stupid motherfuckers, they think I'm playing
Talking all kind of shit but I'm cracking it up
I can afford to laugh 'cause I'm backing it up
I'm not a buster I'm more like a hitman
So if you don't wanna throw then you can get down
You don't like the fuck away from me
So you can stop the shit, trying to fuck the E

[Verse 5: MC Ren & Eazy-E]
You heard what he said and it's the truth so whats up
So if you want me to go well I'm about to nut up
The two baddest motherfuckers alive
So I don't think that you and your boys can survive
You got a girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the ho
A train was in effect and your bitch was rocked
By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop
Yo Ren lets jet let's get the fuck on out
Because everybody knows what we're talking about
We're two hard motherfuckers

[Hook]
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers

[Outro: MC Ren]
Like that like that
Break it down again, come on Yella, break it down
Can I get a another roll (one time)
It little simple for you
Break it down to break shine
Let me get a funky roll right here
Aight on the 3, on the 2
Ah yeah, here we go y'all, break it down on the 1
Here we go, let me get a funky roll right here
Two times, two time, two time..2Embed
