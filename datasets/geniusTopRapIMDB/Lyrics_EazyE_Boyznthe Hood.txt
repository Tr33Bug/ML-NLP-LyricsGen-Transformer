Boyz-n-the Hood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

[Chorus]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
[Scratches]
Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that bass!
Mothafucker, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucka dead, LA Times front page

[Chorus]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue
You might also like[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

[Chorus]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way
[Verse 4]
I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said "Oh, brother."
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

[Chorus]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
L.A. playa
Big Drum Beater

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
"Disruption of the court," said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "Fire!", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

[Chorus]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Get busy, y'all!
Aw
You mothafucker!44Embed
