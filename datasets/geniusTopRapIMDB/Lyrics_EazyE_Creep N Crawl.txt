Creep N Crawl Lyrics[Intro]
Straight off the streets of mothafuckin' Compton
It's the downest nigga I know
Eazy mothafuckin' me
'Bout to kick your ass in '93
Yeah
(Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood)
Yeah
(Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood)

[Hook]
I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl, creep, creep
I said I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl, creep, creep
I got my niggas from Grape Street, Watts
I got my niggas from the C-P-T
I got my niggas all across the mothafuckin' land
That's down with the E-A-Z-Y-E
[Verse 1]
Now, early in the mornin' I awake
Thinkin' about this dead fool's life that I had to take
Frontin' on a true name, I peep game at point-blank range
Fuck 'em! (Mothafuckin' right, y'all)
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin' a fuck about the nigga that I wet
That's what he gotta shout for actin' like a trick
Now he's six feet and I'm deep in his bitch
Creepin', creepin', creepin' on the marks that be sleepin'
Catch you slippin', slap the clip in, buck 'em every weekend
A scandalous lil' nigga with no heart to feel remorse
Dig the nigga's corpse, leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a fuck about shit, that's why I'm mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the Devil
A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a
Nigga full of lead, 'cause I'm a mothafuckin' killer
Thrilla from Manila, though I'm shorter than the average
Try to test yo' luck and get bucked by a mothafuckin' savage

[Bridge]
Yeah
(Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood)
Yeah
(Creep with me, as I crawl through the hood)

I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl, creep, creep
I said, I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl, creep, creep
I got my niggas from Grape Street, Watts
I got my niggas from the C-P-T
I got my niggas all across the mothafuckin' land
That's down with the E-A-Z-Y-E

[Verse 2]
Now, later on that night as I'm rollin'
Lookin' for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin' at a light on the late night
Fire up a Philly blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin' at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin' is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive-through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the '4, yo
Smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for who was fool, make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome, now he sleeps
One shot to the top, body flopped on the seat, peep
I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin' in a rage, so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about five blocks
Before I got stopped by a punk-ass cop (Shit, fuck 'em!)
(You can't shoot a cop!)
Fuck you *shots*
Motherfucker, ha-ha-ha!
[Hook]
I creep and I crawl and I creep
I creep and I crawl and I creep
I creep and I crawl and I creep
I creep and I crawl and I creep

[Outro]
(Creep with me)
Yeah
(Creep with me)
Yeah
(Creep with me)
Yeah
(Creep with me)
Yeah, ha ha ha ha!8Embed
