Down 2 tha Last Roach Lyrics[Dr. Dre:]
"I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess."
Bitch!
[Intro: Eazy-E]
Ah, greetings earthlings
And welcome to the motherfuckin' wonderful
Wonderful, motherfuckin' world of gettin' higher than a motherfucker
Oh me, I'm funk on your mind
Alias to you motherfuckers Roach Clip
And this here is my Kimosabe dumpin' shit on your ass
And my nigga goes by the name of B.G. Ash Trey
And we 3-65, that means we're fucked up all year round
And our motto is:
[Hook]
Gettin' higher than a motherfucker
Down to the laaast roach

[Verse 1: Eazy-E & Dirty Red]
Creepin' through this cloud of smoke
With a little bit of funk to make ya choke in
Gangstas come feel good inside
As we take you for a ride to another dimension
Deep from a 40 OZ
Two crooked ass niggas on a cosmic journey
Straight from the planet G
Where the real niggas dwell in the realms of Ruthless
Took a puff of the indo spliff
High like a bird as I creep to the bud spot
Break me off a proper piece
So I can get fucked up with my nigga Roach Clip
B.G. Ash Tray, dump that ass Dre
Ruthless family, high as you can be
Smoke that psychadelically insane
And gettin' higher than a motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shaki & Eazy-E]
As I step through the smoke
Deep from a land broke niggas don't come to
Straight to Indonesia
Chronic fever
Step off punk, we don't need ya
Blaze a blunt to the boogie
And come take a ride on a journey with a real G
Life is easily explained on a level
Of smokin' bud with the motherfuckin' devil
In my imagination
Sup with these thoughts what a fly creation
Indo smoke from the land of G's
Lettin' them know they can't handle these, niggas
Straight from the planet dime
I have come, to put funk on your mind
Eazy-E better known as Mr. Roach Clip
So pass the bud cause we still gettin' higher than a motherfucker

[Eazy-E]
Now I'm real fucked up yes, high as hell
Ring ding ding do I hear some bells
Or am I just trippin'
Thinkin' about that 4 that I'm dippin'
Front, back, side to side
On corners that's how a nigga gotta ride
Dip to the, dip to the, dip to the back
Bumpin' Eazy-E on 8 track
So blaze up a another skunky, funky, dookie, doobie
So we can get loogied
Up some more, up, up it go
What's my name "Eazy-E", yo, the motherfuckin' bud smokin' loc 'n
When I'm high as a kite causing ruckus, yeah
Gettin' higher than a motherfucker

[Hook]
