Eazy 1, 2, 3 Lyrics[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
A typical street corner ass nigga
Once a nigga, always a nigga, now a public figure
But I can still serve a mothafucka if I have to
Cuz, I'm slanging them thangs, nigga
I roll deep with the crew, oh, a posse (Yeah)
Niggas cuttin' throat, Murder She Wrote for the Eazy-E, fool
Fuck with the veteran, still a better man than the next man
Then again (Uh), I can still put a chrome 9 to your dome
Po' nigga, po' nigga, no Milkbone
Yippie-ki-yay your ass back the fuck on home
Stay the fuck off the sherm and crack and "Just Say No"
[Verse 2: Phalos Mode]
My definition of a bitch nigga, ah shit
Get pistol whipped, need to sit down when he piss
Cause I beat 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, like 1, 2, 3
The legend of gangster rap is Eazy-E
Still gangsta and Ruthless, leaving mothafuckas toothless
I was high as the sky before I drew this
A nigga gone, I guess I see you at the crossroads
A nigga with an attitude, my name Phalos Mode

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
We meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
We meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3

[Verse 3: Loesta]
This where the street meet the radio
And give the love like it s'posed to
Y'all don't want a death in the studio
Another scandal for media to handle (Uh)
Raised my '64, we livin' on the road
Bang, Los Angeles slang
Like a double barrel E pointed right at the game (Haha)
Big Loesta, your SC smoke blower
None fucking with legends, Eazy, where the weapon?
Cash is threatening, kill a cross-over
Jumped in the game and bitches slandered my name
Violence, reporters, the streets out of order (Order)
Projects, corners, and gangsters with four-doors
I hit blocks off a double-shot (Shot)
Show my face on the block, I give a fuck about a cop (Cop)
Male black attitude, nigga, fuck you
Stomping niggas from South Central to Compton

I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
We meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
Wemeet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now, what the fuck is worse than 1 punk nigga? (Nigga)
2 punk niggas, add 'em up and get the picture
One's a fucking fag from the days and one's a busta
I was born a pimp, a mack daddy, and a hustla
You can take the nigga off the street
But you can't take the streets out the nigga
Once a nigga, still a nigga
Fucking hoes and I do mean fucking steadily
I fucked your bitch (Uh), 'cause she was begging me
Your bitch ain't nothin' but a piece of cock to me
She dropped the drawers when she found out I was Eazy
She licked the balls and sucked the dick, I came, heavenly
Ooh, get me ready E, fuck me steadily

[Verse 5: Phalos Mode]
Why these niggas sippin' Haterade? Drinking on bitch Kool-Aid
For the name of Eazy, niggas get sprayed
I'm in my Lowrider, and it's candy-paint
Stash spot for the Glock, nigga think I ain't
I'm with a 5'5 gangsta with skrill
Big paper drill, on the quest for mills
Now everybody say they thuggin'
But when the gun blast, seeing niggas running
I leave no witnesses
[Bridge: Loesta]
Punk niggas always tryna hate and they be always talking shit
But when they sober they all hesitate cause they don't know who they fucking with
Long live real gangsta shit and tell your ho to get off my dick
'Cause we gone finish up the legacy and keep the family so legit

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
We meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
I meet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
Wemeet 'em, treat 'em, fuck 'em, Eazy 1, 2, 3
