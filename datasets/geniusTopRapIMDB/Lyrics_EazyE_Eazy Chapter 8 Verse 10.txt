Eazy Chapter 8 Verse 10 Lyrics[Verse: Eazy-E]
(Alright, go)
This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10, and it reads:
It's time to put some niggas in check
When you shoot a gun, hot shells eject
Catch 'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for fingerprints
You ask why am I like this
'Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it how I know it, just hope the fuck I don't show it
Niggas out frontin', loitering and looting
Let's recreate a drive-by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun, Mack-10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of niggas
It was 9 just like the fuck they figured
Go around the corner come back real slow
Lights off, car's in neutral, rollin' at a snail's pace and creepin'
Hoping to catch all of them sleepin'
A so-called gang, drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all the others jet, 3 of 'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scene, with gunshot wounds
3 dead because Compton is scandalous
I'd like to tell you, brother, ashes to ashes, dust to dust (Amen)
Da da da
(You will now witness the sound of TV Ang-Ang-Angels)
(We will now pass around the hat)
(That's good enough)
No it ain't, you fucked up, you fucked up (it's cool)
No, it ain'tYou might also like4Embed
