Eazy Street Lyrics[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Now I'mma Break it down and tell a story
About a nigga in the wrong territory
Sharon and Shide is who he had to meet
He made a right turn down the wrong street
Now whatta, whatta, whatta, what a pity
A new jack in my motherfuckin' city

Compton that is
They say it's niggas pimpin'
Gangsta limpin'
But back back to the nitty gritty
Bout this nigga slippin' in my fuckin' city
By the time that he realized that he fucked up
The stupid muthafucka got a foot in his ass
Now this is how the story goes
Don't you ever bring your ass
In my neiborhood fuckin' my hoes
Cause they my hoes and I knows
When they've been fucked

"Fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing."
"Doin' it you know."

[Eazy-E]
Now lets get the story about the bitches
And tell how this kid went from right to riches
Now he's drivin' fancy cars gettin' bitches galore
He was a dirty little boy that I knew next door

[Dr. Dre impersonating Mack Romey]
Mack the muthafuckin' Romey
The one and only
My dick's too hard to be lonely

[Eazy-E]
Now this muthafucka braggin' on how
He got all this and that and he got
All these bitches callin' him Big Daddy
Ain't that a bitch how this muthafucka
Get rich on my muthafuckin' street
That's supposed to be my goddamn money
And this bastard is use to wear platform
Shoes, plaid pants and nappy-ass hat under
A fucked up hat now lets kick the story
About that

When the sun falls
And the shit falls down
So when people start comin' around
Knockin' at the door sayin' we want more
And moms wonderin' what the fuck they here for
Rock cocaine, yeah, just as I figured
But he can do that cause he's that nigga
From Eazy Street on the road to riches
Money, cars, houses, and hoes
That's how the story goes
And if the nigga stays up you
Know he can't be beat
All this shit happens on Eazy Street

[Eazy-E]
Now back to the story about the bitches

["About the what?"]

[Eazy-E]
The bitches, the bitches, the bitches yo
