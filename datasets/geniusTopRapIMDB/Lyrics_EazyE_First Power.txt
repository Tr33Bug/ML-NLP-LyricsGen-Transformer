First Power Lyrics[Eazy-E]
"I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me though he die, yet shall re-live. And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Shhhhhhhh, shut up, bitch. Fear not them which kill the body. Rather fear him that's able to destroy both body and soul in hell. Get thee behind me Satan and push me along."

[Satan]
"All this power I will give thee, if thou there for will worship me, all shall be thine."

[Eazy-E]
"Come with me, bitch, as we walk through the door backwards. Heaven in art which father our, our father which art in heaven."
(Hey motherfucker!)
