Folsom Prison Gangtaz Lyrics[Verse 1 - Eazy-E]
Aw yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buddha sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG playaz don't set trip
Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real G funk to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin' love to them playaz that I know is real Gs
[Chorus - Johnny Cash]
When I was just a baby
My mother told me, "Son, always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

[Verse 2 - Eazy-E]
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (Who's that?)
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin' me
And broke groupies and hoochies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I tell it like it straight up is
Before you do a record, partner, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin' on the under
Or you might wonder (What's up with them ends, G?)
I call a spade a spade and get paid
Gs show the way, so I give love to 'em
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Eazy-E]
E-A-Z-Y, must I
Chase the cat and be a dog, a straight up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my record bumpin' on the Compton street
That OG, P-I-M-P and Loc, G and Loc
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cuz I'm the short but wicked playa named Eazy
Women can't play me, some say I'm crazy
But I don't think so, come if you're a loco
I gives a damn about a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
But don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, I got no love for ya

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (That's right fool)
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin' straight dough (Hooooo!)
If you got love for them playas
Let me hear you say ooooh, ladies we want you (Ooooooh!)
If you got love for them straight Gs
And you wanna be down just scream (Heeeeeeey!)1Embed
