Gimmie That Nutt Lyrics[Intro]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
[Verse 1]
It's like that and it's like this
I took her to the pad and we started to kiss
Now my dick's on hard, you know what I'm thinkin'
Took the panties off and the pussy wasn't stinkin'
Pulled off my drawers and we started to begin
Now the pussy's wet so my dick slides in
Oh, Heidi Heidi Heidi you ho
Ridin' from the back so I'm pumpin' kinda slow
So fee-fi-fo-fuck-fum
She's scratchin' on my back oh here she comes
Now I gotta get a nut, gotta get a nut, gotta get it quick
You know because I love this shit so
[Chorus]
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut

[Verse 2]
Okay back, back to the fuckin' basics
You got yours and mine you want to taste it
Open wide oh no don't you waste it
Oh shit all over you face kid
You know you know one thing
You know me I like to slang
That dick you know what so roll over girl while I stick it in ya
But I'll trade it all while I'm ridin' that ass scream and shout
My name is the same
Just another pussy that I had to tame so

[Refrain]
Uh, get it all baby
Uh, get it all baby
Uh, get it all baby (Lick my balls honey)

[Chorus]
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut

Now I love pussy
And pussy loves me
Like a lemon to the lime and the bumble to the bee
You know it's real good, a nigga can't resist it
Couldn't be a fruit loop so don't get me twisted
'Cause in some pussy is the place to be
Always fuckin' is the life for me
Spread them legs open far and wide
Fuck this shit just let me put my dick inside, so

[Chorus]
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut

[Refrain]
Uh, get it all baby
Uh, get it all baby
Uh, get it all baby (Gently put the ball, hahaha)
[Chorus]
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, that, that nut
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that nut6Embed
