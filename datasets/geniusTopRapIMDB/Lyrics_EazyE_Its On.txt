It’s On Lyrics[Intro]
Today's a good day to die (*screaming*)
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
I tell 'em bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie-yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
It ain't nothin' but Eazy baby
He'll smoke two niggas 'cause they crazy
Talk a gang of shit but it don't phase me
That punk nigga Dre still pays me
[Verse 1]
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Now if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Hey mister prankster, prankster
Story book gangsta
Back in '86 you wore the pumps and mascara
Down with the motherfuckin' Wreckin' Cru, bitch
But once a bitch is always a bitch and now the fuckin' switch
Fag, with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin' bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin' Locs in a G ride
What set you from punk what set you from ride
Rip Van Winkle sleepin', nigga woke up and became a G
But you still don't impress the Eazy
Smoke a lil' sherm, now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the westside call it bionic
I make a mil' here, make a mil' there
Fuck a bitch here, fuck a bitch there, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on

Old nigga Eazy-E went to the cupboard
To get Snoop Doggy Dogg a bone, motherfucker
Here's another G
Or should I say a H, a I, a J, a K, a L-M-N-O-P?
P for the pussy wussy wuffin' nigga broke
As a motherfuckin' joke
Talkin' about you wanna smoke
The E to the A-Z-Y
Nigga this east side
Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg, you wanna try?
187 on the E that you sing
But you cling on my balls when I swing my ding-a-ling
Yeah, ya got more juice like a plant of puppy water
First I'm gonna choke ya
Then I smoke ya, then I'm gonna
Toss you in the back of my trunk
With the other punk
Smoking Death Row like I smoke a Phillie Blunt
If it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Now if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G

[Chorus]
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell your motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on motherfucker then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
[Verse 3]
Still a nigga, once a nigga, always a nigga, down from the get-go
Never let go, never flossin'
Never slippin', never trippin', stickin'
Dick and my balls down your throat, doggy, listen
Niggas from the LBC, they never heard of ya, G
And niggas from the CPT ain't down with D-R-E
But you gave it up still, like a trooper
Let 'em play your jam, shake your hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast and the mid-west
But In LA, you still can't pass the test
See, I can tell a pussy when I see one
Dre wearing lip stick that mean ya have to be one
You need to change your sex and your occupation
You try to fuck with E, nigga, run, run, run
'Cause if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Now if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G

[Chorus]
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuck—
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfucker—
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on motherfucker, then it's on

[Outro]
Whip-whip-whip it
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Tell you motherfuck—
Tell you motherfucker—
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfucker—
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Tell you motherfucker—
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on
Whip-whip-whip it
Tell you motherfucker—
Tell you motherfuck—
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy
Tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with, Eazy23Embed
