Just tah Let U Know Lyrics[Intro]
Eazy ... E , Eazy ... E
Padapapow... Eazy, padapapow... E
Padapapow... Eazy, padapapow... E

[Verse 1]
It's that man comin' up from that land of tha CPT
("What's my motherfuckin' name?" - Snoop) Eazy-E
Comin' thru with a big lick for '94
Showin' alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-down bow-wow the big dogâ€™s in town
And them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laidback as I blow a fat sack
Hittin' switches for them bitches, bendin' corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
With the E to the A-Z-Y
That nigga makin' more off yo hits than you do
You fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin' to speak up on tha OG, nigga you don't know me
Break em off these nuts lil wanna-be
Cause I peel caps if need be
And ain't nothin' you gonna bring don't see me
Just to let you know
[Hook]
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)

[Verse 2]
It's the E comin' up from the gank
So nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz ain't nuthin' on my mind but them chips
Gotta have a griff, run a nigga dip
Back to the past on the Compton streetz
Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin' mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front 'n back, dippin' side to side
And it's been like that since I was BG
"It's the E," that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin' that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin' done like a two dollar ho
It's just a lil something from the E tah let U know...

One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)

[Verse 3]
It's still the CPT, nothin' more, nothin' less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
'Cause them busta-ass niggas can't see what I'm sayin'
They think the E be playin' [What ?]
But I ain't givin' up nuthin' but this Glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin'
With the original Compton criminal
Coz the only thing poppin' is a snaps
And ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
But a nigga like the E ain't trippin' though
I'm just here to let you niggas know
[Hook]
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
(Just to let you know
Just to let you know)

[Outro]
You have your own freedom of choice
So you do what the fuck you feel like doin'
Take it from me, that streetwise motherfucker named Eazy-E3Embed
