My Babyâ€™z Mama Lyrics[Intro]
[Baby:] "What ya doing daddy, what ya doing daddy?"
[Eazy-E:] "I'm sitting here writing this song about baby's mothers, who, uh, try to sue the daddys for child support, even though daddy's taking care of the baby. But the mother's just, you know, scandalous and I'd just like to say..."

[Verse 1]
Fuck my baby's mama, the bitch got drama
Fuck my baby's mama
Cause she's the type of bitch that wanna see me broke
Broker than a joke, bitch stole my role
And every time I see the bitch, she needs cash
She make me wanna slap her ass
Trifling bitch, always got me in a fix
The low life Compton-shopping-swap-meet trick
I wanna kill the ho
Then slam her in the trunk of my six four
Cause yo, that ho made my dick grow
And now her lawyer's at every show
Waiting for me to kick in my dough
But before I go, I'm on death row
Cause the bitch had too much drama
Fuck my baby's mama
[Hook x8]
Fuck my baby's mama (that bitch)

[Verse 2]
Fuck my baby's mama, the bitch got drama
And I'm not the one
I should just knock her punk ass out
While I'm in court paying child support
But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel
And he's the type of nigga that a nigga's gotta kill
Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her
Cause the bitch is buying skirts instead of diapers
Begging so much to hold hands it startin' to look like cuffs
I wish I never fucked
But that's too late. How much you laid?
Cause according to your income, you might have to spend some
Time behind bars, now you find it hard
I never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this
I can't do another day with Pamela
So I'mma pay ya', Anna
But I'd just like to say

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I think of all the money I spent on a lawyer, I used to be an employer
But now I'm just an employee, filing bankruptcy
But now the punk bitch can't touch me
Uh, I only call her to check up on my daughter
So now she got a restraining order
Put me to the curb and had the nerve to ask to borrow a dime
Bitch, you must be out your rabid ass mind
Huh, love for start will take much you see
The bitch broke me so now I need a crutch
But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck
About a young nigga that's down on his luck
So I gotta put the P down and be down for the calls
And give the bitch back her drawers
So if you're driving by and you see her
Do me a favor, give the bitch the finger
Fuck her

[Outro]

This one's for you
This evening's news report
