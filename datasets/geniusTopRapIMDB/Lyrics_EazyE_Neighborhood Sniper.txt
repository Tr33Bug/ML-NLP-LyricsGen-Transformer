Neighborhood Sniper Lyrics[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Perched up high on a rooftop
Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at it's own pace
Sometimes I feel like a superhero
Urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart through a dime
Now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put my finger on the button then the sight I check
I make the kill here's the deal
After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
So it's the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyone's scared, I'm the neighborhood sniper
[Chorus: Cold 187Um & Kokane]
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces, some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Boom, boom, boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Yaa, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda 'em
Yaa

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
And simply scared the bitch (Boo!)
Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes, nigga, and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now there's nothing left but a snitch
Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes, you're out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
Duckin' to an alley, so they don't recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin' scared of the neighborhood sniper

They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces, some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Boom, boom, boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Yaa, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda 'em

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
I'm doin' dirt by myself as I continue my mission
Killin' all fools as an addiction
As the E, lovin' the game, leavin' a shame
And in my heart, I feel no motherfuckin' pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And with my AK-47 I stand bold
Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Pop-pop-pow, as I watch the motherfucker drop
Lovin' the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph, to keep in my hall of thrills
I’m stayin' calm and never hyper
As I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus: Cold 187Um & Kokane]
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces, some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Boom, boom, boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Yaa, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Boom, boom, had to murda 'em
Yaa

[Outro]
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Yaa
Some of them bust them pieces, some of them run up to get that leak-leak
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em
Yaa
Everybody else, everybody else, I'mma shoot to kill ya
Boom, boom, had to murda ‘em2Embed
