No More ?’s Lyrics[Intro]
We're sitting here with Eazy-E
Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

[Verse 1]
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo, I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-four Impala
Rollin' and runnin' from the police
Brother, don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal?
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping? Hell nah
Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches, I'm sorry for that 'burst
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
[Interlude]
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Okay, what would be the situation when you so-call "gank" someone?
[Verse 2]
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in, all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow 'cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know, it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall, don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
You might also like[Interlude]
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two-eleven?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick? Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said, "This is a robbery"
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said, "Punch it"
Took the gun and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true? I don't lie
You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy
[Interlude]
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

[Outro]
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Taught, and damn, it's your fault
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N.W.A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
What's your real age? No more questions24Embed
