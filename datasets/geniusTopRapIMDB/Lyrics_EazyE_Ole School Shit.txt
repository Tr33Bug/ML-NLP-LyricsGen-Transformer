Ole School Shit Lyrics[Intro: Eazy-E]
Hey Yella
Kick that shit
19-9-muthaphukkin-E
The muthaphukkin year of the real muthaphuckkin G's
And we gonna do this shit like this:

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Nigga evidently, ya just don't know who ya fucking with
So I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin', bitch
Before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast, I leave my gang rag layin' on ya face
I tattoo Dre name on my chest
Cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed, huh
And you won't see R.I.P., you'll see P.N.D
A Punk Nigga Deceased, yeah
And the bitch that was yours will be mine, buddy
All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
And I had to make an example
Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
Of a nigga with street wise reality
That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face
Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
Cause a nigga never know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
Cause I don't wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that never gave a fuck about me droppin' phony tears
I hope I'm in the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin' all night
Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life, yeah
And now you see you can't handle me
I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless fuckin' family
[Interlude: Eazy-E]
Yeah, out with the old, in with the motherfuckin' new
But check this shit out
I got somebody for ya, bitch
Motherfucker
(Kick that shit!)

[Verse 2: Sylk]
Now it's about time for the Sylk to speak
Check dat ass last weak
You off the chronic and you tweak
Speak when I feel
Cause I'm as real as they come
I'm a bitch with a gun
Never run ain't for none
So step, step up
If ya wanna test ya luck, trick
Sister like Sylk
Really don't give a fuck, bitch
Punk bitches wanna step phony speak howdy doody
I make ya self break ya self bitch you never knew me
Yours truly no longer layin' in the cut
Steady fuckin' shit up
Never see me shakin' my butt, I strut
Like a gangsta bitch, no, not a pranksta bitch
I'm quick to gank a bitch, trick
Peep game at this bitch as I shoot this
Gangsta bitch steppin' rollin' with the Ruthless

The R-U-T-H-L-E double S, yo, it's the nigga Knocc Out
Claim the Blocc so nigga whats next
Try to step and flex and get wrecked like a mack truck
I'm kickin', tah spittin' this funky shit to make a quick fat buck
I'm doggin' a dog you suckers can't talk about tip flip I rip shit
I'm stressin'—
"Damn cuz", "Pick it back up"
Chillin' up in the studio
With the Ruthless Family
Fuck the Death Row posse
Yo, them fools can not handle me
Snoop and Andre ya come and try to fade the
Loc'ed out, Compton, original baby gangsta
1-8-7's how we do it on the West
Ya say ya shit is chronic, but to me, it's more like stress
Or should I say make my shit the stronic
Tha Dogg Pound don't wanna step to the atomic dog
D-O-T-K-N-O-Double-C-O-U-T so motherfucker come and fuck with me

[Bridge]
(Come on, come on)
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ya still in effect
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ya still in effect
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family ya still in effect
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless motherfuckin' family—
(Kick that shit!)
[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Jealousy is a motherfucker when you're the man
With the upper hand, I don't give a shit
Clock a grip like no other can
Wanna be like me, be a G like me
But I'm the nigga that made a G
Outta the bitch D-R-E, see
I was the captain
Dre was my sidekick
Everything was cool
Til he wanted to get what I get
Any other real G, Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
Now claimin' you a G
How does it feel to be me9Embed
