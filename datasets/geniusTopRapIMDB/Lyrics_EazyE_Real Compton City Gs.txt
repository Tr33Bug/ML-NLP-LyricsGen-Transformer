Real Compton City G’s Lyrics[Intro]
Compton, Compton, Compton
Ahh, real Compton city G's
Ahh, real Compton city G's
Ahh, real Compton city G's
Ahh, real Compton city G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real stuff provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That the fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
M****f*** Dre! M****f*** Snoop! M****f*** Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real Compton city G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the hell you found that anorexic rapper?
Talkin' about who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So, sucka please, suck please
Don't step to these real Compton city G's
[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a girl but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the brother and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of homies in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your damn work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Brothers straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many brothers can vouch that
And since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But brother like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia brothers
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets, G
I think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little --- tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, brother please, brother please
Don't step to these real Compton city G's

Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition "Original baby gangsta"
Approach me like you hard, little busta, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my damn shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real ass brothers
G's, fools please, don't try to step
See if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See, young brotherss like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Suckers like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real Compton city' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did nothing wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, sucka, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' it
Both of you brothers can come and suck my doggy's ****
Beatin' up a girl don't make you it, but then again
Some brothers think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how Dre could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on ******* at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a track-ass busta
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real Compton city G's
[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now: Eazy Duz ItEmbed
