Real Muthaphuckkin’ G’s (Edited) (2002 Remastered) Lyrics[Intro]
Compton
Compton
Compton
Compton
Compton
Ahh, Real Compton City G's
Ahh, Real Compton City G's
Ahh, Real Compton City G's
Ahh, Real Compton City G's
[Verse One: Eazy-E]
Hey Yo doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real stuff provoke, so you's a wannabe 'loc
And you'll get smoked and I hope that the fans understand
When ya talk about playin' me
The same records that you making' is paying me
********* Dre
********* Snoop
********* Death Row
Yo and here comes me left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season
To let the Real Compton City G's in
Your like a kid, you found it bumping down the dapper
But tell me where the hell you found that anorexic rapper
Talking about who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only 60 pounds when your wet and wearing boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only met Eazy's pay day
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a G thang
But on his old album cover, he was a she thing
So sucker please, sucker please don't step to these Real Compton City G's

[Chorus]
Stomp him in his track
Show him that I'm ruthless
You might also like[Verse 2: Gangsta Dresta]
Every day it a new rapper, claiming to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a girl but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap about the guns and knives
Just take a good look at the brother and you'll capture the fact, that the bastard is
Simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the Mental
Of homies in Compton, Wattz, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse, you claim to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to your fucking work
See you never had no business, so save the drama jerk
Brothers straight kill me knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt, put in work, and many brothers can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But brothers like you, I gotta hate you
I'm just tired of suburbian brothers talking about they come from projects
Knowing you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
I think you start trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme, little ***
Tried to sag, but you fronting at the same time
And your set don't accept you
Scared to kick it witcha homies cause ya know they don't respect you
So brother please, brother please, don't step to these Real Compton City G's
[Verse Three: BG Knocc Out]
Well, its the Knock Out, definition original baby gangster
Approach me like you hard, little buster
I'm bank ya
Shank ya, with my damn shank, if i have ta
Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
But this time your dealing with some real last brothers
G's, fool please, don't try to step
See if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young brothers like me will break ya off somthing
Claiming my city, but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggas like Dogg is what I call wanna be's and ain't nothing compared to Real Compton City G's
[Chorus]
Stomp him in his track and
Show him that I'm ruthless

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met an OG who never did nothing wrong
You tried to dis the Eazy-E so now sucker it's on you
And your Doggy Dogg, think that yall hogging it
Both of you tricks can come and suck my doggy ****
Beating up a woman don't make you it
But then again some brothers think it makes a man
Damn it's a trip how Dre can switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on ******* at picnics
And now you think your bigger
But to me you ain't nothing but trick ass buster
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear your getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get yo ass popped with a Smith and Wesson
Learn a lesson from the E
Stay in your place and don't step to Real Compton City G's

[Outro Chorus]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre, What's up? *bang*
Boy, ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre (what's up?) *Bang*
Boy, ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre (what's up?) *bang*
Boy you should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre (what's up?) *bang*
Boy you should have known by now
