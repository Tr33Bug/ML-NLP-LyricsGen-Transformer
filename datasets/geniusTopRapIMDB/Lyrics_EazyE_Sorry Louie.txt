Sorry Louie Lyrics[Intro: Jimmie Ray Weeks]
Hi, Claude again
You remember I told you about my cousin when I was 15?
Well, the year after that, I killed this kid, Louie
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
I got away with it
But I wanna apologize to Louie
I'm sorry Louie

[Chorus: Jimmie Ray Weeks]
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
[Verse 1: Eazy-E with Jimmie Ray Weeks]
I knew this motherfucker named Louie
Every day the nigga talked shit, but today he tried to do me
He rolled down my block with a pistol and a stare
A black khaki suit and dooky braids in his hair
The motherfucker thinks I'm slippin'
But I got my gat and a bat and a 40 and I'm sippin'
Waitin' for the fool to get out the car
The stupid motherfucker thinks I'm a star
But I'm not, I'm the type that'll kick the nigga's ass
Fast, Eazy-E's a nigga that'll blast
Hold up, wait, the nigga started to load his gat
I grabbed my bat and ran around the back, yo
He's at my window, thinkin' I'm playin' Nintendo
But the stupid nigga don't know I'm behind him, so
He dropped the gat like a stupid motherfucker
So I bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger

[Chorus: Jimmie Ray Weeks]
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger

[Verse 2: Eazy-E with Jimmie Ray Weeks]
I knew this bitch named Peaches
She often wanted me to fuck her trampy ass on them beaches
But bust it, yo, Peaches
Be fuckin' around with me, instead of fuckin' her man
She's butt-naked with my dick in her hand, yo
As soon as Peaches started suckin', I saw this motherfuckin'
Nigga behind my car, and he was duckin'
So I told the bitch to hold on
You stupid bitch, put your motherfuckin' clothes on!
I wonder if this nigga's tryna jack me
Cause I ain't got my gat with me, shit
The nigga started runnin' up fast
I thought he was gonna blast, so I hid behind her ass
She started howlin' out, "Wait!"
I banked her in the face
But the punk nigga pulled out mace
He asked the stupid ass bitch did I mug her
So I bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger

Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger

[Verse 3: Eazy-E with Jimmie Ray Weeks]
I'm a motherfuckin' psycho and I don't give a fuck about 'em
I kill the nigga, cut off his dick, so you know I got 'em
Cut his vein, ate his brain, left the nigga for dead
Now it's a gallon of blood, drippin' from under his bed
Oh, no! What happened to my lover?
Bitch, I bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bitch tried to call the cops, fuck that
I gotta take the girl out with my motherfuckin' bat
Cause I ain't doin' ten in the pen
For a bitch and her dead-ass boyfriend
So I gotta kill the ho, I'm reachin' for my weapon slow
That's when I notice some nigga standin' by the door
The little nigga said, "Don't kill my mother"
So I bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger

[Chorus: Jimmie Ray Weeks & Eazy-E]
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger (I'm sorry, Jimmy!)
Bashed his head in with my Louisville Slugger
[Outro: Eazy E]
He's dead!
I'm sorry, Billy2Embed
