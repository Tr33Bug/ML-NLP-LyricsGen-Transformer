Tha Muthaphukkin Real Lyrics[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Well, it be the real niggas back with that hard street shit
Bitch niggas be pissin' a fit but I say fuck 'em, when I buck 'em
It's that nigga with the cool and mellow shit for your ass (Hmm)
Takin' niggas back through the past
All up on my nuts shit be swingin' like a fist (Yeah)
Can't even take a piss, if I did niggas would cut they wrist
In a motherfuckin' candy 4, beat that ass with the switch
Then blast on the bitch who was all in my shit
It's that nigga Ren back for the '9-5
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive
So I'm puttin' it down with that nigga E (Uh-huh)
For all of my niggas in the C-P-T (Yeah)
So here we go again with part 3 of the script
Making bitch made niggas bite their lip, when we dip
So tell me how the fuck do it feel
To get hit with the motherfuckin' real (Real)
[Chorus]
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
(Goin' out to the hardcore hip-hop)
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
(Buckin' these niggas 'til they drop)

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Now everything's good in my hood, and it's on and poppin'
Eazy-muthaphukkin'-E from east side south Compton
Straight givin' up the real
On how a nigga feel talk that shit, mothafuckers' caps get peeled
Layin' low in the cut
Gettin' high than a motherfucker, niggas know what's up
I'm that gangsta-gangsta, is that what they're still yellin'?
Nigga G to a T saggin' and bailin'
Live by the gun, you know what I'm sayin', Ren? (Yeah)
So I guess I'll die by that motherfucker then
So when I die, niggas bury me
Make sure my shit reads Eazy-muthaphukkin'-E
And it's a fact, to be exact, my tombstone should read
'He put Compton on that map'
And that's how a nigga feel
When I'm givin' up the motherfuckin' real

[Chorus]
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
(Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop)
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
(Buckin' these niggas til they drop)
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
The motherfuckin' real (Real)

Niggas be pissin' on they self when the real niggas drop
While they rollin' in they shit, hittin' corners on the block
Niggas fresh out the pen with two strikes
Be bumpin' this real shit every fuckin' night, it's alright, niggas
It's two hard motherfuckers on the streets
It's the nigga MC Ren and the nigga Eazy...

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
...does it ya wish the fuck that you could do it
Got a nine millimeter don't make me have to shoot it
Who gives a fuck about the police?
Cause them the main mothafuckas that break the peace
Now let me know how the fuck do you feel
Gettin' hit with the motherfuckin' real

[Chorus]
The motherfuckin' real (Real)
