We Want Eazy Lyrics[Michel'le]
"We want Eazy!"

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea! Can yall hear that?
Can yall hear that?
Well, clap ya hands then-come on
Clap ya hands everybody
Clap ya hands, come on, come on
Put ya hands together and clap 'em
Now can y'all say Eazy!
Come on, say it
EAZY!
Everybody come on!
EAZY!
Who yall came to see?
Eazy!
A little louder come on!
EAZY!
Get those hands in the air!
Eazy!
Come on, come on say it!
Eazy!
A little louder come on!
EAZY!
Come on make some noise!
EAZY!
Ayo Ren lets do this

[MC Ren]
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set, hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal - Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless, when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
You might also likeEAZ-Y...

[Michel'le]
(Michel'le)Eazy
Hey eazy
(Eazy)Wassup??
(Michel'le)Why you wear your pants like that?
(Eazy)I wear my pants like this, fo' easy access baby
Yeah thats right

(Ice Cube)
Yo homeboy, where we takin' this jam to?
COMPTON
Where?
COMPTON
Alright

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
EAZ-Y...

Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your age?
(Eazy-E)
Man, why you gotta bring that up?
Yo, get this fool outta here!

Hey Eazy why you always cussin' on your records?
(Eazy-E)
Who are you, Gene Autry or somethin'?
I just do that to get my point across
Now I wanna know who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it

EAZ-Y
We want Eazy...9Embed
