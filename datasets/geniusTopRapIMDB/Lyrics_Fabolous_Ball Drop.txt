Ball Drop Lyrics[Intro Skit]
Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990
We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989
The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'em
Oh, can you ever hear 'em
They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990; goodbye to the 80's
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Happy new year!

[Intro: Fabolous & (French Montana)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa (haan!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (change is good for everybody)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Montana)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ya boy Fid-fida, haan!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
[Bridge: French Montana]
When that hate don't work they start telling lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop

[Refrain: French Montana & (Fabolous)]
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
I just don't know why

[Chorus: Fabolous & French Montana]
Hatin' hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
(Haan! Whoa whoa whoa - haan! Whoa whoa whoa)
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New year, new money, then the call dropped
New year, new money, let them drawers drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
'Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top, smokin' medication

This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told em get money, that's the best solution
When you do, wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style, I ain't stress the boostin'
It's time to make more money, less excuses
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass, she the best since Boosie

[Chorus: Fabolous & French Montana]
Like whoa whoa whoa
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
And I just don't know why

[Verse 2: French Montana]
12 o' clock then the call dropped
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Young boy, hard head in the soft top
'Cause when them shots ain't ringin', you can't call shots (ba ba ba!)
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin' at (ba ba ba!)
V with hundred on the Lincoln (bling)
3 quarter mink, blew the top off Lincoln, God (haan!)
Niggas scared to play it like jail or Richard Mellor (Mellor)
I hope I never Tom Heller, die (die)
Scramble like a dope fiend (dope mean)
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin (ahh!)
My right hand got 30 on his left arm (bling)
On that left lane nigga, what a bitch for? (haan)
And I just don't know why (and I just don't know why)
[Refrain: Fabolous]
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

[Bridge: French Montana]
When that hate don't work they start telling lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop

[Refrain: French Montana & (Fabolous)]
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
I just don't know why

[Chorus: Fabolous & French Montana]
Hatin' hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
(Haan! Whoa whoa whoa - haan! Whoa whoa whoa)
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New year, new money, then the call dropped
New year, new money, let them drawers drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
'Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top, smokin' medication

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes til' the casket drop
Quiet 'fore you suckas hear a pin drop
I'll buy this muh'fucker like the price drop
Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop
Mommy killin 'em, tat a tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat, heard he dime dropped
Hit 'em in the head, watch the body drop
Dollars comin' down like rain drops
New year, new money, nigga ball drop

[Refrain: French Montana & (Fabolous)]
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)
Haan (whoa whoa whoa)46Embed
