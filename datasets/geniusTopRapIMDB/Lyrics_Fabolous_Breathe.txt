Breathe Lyrics[Intro]
Breathe, oh
Woo, woo, woo!
Breathe

[Refrain]
One and then the two (Two) two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
One and then the two (Oh, two) two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta (gasp) then you gotta (gasp)
[Chorus]
Yo, these niggas can't breathe when I come through, Hum 2
Some shoes, gotta be twenty man, it's not even funny
They can't (Breathe) the chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right, you know what? You right
These bitches can't (Breathe) look, look, they hearts racing
They start chasing, but I'm so fast, when I blow past
That they can't (Breathe) in the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better (Breathe)

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year, like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K9's through
And I pace myself
I know these money-hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep 'em on a diet
Embrace they health, or either keep 'em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got 'em grabbing they chest
Cause it's hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just laying a verse, I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone
Breathe!

[Verse 2]
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (Breathe) but I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (Breathe) they has to react
Like having an asthma attack, when they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe breezing at 90
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on 'em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it 'til your face get blue
And then (Breathe)
[Refrain]
One and then the two (Oh, two) two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (Breathe)

One and then the two (Oh, two) two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta (gasp) then you gotta (gasp)

[Verse 3]
Yo these niggas can't (Breathe) when the crew walk in it
Pop a few corks in it, as quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath 'fore you catch a left, even worse, catch a Tef'
Only way you catch an F, to the A-B
It's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya, they gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed? And it won't stop
'Til they inhale your seed, and it don't stop
'Til I tell 'em to breathe like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope, unless these motherfuckers (Breathe)

[Outro]
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta (Oh) Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta, Queens gotta (Breathe)
Staten Island gotta, you niggas gotta
You bitches gotta, everybody (Breathe)
One and then the two (Oh, two) two and then the three (Three)
Three and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (Breathe)
Then you gotta, then you gotta
Breathe!8Embed
