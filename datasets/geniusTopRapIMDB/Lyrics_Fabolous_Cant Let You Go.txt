Can’t Let You Go Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon
[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go

[Verse 2: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
You ain't never step outta line or get outta pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go

[Verse 3: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Uh
Uh-oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gon' kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly, uh
You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you, yeah)
These feelings I'ma share wit' you
Which makes it a little more clear for you
[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go13Embed
