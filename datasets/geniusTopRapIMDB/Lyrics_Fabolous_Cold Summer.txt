Cold Summer Lyrics[Intro]
You ever have a cold in the summer?
That shit be the worse
It gets better though

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
How they turn a top dog to an underdog
It's a cold world even in the summer, dawg
Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God 'fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when it's thick as London fog
I'm from the city baby, I done grew up under Small
Not to bring up old shit, I'm not a plunger, dawg
No dalmatian but I come through with a hunnid, dawg
And they don't bark, they bite
Let it spark, they might
Gotta walk straight, right?
Turn the dark to daylight
Let 'em talk, they right
In your heart, stay light
Play your part, stay tight
Bosses park where they like
Don't you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut 'em off and let a bygone be a bygone
When you ballin', you that nigga that they got they eye on
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
Bussin' out sneakers, swingin' on rims
Being number 1, bringing on M's
Hope the Knicks get him, I'ma bring him Timb's
Tell 'em lace his boots, I'ma give a king some gems
Like look, you the great hope and a scapegoat
You gon' have to make quotes and take notes
And some can't take smoke so they may choke
But those who learn to make boats, stay afloat
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin' but he got my old number
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin' but he got my old number
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
I'm chillin' for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
I'm chillin' for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer

[Verse 2]
The media promoting fake, they just stampin' and shit
You don't wanna see us beef then stop ampin' and shit
They was giving Meek an L, said he wouldn't prevail
Next thing you know that boy was in a championship
So everyday I'm goin' in, I'm on some vampire shit
And every night I'm in my bag like I'm campin' and shit
The trenches that we grew up in need to know you can win
So you see me in my hood on my champion shit
See a minor setback, breed a major get back
If I lose it ain't over, I be yelling bet back
I come from where they take it, you might never get back
Gotta shoutout New Jersey, y'all won't get the Nets back
Play for keeps 'round here, Prada's deep 'round here
Shooters creep 'round here, hard to sleep 'round here
Life cheap 'round here, Grim Reap' 'round here
Spilled milk get wiped up, we don't weep 'round here
We just goin' harder, we raisin' sons and growin' daughters
Came a long way and workin' on going farther
Grew up not knowing fathers, seeing no one bother
But know my story gets better 'cause I know the author
Keep readin' it's a comeback story
I told her that if you leave don't ever come back shawty
I be sayin' word to Mother, she the one that taught me
Karma is a bitch who hoes around and come back for me
Cold

Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin' but he got my old number
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin' but he got my old number
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
I'm chillin' for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's gon' be a cold summer
I'm chillin' for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer

[Outro]
I just feel like life is hot and cold
Ups and downs, back and forth
Wins and losses
It's gon' be some sunshine and it's gon' some rain
And when it rain, it pours
But ask yourself, can you weather the storm until the sun shines again?4Embed
