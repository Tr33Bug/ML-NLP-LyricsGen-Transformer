Cuffin Season Lyrics[Intro]
Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Baby, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

[Chorus: King Chip]
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (around June)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fucking winter (whooo)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fucking winter (yeah)
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
You was in La Marina all summer (every Sunday)
You was up in Toxic all summer (turn up)
Now it's getting chilly, that's the fall coming (wooo!)
Now a nigga get a call from her
What's up? How you been? How was summer? Hotter then
I'm like some bitch stringing me along like a violin (dumb bitch)
She was too busy hosting, on Instagram posting
Hashtag #nofilter AKA #hofilter
With the innocent face, but she so guilty (she did it)
Now I'm a take her in like a ho shelter (whaaat)
When there's a few niggas that I know killed her (whaaat)
4 Celtics, Knicks guard, you know Felton
This nigga in Atlanta Airtran her, no Delta (haha)
Been naughty all year trying to end it nicely (niiice)
Summer hoes turning into winter wifeys

[Chorus: King Chip]
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (around June)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fucking winter (whooo)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fucking winter (yeah)

You was in club Liv every Sunday, you was in KoD every Monday
Just like Lil Wayne said: LIV on Sundays, King of Diamonds Monday
Oh, you been working out? (Word?) You think I'm dumb or what?
I know how a winter gut turn into a summer butt
She bartend, he paid for the shots (for the shots)
Budweiser Limearita for the thots (for the thots?)
Hard dick and bazooka, maybe a little hookah
She thinking Philippe, I'm think Chipotle (yeah)
I heard bitches commit  cyns(sins) for Chipotle
Every rapper in a cypher, every player in a huddle (whoa)
You really wanna fuck, but you say you want to cuddle (whoa)
You posting like you balling, but you really in a struggle (yeah)
Your captions be deep, but you shallow as a puddle
Turn down for what?

[Chorus: King Chip]
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (yeah)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (around June)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fucking winter (whooo)
These hoes keep calling, I ain't picking up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fucking winter (yeah)38Embed
