Diamonds (The Soul Tape 2) Lyrics[Chorus]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I turn my dark secrets into bright ideas
I used to cry for help, I learned to wipe my tears
I was scared to embrace, but now I fight my fears
These hoes say I'm too much, it's only right I share
Pressure makes diamonds, I was made to shine
When life gave me lemons, I made lemonade with mines
What's beef? Beef is when you make mistakes
Like less burgers with ya buddies and more steaks for snakes
My story just gets better when you get to the end
So when I'm at my worst, I know it's not the end
I came from the dirt, made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do?
[Chorus]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I'm shining religiously, Jesus pieces and crosses
I paid for all of my toys, I don't owe any Santa Clauses
I never finished school or completed no college courses
Was taught to be a winner, but I learned more from my losses
Losses like, when you go is your friends gon' miss you?
Was it cause you beneficial or you been official?
Condo at the top, one floor down from Heaven yo
Hating is beneath me, I say that's the devil yo
I'm tryna keep the faith, hanging in with hope
Went to my jeweler, brought myself two angels on the ropes
I came from the dirt, made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do?
[Chorus]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Could say I always was the truth but that be lying a little
You can't spell believe without a "lie" in the middle
I always say it first, niggas trying to ditto
But I got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle
Mind of a general, heart of a solider
That just mean I call the shots, but ain't afraid to take the shots
Niggas gave it all they got, still couldn't take my spot
Don't get ya shorty got and have to live out takens plot
I ain't give a fuck, now I would give whatever
You only live once, but legacies live forever
I came from the dirt made the cut and blew
So when you put me in that right light
What I do?

[Chorus]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond4Embed
