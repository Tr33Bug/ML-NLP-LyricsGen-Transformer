Diced Pineapples Lyrics[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and you’re my dinner guest
Shawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain’t try to hurt her, ‘cause i’ve always been the best
I’m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I’m a fan of her talent, so i’ve always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands
[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy, shit, at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
The club popping but she ain’t trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I’m the only one that get up in the vip
My money grown, baby, ain’t no need to see id
Slide her something just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you’re getting through the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you’re overdressed if you’re wearing underwear
I turn up, couple js to burn up
Couple spots to hide out, now let that playlist right out
Where I live on sunday, her place monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the christmas, though

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy, shit, at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushing and I drink the best juice
I’m drinking till nothing left to
And she playing with herself, too
I be thinking about her all day
She perform like it’s Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top wit' the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
Throw her on the stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see the niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause i’ll never get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She’s said "Trigga, why I never seen her with a bad bitch?"
Unless she’s meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she’s giving head, she’s throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella friend?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that’s what she ever wants
Somethin' 'bout to alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we’re about to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you’re the shit
Couple days with her, man, that’s all I ever get
And she got a little sister, that’s what she ever with
Game like a nigga man, that’s all she ever speak
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair
Try to beg mine, my nigga out of bootie
Never retract statements, nigga, I’m never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I’m never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you’re doing what you’re supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl though, I just need you in my world, yo
[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy, shit, at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right9Embed
