Doin It Well Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous & (Trey Songz)]
Datpiff.com world premiere
(Go ahead)
See you can't just do it
(Go ahead)
You gotta do it well

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, body language is the kinda talk I'm fluent in
Why don't you stop talking 'bout it and come do it then?
Written on your face, that "Yeah I'm tryna do it" grin
Event planning, we just need a spot to do it in
Heading to engagements, head behind the Range tints
Fruits of my labor, edible arrangements
It get a little messy, sweater new, Jays mint
She say when she done with me I better go and change them
Fuck the sweater, I don't know no fuckin' better (Whatchu mean?)
Y'all don't get it, I don't know no fuckin' better (Word)
Then this right here, shawty right there
Still givin' ol' boy nightmares
And I heard your ex hate it, that's why my texts stated
Last night was a movie and it was X-Rated
Flick called Wet, it only gets better
Tonight we make the sequel and call that shit Wetter
[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
(Go ahead) Go ahead
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right (Nice)
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
(She represent Queens, I was raised out in Brooklyn)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Body language is the only talk he fluent in
He knew it was going down when he flew me in
Anything that I got on he wanna do me in
Now all these non-discrete bitches wanna do me in
Uh, Gold AP on me
He know all his niggas wanna put the D on me
Even Dr. Dre went and put the B on me
But my pussy so exclusive, limited edition
You know niggas love pretty bitches with ambition
Bees on the keys, never go in the ignition
B-B-But when I ride it, do it to precision
I could tell that he trippin', every time that I slip in
When he 'bout to cum I start to kiss his neck
I let him score, but we ditch the ref'
When we going out, we gotta ditch the press
Ah man, I got his bitch depressed

Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
(She represent Queens, I was raised out in Brooklyn)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Fabolous]
I'ma call you big daddy and scream your name
Only if you have me drippin' like candy paint
So what you sayin? I give it to you right, give it to you left
Make it last forever, Keith Sweat, have you outta breath
Mmmm, daddy slow down a bit
You acting like you never been downtown and shit
I need a baller laid back while he watch this thing bounce
Buying them designer bags, put money in my account
No doubt, I'm the player that they're talking about
Got that good shit, even in a drought
If you gon' do it, do it for real
And if they ask how I'm doin' tell 'em doin' it well
[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
Go ahead
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
