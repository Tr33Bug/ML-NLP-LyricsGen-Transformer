Faith in Me Lyrics[Intro: Wale]
I, yeah
Yeah
Uh, Wale

[Chorus: Wale]
And I love you
And I want you
Have faith in a young nigga please
Have faith and I will never ever leave
I love you
I want you
Have faith in a young OG
Have faith and do it B.I.G
[Refrain: Wale]
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?Back of the clubs with D'usse is where you'll find me
Back of the club with two things on me prolly
Back of the club, I got to stay Chris Farley
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
Back of the club with D'usse is where you'll find me
Back of the club with two things in the party
Back of the club, I gotta stay Chris Farley

[Verse 1: Wale]
Soon as I get home I make it up to you
Ready to do what he never do
Got her in Cancun
Sweating out of face, powder, watching her pants move, down
Sat the generous zipper
Get her digits and I split her like it's different opinions
I love it when she call me Big Poppa
You keep riding how you ridin' you gon' be knocked up
Oh I got you, no I got you
And I got you like I got you, said I cops come
You showing out with your cute ass
Wild when we do that
Pussy know my name when he pound, "nigga who dat?"
No really, who dat
Any cat ride smoother than you would be a new Jag
Faith in me
Hope you got some faith in me
Ain't that one to take out of my piece
I'm out, peace, don't wait for me
You might also like[Chorus: Wale]
And I love you
And I want you
Have faith in a young nigga please
Have faith and I will never ever leave
I love you
I want you
Have faith in a young OG
Have faith and do a B.I.G

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I heard she chased by the safeties and tight ends
So I put it in the safe cause she might sin
I could go Wraith but I might Benz
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
This is not for goofy niggas wearing Breitlings
Every time I wave my wrist they think it's lightnig
They don't know about this Patek up here on Dyckman
But the diamonds back me up just like the hype men
I'm a pull up on you nigga, not a skype friend
If you aren't trying to level up then you not my type then
One eye on your bitch, I'll be snipin'
And all the pieces hittin', I'll be swipin'
Told my wifey Faith never sweat Baltimore's
We could lose Audemar and order more tomorrow
The ballers gotta appreciate the water boy
There's a difference in smooth, silk, or corduroy
Don't you ever, ever, ever loose faith in me
Don't ever violate and think you're safe with me
I know you don't believe in niggas
But do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
[Outro: Wale]
Cause I love you
But can't fuck with you
You got something I need
But you don't got no faith in me
I'm leaving7Embed
