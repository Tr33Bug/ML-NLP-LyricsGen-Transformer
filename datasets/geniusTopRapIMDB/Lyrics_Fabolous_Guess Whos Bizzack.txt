Guess Whoâ€™s Bizzack? Lyrics[Intro]
I made some changes in my life, don't regret none of them
So if you ain't heard from me then you're probably one of them
Niggas want different results but do the same shit
They wait for it to come, I became it

Guess whos bizzack nigga?

[Hook]
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit you're always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now
[Verse 1]
The new you, I can't do, I knew you, this ain't you
I'm not no angel but always remain true
You hear what they say, my only complaint you
Wasn't just listening, you let that shit taint you
We fell out like faints do, I lost all respect
For niggas that's bitches, so don't call or text
Them bitches get checked like they all correct
But they be wrong that's why they're called your ex
You know talk is cheap so I call direct
And you niggas broke. Ya'll call collect
I'm watching my close friends like strangers, for bread
You said you'd never change, now don't change what you said
Face it ya'll all your bitches basic ball
But then you block it like you're 8 feet tall, homie
I'm in the truck with the Soul Tape on
Hoodie up, rest your soul Trayvon
I'm that cool I said guess who's bizzack

[Hook]
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit you're always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now

[Bridge]
I can try to erase your pain
But you and I, we've made some mistakes
I fucks with the old you, the new you is lame
What did you say? You said that you'll never change
You might also like[Verse 2]
But you did soon as you got a chance
Why you poppin shit? you should poppin bands
Living that good life without a care
The new you is hot headed and I'm not a fan
But I still keep it cooler, I think you should cool out
For real, cause that ain't you though
Since you've been on that high horse your life been at a new low
And I've been chucking deuces from that 2 door with my new ho
Swear to God I ain't losing no sleep
I know you heard what I do to those freaks
I don't beat it up, I kill the shits, cause a funeral in those sheets
You mess with lames, they seven days, I swear them dudes so weak
It can all be so sweet, but baby, do your thing
And miss me with that bullshit that you be saying
You complain and pointing your finger when you're the blame
You know I got that comeback, boomerang
Baby, what's up?

[Hook & Bridge]
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit you're always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now

[Outro]
And that's what you told me, but it's not what you showed me
It is what it is, yeah, but I'll always love you5Embed
