Lituation Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah... money, money, change, situation
Money, money, change, situation
Let's get it

[Chorus]
My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way, lituation
Models in the face, lituation
When I come around it goes down
Money, money, change, situation
[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's a movie, get your Goobers, nigga
Yeah, it gets deep, get ya scuba, nigga
Uh, I got the swipers in the gun shop
Yeah, I got the shooters in the Uber, nigga
Wooh! Everything brand new my nigga, yeah

Uh, they callin' me Fidel cash flow
Yeah, and the link come from Cuba, nigga, wooh!

Plastic Glock 9 get ya ass shot
Dream team, gold chain, match watch
And the bad bitches be the mascot
Yeah, got your bm in my BM nigga

Ha, we ain't gotta be a hundred deep (huh)
I'd rather ten lions than a hundred sheep (huh)

[Chorus]
My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way, lituation
Models in the face, lituation

Special thanks goes to the haze and sour
Respect brought the money then it gave me power
Sneak dissin' always been a fav of cowards
Ahh, you don't wanna take it there
Where I'm from all they do is take it there
I came from no space wasn't safe
Now it's like no space in a safe
I do it big and light skin my new faith
And we skip to my lou in that new Wraith, aaah

[Chorus]
My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way, lituation
Models in the face, lituation
When I come around it goes down
Money, money, change, situation
