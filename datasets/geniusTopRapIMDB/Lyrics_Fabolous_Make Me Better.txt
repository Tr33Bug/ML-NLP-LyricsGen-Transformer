Make Me Better Lyrics[Intro: Ne-Yo with Fabolous]
Timbo! Hey!
Ne-Yo! Say what?
Loso! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
You plus me, it equals better math
Your boy a good look but she my better half
I'm already bossin, already flossin
But why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin
You're-You're-You're-You're keepin me on my A game
With-With-With-Without havin the same name
They-They-They-They-They-They might flame
But-But-But-But shorty we burn it up
The sag and my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci mami in Giuseppes
Guess it's a G thing whenever we swing
I'm a need Coretta Scott if I'm 'gon be King (Oooh)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Verse 2-1: Ne-Yo]
First thing's first, I does what I do
But everything I am she's my improve
I'm already bossin, I'm already fly
But if I'm a star, she is the sky
A-A-A-And when I feel like I'm on top
She-She-She-She give me reason then I stop
And-And-And-And-And-And though I'm hot
To-To-To-Together we burn it up

The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
The shorty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like it is that man's problem
And-And-And-And when I feel like I'm tired
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mami be takin me higher
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm on fire
But-But-But-But shorty we burn it up

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]

You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Cause on the side of every great man
You could find a woman like a soldier holdin him down

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
She treats me like a don, watches for the hit
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip
And baby girl you so major they should front page ya (Front page ya)
God bless the parents who made ya (Who made ya)
Middle finger anybody who hate the (Who hate the)
Way we burn it up
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey!)
You make me better, You make me better (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
