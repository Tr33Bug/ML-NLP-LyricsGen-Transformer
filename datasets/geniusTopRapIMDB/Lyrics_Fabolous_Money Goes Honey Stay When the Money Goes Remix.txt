Money Goes, Honey Stay (When the Money Goes Remix) Lyrics[Hook: Jay-Z]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
It was all good just a week ago
Shoe box full no sneakers though
Just moved in, it's been a week or so
Brand new coupe so the seat could go
White Benz (White Benz), light tint (Light tint)
Riding like, "What the fuck is an indictment?"
Spent ten thous for excitement
That's how the day goes, that's how the nights went
Louis bags, Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me, I'm a Murcielaga
In the same lime green as the Air Max joggers
But if it wasn't here, will she wanna go?
You don't wanna ask, but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm?
Stick around 'til the weather is warm
[Hook: Jay-Z]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She like shopping, but never trendy
A little Gucci, maybe Fendi
Island hopping the West Indies
Diddy said got us all about the Benjis
Key tile phelipe chow
Reservations we could sleep now
Ask how much, I don't allow such
Pull an AMEX out ya reptile clutch
But who knew that the sky get cloudy?
I bought her four rings, didn't think she'd be outty
Huh the games over seize my Range Rover
Feds said somebody gave my name over
Now I'm inside, she's outside
What should you do? How about ride?
Guess nothing lasts forever
I thought we could watch these clouds pass together
But hey

When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
You can't ride big on lil' rims
You wanna do it big? You need a Lil' Kim
Raise ya hand high, look in the man eye
I dont know 'em your honor, can't lie
Money comes, money goes
So you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who ain't turn 180
Place no one above ya' sweet sady
Sun stop shining, she never got shady
She could've watched them box you in like a Brady
But she stood up, like what up
It's a cold world zip the coat put the hood up
That's some sick shit, that's a ill bitch
When you dead broke she make you feel rich
See mama you're my Rihanna
Pull the umbrella when you see drama
[Hook: Jay-Z]
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
When the money goes, will the honey stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh2Embed
