Ready Lyrics[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch, one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it coming on strong, you're so heavy
And she ready, I'm ready

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah, I hear if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready
Call you when I get there, you just get your shit wetty
Oops, I mean your shit ready, can't believe I said that
Least you know where my head at, now shawty, where your head at?
She gon' dive in head first, school me like the board of ed'
She do it, then we do it so she can say she thought ahead
Laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed
Talk nasty for your boy, silent treatment for the feds
No cup for the thirsty, she bad as controversy
Skin-tone like Hershey, body Lord have mercy
Yeah, if this thing were a car, it'd be a Lamborghini Mercy
Maybe I'm too fast, girl say she-she
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch, one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it coming on strong, you're so heavy
And she ready, I'm ready

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Talkin' 'bout you born ready, talkin' 'bout it's on deck (woah, woah)
Talk a good one on text, you say you 'bout it, I'm gon' check
I put some kisses on neck, let me warm that engine up
Relax when the tension's up, girl, you just call your ninja up
And I pop up in that all black and kill that (all black)
See I'm dressed appropriate, you got to feel that
Feel that? (I feel that) That's that love comin' down
For the brain, I'm dumbin' down, we on swole when she come around (yeah, woo!)
Need ice to numb it down, night stick to beat it up
Rodney King that thing, girl, can't we all just get along?
You could get along, haha, you already know
But is you ready though? (Sing, sing)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch, one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready (she ready, so ready)
She ready, so I'm ready (I'm ready)
I feel it coming on strong, you're so heavy (so heavy)
And she ready, I'm ready

If you are a bad one, be ready (be ready)
Two times for my niggas, we ready (we so ready)
Pretty ladies in the V.I., they ready (and they so ready)
I'm feeling good, feeling good, I'm ready (woo, ooh) (I'm ready, yo)
Left a girl in the back, she ready (hey) (she so ready)
We don't know how to act, we ready (we ready) (swear we're ready)
And we can't wait to get home
If you're ready, come on
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Fabolous]
And baby, we don't need a bed, no, woah
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah" (yeah!) (She like, "Yeah," she like, "Yeah")
One touch, one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready (woah! She ready, so ready) (She's ready)
She ready, so I'm ready (I'm ready) (she's ready, and I'm ready)
I feel it coming on strong, you're so heavy (it's so heavy) (so heavy)
And she ready, I'm ready (she ready, and I'm ready)

[Outro: Fabolous]
Yeah, y'all ain't ready25Embed
