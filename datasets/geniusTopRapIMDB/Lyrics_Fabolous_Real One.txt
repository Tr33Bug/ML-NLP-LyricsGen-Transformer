Real One Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
One time
AutoMatik
One time
You just need a real one one time
You just need a real one, ay

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Heard she in between dudes, just like Lauryn
Go to work everyday, take the bus like touring
She be curving all the locals, must like foreigns
And this is when I had the Martin, I was just like Lawrence
So wassup, dark windows on the Aston
Who else pull a big daddy up on Mother Gaston
I'm like “How long this hard-to-get role lasting?”
She said "I don't know, it depends who's asking"
Look, I'm Young OG, but you can call me Yogi
You say how real I am but when you do it sound bogie
So why don't you get to know me, I'll remind you of the homie
And make you forget about everybody that's before me
She said "I hope so cause them other niggas flow be
Had me getting hurt all the time, I'm like Kobe"
So I be with Adobe, M.I.A like SoBe
All these nigga tryna hit it, even bitches on the low be
Brooklyn like "Nah son", Harlem like "Yo, B"
It's wet like the ocean, with dick like Moby
We need to stick together, real one's click together
Since we both getting to it, we can hit that lick together
Get that money
[Pre-Chorus: Fabolous & Jazzy]
You just need a real one one time (get that money)
Stack up to a million one time (where we at?)
Back up in the building one time (one time)
Shout out to the real ones one time (ay)

[Chorus: Fabolous & Jazzy]
Said you might have had some but you need a real one (ay)
You might have had some but you need a real one (ay)
You might have had some but you need a real one
Said you might have had some but you need a real one (one time)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Funny how money change a situation
Real one come through, make a lituation
When you work for me it come with vacation
Trip to L.A just to hit crustaceans
Everybody eats, had the krab with the noodles
Too busy doing me to be mad at what you do
The big dogs out, better grap up your poodles
Don't let em work that magic cause Fab got that voodoo
Fab go that voodoo, yeah, Fab got that voodoo
Stick the pen in your doll, stab up your booboo
She might have had some but she need a real one
And she a bad one, realest in the building
And I'm a bad boy, I Diddy bop on Biggie block
Bad bitches can't really rock with any thot
Gotta ball, we really jocks up in the spot
I'm so Brooklyn, I Millie Rock on any block

We all need a real one one time
I know him when I see him one time
Kill 'em, and won't grieve 'em one time
But bae I'll never leave ya one time
You know I'm the type to ride with ya
Sit back, late, gettin high with ya
Kick back, bump this vibe with ya
Baby I'm just glad to be alive with ya
You complete me baby
So much, listen to me, but boy you fill me up
And I know you need me baby
You know I'm down and know just how to lift me up
So tell me the truth
Is you rocking? Cause I'm into you
Boy this parking, I'm not timing you
Boy come clock in and it's all on you
I'll come knocking...
Baby I'll be back in no time
Soon as we pause, we hit the rewind
Go back in time, slow down, 69
187, baby you are a big crime
And for you I'll do time, for you I'll do time
Long as you repay me with wine and dine
Anything you ask for with me is fine
I'll be your star baby, you my sunshine
[Pre-Chorus: Jazzy (Fabolous)]
(Tell me what you need) I just need a real one one time
(Get that money) Stack up to a million one time
(Where we at?) Back up in the building one time
(One time) Shout out to the real ones one time

[Chorus: Jazzy (Fabolous)]
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one
