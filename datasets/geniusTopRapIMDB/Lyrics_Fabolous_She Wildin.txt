She Wildinâ€™ Lyrics[Intro: Chris Brown]
Ooh, she wildin', wildin'
Ooh, she wildin', wildin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, she wildin'
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah, she wildin')
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (wildin')
She just wanna shake something
Girl, that ass gon' make money (Oh, she wildin)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (she wildin', wildin')
Said she like it rough, beat that pussy up
You ain't never fucked a thug, you gon' fall in love
A bottle of that liquid courage on the way now
All my ladies takin' shots, I know that they down (she wildin', wildin')
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang thang
Lames get shot down, she do a bang bang
She attract rappers and the ones who do the same thang
Playas in the league and the dope boys who slang thangs
All tryna pull up on her, all she do is lane change
They be all in the air, wantin' her to be the main thing
Tryna lock her down, she ain't with the Chain Gang
Wanna make her wifey, but no name change
She be on that Birkin to Chanel type of name change
She be stuntin', she be on her Jackie Chan thang
Big set of Rollies in the sky, let your thang swang
Might wear the iced out, might Plain Jane
Either way you know what time it is, gotta maintain
Mr. Chow's girl, not a P.F. Chang thang
Whole crew bad, it's a pretty gang thang
Long hair, don't care, let it hang thang

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, she wildin'
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah, she wildin')
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (wildin')
She just wanna shake something
Girl, that ass gon' make money (Oh, she wildin)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (she wildin', wildin')
Said she like it rough, beat that pussy up
You ain't never fucked a thug, you gon' fall in love
A bottle of that liquid courage on the way now
All my ladies takin' shots, I know that they down (she wildin', wildin')

Yeah, I said ooh, she pop a Molly and do her thang thang
Take the grapefruit and do that brain thang
Man, that ruby red, that shit done changed things
I'm about to bust, but before I go bang bang
Hold up, she climb up on it like she King Kong
Back and forth on the table, like she ping pong
She tell me play the dirty version, not the clean song
She tell me fuck her in the dark, with my bling on
And she do this thing to me, she know I like, yeah
She need no one-two check, she know that mic, yeah
She like when Spider-Man climb up them walls, ooh
She be so wet, feel like you in The Falls, ooh
She like Niagara, man, fuck your Viagra, woah
She make you cum fast and fuck up your swagger, woah
She make you come back, like that boomerrang, nice
Ooh, she be wildin' when she do her thang
When she do her thang
When she do her thang
When she do her thang
Ooh, she be wildin', when she do her thang

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ooh, she wilding, yeah, yeah

Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (yeah, ooh, she)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang (wildin')

Girl, that ass gon' make money (make money)
Ooh, she wildin', wildin', she do her thang, thang
