Tell Ya Friends Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
You know them hoes don't want to see you happy baby, yeah

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Make sure you tell 'em every detail
Make sure you CC 'em on that email
Talk how that Mercedes gettin' detailed
Mention that new C.C. bag at retail
Them hoes be jel, never wish me well
Told my lady that I'm leggin' bitches like I'm Miguel
Big mouth bitch, we just call her Gmail
You know everybody had her Gmail
My nigga Craig said, "Deebo, that's a female"
I say she fuckin' like a nigga, that's a she-male
Every crew got a Shady one just like D12
All she ride is dick, you ridin' that V12
In that S6, talking on a 6S
Not no gossip, just makin' moves and success
These bitches flexin' on a baller alert
Guess they don't know, that's a bitch who need baller allure
(Oh you ain't know) Gossip just a broke people sport
(Oh you ain't know) Deep pockets, even deeper thoughts
(Oh you ain't know) Snakes in the grass, keep it short
(Oh you ain't know) Free Wi-Fi and it's cheap to talk, so, go...
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low (whoooa ohh-whoa)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She don't want the key to your heart
She want the key to your whip
If she had the key to your heart, she'll prolly key up your whip
I'm tellin' her, egos trip but the humble doesn't stumble, baby
You feelin' yo'self, I'm the one that numb you, baby
I seen it come together and I seen it crumble, baby
Let them keep score, we just do our numbers, baby
Everybody talkin', I feel like a trendin' topic
Hashtag, I bet your mouth bigger than your pocket
I got you and your bag, new CÃ©line
Got you Young Fly, FawwwkUMean
Let them groupies chat in the group chat
Niggas tryna shoot they shot but don't know where the hoops at
Bitch you know I'm ballin', if you smart, you would recruit that
Niggas catchin' plays, ask me where the alley-oops at
Man you know this game is vicious
All they want is fame and riches
Wifin' up the lamest bitches and they tellin' same as snitches
So...

Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low (whoooa ohh-whoa-ohh)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Interlude: Phendi]
Listen, me and my bitches are like sisters
So of course we gonna give our opinion on everything ok cool, granted P I'm never the type of female the call my bitches haters
If they give they opinion on my relationship
If my relationship is fucked up, but bitch
If I tell you I'm happy my relationship
If I tell you I'm happy with my nigga
Just be happy that I'm happy
Bitch, I ain't gotta lie to you, I'm grown
And they always wanna bring up what ya nigga did in the past
Okay cool, you was a hoe in past, bitch, I stood by you
[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, the shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, the shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, the shit is pointless
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen (ooooh-ohhh)
How I roll, how I be on the low
(Woooooooooooooooooooohhh, wooooooooooooohhhhh)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
