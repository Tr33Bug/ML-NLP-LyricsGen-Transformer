The Hope Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yeah (You're now listening to AraabMUZIK)
Yup, HA-HAAAEEH!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Don't make me put one of y'all in the grave (uh-huh)
I'm playing with money, y'all niggas save (yup)
The pain I'ma cause is something y'all couldn't phase (mm)
Couple niggas shot 'cause one of y'all niggas brave
Rushin' 'em to the ER, rushin' me to the stage
It's The Soul Tape 3, nothin' we need to say
Leave the handguns at home, fuck 'em, just bring the K's
For the homies in the county with nothing that's eating trays
Since I started eating my motto is eat away (eat)
Top 5 is always followed by DOA (yeah)
Thought I was on top when I bottled a key of yay (uh)
Then I went straight from the block to the VMA's
The way the hands move on the clock you'd be amazed (yup)
You just feel the burn, nigga, you don't see the blaze (uh)
Take a good look at my eyes, you'll see the haze
Right left, life or death, either ways
Same tough guys'll cry when they see you laid
Never show your hand, they dying to see your spades
I'm married to the game, you dying to get engaged
You only gangsta when the lions is in the cage (coward)
Your life's worth nothing, the goons had it appraised (uh)
I might do the Wraith, maroon with the beige
Bad bitch with me, doobie with the shades (uh)
If you ain't self employed, then truly you a slave
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Tooly to your waves, brain on your winter coat
Niggas burning bridges then expecting you to send a boat
If I'm coming at your neck, think a bullet in the throat
Never gon' forget you niggas, got 'em written in my notes
I'ma send the goons (yeah), a snitch gone, send the folks
They gon' kill you just 'cause, don't make me send the locs
New blue hunnids (yeah), spending C-notes
Fresh pair of Timbs, vintage pea-coats (woo!)
I'm a stand up nigga, never been a joke
Riding since pedal bikes with reflectors in the spokes
I snuck up from behind, put the game in a yoke
You apply a little pressure and them rookies finna choke
Niggas looking washed up, it's something in the soap (huh)
You looking like Adrien Broner in the ropes (huh)
My shoes is 2 racks, I should be in the slopes
Might come through in the bubble same way they send the pope
Parading down 5th Ave like I'm in a float (yeah)
That new 850 push button like remote (woo!)
Control is hard to have, especially when you broke
They sleep because they eatin', but you hungry and you woke
Shorty mouth wet, but her strength is in the stroke
Greatest of all time so her name has been the GOAT
She say you got the people waitin' for it then it's dope (yeah)
The game is fucked up, but if you back then it's hope, niggaYou might also like10Embed
