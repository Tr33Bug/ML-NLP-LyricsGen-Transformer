The Plug Lyrics[Produced by Sonaro]

[Intro]
Mi amor usted no sabe cuanto lo quiero
Pablo

[Verse 1]
She callin' me Fablo
She think that I'm Pablo (Esco)
She watch too much Narcos (let's go)
She think I'm the Narcos
I buy till the bar close
I hit Neiman Marcus (blow that)
Fuck a Wells Fargo
It's stacks in my cargos (you know that)
Griselda Blanco, she got the donk though (okay..)
Whippin' that foreign like it's the Bronco (okay..)
I'm on the highway like I caught a body (woo!)
Me and compadre smokin' beats by Dre, loud to the head (head)
Takin' loud to the head (head)
First we count up the blessings (bless)
Then we count up the bread (bread)
I can count on the squad (squad)
I can count 'em like one, two, three (ay)
Everything gotta run through me (ay)
You know Jefe the one to see
Don't you get comfortable nigga
Cause that's when they come for you nigga
Not here to comfort you nigga
Lay you like comforter nigga
You know where I come from my nigga
I am from the iron jungle my nigga
I done seen the lions rumble my nigga
Listen up you Brian Gumbel ass niggas
Young OG is back to humble you niggas, plug
[Chorus]
I got what you want, I know what you waaant
(I know what you want)
I got what you need, I know what you neeeed
(I know what you need)
I got what you like, I know what you liiike (I know what you like)
I got what you love, I am your plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she fell in lo-o-o-ove
She want the plug, she want the plu-u-u-g
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug

[Verse 2]
She givin' me Besos, she feelin' my dress code
I blame Ernesto, it's your fault Ernesto (Clue...)
Took me to the west coast, linked me with Nate Dogg
I gotta cook up now, ain't no marinate dog
It's no time to wait dog, wait dog, wait dog
We done sellin' weight dog, weight dog, weight dog
If I fell away dog, they feel a way dog
They come with AK's dog, like it's Kuwait dog
All we, know is, B.I.T.E, we a-ggressive, sharks
Don't you, ask us, nothin, fuck a, question, mark
Flyest, nigga, in it, spit the, freshest, bars
This is, Narco, swag, call me, Freshco-bar (niicce!)

I got what you want, I know what you waaant
(I know what you want)
I got what you need, I know what you neeeed
(I know what you need)
I got what you like, I know what you liiike (I know what you like)
I got what you love, I am your plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she fell in lo-o-o-ove
She want the plug, she want the plu-u-u-g
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug

[Outro]
Gimme me some head, she be a plu-u-u-ug
Fuckin me good, she be a plu-u-u-ug
Holdin me down, she be the plu-u-u-ug
Whatever I need, she be the plu-u-u-ug
Que lo que esta pasando
Te necesito tanto, te extra√±o
Por favor regresa Pablo
Pablo en la calle no hay amigos
Porque no me contesta
Usted lo sabe que yo lo amo, regresa
Pablo yo lo amo y no te podemos perder
Por favor tenga mucho cuidado porque la calle es mala
Y aqui hay muchos traicioneros, regrese
Pablo tu estas mejor, yo lo amo para toda la vida, mi amor
Cuanto lo quiero
