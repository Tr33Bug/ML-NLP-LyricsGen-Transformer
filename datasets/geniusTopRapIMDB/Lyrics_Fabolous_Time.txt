Time Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
Somebody told me the greatest gift you can give somebody is your time
'Cause when you give your time
You givin' a portion of your life that—
That you'll never get back
Yeah

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Fabolous]
Shawty, I never meant to hurt you, hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach, curtains
Since I got my bag up, I cashed out on a Birkin
I ain't gotta question myself, know you worth it
I don't want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high (Uh)
I just wanna bust down with you, we can just fly (Yeah, yeah)
I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I had to buy that watch I knew it would take time
Just like Rolex I'm always gon' make time
Been through some rough patches but also had great times
I mean, we done did it all except for the state time
But we got time in and I'm tryna do life
Got a ring to go with it, if you tryna be wife
'Cause this lifestyle savage and it kinda be trife
It's so many backstabbers at your spine with a knife
But her, she ain't no bust down thotiana (Thotiana)
So she get the bust down watchiana (Watchiana)
Drippin' like she just now out the sauna (Out the sauna)
She take off and touch down in designer
She a spicy mami, sorry it's pricey mami
I got caught once, I ain't had the right one by me
Had me lookin' crazy, yeah, shiesty, grimy
So I hit her wrist with ice, tsunami, just 'cause

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Shawty, I never meant to hurt you, hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach, curtains
Since I got my bag up, I cashed out on a Birkin
I ain't gotta question myself, know you worth it
I don't want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high
I just wanna bust down with you, we can just fly
I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time

Yeah (Yeah)
They always tellin' me that time is money (Time is money)
But I never could do shit with that, uh
'Cause the money, come the money go
But the time, you never get it back
If I could turn the hands of time back
I'd bring Cliff, Nipsey and Prime back, bring Ring's mom back
I mean, I wish I could rewind back
More than the Raptors wish Kawhi would sign back
But he didn't (But he didn't), so cherish the time you was given
Be thankful you eatin' not just on Thanksgiving
You can right your wrongs as long as your living
I don't ask to be forgotten, I just ask to be forgiven
Life is too short for grudges, too long for DA's and judges
Who wrongfully convict niggas
I'm talkin' Central Park Five, Jena Six niggas
Exonerated, but that time still tick nigga, damn

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Shawty, I never meant to hurt you, hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach, curtains
Since I got my bag up, I cashed out on a Birkin
I ain't gotta question myself, know you worth it
I don't want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high
I just wanna bust down with you, we can just fly
I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time (Time)4Embed
