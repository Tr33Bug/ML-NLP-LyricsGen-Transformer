To the Sky Lyrics[Intro: 070 Shake]
To the sky
To the sky
To the sky
To the sky
To the sky

[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
And every time I move, you know
You really start to lose it all
And every time you see me, 310
You ain't know me, you excluded 310
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
My homie got back so I had it locked, pour it up
This homie's dope got me satisfied, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up
[Chorus: 070 Shake & Fabolous]
I mean but what else we gon' do but level up, huh? Yeah
Still sit down and play loud
Still don't go at all
But she naked now
Still sit down and play loud
It's Young OG, the motivator
Still don't go at all
But she naked now
Break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
Welcome to part two, it's level up now
Level up, level up, level up, level up
Let's go

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You playin' with the wrong nigga, word to Rich Homie
Prolly wanna off me cause your bitch on me
Gotta switch phones when it gets phony
Verizon man ass niggas switched on me
It ain't about the sprint, it's 'bout the marathon
I came back ballin' in a pair of Brons
Prolly went over your head like a carry-on
Prolly went over for head with all my jewelry on
Told her level me up, told her level me up, yeah
Told my jeweler free the boutique then I put 70 up
I get to talk down if they never been up, yeah
The space you haters is in I pray I never end up, hold up
I do the money dance when I make bands
What you broke niggas do? Break dance
Got the bookin' info if you're tryna make plans
I chase the money like Joe Budden do Drake fans
Through the sunroof screamin' money ain't a thing
Hand full of rocks, money made a ring
I do the walk through then I run to David Bling
DeMarcus Cousin flow, I'm an underrated King
Look, sex me in the back, head in the Masi'
Put some money where your mouth is, Ted DiBiase
Pass the D'usse instead of that Courvoisier
Hit Cookie on the way, got bomb in bed with Taraji
Now level up

To the sky, to the sky
To the sky, to the sky
Stay awhile, sit down and play loud
Still don't go at all
But you naked now
Stay awhile, sit down and play loud
Still don't go at all, but you naked now
But she naked now, ha, yeah
Level up, level up, to the sky
Level up, level up, to the sky, where we goin'?
Level up, level up, to the sky, Shake, where we goin'?
Level up, level up, to the sky, oh, oh, oh
The Family, 070, I mean we come from the bottom too, there ain't much we can do but level up. Gotta weather the storm
'cause the weather always changes, feel me?
Level up, level up, level up, level up, to the sky
Level up, level up, level up, level up, yo...3Embed
