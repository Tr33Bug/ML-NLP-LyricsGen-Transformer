We Get High Lyrics[Intro]
When I stopped to care, then I find there is no one there
When I stopped to care, then I find there is no one there
But I think of you and I know we are something new
We get high and high, crazy blue like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at, where you at

[Chorus]
We get high and high, crazy blue, like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at
We get high and high, crazy blue, like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at
[Verse 1]
Stimulate your mind, girl, it's friday that you ain't got shit to do
I'll put you on to some real shit if you ain't scared to take a hit or two
Stay away from that reggie, can't deal with the middle men
Who gives a fuck if he keeping clean, you can't ride on the lil' ten's
They say they got it, they ain't got it, they won't seem to feel no guilt
Got peanut butter, but no jelly, got cereal, but no milk
Where I'm from that's a half ass nigga, half of the time 'ol half past nigga
Mad cause they can't get down with the team
Still standing at the end of the draft ass nigga
Getting high on these low lives, dead these chumps give em no life
Cut em loose, keep your knife
Don't meet a ho and make her your wife
Don't make a ho, your husband either
Hard to win the game when you're playing with a cheater
I be telling them that you can't change nigga
Better off, keeping that change, for the meter

[Chorus]
We get high and high, crazy blue, like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at
We get high and high, crazy blue, like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at

[Verse 2]
How high? How high? Just came from the OG, man
My eyes so red, man, that M-E-T-H-O-D Man
I'm talking about pimping been since
Pimping been since been pimping
I'm talking about going, motherfuckers saying that ain't other
Tell em no more mister Nice Guy, you hoes way past Half Baked
If I got paid to hear chicks lie, would make more cheese than Kraft make
And these nigga be acting up, Ri Ri must be serious
Wonder what that shit hittin' for, real nigga is curious
These nigga stuck on my whole joint
Already know how I feel
Let a chick know she is not low, even though she's in high heels
Six hundred for the gas, that ain't nothin' but a high bill, bitch donâ€™t be a high kill, you know he getting high over there...

Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at
We get high and high, crazy blue, like Saint Elmo's Fire
Love's so sharp and fly, that it's hard to know just where you at12Embed
