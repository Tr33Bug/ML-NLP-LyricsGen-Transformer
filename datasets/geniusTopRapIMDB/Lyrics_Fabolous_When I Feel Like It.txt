When I Feel Like It Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
I ain't in no rush
I handle you niggas when I feel like it
I just be chillin'
Your bitch is chillin' too

[Hook: Fabolous]
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
The way it's shaped they say it's fake, I can't lie I still like it
No snitch I can't tell if it look real and it feel like it
She bend it over, I will hike it, number one pick, got skills like it
Heard she fucks with some ball player, when I touch down I still spike it
Know I got that check on me, I'm not Nike but it feel like it
At the game on them floor seats, I ain't Spike but I feel like it
We ain't friends, we don't chill like it, you ain't my dog we don't bill like it
My nigga no camera man but he be flashing them steels like it
Where I'm from it ain't Iraq but swear to God it get real like it
Got soldiers in the field like it, bout mine, you get killed like it
Pussy niggas be commentating, say they ain't hating but it feel like it
Just post a pic of me and his boo on Instagram, think he'll like it

[Hook]
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I ain't a chef I make meals like him, cut them up in thin slices
I got bricks like constructions
You want instructions? You niggas ain't built like me
Competition ain't real like me, I'm so sick, who ill like me?
Two bitches in my suite, so when I leave I bet them bitches still diking
Family good cause I feel like it, I'm hood cause I feel like it
Might not be your favorite artist
But your favorite artist got a verse from me, so they still like it
Ain't nobody popping seals like me, codeine like a supplement
If I make her cum it's a compliment, nigga fuck you, like a parking ticket
Now I got 'caine, like a walking stick, shoot you for a argument
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get
I'm getting rich cause I feel like it, take your girl cause I feel like it
Cash her out, toss her up, wash her up that's the spin cycle
And them niggas never did like it, in the car and I got the title
Grandma bought me a hand bible, I bought me a hand rifle
Cause I feel like it, all you niggas look re-cycled
And I'm getting head in the car, while she's driving

When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it9Embed
