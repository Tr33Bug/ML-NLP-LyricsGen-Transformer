Wolves In Sheeps Clothing Lyrics[Intro]
Them niggas is talking baby
Don't mind them, they just talking
They know they can't fuck with me baby
You tell them like that bitch told Scarface
What did she say
I don't fuck with the help

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
They say they're out for dead Presidents, never respect it
First of all, Ben Franklin was never elected
That means him and Big Bills have never connected
They just say it cause they think it sounds clever on records
Secondly God's first should never be second
And if you living wrong, money can never correct it
I'mma say it once then it's whoever direct it
You never get off on me, I'm never the exit
All black everything in my black V
It ain't a game, if it was it'd be a black Wii
I'm on my A game, never on that B shit
You on that B shit, you never gonna be shit
That's how I see shit, cause I am de shit
True story, like that Hollywood E! shit
I say F niggas cause I'm on some G shit
Yeah, that red-and-green stripe double G shit
That was for my homie, just know I'm thinking of you
I told him stay on top so they can't get above you
He told me I dig that, like a fucking shovel
Why it take a nigga to go to jail to say he love you
We be killing them, boy we be killing them
Damn we used to dream to have a million
Now the family get money like Will and them
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium
My baby girl got ass, it's no secret that it
Make you look away and still be peeking at it
She said they come with painted-faces trying to clown on you
How they under you but try to talk down on you
You see, a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar
Tell my bitch that I'm no good as if they're any better
But her loyalty keep her from them other boys
Let em holla, she just gonna exist above the noise
[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Paul is sorta like
A nigga with the swag of a Yao Ming balla type, but more Rich Porter type
A small giant, nigga, we not at all alike
The shit you just discovering I've been doing all my life
Y'all niggas call it balling, I just call it life
I'm still the same as day 1, I dont get caught in all the hype
So wussup Dash, I can't call it Ike
I guess they don't see Paul they only see all the ice
Yellow everything lemon head sour jewels
Rich head to toe aviator fly Howard Hughes
Enjoy the best of everything, we paid our dues
So niggas wanna jump ship and join our cruise
But this ain't no joy ride when my boys ride
Somewhere somebody's boy died and never will your boy hide
I'm on frontline no matter how drastic
But otherwise you can find me where the cash is
In love with the rapids; no, I dont mean white water rafting
I'm talking bout them 4 door Astons
Addicted to fashion, diamonds, flashing
But the money music and fast cars is my passion
I'm no newbie, nor am I a has-been
These whack rappers give me headaches, this just the aspirin
I often speak through my actions
But paint pictures with words that you can close your eyes and imagineYou might also like11Embed
