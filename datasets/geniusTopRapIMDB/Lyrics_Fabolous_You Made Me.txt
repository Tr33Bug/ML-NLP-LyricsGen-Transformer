You Made Me Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous & (Tish Hyman)]
I think we all try to be good people
But it's just things you go through that make you who you are, yeah
Nigga this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)
Yeah, nigga this is how you made me (this is how you made me)
(This is how you, this is how you, this is how you made me)

[Chorus: Fabolous & (Tish Hyman)]
Hol' up, last time I trust a nigga he betrayed me
Last time I trust a  bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Thinkin' 'bout my old girlfriend, lil' mama played me (what?!)
Left me for some light skin cat with a Mercedes (what?!)
Back then I didn't have no whip, had to upgrade me (uh)
Now I got those white boy M's, she ain't as shady
Well karma is a bitch, baby (yeah)
Oh you wasn't tryna chill hoes? (Remember that?)
One day karma kicks you in the ass (oh yeah)
And I hope she wearin' steel toes
Tried to have my head all twisted, won't let 'em braid me (nah)
I just gotta be who I be, don't let it jade me (nah)
Life gave me lemons, it's time to lemonade me (uh-huh)
Music to my ears, the lies just serenade me (hold up)
And what they did to me, I done it to the next (it's my turn)
What goes around is comin' to you next (oh it's comin', baby)
I dress like I'ma run into my ex (ay)
And every time I run into her flex, uh

[Chorus: Fabolous & (Tish Hyman)]
Hol' up, last time I trust a nigga, he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me

Your boy tried to fuck me over, thought we was homies
Guess he was a h-o-e when I say hoemies (yeah)
Niggas get some money then act like they don't know me
Got a new phone, cut off the old phonies
They ain't never pick up for me when I used to call
And they ain't never pass the rock when they used to ball
And they ain't never help me up when I used to fall
Kept tryin' to do it big, fuck gettin' used to small
After the success it's like yes they used to know me
Now it ain't no 'Nenehs nigga, I got Naomis (woo!)
Shoulda paid attention before you haters owe me (huh)
Since you down there on your knees, go ahead and blow me
Suck a dick, tell a hater suck a dick (tell 'em)
Just a hood nigga that hit a fuckin' lick (tell 'em)
I keep my head up and I ain't never duckin shit (tell 'em)
I'm self made, I don't owe a motherfucker shit, boi

[Chorus: Fabolous & (Tish Hyman)]
Hol' up, last time I trust a nigga, he betrayed me
Last time I trust a bitch, she played me
Pardon me if I've been on one lately
Yeah, this is how you niggas made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
(This is how you, this is how you) this is how you made me
