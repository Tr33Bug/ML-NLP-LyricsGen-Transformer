Cool & Dre

Black game
(Is)
Terror Squad (I, I, I, I, I)
The remix

[Lil Wayne]
Gotta say my name
Weezy F. Baby
(This is) Weezy F. Baby
Aka it's the remix baby
Now let me get into it
And do it how I do it
Yeah, long hair don't care like the jewish
Garbage man
I'll be dumpin
And I eat beef but the cow eat nuthin
You probably say I didn't when I did
Or I wasn't when I was
And I'm not when I'm is
You and yo homies wack
You probably had too much of that corny yack
So watch where ya goin
And know where you at
Cause me and my goonz don't know you like that
Never been a sucka
Metal in the duffle
I'm all about my chips
I gets my ruffles
Joey I got ya
B boy bluffing
I'm doin the Hulk Hogan but they ain't sayin nuthin
[Hook: Fat Joe]
You ain't sayin nuthin
I be spendin euros by the pound I'm talkin London
If it ain't about some millions boy you ain't sayin nuthin, you ain't sayin nuthin
Actin like you tough, when it go down you go to runnin
Boy you ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't about money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)

[The Game]
Ayo macho, check it
(You ain't sayin nuthin) (If it ain't bout money, money)
I gotta pocket full of benjamins and I'm so cold
My neck froze like a penguin, somewhere in England
Waitin for my little duffle bag girl to land, with duffle bag in hand
It's louis vuitton and
She flyer than a eagle
Hood like a regal
She make my deposit, my closet is fresh segal
I rain terror, yes I rain terror
Put my name on ya mind my style is New Era
I been down in miami, sippin ballets with Khaled
I gotta secret to tell that boy ain't from Cali
He from mars
Flow sicker than sars
Tore into his cars
My dunk sittin bigger than yours
I got, big gunz, real big gunz
Spit like a dominican I call dat shit Big Pun
And any nigga that's a enemy to crack is a enemy to me
Terror Squad and the P
