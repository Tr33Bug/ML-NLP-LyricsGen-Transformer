Aloha Lyrics[Intro: Rico Love] + (Fat Joe)
Hello (Coca)
Aloha (Krillz-mania)
It's love (yeah)
Turn the lights on!

[Hook: Pleasure P]
I ain't gotta lie, so don't even trip
I'm super duper fly, you know that I'm the shit
220 on the dash, that forty on my hip
Throw up a bunch of cash, make them bitches do the splits
They say - hello, hello, hello - aloha
Because they know that I'm the shit
They say - hello, hello, hello - aloha
Aloha... because I'm so fly
[Fat Joe]
Yeah, yo
I'm "Supa Dupa Fly," you can call me Missy's boo
Pull up in the SLR, have all the mamis sick of you
All them college credits, you can throw them things away
You ain't gon' be needin a job, you fuckin with Jose
Hey~! Hello, hello, aloha, I go hard
I'm so fly, we so hot, they so not - sheeeeit
Them other niggas is lame
Seent you on the sidelines, time to put you in the game
Coca be the name, party's up in Diddy's house
Pushed her through the Bronx just to show her what the city 'bout
Touched a couple blocks, got the dough and skate off
And just like Bernie, me and my baby Madoff
Hello!

[Hook]

[Rico Love]
Try to play me short, I'mma fuck around and fade a bitch
Fresh up off the porch on that Kool-Aid and them tater chips
Don't fuck with lames, cause they be on that hater shit
If you got a problem with me go ahead, say that shit
I'm scuba divin in Jamaica trick
Put the mic down, I'm on that Anita Baker shit
Or you could find me on the charts
Or up in St. Barts racing European cars
Screamin fuck the law and my baby momma raw
And she my baby momma cause them other bitches flaw
Aww! I'm what them other bitches call
A motherfuckin pimp, it's pimpin when I'm involved
Hello!

Now tell me why these haters wanna see the end of Joe?
Honestly, I'm runnin out of ways to spend my dough
I'm burnin down the stores, I'm such a shopaholic
What'cha know it ain't trickin if you really got it
Louis scarfs, Louis frames, Louis trunks
Louis boxers, got all the Louis she wants, yeah~!
And you ain't got nuttin for us
Millions on the tourin and the crib ain't got a mortgage
Yes I'm the rain man, must I remind you?
Throw it in the air, watch her spread it like the swine flu
Ha ha! They say Joey on some other shit
And if that bitch start actin up, I go and grab my other bitch
