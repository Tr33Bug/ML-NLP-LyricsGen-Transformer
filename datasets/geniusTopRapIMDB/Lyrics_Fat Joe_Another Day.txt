Another Day Lyrics[Intro: French Montana]
Crack! Sometimes you have to take it a day at a time
You know when you hear that Haaaaa [?]

[Hook: Tiara Thomas & French Montana]
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin' good today
I hear the (gunshot sound), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didn't have to use the K today
Made it through another day
[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
In my hood everyday niggas get locked down
Best friends hit on your girl and get 'em knocked down
Teachers tell you quick, you niggas'll never be shit
Dropped so much coke in the water, could make the sea sick
All I hear is sirens and sounds of guns blastin'
A little girl went missin' but ain't nobody askin'
My nigga Lil Troy hit the bank said he need cash
Seen him on the news I guess he forgot the ski mask
Strippers and celebrities, Instagram's a lick
Niggas rantin bout gay, cause ignorance is bliss
Shorty changin' food stamps just to get high
Listenin' to Stevie, "Ribbon in the Sky"
Homie reminiscin', I'm keepin' him in my prayers
Cause Joe crack cares, even if no one else cares
See me on the screen but I'm still the same G
They thought I'd never see outside of 5V

[Hook: Tiara Thomas & French Montana]
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin' good today
I hear the (gunshot sound), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin' good today
I hear the, but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didn't have to use the K today
Made it through another day

Welcome home my nigga Joe Crack
Bust a bottle of that black shit lets go
New seven series charcoal gray Beamer
Joe Crack, Dope Boy, nigga Don Cartegena
All the sixes we collect, bitches we could sex
Phone still tapped so it's best to send a text
Go and do a bid back home just like a king
Bucket full of crab, money bags that we seen
From Rikers to Fisher Isle, digits to digits pilin'
New Wraith with soft plates, long as the bitches smilin'
Ciroc boy, AP on the rocks
New Sunseeker, four mill on a yacht
I came from the mud, Def Jam the new plug
Five gold joints and still gets no love
I walk the same block, rode the same trains
We fucked the same bitches, whipped the same cane
(Boss!)

[Hook: Tiara Thomas & French Montana]
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin' good today
I hear the (gun shot sound), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin' good today
I hear the (gun shot sound), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didn't have to use the K today
Made it through another day8Embed
