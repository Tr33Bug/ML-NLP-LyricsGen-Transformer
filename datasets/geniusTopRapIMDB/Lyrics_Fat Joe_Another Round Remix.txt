Another Round (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous & Mary J. Blige]
I just like waking up right next to that thing
La dee da da
Have to roll over and go another round, yeah

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]
I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No, I won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Boy, I know I want another round, another round (another round with you)
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you
[Verse 1: Fabolous & Mary J. Blige]
Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty (yeah)
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty (nah)
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie (check that)
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy (oh)
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable (oh)
You been around since the Lunchables, girl, I fucks with you (oh)
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two (oh)
I'm just playin' with you, thinkin' 'bout stayin' with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playin' with it 'cause you like it raw
Might need a mornin' after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're tryna fight me more, yeah

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]
I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No, I won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Boy, I know I want another round, another round (another round with you)
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yo
Cake cake cake cake cake, you know you love it
Icin' like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you, you a star, I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard, in these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you comin' back to back, more sex to cook up
Haha, but ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

'Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Boy, I know I want another round, another round (another round with you)
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her (you and her)
And now you got me and only me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
See, she done came down
Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drank from me
Ever since I came 'round
She say she feel wrong 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn 'bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rollin' 24's through the hood, women checkin' for me
Girl, I ain't playin' 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearin' somethin' special for me
And I'ma lay it down
Round one, two and three, can you keep up with me?

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]
I won't be holding back, my love (I won't be holding back)
I won't be holding back (no, I won't)
I won't be holding back, my love (I won't, I won't)
No, I won't be holding back (I won't, I won't)
'Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Boy, I know I want another round, another round (oh, another round with you)
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you
[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah3Embed
