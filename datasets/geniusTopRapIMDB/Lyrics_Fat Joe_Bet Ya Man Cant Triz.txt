Bet Ya Man Can’t (Triz) Lyrics[Intro: Fat Joe & Cuban Link]
Bam
Bang-bang, baby
Yeah, Terror Squad style
Trizzie, check it out now (Yo)

[Verse 1: Cuban Link]
I'm rated X in sex, I flex like Lex Luger
So who's next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba?
We do maneuvers like Super Dave, always with a group of babes
Laying mamis out like Sugar Ray
'Cause Cuban Link don't play games, miss, I flip and do some strange ****
With you like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I'll get you naked like I'm mystic 'cause this **** is
Thick as a brick, long with big ***** that fits it
Now let's get physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snicker bar 'cause I'm the pick-up artist
That'll stick you quicker than a spic'll strip a car
My repertoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin' more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin' in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up
[Chorus: Big Pun, Lo-Key & Fat Joe]
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Like that)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Like that)
I'll make you scream "Papa" (You the best, dada)
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Like that)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Yeah, uh, uh, like that, yo)
I'll make 'em scream "Papa" (You the best, bana)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Paradin' in the Palladium, all eyes on my presence
Poppin' the Cris', sportin' the chick straight out of Essence
Word up, patch thug, three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like 'Who is he, lookin' like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drunk pissy
Wanna lay the love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin' a killin' off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem like I'm conceited with the cream talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
When we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T.S. for one second and find your girl missin'

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
Baby, make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party 'til mañana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, gimme some Mississippi masala
I'll be in the sala chupin' the nalga like the chupacabra
Cool it, mama, you gettin' too hot, bust a shot
Boo-yaa, rub it up and down like my oowops
Sucia, show me your dirty dance
The way you work them pants make any man wanna jerk his hand
You might also like[Chorus: Big Pun, Lo-Key & Cuban Link]
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Like that)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (Like that)
I'll make you scream "Papa" (You the best, bana, yo)

[Verse 4: Cuban Link]
My ***** official, I get in you like Keith Murray
Bury my beef deep in your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas, did you ask me?
Pass me those ***cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the back seat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal, mami? You wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani

[Verse 5: Triple Seis]
Come on, mami, you comin' home with me
All night in my tub drinkin' Hennessy
Gettin' lied up with your thighs up
I'ma surprise her when I rise up inside her
Yippee ki-yay, I'ma ride her and guide her
Straight to the triz, where we goin'? Straight to the crib
Pun in here and Cuban and Seis, you know what time it is
Soon as we walk in the crib, let's get biz
Triz, triz, triz, triz
Triz, triz, triz, triz (Okay), triz
[Chorus: Big Pun & Lo-Key]
Since ya man can't do it like Link (Like Link)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (Like Seis)
I'll make you scream "Papa" (You the best, dada)
Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (Like Crack)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (Like Pun)
I'll make you scream "Papa" (You the best, bana)
Bet ya man can't do it like Link (Like Link)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (Like Seis)
I'll make you scream "Papa" (You the best, dada)
Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (Like Crack)
He can't work the middle 'cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (Like Pun)
I'll make 'em scream "Papa", adios, mama
