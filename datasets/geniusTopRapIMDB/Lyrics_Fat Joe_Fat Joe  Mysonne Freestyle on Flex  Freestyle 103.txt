Fat Joe & Mysonne Freestyle on Flex | Freestyle #103 Lyrics[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yo
We got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas
I fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke
Niggas fake with having I'm lacing karats
Darlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics
I was rich when they wasn't still rich when you was
Men it is what it is I'm a habitual plug
If I said it you say I was pathological
Got shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital
I was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats
Talks of killing his mom's I couldn't live with regrets
Coco
Yo-oh yo-oh
So many bitches I swear I'm a dickless
Now that the bags is different to talk different
Alright here we go
Yo here we go

Yo

So many bitches I swear I'm a dickless
Now that the bags is bigger they talk different
She want the best life now so here's your wish miss
We've been shitting or some about to do Christmas
Off white colored a truck to the hood love them toys
Ain't no future and there's some good love and joy
Skin brown color on the joy
We mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise
I told flex I'm a thug man I'm a die fly
Chanel forego 60 bands New York's flag
I chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert
My Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert, I'm saying
Salam alaykom my uni country you know listen
Um
Trendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice
We woke up at the awards every rapper just like me
I inspire the bosses
Shit I've been moving white like fire in crosses
No trump intended
Made me a menace that's work on the team playing when
Zach was on Memphis
When he win for the grounds real don't tell you how
There's some other motherfucking clown will
And you could think spike for the motion pictures
A couple Jesus ain't nice that's the frozen scriptures
Team rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping
Pick and roll caught him (M)alone and I'm Stockton
And you wonder why them niggas depress
We selling the same dope I just picture the best, is coca

Uh-huh yeah
I done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves
Hustled in the cold and below zero degrees
I'd have seen shit that most probably wouldn't believe
So the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze
Yo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far
The lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars
The bar set they reach now I'm resetting that bar
Promised y'all by tomorrow I'm gonna be mentioned with God
This is me catching the charge, premeditated murder one
The cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son
Huh you heard I'm fronting, then somebody lied
You heard somebody did something to me somebody died
And if they didn't kill him, bet somebody tried
So if he's still alive then God was on somebody's side
Somebody try to defined Myse no definition
One of the best cats that'spitting that get no recognition
I repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didn't numbers
And 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us
Dumb us we let these retreats not much
Jay Z tried tell us don't let this shit become us
What you see that's how they want us beef and fueling
Among us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us
Then they lock us up for the same cane that brung us
We got to change the game but just maintain the hunger
The aim is getting younger they're shooting at our babies now
Feminizing men, dudes moving like ladies now
They said you sound like a hater sometimes I say
Nah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying
They've been waiting to find my kind
Divine being a shining McDonald's climax by just using my mind
Cuz nah I don't touch 'em see what they did to Russell
Some of these chicks done turning rape into hustle
Now have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you
I swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you
But listen I'm trying to tell you that shit is a scam
They trying to divide the black women and men
So as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize
For that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize
You see when my father died I swear my mama tried
To turn me to a man I ain't fell she is qualified
That's why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides
And the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize
That's why I despise when the rats got idolized
You played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified
Nigga I defied them odds and I survived
I'm 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized
They say that I provide a feeling that's undenied
Barring nobody I am the realest nigga alive
Your feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride
Yeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides
For the minute that y'all decide to celebrate authenticity
Every category you have it's gonna mention me nigga
I gave him history facts bars consistently
How the hell they don't respect that it's a mystery
So fuck y'all listen they don't mean shit to me
Seeing my people revolve is my victory
Harry Belafonte well I call him Mr. B
Said I had a gift God gave that gift to me
To lead the people from bondage and out of misery
Swami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me
You see my mission different that's why I see shit differently
Shit you might see a success I might disagree
Chick you might be paying for sex I might get for free
I think it's lame to pay for sex but it might just be me
Maybe it's just the grease, levels and different leagues
I'm war already that's why I'm always in fatigue
Listen please, don't get it confused because
I'm elevating them switching my views and I'm uplifting my dudes
I flip quick you get shit misconstrued
And I put a nigga in the clip on the news
So you're gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity
Or to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy
I know it's a contradiction understand it's two of me
It's the goons Myse from the Bronx then it's the new of me
It's the whole of me that's comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P
Flex can you agree that I did what I told you
I came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer
They robbed me different they don't switch they approach up
That bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova
4:44 tell me I aspire death I'm flattered but I ain't really buying that
But what I will say is that they wasn't jacking that kind of rap
Before I came up here stop me where I'm lying at
Iron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back
I eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back
Real going admire that but the fake going down play
Swear these squares uncomfortable around me. Why?
Cuz I proudly point out they fraudulence
Then I expose these actors to their audience
Y'all be ignorant that they don't move according to that shit that they recording and y'all still applaud it, me?
I'm reporting it live from the corners
When they do crime and get more time than Warner
You see, I'm trying to warn you it's no more honor nah
They done trading these principles for designer
Your right-hand man might kill you for some vagina
And the so called jeez get pistols to the minors
And this will y'all be trying to compare to me
From where I swear this whole industry scared of me  it's clear
This shit it's just like breathing enemies I'm guard here
You should be making a prayer to me it's rare
You'll see another rapper that's this complete
That speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete
When his drama I'm the piranha trying to get the meat pause
I'm kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma
I'm just the lead I'm not heart beat her the streets
I am the place where life and art seem to meet
See first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach
Now I got the world on my palm my song speak
And they stop looking they listen, they pay attention
Because they be saying the same shit I just say it different
I just paint a picture of dimensions they can't mention
Cuz they ain't bended it when they spit it it ain't convincing
The image they predict ain't the position
The image they predictable bars ain't their position
Of course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen
But what about the block getting locked facing that prison
When either you gonna tell what you won't sit in that cell
Everybody a G before that that's when it's real
Now that's when you can tell the morals have finished still
When your back against the wall your character get revealed
So either you gon' squeal and try to make you a deal
Or you're gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill
I know that and going pill to a coward or civilian
With the Gs no I just kept with a million
Tell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness
The doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this
With the real rice been waiting for me to take this game
Back from the fake so please pardon my lateness but
I was busy fighting for freedom
These kids needed food for thought I had to feed them
They needed something to follow I had the lead 'em
Men of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them
Chicks keep calling me God all in my DMs
No disrespect but God ain't that your BM
Guess she realized your fraud
See, a queen could tell the difference between a king
And the pawn when she see him
And yup I am here my motto is copper dim
Growing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than p.m
And pool full of sharks I learned to swim
They hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems
Nigga we turning men way before puberty shit
By age ten it wasn't nothing y'all could do to me
America have ruined me. Poverty, real hunger
Oppression, pain, same shit that may kill Manga
And they still wonder what I'm marching for
To identify allies when it's time for war
Which I'll gonna do when they declare martial law
And then the soldier with guns knocking at your door, huh?
You ain't even prepared
The revolution done starting you ain't even aware
You see the Dred Scott case takes
We can't be free and these United States cause we ain't even from here
Long as I'm breathing this air until it's even and fair
I'ma fight cuz one thing I don't believe in it's fear
I guess the reason I'm here is to maintain the balance nigga
I'm the place between peace and balance
Between screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga
Just fighting off these demons is a challenge
It is the talent just keepin my composure
While you beef with me knowing I could fold you
Knowing if I told my soldier he would mow you
Down like a lawn you see is pros vs. cons
Is knowing that I'm in the right but it's still wrong
It's chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn
Yo flex I'm gone before I leave your residence
I hope you realize this is black excellence
This is black brilliance black power resilience
The Black Panther, not to film, the real shit
This black Wall Street time to rebuild this
We need a thousand Oprah's and a thousand Will Smith's
We need celebrities of a higher pedigree
To have some integrity that one to leave a legacy
Shit I'm fighting for I'm probably ain't gonna never see
But my kids will just hope today remember me
Hope today remember he defied the odds
He played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards
A-1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds
He frontlined and never get you nothing but bars
Nothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed
The Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need
The OG told me it was designed to divide us brother
Cuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other
So just imagine if we was all fighting together
We all be winning and all of our lives would be better
Good people died just so I can have a life
And that's why I give my life as a sacrifice
Good people died just so I can have a life
And that's why I gave my life as a sacrifice1Embed
