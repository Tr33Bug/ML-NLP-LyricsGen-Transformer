[Chorus: Nelly]
It's two up in the mornin' girl, and the DJ playin' that song
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
It's two up in the mornin' girl, and the DJ playin' that song
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I got that plat no-limit American Express card
Mami you can get whatever you like
Plus I got that all-black Phantom it's tinted on four sides
Go 'head kiss it, they can't see us inside
Mami tell me do you like it, I know you like it
It's written all over your face don't fight it
You like it, more than I like it
So put it all over your face don't bite it
From rags to riches, club packed with bitches
Had to bag them digits, her head game was vicious (Muah)
And we can get it poppin' in the bathroom
Don't be selfish ma, go ahead and pass it to him
Then we can all fuck
It's like a million on my neck, got all of these bitches awestruck
Aow! We pissy drunk off of Seraphin
I'm up in V.I.P. and these bitches are screamin' "Let me in"

[Chorus: Nelly]
Up in the mornin' girl, and the DJ playin' that song
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
It's two up in the mornin' now and I'm tryin' to go home with you
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)

Ha ha, yeah, uhh, yo, uh
Get it poppin', go 'head and drop it
It's written all over your face, don't stop it
Just drop it, more like it's hot, miss
Kick in the do' with the fo-fo messin' with Joe
Now this chick got an ass so fat in fact I
Put a drink on it and I came right back
She would never talk to a lame like that
In my ear screamin', "How you got a name like Crack?"
Crack, similar to Mike Jones
Hear my name enough, then I'm takin' you home
Aow! You know I walk with I talk with
I sleep with the chrome, one squeeze and you're gone
What I look like, not takin at least
Three to six women out the club with me
Now we back to the fuck pad, call it the fuck pad
Cause all these bitches fuckin with me, talk to 'em dirty

[Chorus: Nelly]
Up in the mornin' girl, and the DJ playin' that song
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
Well, it's two up in the mornin' and them niggas tryin' hate on your crew
Nigga, what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
Yeah, what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now when them doors swing open with that awkward motion
What you call it? Suicide, it's a suicide
And if them niggas talk shit cause they drunk off that potion
They commitin - suicide, it's a suicide
Let's get it poppin my niggas (Cook, yo)
I got a shotty my niggas (Oh, Lord)
I feel sorry for your mudda, give a fuck what you say
Spin your head back, promote you on a videotape

[Chorus: Nelly]
Up in the mornin' girl, and the DJ playin' that song
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
It's four up in the mornin' now and I'm tryin' to go home with you
Now what you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)
What you gon' do? (I'ma get get get it poppin)

[Outro: Fat Joe]
Yeah, it's Crack! (What'chu gon' do)
