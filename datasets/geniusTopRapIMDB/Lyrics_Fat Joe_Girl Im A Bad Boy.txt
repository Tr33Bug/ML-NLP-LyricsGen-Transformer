Girl Iâ€™m A Bad Boy Lyrics[P. Diddy]
Terror Squad...Bad Boy...Joey Crack

[Hook: Dre]
Girl I gotta do what I gotta do
Change my life (Change my life)
Make things right (Make things right)
And girl I'm a bad boy so I gotta do what I gotta do
Risk my life (Risk my life)
In the late night (In the late night)
Cause girl I'm a bad boy yeahhhhhh
[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I know at times you feel stressed out
But I'm tryin' to set you up so later I can buy you up this guest house
But for now I gotta hug the block
I know you sick of visits from undercover cops
Runnin' to the kitchen tryin to hide the box
Just give me a minute and I'm gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but let's be real
Ain't no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal
I gotta do what I gotta do that's whats up
What's with this new attitude you know bitch that is what's up
I'm a Bad Boy like 'Mike Lawry'
How you think you got that rainbow Louis
Not with a legal job's salary

[Hook: Dre]

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
Ma' we got you stuck off the realness
You know the infamous
You heard of us
It's your Bad Boy business men
Me and Joey Crack gettin' benjamins
Sittin' in the Vanquish, the same color as cinnamon
Ma' I'm tryin' to be your knight and shinin'
To put you in the house on the Cayman Islands
Spend your whole life with stylin'
With that light that got me
Through it all you was right behind me
And ma' I know I gotta change
But right now a nigga is dealing with alot of things
It's not the same
Girl with me you can achieve whatever
But I can't change, I'm a Bad Boy forever

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we livin up in Ja-sery
In the t.v. in the car got the game on starrin' Marbury
And your ring gotta rock the size of strawberries
Everything that you want I got it don't worry
And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why everytime we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
It's more than a crush
It's all about us
It's love and trust
Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice
But I'm gonna be a Bad Boy for life

[Hook: Dre]
