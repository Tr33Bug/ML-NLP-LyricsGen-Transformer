(Ha Ha) Slow Down Lyrics[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Ayo, it took A. Keys and Jay-Z to get this city poppin' now
Rob Base, Snoop Dogg to get it rockin' now
Big money talking, Mayweather, Paquiao
Gucci soft up 'cause he can't hard top it now
Now what you boys got a death wish?
I beat a muh'fucka uglier than Precious
Real nigga, you can find me where the X is
Whippin' in the kitchen, both hands, ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I don't buy stocks
Tell a little muh'fucka get his shine pa
Goodfellas, hood fellas, livin' on my block
Nigga got a problem, I solve 'em (solve 'em)
A couple keys, yes nigga we'll rob 'em (rob 'em)
Got the 9 milli. in my pants, case you niggas wanna dance
Leave a muh'fucka shakin' like Harlem (Harlem)
[Chorus: Young Jeezy {Fat Joe}]
I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams? What's up?
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Always on that blow shit, Jeezy Montana
Cocaine capital that would be Atlanta
One triple O where I'm from, that's a homo
Nigga catch ya slippin' where I'm from that's a no no
Next up a homicide, ain't nobody seen shit
Wake up to a homicide, ain't nobody dream shit
Welcome to the home of the home invasion
DEA like to raid, you might get your home raided
Went up in it, like a halfback from the Raiders
Bring a half mac, anything for that paper
Two door Phantom, Avatar blue though
Parked outta space shit, we call that bitch Pluto
Grown livin' legend, in the hood I'm a hero
On that minute fourteen, like a guitar hero
Came a long way from that toilet bowl white though
But I'ma be all right though

I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams? What's up?
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Always on my hard shit, Joey Viagra
Pull up make 'em car sick, abracadabra
Presto magic, Bugatti's on the scene
Parties all around me like its Gotti on the scene
Your money NBA, NFL all legal
My niggas on the block goin' hard pumpin' diesel
However do you want it?
Joe stay blunted, I gets off but the hoe stay on it
This is my 'castle' but it ain't 'white' though
Ice so bright shit shine like a light show
This my life yo, go get yours bitch
Ball 'til we fall 'til the drugs hit the ball pit
Cocaine cowboys that's my thing
Do it for my niggas locked down in the bing in the state
In the Fed pen my name rings
I don't need your respect the streets crowned me king
[Chorus: Young Jeezy {Fat Joe}]
I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams? What's up?
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
(Ha Ha) {Slow down son you killin' 'em}
