Hold You Down Lyrics[Jennifer Lopez]
Now you been holding me down mm
For such a long time now
From back then to now in my story
Straight from the hood
You've always been there for me

And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you that kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yeah
[Fat Joe]
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's skyblue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
For sweepin them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que on that red carpet
When Pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you
But you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
Cuz baby you don't have to change no...
