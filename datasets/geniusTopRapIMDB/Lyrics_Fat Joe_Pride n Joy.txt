Pride n Joy Lyrics[Intro: Miguel, Jadakiss, Yasiin Bey, DJ Khaled, Busta Rhymes & (Kanye West)]
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
(But she still my pride and joy)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe & Kanye West]
Court side at the Knick game, who the don?
Plus I worked on your kick game, Louboutin
Birkin bags made of python
She a beautiful nightmare
Turn the lights on, still my pride and joy
So I could see that ass
Word to Martin Louie the King, she free at last
Word to my nigga Joe Crack, you let her hold some stacks
Yeah, before we go to the club, she wanna go to Saks
Still my pride and joy, joy, joy
I let her get the gold card, I'mma hold the black
I let her get the black card, I couldn't hold her back
Cause back in the backyard she used to hold the crack
So I cut them other hoes off like the culdesac
Huh, now what cold is that?
[Hook: Roscoe Dash + Miguel]
I ain't never felt a feelin' like this, I need, some more
You gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin' on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and joy

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Kanye West]
Yeah, uh, yeah, uhh
I ate dinner after, share with another, yo
She love women and she keeps it undercover, yo
And I love women, so she brings them under covers, yo
Fight then we fuck again, I swear I really love her though
But you're still my pride and joy, and joy, and joy
Don't wanna be a player, help her find another Joe
Just to prove I love her, I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out it'd be another blow
And that only me that I'mma have to hit another store (my pride and joy)
Spend another knot, hit another lot
That's how you know if you are in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on Mother's Day
Now I gotta get her the same whip her mother got
Pass the Nuvo Mach

I ain't never felt a feelin' like this, I need, some more
You gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
What's goin' on with me and you, is real, for sure
But you gon' have to show me more
Before you steal my pride and joy
Before you steal my pride and joy

[Outro: Miguel, Jadakiss, Yasiin Bey, DJ Khaled & Busta Rhymes]
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care

And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share
And even if she all about the money, I don't really care, care
I got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we can share, share5Embed
