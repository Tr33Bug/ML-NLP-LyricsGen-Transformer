Success Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
This joint right here is going out to everybody getting money
I mean the real cream
All up and down the East and West coast
Check it *echoes*

[Chorus]
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
[Verse 1]
One's for the cash, two's for every blunt's ash
Three's for all the 40 brews corner crews devour
Four's for the drugs, sex, and power
I be the top dolla scala, rocking gold collars
While you trying to sip the juice, I'm taking swallows
Step into my zone and get blown, my ways are internationally known
Yeah, in case you haven't heard or read
Have an appetite for beef and get hand-fed lead
Rapid-fire echoes through your vicinity
Why you messing with this nigga from Trinity?
For every shell that fell there's a story to tell
But it's a fine line between grapevines and pines
Knahmean? There's no room for snitches and loud bitches
But it's always room for riches and deep ditches
That's how it be in this everlasting game
Declaring war on cocks, and leaving chumps slain
So maintain, and put the fronting to a rest
Or today'll be the grand opening of your chest
Success, triple beam, knahmean?
Dollar dollar bill

[Chorus]
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day

The streets are full of vengeance and it's expensive
If you don't organize your words right in your sentence
Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost
Who said an arm and a leg was a high cost to toss?
Things are done different in my zip code
Hollow tips implode, dum-dums explode
Now your crew is screaming like they see demons when I reload
You can't comprehend, act like you want it for clarity
I'm pushing wigs, handing out jigs like charity
You best to get your groove on or get moved on
Or play the hot steppa, and die with your shoes on
I collects ass and cash
While my crew consumes liquor and hash and keep the stash
Whether hustling or dusting we get busy with ours
T.S., T.A.T., respect for miles
The Bronx is the turf, South is the area
Bring ten, bring twenty, the more guns the merrier
Nobody's bad as me, no cops nabbing me
Front if you dare and I'll change your whole anatomy
For real... uh!

[Chorus]
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cash, drinking Mo', getting blessed
The games people play
The names people slay
It's just another ordinary day
Hustling is the key to success
Money is the key to sex
The life is getting cashEmbed
