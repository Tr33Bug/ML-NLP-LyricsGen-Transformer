Terror Squadians Lyrics[Spoken Intro: Fat Joe]
Terror Squad
Ungh
Now why you wanna go and fuck with them?
Platinum status motherfuckers
Eat a dick

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Now who's the underated pro
They scared to play on the radio?
Who lives the lyrics?
All my real niggas already know
Flow for flow
No crew can step to us
And blow for blow
I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumours
I give tumours to niggas and comas to bitches
No one's against us
Roll with the riches or float with the fishes
The revolution has started thats why I'm undercarded
My Squad will turn to the most feared into the dearly departed
As hard as they come
They all fall like the Great Wall
Make no mistake
I take you straight to the state morgue
Swarmin informers like cops at drug corners
Feds got the bugs on us
Tryin to lay the law up on us
They want us in jails with bails too high to bond, but am I the Don?
Shit
I'll be out by the morn'
Word bond, my game is on lock, 'trigger ball-cocked
And its never ever gonna stop
[Verse 2: Prospect]
Yo, yo, I play the game with caution
Sun changes, gave power creative activities
Bring fame and fortune
Why can't you live this?
All day hands on bitches
With financial ventures
Enhance the riches
Gotta hold the cake
My grandmoms had dreams
But it seems I couldn't graduate or go to Drake
It hurts at nights
I gots to reimburse the rights
Niggas is worse than shiest for the merchandise
My words precise
'Cause if not I wouldn't speak it
I rock shit everyday of the week
Especially the weekend
Outside it's pretty clothes I live
But with the titty-ho
Knock a nigga out for the shit he stole
We already degraded
Me and my family the most hated
Bitch, we barely both made it
See, to them we relate to everything in the street
I'm sellin' coke, crack, to dope, plus swingin' the heat
You might also like[Chorus: Armageddon]
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin', just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
I thought you knew we had...
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
(And it don't stop!)

[Verse 3: Cuban Link]
I got rubies on my Uzi's and gems on my Mack 10's
Diamonds on my nines and golden bullets just to match them
Platinum magnums with silver clips
Real begets
Shit, I'm gonna milk this bitch till I'm filthy rich
Filled with chips from the floor to the ceiling
Just flossin' and chillin'
In a Porsche full of women
I'm one in a million
Het on the deal already
My skills are sharper than a steel machete
Realer than the military
Killin' every track I'm on
Link and Joey Crack the Don
Pimpin' in my Cuban Caddy with the hazards on
[Triple Seis]
So, come on if you gon' ride with us
Live niggas
Hop with us
Quick to try to triple five figures

[Verse 4: Big Punisher]
Your style is unoffish'
Niggas like you stay on my wanted list
Pun the prince be barking on kings like a son of a bitch
Fuckin' with this is hazardous to amateur battlers
Av-er-age niggas get lost in the course of embarrassment
Course you don't have a chance
I'm the boss and your eminence
Get tossed in the ambulance
With the force of an avalanche
I'll torture your fragile ass
With rhetorical paragraphs
For all of you that'll laugh at an historical aftermath
I come equipped
My tongue and lips are like a hundred clips
Look behind you, I'll blind you like when the sun eclipse
Ain't no second chances
I glance at niggas, make 'em wet they pants the
Chances are slim if twins don't swing the rest of the ransom
The best and the champion, that means I'm far beyond
Dionne read my palm
Told me to get on and put my army on
Come along
Follow the Don, my motto and song is fuck tomorrow
Cause today's almost already gone
Lets get on
Split your belly with the machete long
Tear your arms of your shoulders, and tell you to...hold on
I know it's wrong, but it feels so right
I used to bust steel all night, but now I gotta deal, alright

[Chorus: Armageddon]
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin', just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
I thought you knew we had...
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
(And it don't stop!)

[Verse 5: Armageddon]
Fuck a Toe to Toe
Give me a forty-four and a foe to blow
To make it more dramatic
I quote Jehovah holding the scroll
Open your skull
Show you shit you ain't supposed to know
Break the world in half and split the ocean from coast to coast
Just to let you know that I'm zone coasting
And play the visuals from the top of my verse back in slow-motion
Assassinate the Pope with no emotions
So why should I hesitate to crush your campaign like I wasn't votin?
My brain's floatin' away above y'all niggas like I make time pause
Checkin' my Rollie watch my diamond Roman digits
Golden riches
Better hold em bitches
Cause we robbin' niggas way before the translation of Holy Scriptures
I was Armageddon before the motion picture
The last nigga to drop his verse and have the globe shifting
My Squad's hard and far from Puritans
Robbing and killing men like we proud to be Americans

[Chorus: Armageddon]
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin', just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
I thought you knew we had...
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin'
Slugs killin, ya touch feelin, just for the thrill and
We bust villains, dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squad's everywhere, it's just us illin'
(And it don't stop!)4Embed
