The Crackhouse Lyrics[Intro: Dre & Fat Joe]
I'm sleeping on a billion dollars
Coka
I'm eating
Crills mania
I'm eating
I'm sleeping on a billion dollars
And I say right about now New York City

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Oh no, oh Joe, he did it, he's back
In the back of that black Maybach, tripping
Now, blow that motherfucking kush up in the sky
La la la la la la la
Bumping that Kanye, you can't tell me nothing, right?
La la la la la la la la
Hand on the shotgun and I'm riding shotgun
Uzis, banana clips, what, what? I got some
Bullets are wholesale, food stamps, coupons
Yellow mustard Phantom car, it Grey Poupon
I can make it Pacman Jones in here too long
We up a hundred grand whenever I hear a new song
Come one, come on, there's too many ringtones
2.8 what you want me to tell you?
Make it rain, Mary Anna, go and grab an umbrella
-Ella, -ella, -ella, holy shit
So much coke, a nigga have to shovel it
So much coke, a nigga change his government
Now we can all sing along for the fuck of it
Crack, crack, crack, crack
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hey, this is the crackhouse, welcome to the crackhouse
I mean, I'm talking more pies than a frat house
This is a problem, this is not music
I hope you find it 'cause he about to lose it
Joey, don't do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doing it until you're done with it
Bring them to the crackhouse, show them the crackhouse
Take them to the crackhouse, we in the crackhouse

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
You gotta touch your toes or I'm out
Fuck a club, I got a strip pole in my house
Six million ways to make it rain, hold up
Conflicts in my chain from Angola
Convicts in my plane when we roll up
And they hustle yay not vitamin water
Fat 'cause I'm so rich, rich 'cause I'm so hood
Uzi your whole whip, nigga, I'm that hood
You flow cold, but Joe flow sicker
Even Reverend Al be like, "Joe's that nigga!"
John Gotti, Supreme Team show
These are the niggas you compare to Joe, hello

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hey, this is the crackhouse, welcome to the crackhouse
I mean, I'm talking more pies than a frat house
This is a problem, this is not music
I hope you find it 'cause he about to lose it
Joey, don't do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doing it until you're done with it
Bring them to the crackhouse, this the crackhouse
Walk them to the crackhouse, we in the crackhouse
You might also like[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Get em, Joey just get em
Get em, get on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Hey Weez just stop right there
Shit I don't let em go, get the whole block clear
These niggas actors, they are not there
And thier time's tickin' like an Audemars
First nigga pop up and we gave him the piece
Next nigga pop up leave him under the sheets
C'mon papa, you talkin to ME
Ain't nobody else runnin' these streets COCKSUCKER!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Heeey, this is the crackhouse, welcome to the crackhouse
Man I'm talkin' more pies than a frat house
This is the problem, this is not music
I hope you find it cuz he about to lose it
Joey don't do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doin' it until you're done wit' it
Take em to the crackhouse
They don't want the crackhouse, they don't want the crackhouse
Kick em out the crackhouse1Embed
