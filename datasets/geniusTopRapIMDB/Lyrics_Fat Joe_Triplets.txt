Triplets Lyrics[Intro]
*phone conversation*

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Since day one, niggas doubted the Don
Cause I was anon, now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadriplegic any squad that wanna squabble when I'm heated
Not even God can believe it, the way we regulate
And levitate heavyweight niggas like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thing
It's the paid game, to amputate more body parts than gangrene
[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Yo this a man's game, it's a shame how niggas truly mock me
But who can stop me, from breakin' niggas off like Fujiyaki?
My crew's probably the only niggas that really live the lyrics
Niggas really fear us, they must've heard we really killers
We're Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army colors, Willie niggas that laundry dollars
I'm Nostradamus predictin' the future, my position is crucial
With a non-fiction obsession addiction to shoot ya

[Verse 3: Fat Joe & Big Punisher]
Hey yo I'm better off dead than givin' the feds the satisfaction
Subtracting my freedom have me missin' in action
A fraction of y'all, raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of y'all, fear war, and couldn't follow out the protocol
Joe the God is like the angel of death, strangle your neck
That's why Don Cartagena's the name you respect
I'll leave a pain in your chest that'll make you question your threshold
Flex like you bench four, still "bless you" like a chest cold
We destined to explode, that's why I stay on flip mode
You dick rode me long enough Dunn, now you can let go

[Chorus: Big Punisher] X2
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm deadly and there ain't no gettin' rid of me

Uh, uh, uh, yo!
Somebody hold me back, Joey Crack's about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max 'n' better, out for the ass 'n' cheddar
But fast cash don't last forever

[Big Punisher]
I asked the felons, if I don't stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers, I got all the ostriches acting jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompson's, flown back from Paris

[Prospect]
Dat dat's the illest, these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine, [?] to climb
Especially in time, with the recipe in mind
From the jump start, they ain't have to pump heart in this
I was a part of this, and marvelous stats, it wasn't hard to miss
And yo, I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu? A record deal they couldn't lend you
I had to burn my Glock and earn my spot
The time flew by, had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume, I run into that bitch named Des'ree
She ain't believe my dream was a better way
Prospect'll have to collect dough
Diallin' 905 to L-A-X with somethin' I was trying to drive
A life that's trife for what I wore in the fuckin' [?]
A thug in pain, I swear to my little cousin's grave
[Chorus: Big Punisher]
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm deadly and there ain't no gettin' rid of me
Every man in this world has a destiny
Can't no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf, dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because I'm dead in the middle of little Italy

[Outro]
