Your Honor Lyrics[Intro: Fat Joe]
Rihanna, Rihanna, hey, ho, hey
Madonna, Madonna, hey, ho, hey
He is a good family man, Your Honor (Your Honor, Your Honor)
He does give to numerous charities (Charities, charities)
He did pay back all the money, Your Honor (Your Honor, Your Honor)
But do it for America

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
For the love of drug dealin', bricks to the ceilin'
Tits on display, relatives on payroll
Put my moms in a mansion, mink draggin' off the yay
Got lifers ready to kill when I say so
C.O's slide me cellphones
Speak Italian with my capo, Jesus medallions, extravagant
Sittin' in the Porsche like I’m Tony M
Niggas tryna X me out, shoot me off the podium
From lux tees to Rugby's, my crime syndicate
I grind in the mix, you niggas rhymed into this
Pump cracks out the wall, back at us all
In Lil' Wayne’s crib writin' crack on the wall (Crack!)
Barcelona 9’s, but these squeeze all
23 shots off a hardened man jaws
For my Chi Town niggas, Joey need a statue
'Cause Joey played the goalie when them things is kickin' at you
Shoot like paparazzi, I go Kanye crazy
Then beat a nigga blue like Beyoncé baby
Uh, lifestyle of the realest
Step on Donatella when I’m coming out the villa
[Bridge]
This shit separate me from the pack
I’m the reason why the Hip-Hop Cops came patrollin' the block
They must’ve heard I was cookin' with rock

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Respective path made, the 850 roof is black suede
Hair slicked back like Pat
Drivin' glove zipped up, speedin' tickets gettin' ripped up
Eatin' chicken, gettin' my dick sucked, it's basic
Ronny Fieg Asics
This fucking beat make me feel like I’m in the basement
These fuckin' drugs make me feel like I’m in the Matrix
With a long trench and a motherfuckin' feather earring
You better cherish before I perish
Scuba divin' off the terrace
Utilizin' my athletics
Supersize me on the lettuce, you could keep the beef
'Cause I know you’re tryna keep your teeth
I like 'em Greek with a petite physique
She make me healthy things to eat and never feed me meat
So I keep Chanel on the feet, I’m a great man
Me and Joey sit at the table, then we ate lamb
Then we shake hands

[Outro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
I’m not a stranger to the court of law
That’s how you got the word for the numbers you sellin'
Niggas yellin' out the window “Joe’s at it again!!”
Joe's at it-Joe’s at it-Joe’s at it again!
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Niggas yellin' out the window “Joe’s at it again!”
Said Jojo crack shit’s all the same
(As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain)
These Feds want me for some Tax Evasion
