High Klassified な音楽
I got the jewels flooded from Ben, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out..

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one (Still comin')
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (Still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (Still comin')
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one (Still comin')
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one (Still comin')
The only time I feel alive when I take (Still comin')
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (Still comin')
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? (Do you know who I am?)
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no
You might also like[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong (Still comin')
Still comin' out..

[Verse 3: Future]
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves (Keep comin')
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you (Keep comin')
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (He was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (Gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (La familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(So familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong (Be honest to me)
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out...

[Outro: The Weeknd & Future]
Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, she lie
Kindness, oh46Embed
