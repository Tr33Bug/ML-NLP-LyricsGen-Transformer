[Verse 1]
Lamborghini doors when I lift off (You)
They done fucked around, got a nigga pissed off (You know)
Nice little thot got a stiff arm (You)
Did the Heisman on the ho, got the stiff arm (You know)
Fuck all that biting like Tyson or Holyfield (You)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (You know)
A couple of pills and I got my soda filled (You)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (You know)
Break out a sweat, I go head over heels for these mils (You)

She thinks she the one but to me she ain't nothing but a thrill (You)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (You know)
I've been drippin' like a God, what else? (You)

[Verse 3]
Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born30Embed
