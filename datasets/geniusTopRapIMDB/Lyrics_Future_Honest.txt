Honest Lyrics[Intro]
Dark marks all on me, I'm just honest
Rockstar my swag, I'm just honest
Everything exotic, I'm just honest
Gold all on my neck, I'm just honest
Yeah, I'm just honest
We got the club on smash

[Chorus]
Name another nigga hot, I'm just honest
Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
100,000 on watches, I'm just honest
Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
I'm just bein' honest
[Verse 1]
My piss comin' back dirty, I'm just bein' honest
Got bitches kissin' on bitches, I'm just bein' honest
I'm a rockstar for life, I'm just bein' honest
Got a check on me right now, I'm just bein' honest
We done turnt up in Platinum, then we gon' hit Onyx
Ain't nothin' but a dopeboy, I'm just bein' honest
These niggas get shot for bein' honest
I fucked her on the spot, I'm just bein' honest
I'ma stack it 'til it rot, I'm just bein' honest
And I'm drivin' foreign coupes, dash 200
Live a rich nigga life, I'm just bein' honest
Real street nigga ain't get nothin' but some pain from it

[Chorus]
Name another nigga hot, I'm just honest
Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
100,000 on watches, I'm just honest
Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
I'm just bein' honest

[Verse 2]
Got crack all in my drawers, I'm just honest
My diamonds ain't got flaws, I'm just honest
These Zoes on sight niggas, I'm just honest
We can ball all night nigga, I'm just honest
You fuck nigga ya'll don't even know struggle
You ain't even know why a nigga out here hustlin'
Got flat screens in the trap spot, I'm honest
Kept it real with all you niggas, I'm just too honest
Took some bitches out the strip club, I'm just honest
To the niggas all out in the hood, I'm just honest
Lil Mexico for life, I'm just honest
I came up shootin' dice, I'm just honest
You might also like[Chorus]
Name another nigga hot, I'm just honest
Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
100,000 on watches, I'm just honest
Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
I was gon lie to you but I had to tell the truth
I'm just bein' honest55Embed
