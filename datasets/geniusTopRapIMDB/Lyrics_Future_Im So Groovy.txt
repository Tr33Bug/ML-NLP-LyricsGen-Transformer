[Verse 2]
I'm the last don, I'm the last con
Done turned it up to an icon
Pimpin’ hoes nigga, ugh
Thots expose niggas, huh
Paper tags on the yacht
I just smashed in the clouds
Thousand bags in the clouds
Louis rag, wipe me down
Cash king on a clown
So prestigious, so profound
Cash cloud, let me live
50 cars at the crib
Private dinners on the leer
VVS’s when I steer
Instant glam on my ear
Outer space when I appear
Promethazine in my seal
A yellow bone in the rear
Dapper God, I’m in here
Fuck your squad, they some queers
My conversation bringing mills to ya
I get my brother to bring the bales to ya
Killas on the right and the left to ya
Gang gang, whatever’s left of ya

I'm so groovy, I got power

[Verse 3]
Sitting in the 'vert, mhm
Got a lotta dirt, mhm
Courtroom flow, mhm
Now I’m sitting courtside with your ho, mhm
Addy’s work miracles, hmm
Benji’s subliminal, hmm
(Hmm, mhm)
Uptown, Lenox, mhm
All about the Benji’s, mhm
Pour a little Henny, hmm
Totin' the semi, hmm
Making love with my diamonds on, hmm
Diamonds on honeycomb, hmm
Hit 'em with the stick, ooh ooh
I just copped the deu-u-uce (Mhm)
Syrup like Denny’s (Mhm)
Bitch brown like a penny (Mhm)
Tote it up in one minute (Mhm)
Out of the country, I hit it (Mhm)
Playing with the trenches in a suit
Armani got me with the juice
Made a bad bitch my masseuse
Take a little stress off the crew

[Chorus]
I'm so groovy, I got power
I'm so groovy, I got power
That’s your bitch? I just bought her
Oh that’s your bitch? I just bought her
