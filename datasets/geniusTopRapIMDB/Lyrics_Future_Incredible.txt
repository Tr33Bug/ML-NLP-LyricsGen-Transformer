Incredible Lyrics[Intro]
It's a light day
Ain't got on nothin' but about $700 thousand worth
That's it
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I was havin' trust issues
But I've been havin' way better luck since you
I know it's true love with you
Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you
Rollin' on the eway speedin'
Friday, just started the weekend
XO textin', you respondin'
We gon' go crazy with this money
We do hot yoga, 92 degrees
Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?
Then she looked me in my eyes
Told me, "Fuck them pussy niggas
They ain't ridin' 'cause I'm ridin'
And I'm dyin' for you, baby"
Got me feelin'
[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
We can do exactly what you like, baby
And it's all on me
We can take Vicodin tonight, baby
It's all on me
We been textin' back and forth
Now it's time to get it crackin'
Girl, take it all out 'cause I know you active
Did you come to talk or is you 'bout that action?
Diamonds on my neck, moonwalkin', Michael Jackson
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to keep my baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to shake these haters off
Put it on, fuck the cost
I just wanna show you off
I can see your flaws, she gon' take me how I am
Hit it from the back, girl, you know I'm goin' ham
Fuck the pigs, girl, you got me feelin' like the man
Yeah, yeah

The way you move your body, I'ma have a change of plans

[Verse 3]
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it take to keep my fuckin' baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it takes to shake these fuckin' bitches off
I'ma do whatever it takes and you gon' be my personal
Dance, dance, girl you dancin' like you strippin' for this gold
Romance and we've all done been here before
But your passion, I hear it when you're talkin'
We ain't clashin', you quiet when I'm talkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'em Billie Jean moonwalkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'emmmmm moonwalkin'
You get into everything exclusively, I'm honest
We don't need nobody comin' inbetween this money
These niggas already tryna invade the embassy
Good thing I changed and you got that remedy
The best thing about you, oh you're that far from me
You a star to me
[Chorus]

Know you, girl, you fuckin' with a full-grown man
The way you move your body, I'ma have a change of plans
