Inside the Mattress Lyrics[Intro]
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah, Hendrix
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
[Verse 1]
I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
I was tryna tell you I was losin'
I was gon' tell you I'm improvin'
I done caught a vibe, she was choosin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus, I'm phenomenal
Once I cock and load I'm the money man
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin' kung-fu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I go through
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I don't wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for my squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out

I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool on my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I rap for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
