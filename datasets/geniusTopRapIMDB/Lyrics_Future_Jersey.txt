Jersey Lyrics[Chorus]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip gotta hold like a thirty
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
'Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin', yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want once you cop it
You do what you want when you got it, yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it, huh
[Refrain]
I be on syrup, they know it, huh
Stack up some money, then blow it, huh
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the Styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code, but that ain't for us

[Verse 1]
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress, then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out a Benz when I roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I keep me a banger like Birdie
Sip out my cup and it's dirty

[Chorus]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip gotta hold like a thirty
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
'Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin', yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want once you cop it
You do what you want when you got it, yeah
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it, huh

Like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch, you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make so much money, it's got me delirious
When your gang-gang in the chain gang, shit serious
I gotta maintain, I'm superior, nigga
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

[Refrain]
I be on syrup, they know it, huh
Stack up some money, then blow it, huh
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the Styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code, but that ain't for us

[Chorus]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip gotta hold like a thirty
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
'Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'32Embed
