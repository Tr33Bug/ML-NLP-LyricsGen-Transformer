Karate Chop Lyrics[Intro: Future]
You know
This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?
This beat is so, so Metro

[Chorus: Future]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean
[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera 'round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Picture nigga getting money, nigga, get back (back)
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack (crack)
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk (donk)
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge (splurge)
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup (syrup)
Keep a young nigga workin' that'll bust a K (K)
I'ma take a phone call, hustle everyday (everyday)

[Chorus: Future]
Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari (Yea)
Living like John Gotti (The mob)
Chopping bricks like karate (Chwaaa, chwaaa)
Drink a bunch of codeine (Drank)
Serving to the dope fiends (They smokers)
Blowing money, stay clean (Freebandz)
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a Spyder (Spyder)
Young nigga play with keys (keys), like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at? (at) nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s ('80s)
We was grinding up from two and a baby (oh)
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl (curl)
Got a styrofoam cup and it's full of syrup
Send it over from Lil' Mexico and let me work (lets work)
I can get 36 for a clean shirt (shirt)

[Verse 3: Casino]
Pull up, serve you in my 'Rari
Money like I'm Frank Matthews
Killers around me like I'm Gotti
If I tricked you, know I'm sorry
I be fresh, don't need no stylist
I be geeking on them Mollies
Sell remix, don't sell no clean
My hand like a triple beam
I got workers like machine
All I do is sell dreams
Half my niggas serve fiends
I get up and then I lean

[Chorus: Future]
