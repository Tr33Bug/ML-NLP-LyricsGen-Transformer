Life Is Good (Remix) Lyrics[Part I]

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Say she want to eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Anything she want, she cashin' out without no problems
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't got love for your mama?
You can die today, it ain't gon' save me nothin' but drama (Super)

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
[Verse: Future]
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch
Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Switchin' up my bitch, I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't buyin' a Birkin for your mama?
You can die today, I swear I still won't break my promise (Pluto)

[Chorus: Future]
Make love on the weekend as usual
Take drugs, goin' up, oh, that's usual
Every time she come, big spender
Every time I put my chains on, big spender

[Interlude: Future]
It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like

[Part II]

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
I can't entertain all that flodgin'
I ain't been the same since they crossed me
You know how they do when you poppin'
You know Baby can't do all that talkin'
I got fools tryna sue up in Boston
I got dudes tryna sue down in Florida
I got hoes in L.A., got a new boo from Georgia
A milli', saved up to give to my daughter
Over one hundred K to Drew Findling, my lawyer (Let's go)
Six digits on cases, we beat it like Tina (Mmh)
Baby all on the TV, that's easy
I mixed mid with the gas and I bought me a Bimmer (Yeah)
Now I pull up in Ghosts, they ain't see me (Casper)
I know she gon' fuck, I ain't askin' (Uh-huh)
F&N like a prop, this shit plastic (Phew)
Fuck around and get popped just for laughin' (Boom)
Put that boy in a box, pick a casket
I go take that ho to Dior, pick a shoe (Let's go)
Kickin' shit with your whore, that's my boo
You can go put hardwood on the floor with the hoop (Hoop)
We like uppin' the score, we gon' shoot (Ball)
I never pick up when she call me (Brr, brr)
Help the bitch start a business, she bossin' (Uh-huh)
Like to wake up to sex like it's coffee (Sex)
Big baguettes on my neck, this shit cost me
Cartier, Audemar, Audemar or the Rolex (Let's go)
I been broke before, bet I won't go back
When she walk through the door, take that iron, make her hold that (Hold that)
They ain't seen me go out like a ho yet (Ho)
You know these lil' niggas got ho ways
Make 'em come air it out like the old days (Uh-huh)
You a throwaway, baby, it's okay
My boy off a pill, need an OJ (Yeah, bitch)
[Chorus: Future & Lil Baby]
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since (Woah)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Spent thirty racks on a rap bitch, could've went and bought a brick, woah
Quarter million worth of chains, ask Icebox, everybody lit, woah
It ain't no coppin' deuces, nigga, that's your man, everybody get it, woah
Made a few mil', made a few hits, fuckin' everybody bitch
Got somethin' to lose so I stay with a shooter
Got game from a G.O.A.T., I know how to maneuver
She kinda cute, really somethin' to do
I got somethin' to do, so I gave her to Pluto, huh
Hundred thousand for a body, go inside the house and everybody get it, huh
Got a plug on exotic, overnight 'em, floodin' everybody's city
Extra three-fifty, might buy me a Richie
This shit gettin' ridiculous, sip syrup wrong, get sick
Spot in Toronto, just show me the real ones
Give me a few months, I'll be servin' the 6, woah
Rolls truck, four bucks, all white guts, call it good luck, woah
Neck lit, wrist lit, look, don't touch, reach, you get busted
Hop out a Phantom, they think it's Houdini
Seven-fifty one day, I bought two Lamborghinis
Hundred racks spent on a four carat diamond
I didn't propose, but I bought her a ring
They had my bro, had to let that boy go
He had stick to the code, he ain't tell 'em a thing, uh
Ballin' like we won a championship, yeah
Everybody get a ring, huh

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since, woo

[Outro: Future]
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch
Hundred thousand on the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, yeah
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, huh
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch19Embed
