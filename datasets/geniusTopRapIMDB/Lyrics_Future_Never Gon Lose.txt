Never Gon Lose Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
(808 Mafia)

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter in the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose
[Verse]
Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around
These diamond rings gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagen
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

[Outro]
Woo
These bitches gon' choose
We never gon' lose56Embed
