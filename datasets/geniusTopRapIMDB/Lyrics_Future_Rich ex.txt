Watches on watches

Baby, let's gon' have rich sex
Make a little love, havin' rich sex

[Chorus]
Baby, let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex (Come on)
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it (Do it)
We can keep an AP on when we do it (Do it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (To it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (Come on)
When you look down, see my chains on (Chains on)
When you look down, see my chains on (I got it on)
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on (Ridin' on)
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on (VVS)
Baby, we can go and have rich sex (Yes, yes)
Baby girl, go and have rich sex (Future Hendrix)
You ain't never ever had rich sex (Ooh, ooh)
You ain't never ever had rich sex

[Verse 1]
Never made love to a misfit
You never made love to a misfit
Come and kick a deal on some rich shit
I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, countin' fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glisten
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets
And all she want is the D
And for me to keep this ice on me

You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (Come on)
When you look down, see my chains on (Chains on)
When you look down, see my chains on (I got it on)
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on (Ridin' on)

[Verse 2]
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle
[Chorus]
Baby, let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex (Come on)
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it (Do it)
We can keep an AP on when we do it (Do it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (To it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (Come on)
When you look down, see my chains on (Chains on)
When you look down, see my chains on (I got it on)
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on (Ridin' on)
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on (VVS)
Baby, we can go and have rich sex (Yes, yes)
Baby girl, go and have rich sex (Future Hendrix)
You ain't never ever had rich sex (Ooh, ooh)
You ain't never ever had rich sex62Embed
