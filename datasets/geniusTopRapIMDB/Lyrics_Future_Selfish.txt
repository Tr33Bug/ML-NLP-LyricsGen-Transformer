Selfish Lyrics[Intro: Rihanna & Future]
Ooh (Ooh)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna with Future]
It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly
Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns, saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels
[Refrain: Future & Rihanna]
Oh-oh
Let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh-oh
Let's not be alone

[Bridge: Future & Rihanna]
Empty thoughts fill the room (Mm)
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

[Chorus: Future, Rihanna & Both]
Let's be selfish, selfish, bae, yeah (Tonight)
Tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
I just hit the lick, south of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust
Every night, we gettin' more popular
Wrong is right when it comes to us

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone, mmm, tonight

[Chorus: Future, Rihanna & Both]
Let's be selfish, selfish, bae, yeah (Tonight)
Tonight
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Rihanna & Future]
I'll be selfish, let's be selfish
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, oo-oo-ooh
I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Let's be-
Let's be selfish
Yeah, yeah37Embed
