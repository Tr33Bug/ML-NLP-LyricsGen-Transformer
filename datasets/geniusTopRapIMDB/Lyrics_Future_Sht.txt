Sh!t Lyrics[Intro]
Aye
Talkin' 'bout ya bussin' heads (Ayy), nigga, you ain't shot shit
Talkin' 'bout ya working clips (Ayy), nigga, you ainâ€™t
Ayy
Eardrummers
Mike WiLL Made-It
Aye
Oh, you done go and get all them guns and you ain't killed nobody yet?
How many times you shot that mothafucka, nigga?
Ain't nobody popped up dead?
Thought y'all niggas was murderers
Shit!
[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)
All you talk 'Nana clips (Shit!), nigga, you ain't shot shit (Shit!)
Spending money on these hoes (Shit!), nigga, you ain't fuck shit (Shit!)
Shit!
Shit!

[Verse 1]
Bought the ho a hunnid pair of red bottoms (Shit!)
That's a quarter milli' on a hand job, my nigga
Brrrrrrrr, stick 'em
Fuck you and every nigga came witcha
Go and put a nigga on a picture
Go and put a nigga on a T-shirt
Back in the day, when a nigga sell dope
I'ma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, woo!
Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, getting higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
No, you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Hundred dollars fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit 'em in the head, can you keep it solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut dope, blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at, nigga, throw it up
You might also like[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)
All you talk 'Nana clips (Shit!), nigga, you ain't shot shit (Shit!)
Spending money on these hoes (Shit!), nigga, you ain't fuck shit (Shit!)
Shit!
Shit!

[Verse 2]
Catch a nigga slippin' at the red light
With ya AK, let me see you shoot it
You a goon, you a goon, you a goon, you a goon
Nigga, let me see you prove it
Presidential Rollie and it's glidin'
Love a nigga wrist when it's shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when it's blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot Boy, nigga, BG
That's the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup, can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running 'round with real choppers
Nigga, what's the color of them bottles? they ain't gold
And you moving 'round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, Hoes down (Hoes down)
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown
I'ma fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Button up suits at the Grammys
Had to turn it up for the family
Yes, I'm a Freeband bandit
[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)
All you talk 'Nana clips (Shit!), nigga, you ain't shot shit (Shit!)
Spending money on these hoes (Shit!), nigga, you ain't fuck shit (Shit!)
Shit!
