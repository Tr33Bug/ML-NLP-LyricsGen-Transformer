I know your true feelings ain't
They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
[Refrain]
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with

[Verse 2]
I want you to fuck him in paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more
Monster

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
