Turn On the Lights Lyrics[Intro]
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er

[Verse 1]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Bimmer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Bimmer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er
[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er

[Verse 2]
Send 'er my way
Tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er in the broad day
Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep 'er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin'
And if I get her number, you know I can't wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon' be wildin'
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it
You might also like[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er

[Verse 3]
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'ma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me
And tell 'er I’ve been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin' because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we goin' past the moon
[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er
I’m lookin' for 'er32Embed
