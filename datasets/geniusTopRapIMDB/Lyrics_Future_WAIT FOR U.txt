I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It doesn't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie, RM, wait (Higher, sayin' higher-er-er-er)
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

[Verse 1: Future]
You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going
I been in the field like thе children of the corn
[Chorus: Future & Tems]
I can hear your tеars when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (World was ending)
Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

[Verse 2: Drake & Tems]
Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feelings flowin' like a river
You be textin' back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say delivered (I will wait for you), but I know that you don't get it
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you
