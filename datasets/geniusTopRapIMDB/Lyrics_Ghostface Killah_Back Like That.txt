Back Like That Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Damn
Damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that, it wasn't really even that big, man
You know? Nah, it's alright, though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
And let me get those bags from Paris
And the puppies is staying, yo

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Yo)
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
'Cause I'm too much man to leave a mark on you
You's a bird, you know that
Givin' that man ten points like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw
Had to do it to him quick, old fashioned, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever
Like I'm 'posed to put him on when he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homie, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like, "Nigga, you know me"
Stop fronting for them niggas outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, word, yo, it's on

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Yeah)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl, that's right)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Uh-huh, yeah)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (Yeah, I'ma work him out)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Uh-huh)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Tell him son, yeah, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Yeah, this is how we do)
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Yo)

Ayo, I thought we was iller than that
All them kisses and love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a nigga went to war
Vest banged up, standin' in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homie in the passenger seatin'
Honey, look, I'm a monster don
I do monster things, that's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gon' hide in the streets when the body is gone?
If it's one thing I learned that
Never trust a female on no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your mama house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you's a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Uh-huh)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Told you)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (I'm a good dude, you see?)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Yeah)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Wanna play games, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no
[Bridge: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Shorty, what is you thinkin' 'bout? ('Bout)
Didn't I put you down?
Flyest whips
Rollin' round like, "Yeah, that's the boss' chick"
On the side I might of had (Had), one or two (Two)
But them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, tryna get revenge
That shit, you just don't do (Uh)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, you see? Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (This for the knucklehead)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (Females out there that wanna be)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Actin' like they gettin' they little revenge off)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Takin' it further than what it really is, you know what I mean?)
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Playin' yourself)
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Know what I mean?)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl, this is don status, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that (You gon' have to hold that now)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Word up, and when I see money)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (I'ma hang him upside-down, it's on, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (And not because of you, neither, you know? Believe that)

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
It's real
Yeah, got my swagger back and all that
Theodore, nigga, Theodore, nigga
That's right
I'll go pop more, I'ma go pop more coochies based on that there5Embed
