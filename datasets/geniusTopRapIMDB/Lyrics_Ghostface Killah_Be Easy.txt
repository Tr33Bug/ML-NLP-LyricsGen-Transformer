Be Easy Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, what's happening, New York City?
It's ya boy Ghost in the motherfuckin' house tonight
Know what I mean? (Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry)
We about to get it popping, let's go
Yo, yo

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Tell your crew to be easy
Niggas run around with them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay
Get word to the DJ
Tell 'em Staten Island's in the house, put the record on replay
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Get your nose blowned off by the fifth, uh
You wanna be there, layin' all stiff, uh
Every time you go uptown, you get gypped, uh
That's karma, boy, running your lip, uh
You be fronting like you got a bunch of chicks, uh
You be at home, nigga, beating your dick, uh
I'm in the club with the chipped up wrist, uh
You at the bar, wodie, drinking my piss, uh
The yellow shit in the bottle ain't Cris', son
You turned your motherfuckin' head, nigga, we switched 'em
You just mad 'cause I'm hitting your sister
You in the other room, huh, you couldn't sleep, uh
Pop a lot of shit without that liquor, yup
We mossied up, so take our picture
I'm like the boogeyman, nigga, I'll get ya
Whether now, later, afterlife or scripture

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, oh shit, ayo, Tone, hurry up and get 'em, nigga
You know what I mean? It's about to pop off
Y'all niggas clear the fucking floor
Get the fuck out the way, come on

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Tell your crew to be easy
Niggas run around with them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay
Get word to the DJ
Tell 'em Staten Island's in the house, put the record on replay

Yo, it's Tone in the building, the team's in the building
Niggas wanna beef, w​​​hat up, what up, what up?
We packed to the ceiling, we constantly chilling
We can 'cause we could, we shoot, we slice, we cut​​​​​​

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Shimmy, shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay now
Yes, my birthday landed in May, now
Peace to Dirt Dog, I'm back like déjà vu
Leave your girl around me, I will bag your boo
Ahh, you bitch niggas better listen up
Anybody front, paramedics gon' pick 'em up
They try to save you, swear to God, I hit the nurse up
Like "Nah, doc, he look better in a hearse truck"
I tried to ignore it, his people saw it
I ain't the type of dude you go to war with
My Polo gun, yo, will crack the floor shit
When the heat's on, you know I draw it
I had his number down, Toney just called it

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, ayo, Pete Rock, good looking, nigga
Staten Island, yo, Theodore
What's the deal? Slap me one of the ratchets
I'm about to go in, yo
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Tell your crew to be easy
Niggas run around with them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay
Get word to the DJ
Tell 'em Staten Island's in the house, put the record on replay

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Gotta get that cheese, gotta pimp that V
Gotta burn those leaves, and, uh
Pretty Tone make the girls say, "Please, daddy, work that D
Put it in and be eas'", and uh, so what? Come on
Now some of y'all people might know me from my Wallabees
Pretty bitches got my number, y'all can dial me
I stick it up like a nice cake robbery
And when I'm done, y'all can finger nail file me
Floss the ill robes since "Criminology"
Supreme Clientele put the world on top of me
Yo, babe, hurry up with those collard greens
I represent S.I., they ain't as wild as me
They lousy, I'm phat like a pound of cheeba weed brownies
Tone got the powder, squeeze, don't surround me
Quick to pick a honey up, shit, the flow's Bounty
Y'all can just crown me

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, that's right
I'd like to thank y'all for coming out tonight
How y'all like that shit?
You know what I mean, who really run New York?
This is that Theodore shit, motherfucker2Embed
