Beware of the Stare Lyrics[Intro]
The slums of a big town as packed with drama and danger as the squalling street of some native quarter. In the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis, where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame

[Hook]
He spares no one
He was forgotten, but he was someone
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah

[Verse 1]
Beware, son, I got the stare of Medusa
With the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser
I might shoot ya, make your ass an example
You can't fuck with Tone Starks, and not get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate rats
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies, DeLucas, spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder they daughters
Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes
Like the rise of your worst nightmare come alive
Ghostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive
[Hook]
He spares no one
He's not forgotten, cause he was someone

[Verse 2]
Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer
Metal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers
Bulletproof robes and wave caps
Revenge mode, nigga, you know Ghost gon' stay strapped
Hunt 'em down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil
It's the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel
I'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam
You tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger
GFK, the pain prolonger

[Outro]
He was a lonely man, they killed him
Cause they didn't understand
Though his spirit possesses a rhythm
As the words on this record unleashes the Ghostface KillahYou might also like1Embed
