Daytona 500 Lyrics[Intro: Force MDs]
We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot like Ironman Starks
They be the illest emcees in the world today
Cappa, Raekwon, and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
'Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez
"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at—"
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic, God—acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it, god, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Dre
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing—fuck the union
It's the same style, RZA’s train aboard, jump the turnstile
On the island, he tried to challenge God for the new Bal's
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac'
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a da—it pays, black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily, grands revive lands
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels, like we using 'em
Low-pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
"Ghost Face— Ghosface Killah!""

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Mercury raps is roughed, then god just shown like taps
Red and white Wallys that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep-away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blonde heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars—the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex was rockless, Chef' ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man, no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers in hundred watt boxes
Yo, jostling these cats while Little J be deli'ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians
[Hook: Force MDs]
"Rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"
All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Give me the the fifty thou, small bills, my gold plate, my slang kills
My beer spills—what up, Lils? Murder one, dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, Lorna Doones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill, check out the mad skills
Top-secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knock our slang, sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten, Donna, too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is Hancocked
'96, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

[Hook: Force MDs]
