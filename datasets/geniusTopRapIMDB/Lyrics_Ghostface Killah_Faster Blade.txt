Faster Blade Lyrics[Intro: Raekwon]
You know what I'm sayin'? You on the corners and shit, ya know?
Just gotta be on some, hands-down shit, you know what I mean?
Just keepin' ya eyes and ears open at all times
While we rhyme and shine
For my dedicated niggas who love this shit, we doin' it like this
Word up, what's the phenomenon?
Carry on, Don, tranquilizin'

[Verse: Raekwon]
A-yo! Movin' on these niggas like they owe, so, bro
You know how we go, we go, shift 'em out like perico
Fine, protégés off top connectin' like a buildin'
Four dollar whylin' niggas buildin', savin' the children
Come on now, check out the view like a oceanfront
Slow-motion in cunt, takin' what we want
You know a kid Asiatic, holdin' power like a Craftmatic
You like your fish fried or battered? — That day, he ratted
Check out the rubies from Diana, jet-skiin' in Atlanta
Makin' some power moves out of Savannah
Yeah, rock them niggas like jewelry
Arabics movin' blow like aerobics — That's when his nose itch
Yeah, that means it's all in effect
I'm hittin' you, I'm hittin' Buddha
Out in Bermuda, send that twenty-shot Ruger
Continue to slam and mend you like a venue
Get all up in you, oh yeah, your friend too, respect Wu
Yeah, keep them faggot niggas watery
Rhyme for rich niggas who supported me
Shorty pussy extorted me
So it's a science now, RZA, cuttin' they pockets like scissors
Cindafella found him a Wally slipper
Splashin' ends in the glass Benz in Nevada
Flashin' gems, eight-and-a-half Timb state robber
All my life been on some foul shit besides kidnap a child shit
Get on some foul and proud shit
Cheatin' many Koreans, bein' all that I can be an'
Put down on thirty keys an' get to fleein', light up a tree an'
Don't be breezin' like a blow dryer
Yo, you's a liar like Jeremiah gamin' on the flyer
Yo, Barbarian niggas is carryin', thug drug marryin'
Hittin' Marion off at the Clarion
All my Spanish niggas love us
We movin' like Russia, bone crusher
At the flick, stick the usher
Broke niggas — spot 'em like Cascade in the street masquerade
