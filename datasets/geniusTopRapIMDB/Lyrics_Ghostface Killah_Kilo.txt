Kilo Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah & Sample]
Yo, yo—
—'round the world today, the kilo is a measure
Oh, yo, Rae, I can't feel my face, my heart pounding and shit
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now—who the fuck—close them blinds and shit. Who that?
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
Captain Kirk? What, it's the fucking Stark Enterprise, the Enterprise shit outside, or some shit?
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember
I need some pussy, though—I'm ready to fuck Catwoman or something. F—Fuck it, let's go!
[Hook: Ghostface Killah & Sample]
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure (Ayo, ayo, Shareefa, go to the store for me)
Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember (I need some razors and a fresh box of baggies)
You never catch the kid going hand-to-hand (The ones with ten in them)
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure (Ayo, son, turn that water down a little bit—just a little bit? Thank you)
Once you got the funds, you got the panties, man
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember (I need two waters, a Dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)
Throughout I-95, I'm the handyman (Ayo)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Bricks, tar caps, powder, cooked up crack
Phones is tapped over Franklin stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'
Break out of town when the Jakes take down the pharoah
Reason: He was moving that Peruvian white
Blowing coolies in the hoopties, slamming cuties at nights
Big, heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars in water with rocks in them
Got my whole project out of order
A kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan
Extract oil cut from Cuban plants
The chemists is brolic, Pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo, peace to those cooking that raw, powder-white
Get your sniff on, Scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it "bricks," some call it "birds"
How many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curve?
You would go to jail; get caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales
They lived like brothers—word life—connects discovered
Most niggas get hard from fucking with them pipes and hustlers
Kilos is one thousand grams
You know your ammo better be heavy, 'cause soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land, daddy; I'm a announcer
You get caught with an ounce, it's over
Matter-fact, they taking you down, son

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Some say a drug dealer's destiny is reaching a ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks when they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later, straight cash, two million bucks
Strictly powder, no cut—your coke is vile, that's whats up
Y'all beefing over little shit, we sniff, the balance went up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
Kilo is one thousand grams, a pile of sand is equivilant
To the eye, it's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars; therefore, you check for wires
Dedicated dealers, during holidays, we give 'em lighters

[Bridge: Ghostface Killah]
Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops
Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops
Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops
Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops
Tall tops, long tops, short tops, twelve-twelves
Fifty-eight fifty-eights, weed bags, Ziplocs
Big rocks, coke spots, two Glocks, one ox'
Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack spot
