Meteor Hammer Lyrics[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
I don't touch that swine, I want that unnecessary beef
You smoke garbage buds, we smoke tons of keef
Fishing, looking for that big-mouth bass
And flashing, jack your whole stash
In fashion, keep my goons lined
In an orderly fashion
It's glossy with 500 horsies in the Benz
Tinted out to spend the night
You ain't got angel funds is low, stack
Your bitch been a ho, jack
Still scoop her up, bring her home
And blow that, cause Ghost be mostly
Looking pretty toasty
Front row at Mayweather vs. Mosley
With the Bin Laden bottle
A Brazilian model
Got the paparazzi jumping
Like I hit the Lotto
Party hard, like I'm fresh
Out of the cages
Outrageous like Charlie Sheen out in Vegas
[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
You drop your pants to your ankles
At the urinal at the ballgame
I'm on the stool getting brain
From a tall dame, cause I'm 5'8''
Shorty like 6'2''
Feed her coke, locked jaw
Like a pitbull. I was born to rep
You fucking with a hornet's nest
Old shooters in the corner like Hornacek
Young boys that be handling the rock
Chris Paul dish off, hammer in the sock
Gold flakes in the Gold Schlager
The ammo green XJ12, you know the old Jaguar
I got the birchwood lacing the interior
Poppy bagels getting flavored out in Syria
Only the Fonz, best laced plates
That reach maturity, dick sucked by Shannon Doherty
Take your temperature anally and orally
Make a batch of hummus drizzle royally with oil, B

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Hopping out the Rolly Royce
Rolls Gold Nuvo
Diamond-studded shoe soles
Flyest nigga you know
Puerto Rican version of Scarface
Fuck with the god's say
Disrespect, piss in your broad's face
Chains stay chunky like Oprah's belly
Got the purple and the brown:
Peanut butter and jelly
When I step up in the spot with the rock, you see the
Popular pop rappers go into their pocket and pull out their wallet
When I click-clack, now get up on the ground
Cause I Onyx, Pete Rock, Chuck D shut em down
You know Term, I'm the kid with the 'preme beats
Butter Pecan J Lo, chick with the mean cheeks
Rubies on my gold fronts, iced out notebook
Making volcanos in the kitchen when the coke cook
I rode around with all kinds of thugs
High on drugs, pissing out tiger bloodYou might also like5Embed
