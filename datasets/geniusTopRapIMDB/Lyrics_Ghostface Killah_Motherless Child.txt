Motherless Child Lyrics[Intro]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Yo, yo, guzzlin' forties (Let's get it on, fella), no doubt
The Wallabee champ comes back
Iron Man strikes back (Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks)
Raid your whole empire, no doubt

[Verse 1: Raekwon the Chef]
Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Niggas gettin' murdered for spots and bigger dimes
Droughts and drug wars, living by gun law
Jail cats come home and want to take yours
As a young one, growin' up broke, me and my peoples
Had to sell coke, I guess we all in the same boat
Thinkin', plus drinkin' that ninety-proof
Layin' on the roof sayin', "We need a next man to shoot"
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (Yo)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
I know a rich kid who got hit for three bricks
Showin' off his 850 plush, what a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' forties, hustled in the rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, "I Miss You", written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original neighborhood criminals
Clockin' dollars by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildin'-est niggas peelin' caps, known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clappin'
Slept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin
Labeled as the cow, he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
'Cause if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But shit never calmed down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off, money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relaxed like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin' him, them niggas from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, lookin' like he had a vest on
The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm
Movin' slow, baseball hats crazy down low
Word life, God, this bookhead nigga gotta go
Oh, shit, bookhead just bought a five G head
A King Tut piece, about the size of Little Maurice
We got to get him baby, yo, cousin, count to ten
I'm runnin' in, my first instincts is they're returnin'
The time is now, walked in and pulled out
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out?
Don't move, don't even flinch, fix 'em up
Drop the head, don't want to get blood on the Tut
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out, I'm robbin' him
Had to hit him ten more times, make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash
Granny shot my man in his ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee, fast
You might also like[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (Oh shit, what the fuck? Shit was horrible)
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
