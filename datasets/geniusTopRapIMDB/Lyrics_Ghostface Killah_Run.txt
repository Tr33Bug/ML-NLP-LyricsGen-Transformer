Run Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Psst
Yo (Yo), yo-yo (Yo), yo (Five-O)
Oh shit, yo (Yo, let me out), run

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Running through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the second floor, ran across
Cracks is fallin', my pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie-talkies them D.T.s had, Black, they was rated PG
Run, I will not give up, no, quick, flag the car down (Yo, yo, yo)
Take me toâ€” Ghost, here they come now
Rrt, pull off quick, back up
Hit the bitch dog, turn down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run, I will not get bagged on a rock
Run, I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run, they amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not coming home when i'm fifty-six (No)
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curve, swerve and get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit, they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life, like, by the tons
Run if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, is life, three-zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns, motherfucker

[Interlude: Jadakiss & Ghostface Killah]
Aha, I might got take my shirt off (Yeah, kid)
I like that one (Uh-huh, go in, go in), yo, uh

[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Ghostface Killah]
It's task force Tuesday, the narcs is in the black car
I got five hundred hundred-packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelves that look like stuffed shells
I'm cutting niggas' throats on the sales while they puff Ls
Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the OGs to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that, uh
Downshifting on 'em like I got gears on me
Besides that, I got about five years on me (Run)
Scared to death, running like I got bears on me (Run)
My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me (Run)
It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm looking for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would've let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life, like, by the tons
Run if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, is life, three-zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns, motherfucker2Embed
