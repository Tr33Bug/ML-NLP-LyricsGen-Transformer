Stay True Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Oh, yeah, motherfucker
It's real
Y'all niggas hold your guns
Throw your guns down, put 'em down

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, we in the fields with heat
You fake niggas eat kid meals to me
We street referees, we rock
Jean jackets, thick shirts over turtlenecks
Certified doctors in hoods that still oil techs
But wait, roll cameras, Babyface money blowin like Beech Nut
Call off the mutts, it's me again
Ghost, your host this evenin
(Ladies and gents I'd like to thank you all for comin out tonight)
Tux tight, all sharp, light up a bark, let's mingle
Fetch me a Remy Martin on Diamonds
Flare-leg Gucci joints, I never wore
I might give 'em to my brother-in-law
Fitzpatrick, rich bastard, worth more than Egyptian marrows
Borrow the God jewels, Gucci goggles
That's how the God do, Motown twenty-five
My orals like Smokey's voice, little moist, but choice
We guzzle Dom's, smoke with scratchy throats
Live on the edge, bracelets, shades and classy coats
Jumbo in the club, we play Columbo
Frosty the Snowman, frozen as the milky way
Ice on the floor, El-Producto in the sleeve
In the seam of his mink, he said he don't drink
Think before he talked, he walked like he ordered
Champ room down in Vegas
Vendin machines that shoot Alize', compliments of E&J
[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin & (Ghostface)]
The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had us years
What is a man to do? (Brother)
(Stay true, stay true)
The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had its years
What is a man to do? (Brother)
(Stay true, stay true)You might also like1Embed
