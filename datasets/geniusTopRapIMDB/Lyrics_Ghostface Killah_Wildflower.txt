Wildflower Lyrics[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
That was the best fucking I ever had
Well, that's because you've been dealing with the Ace
You gotta leave? Where you going, sugar?
I got business to take care of
Oh, shit
Shit, that's my old man, shit
Better go talk to him
[Refrain: Ghostface Killah & Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
No smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs
No smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs, no smoke in the lungs
[Bridge: Jamie Sommers ]
I'm mind shocking, body rocking
Earth shaking, money making
Sitting high, looking fly
I'm drinking on the best wine
[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, bitch, I fucked your friend, yeah, you stink ho
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega shit, 'bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stacking beaucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where was you at, ho? "Pinky house, she put in my perm"
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chicken-head ho, eating Harold's
I'm the first nigga that had you watching flicks by De Niro
You gained crazy points, baby, just being with god
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you Earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
You didn't do the knowledge, what the god was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleeding, held you down in malls
Sexually, you worshipped my di-dick like a cross
I had you freaked out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranqued
But you had to fuck this lobster-head ass nigga
I should've slapped him, but the gods said, "Chill"
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab
I'm wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low ho, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But, fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
We slid to the washing machine and threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb, baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus, I'm conceited, Starks make the biggest ho call rape
I'm God Cipher Divine, love my pussy refined
That means clean, a FDS smell with a shine
