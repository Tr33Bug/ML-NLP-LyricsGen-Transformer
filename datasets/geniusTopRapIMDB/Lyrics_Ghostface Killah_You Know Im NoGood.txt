You Know I’m No Good Lyrics[Verse 1: Amy Winehouse]
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull T-shirt
You say, why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

[Ghostface Killah]
Why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks, 'n'
You need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson
I know, we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cause how I get down
Not cause you was out there, messing around
I would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back
Try g'ing me, like I don't know how to mack
I'm a don - top of the line, I stay flying
Stop trying, to keep covering the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all
Let's go, before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block, when we in the hood
[Chorus: Amy Winehouse]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Break 1: Ghostface Killah]
[Scratches]
You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, nasty girl, try to play me

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a web we weave
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
Hear that lame? You love how I bring the pain?
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast
You might also like[Chorus: Amy Winehouse]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Break 2: Ghostface Killah]
[Scratches]
You had to be nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl, girl
You can't leave the kid... can't leave the kid
Don't worry, I'mma be around forever, nasty girl
Don't forget, I'mma be around forever, nasty

[Verse 3: Amy Winehouse]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips, as I soak my feet

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, get the bath and body works, pumkin and spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams
Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it
I could forgive the past, but I never forget it
[Chorus: Amy Winehouse]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
[Scratches]
Got to forgive the past, but I never forget it
Nasty girl... nasty girl... try to play me
Nasty girl, you had to be a nasty and try to play me
Nasty girl... try to play me, try to play me
Nasty girl, got to forgive the past, but I never forget it2Embed
