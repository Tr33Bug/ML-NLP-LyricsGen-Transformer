Abominable Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, this is for all of the emcees that taught me um...
How to color outta the lines
All of the emcees that made me wanna raise the bar
And take it to the next level
This is for all of y'all

I'MMA FUCKIN' KILL YOU!

[Verse 1]
I'm abominable
I'm a rhymer that's totally all about vocally dominant flows
Abolishing fools that be hollerin'
Goin' at all of 'em look like you're honestly so horrible
Obviously intolerant
Send me yo dough on the friendly expresses
Just go through my honest opinion but now I'm just listenin' and smilin' and cheesin'
Know all my rhymes will go all at emcees
And the thousands of pieces will pound them with ease
And the standin' around so the thousands is doubts
That are out emcee cowards grab on my counts
Till they out in they galaxy, out in the clouds cuz the honor of rapping is marvelous, gorgeous
Jump down for dying you talk to em bout but they answer I just wanna party and bounce
They sing along don't make me think too hard I just came here to relax in my drinking form
Don't make my brain work too hard I need TPR
Keep it on up please don't rhyme about meteors
I'm just an earthling and then I'm like ETR
My favorite Martian I feel like I'm speaking to him
All of my peeps if you do not mind keeping your
Light to yourself because we out here seeking dark-
-ness
I'm like I could just beat you boy
You don't want spirit
You might just want ouija boards
You're the reason hip hops making me sleeping more
Until you try to battle then you pee-pee your pants
And you fret 'cause you're keeping your stance
And you stand there just leaking from dances
I'm speaking advanced from my speaking you're bad for an album this outcome I once tell em done and to keep your advance
[Hook]
Abominable, phenomenal flow
Just sign if they'll take you where y'all wanna go
Abominable phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle ain't probable though
Abominable, phenomenal flow
Just sign if they'll take you where y'all wanna go
Abominable, phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle ain't probable though

[Verse 2]
I'm unfathomable with a habit of totally smashing opponents at random
Zoomin' a lot I'm as potent as stabs from cobra's fangs
Corroding the back of your brain exploding your veins
And growing your skin where rappers are flowing again
It's over for emcees lacking, attacking I'm notable
End these after I smack 'em
I'm over the feeling actually rapping
They know when I'm here to razzle and dazzle opponents
That fear the boldest and coldest of opuses
This is copious diss, I'm blowin' these kids to bits
With ritz
I would'nt've said ritz and kids if it wasn't for hieroglyphics
My rhymes are extensions of all my influences
Combined and mixed together in lyrical bliss
(ya smell me?)
Here, I'll give you a whiff
(inhale me)
Be clear, your mental will drift
(and still be)
Beyond and enter abysses
(tell me)
Mom, this prism is glistening
(said she on)
This livin' is dented, everyone that listens to this
Is privileged to witness lyrics from emcees
(well beyond)
The level of rhetoric dwelling in here has
The competitors iggin' except for whenever I said
That all niggas with metaphors get in the best of your sentences
Just go back and try again
Don't care about your damn zodiac sign
Or your country of origin
Homie like I am ain't kill 'em or killing
You phony ass rhymers and only at times and at
Moments of finding components of rhymes
That escaped through the vessel and go out implying that old ones can't science it
Open your eyes to the forces inside its exploding and shiny

Abominable, phenomenal flow
Just sign if they'll take you where y'all wanna go
Abominable, phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle ain't probable though1Embed
