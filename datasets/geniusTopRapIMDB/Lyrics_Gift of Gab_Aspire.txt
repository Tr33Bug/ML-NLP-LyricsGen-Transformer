Aspire Lyrics[Intro]
[?]

Yeah
Aspire
Yeah, what

[Verse 1]
Times get shooken up
People lookin' up -
Words Illuminati cookin' up
More plots and plans hooked in your washed up brain
Still lookin' for life just look at this
Once crookedness
Just up against blatant acts, just the way they act
When they stayin' back
[?] the puppets moved by the puppeteers
What the fuck is this
Now they shovin' fear
Tryna keep us unaware
Because they know that unaware folks ain’t gonna tear
Down the deceitment
All of the people
All you’d need to arm and proceed to swarm like a single Voltron
We are really the illuminated ones
Really people change to take the story as the story comes
When we can create a newer story starting one city at a time in alignment
The assignment is refinement
Rising higher and higher
I just wanna see the people of the earth aspire!
[Chorus]
Everyone’s a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Don’t allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein' through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
Aspire!
Everyone’s a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Don’t allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein' through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to

[Verse 2]
Niggas act like we ain’t been through 400 years of a government
That don’t want us here
All his brothers pierced
?and his wisdom sense of what justice is?
Paganomics we survived
We are gonna live on another year
Then another year then another year then another year
Can we open up and let some love in here people
What the deal?
Is it really gonna' take a revolution for the veil to be lifted
Truly lifted, truly this shit do be twisted
I just wanna channel all the mystic
Powers of the spirits that existed
All the unformed soldiers, unborn
Call em to the light they come swarmin' in
America is really now on some tournament dumb sorta shit
Observin' it, crumbs, puddles[?] and slums and the rich
Wanna run this shit but it’s done for 'em
When we come for 'em all we gotta do is move as one swarm of ants
In this tournament
Now who wanna dance?
The assignment's set, y'all come to class
Marchin' in and on to freedom once more
See we don’t fear Illuminati, yo we write our own story!

Everyone’s a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Don’t allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein' through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
Aspire!
Everyone’s a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Don’t allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein' through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to

PEOPLE OF THE EARTH ASPIRE!Embed
