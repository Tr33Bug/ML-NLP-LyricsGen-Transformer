Beyond Logic Lyrics[Intro]

Yes
I feel so brand new right now

[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]

Miraculous, marvelous, poem
Everyday on the calendar
Here on star it is born
Some are in heat of the night
A prophet'll come, droppin' uncommon knowledge
To top with a tropical storm
Top of the morn, don't let the obstacles stop you perform
You the chosen, that wove and came out of millions of sperm
And got to the journey and somehow forgot you was one
With all that is possible [???] and all that is formed
And all that is not, and yet it is all that there is
It's kind of hard to walk the walk that the carpenter did [Jesus]
Could it be walked if we was taught about chakras as kids
And how to empower the powerful spark and the big
Vibration inside and around us, embarking in bliss
Somehow without winning and lost and not conquering fears
Beyond logic and thought is where the true energy lives
We are not our thoughts and our bodies is lost in the mist
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's the next logical progression
It's the next logical progression
It's the next logical progression
It's the next logical progression

You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold
You are that important
