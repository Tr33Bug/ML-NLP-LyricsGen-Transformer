Bowling Pins LyricsSet 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Set 'em up as I go in

[Verse 1]
They call me Gabbin
I rap at the habitta-tat-tat
What savage is that-at
The average cat can't
Come rap and they can't stand
The rappers that act
Check they asses they can't stand
The album has rad stats
Banana the abstract
Anatomy smack cats
Inanimate black man
The animal advance
The radical rap chance
Command that you catch that
They cannot do jack rap
An amateurs ass crack
Examples of wack rap
The damage is back now
So stand your ass back and
Be glad that it's that damn
Unanimous back packs
Are crammin' with facts that
Examine the man (blast)
They cannot know that (that)
Fat album I passed at
You cannot, I am that
Phenomenal bastard
My rhymer go blak blak
I'm bombin' music and
There's honor to rap fast
There's already blastin'
Pass all of your asses
[Hook]
Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins

Set 'em up (set 'em up, set 'em up, set 'em up)

[Verse 2]
Keep goin' on 'til the day-break
Was wanting to made great
Phenomenal great plates
Was rhymin' on breaks
Make em fall in rows
Just like some dominos
Just 'cause I'm on a roll
Just 'cause I'm on a old quest
To demolish you
Just 'cause you arent too hip
Plus your styling is disgusting
Honestly kick butt
Whatchu tryin for, pick up
Your garbage and get the fuck
Outta here
Here comes the nominate gift of
Abolishing liquors
They hollerin kick it
And trying to get the fuck
Outta my district
I'm all about this shit
The rhyming and twisting
Ya mind up in this when
My kind of music interest
Shining and glistening
'Cause i am that interest
You kind of a bitch nigga
I am the shit, and you might as well quit
Be cause prior to this
You was hired on lyft till
Your rhyming got hit with
My fire then out went
Denial your outfit
Of liars got out quick
Retired and moved to
The eye of his child site
Admire the wild grind
And spare’a spark to death aura
Sport the best aura
Rock the fresh for’a
Audience aura crowd
It gets more’a
'Bout to rip more of
Feeble MCs are about to get tore up
Compton is global
Monstrous solo
Chop and will throw you
Out in space frozen
Far away, so far out
It’s not local, wait
As I hold y'all up in a choke-hold
Choke till it’s totally done and over

Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Set 'em up as I go in I knock 'em down like bowling pins

Set 'em up (set 'em up, set 'em up, set 'em up)Embed
