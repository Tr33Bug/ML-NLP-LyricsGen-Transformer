Circles Around Circles Lyrics[Verse 1]
Verbally I'm murdering the track again
I lyrically will kill 'em using synonyms and acronyms
Super rap avenger tapping into past I'll get ya pass
And drift into the center mass inventing rap adventures
Class is now in session children
I'll leap impressive buildings
Single bounds as phony rappers feel the pressure building
Their rhymes are less appealing then a crooked ex offender
I keep forever sending Heaven sent intelligence when
The parties over I'll relax in linen sexing women
Like I'm perpetually better than the best that did it
I don't invest in critics, views I manifest through lyrics
After the spot is blown to smithereens you guess who did it
Lyrically I'm the purple kush after they let you hit it
Executive of wrecking MC's for the heck of it and
I'll be the letter man, beheading MC's head and grill them
Over a fireplace at camp embedded in the hills
See that which never kills them is nothing that I rep
So any type of crime you seek is something I'mma get
I shatter rapper's worlds as if they was a China set
Even the thought of battling me is like a sign of death
[Scratch Hook: Trackstar The DJ]
"I 'bout to rap circles around this nigga"
"Serve words with nerve"
"You cool at what you spitting"
"Don't fuck up rotation"
"Word damn, you heard man, you heard man"
"Guard your radius"
"Watching ceiling fans go 'round trying to catch that feeling"
"Rap circles"
"That's the shape of things to come"
"MC's lyin', is dyin' shit off"
"Why don't you give that weak shit a rest and start rapping"

[Verse 2]
Circles around circles
Certain now it's curtains since my purpose now to hurt you
Serving power virtue through the verbs and nouns I lurk through
Murking peoples turfs and town that blurt the doubtful curses
Peep the metamorphis from the secret clever forces
They will be forever lost in sonic deep endeavors often
Here to lead the way of rhyme to each and every lost one
When I see a rappers head I seek to sever off one
Keeping every awesome bar discrete until I floss 'em
Keep excelling very far and free while letting off some
(Shine)
My radiance exploding like some popcorn
Fly so high that literally coming down is no option
Circles around circles around circles around you all
MC's that wanna stand for nothing, y'all are bound to fall
They call me Gift Omega
I rip and drag you through the agony of tragedy
And sad defeat and drown you with the roar
