Dreaminâ€™ Lyrics[Intro: Gift of Gab]
Oh my god
Go to sleep rhymin'
And wake up rhymin'
Just can't turn it off man
I'm just thinking too much
Just, I just, I just wanna take a break for a second
But I can't I just can't flow without it man it's like
Oh my god

[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
Rhyming and dominate prominent ominous flows
Ominous rhyming and shining the time it is club
Diving and hiding they thriving it's marvelous so
Obvious y'all be as down to this party in y'all
Intimate sentences entering infinite kaka
Tangents and ligaments bend and extend in your chakras
Didn't and getting and sitting and chilling and filling
And spilling it, filling it illigent. This is how it goes
Dropping a bomb on a comet; a saga is shaking
Father the stopping and polish it all in a breaker
Fall on a stopper, and follow the dollar I'll fake ya
Although I'm all about Wallace's balling I hate ya
Balling your comets are falling all over your acres
Swallow your shower of pollen in operative papers
All of em slaughtered the rappers and taught of the master
Be caught in catastrophe, come get and hit with power pulse
[Hook]
And the pain in my head
And I've never
Never, never
Felt so alone
My mind can't stop
Can't stop
My mind can't stop
Can't stop
And the pain in my head
And I'm dreaming

[Verse 2: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
Ding dong, That's me at your door
Sir diesel the sandman, gun atcha jaw
Uncut funk the bomb set to detonate, exclusive
Sure to shake it 'til you're lucid
Persuade ya, remind ya' that whining about loneliness
Never get you to the zone you wish
Dzl, my rhyme be the sign of the times
No matter the dateline I'm the grapevine
For the plot line just hit the hot line
If you on cloud 9 I'm hitting the turbine
You can't outshine the sunshine, bottom line
From the starting line make it as clear as crystal Lime
All the way to the finish line
It's a system wide pimping on the pleasure principal
Is it you? You can't pimp me I'm an O.G
Serving you the cold heat, time for you to go to sleep

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
Very seldom seen sleeping
Deep in a dream in the steam of the evening
Too much food for thought I keep feasting
Beats that need beasting, seeds that need teaching
Inner city peeps need reaching
Not hoing I'm heaving and freedom is the reason
D.C.'s teens in the street keep me grieving
Tears on my cheek Yet we keep believing
Every weekend another funeral procession
Creeping all down the streets and families weeping
Peeps need healing, anger's seething
Wanna grab a piece of that heat And get even
The tradition we're steeped in breed beef
And try to teach peace and make some new vegans
It's too frequent, living conditions is indecent
Future been bleak, man quit reaching
And all I got left is my speaking
About these inner visions I be seeing
Till I can touch and feel I'm not ceasing
Never stop rhyming, never stop dreaming
