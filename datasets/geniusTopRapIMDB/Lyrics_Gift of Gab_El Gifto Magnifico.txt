El Gifto Magnifico LyricsVerb murderin'
Lerd
For them to serve
Workin in derb
Perkin that herbs
Turnin some heads
Burnin them permament
And peerin' in
Y'all need to be learnin'
And sweep the tournament
Beat the feet burnin with deep
Discrete words inserted and keep churnin it out
Turnin' your doubt to worms and keep (promises) packed
React verbally
Back to back surgery
Aftermath [? ] with
Raps is sad
Dirty in fact
Murdering rap
What do you lack?
Money and mathematical
Militiamen whos
Ambitions will only keep your ass wishin so you can study my rap style
Huddling back crack with your buddy and whack pals
Cuttin' your ass down till you're utterly cracked brotha
You can't match skills now you're suddenly trapped
Caught in the act, yak, yell now suddenly smacked in y'all
Face all pale like ('where tha reaction? ')
Now who the dope ass rhymer with all the fly flows?
El gifto magnifico
Now who be rockin whole crowds throughout from the front to the back row
El gifto magnifico
Who make the ladies say hi when the brothers say ho
El gifto magnifico
Now who the rhyme traveler shootin' through the cosmos
El gifto magnifico
I'm lyrically aligned with things that you can't see
Physically
Therefore you can't see me
Master the cancer
That's spreading the black panther
Let in your head and you're dead
And I'm only getting the dance floor warm for
Dancers
Carry the gift like
Claus
Snappin a whip on Donner Vixen and Prancer
Asked for the future I'm here
And have more information than a cyber hallway
Half of you bastards are now stored
You fell in a trapdoor
And entered the true realm
Of rappers that rap raw
Rap jaw tap
All actors
The black nerd thug
Showin you [? ] the total strength of what a word does
Word up vision my mission and intuition
Nutrition will have you listen
And pissin and (feather lyrically)
You would step in my kitchen
Forbidden the synonym flowin
I'm sittin and (biddin your gnome?)
My adrenaline shittin on innocent victims
And killin them slow
You feelin it though?
You might also likeNow who the dope ass rhymer with all the fly flows?
El gifto magnifico
Now who be rockin whole crowds throughout from the front to the back row
El gifto magnifico
Who make the ladies say hi when the brothers say ho
El gifto magnifico
Now who the rhyme traveler shootin' through the cosmos
