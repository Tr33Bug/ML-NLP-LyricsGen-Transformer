Evolution Lyrics[Hook]
It's Evolution Get up on
And come into the future of a reality living deep inside the mind, let's come on
It's Evolution Get up on
And come into to the future of a reality living deep inside the mind, and beyond
It's Evolution Get up on
And come into the future of a reality living deep inside the mind, and beyond
It's Evolution Get up on
The floor into the future of a reality living deep inside the mind Let's come on!

[Verse 1]

The verbal acrobatic comin' at you to make your body and spirit and mental status infatuated No saturated active created
A true and living verbal master related
To take it where a lot of rappers ain't able to take it
Painted the vision of what we painted on rhythms
Imagery fakin' inauthentic for dividends
THIS IS SACRED!
Breakneck speed of thought, adrenaline rushin', expanding
Sending vibrations into the hollowness of canyons
Open and Shower the blind and deaf as identity
Man, the planet needs healing, you focused on your credibility streetwise
"okay, we believe you, now what?"
Where do we go from here? 4th Dimensional Rocket Ships Going Up Clever, sever the head of a rapper ready to predator, editor
Let it all get in your head and erupt, travelin' up, unraveling talents
And bust barriers Carriers of a power dreams are made of

[Hook]
Its Evolution, Get Up, Come back into a future of a reality living inside the mind, come on
Its Evolution, Get Up, Come back into a future of a reality living deep inside the mind, and beyond
Its Evolution, Get Up, We make the future come true, of reality living deep inside the mind, come on

The road of rhythm I'm travelin' deep within, the further
In I begin to ascend upon the zone of infinite energy
Given to me, so channel, now the creator that's living within'
Has risen and living through me again
I'm pennin' this venomous sinnin' in this, definitive inner vision
Of lyricists, I'mma win this in the beginning of the
Ending dissention, now get the picture and send that shit into
The millions that came to witness exquisite visitors of a
Distant mystical discipline inflicted, I'm so addicted
To fishin' in wisdom of bliss - I'm a bliss fishermen
Riveting swift, grinning with wit
I did it again and again and again in a minimum of ten trillion
Illy invented, brilliant sentences is inter-thrillin' em
Hit 'em legitimate bigger and wittier, intimate killin' it
Syllable senator, healin' your senate and feeling this shit
