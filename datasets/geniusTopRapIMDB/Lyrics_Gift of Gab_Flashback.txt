Flashback Lyrics[Intro]
As we proceed...
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back

[Verse 1]
Welcome back to the days and the times of old
Welcome back to the classic stories that's been told
Welcome back to diamond back whites painted chrome
Back when life was a way more simple zone
Welcome back to 501 and acid wash jeans
If you had tough skins you didn't want to be seen
Welcome back to cap session 'til the sun went down
Slap box your way before you ever left the town
Welcome back to one on one fight with no grounds
Being fired fat boy signing session in tower
Run DMC, Houdini, my first rap albums
Krush Groove, back when Run asked the crowd who's house
Breaking one, breakin two beats street, Wild Style
Jackson 5 Christmas playing on your radio dial
Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back, welcome back
[Verse 2]
Welcome back to the crush on a girl next door
Fifth period in homeroom passing back notes
Welcome back to family barbecues every month
Sometimes there would be arguments but it was all love
Welcome back to coasters and karate shoes
The Great Space Coaster, no Gnews is good Gnews
Way before you ever had a sip of your first booze
Drunk off life the simple things kept you amused
Welcome back to box cuts and jags
Jheri curl activate a rock in the plastic bag with a hat on the top
When niggas started to sag and gang bang
Even if you didn't you had to claim
Rocking corduroy hats with a crease on top
Stealing fake Gazelles out of the local thrift shop
Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back, welcome back

We keep it moving y'all
We keep it moving y'all
We take it back y'all
We take it back y'all

[Verse 3]
Welcome back to summer time expos in the park
Beach cruisers padded with the black foam on the bars
Welcome Back, Kotter, Good Times, What's Happening Now
Sanford and Son, The Cosby Show, That's My Mama
Gucci sweat shirt light blue furry Kangols
The Fila Mickey Mouse shirt that said "yo baby yo"
Spuds MacKenzie, Pee Wee's dance, doing the bud
RoboCop, the Cabbage Patch, fake ID in the club
African medallion school days do the right thing
I get raw still number one microphone fiend
Reminiscing, drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back, welcome backYou might also likeEmbed
