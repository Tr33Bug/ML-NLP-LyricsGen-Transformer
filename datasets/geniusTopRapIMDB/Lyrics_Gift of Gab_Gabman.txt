Gabman Lyrics[Intro]
Gabman, Gabman

[Verse 1]
Ripping the mission I'm on
Whipping the distance I've gone
Within the prism of rhythm this is precision beyond
Visiting children, christening listeners' ears with the song
Spilling his venom and killing niggas that get in the wrong
Lane and be aiming at me
Dangerous anger at G-
A-B, all haters get ate and slayed and then laid in the street
Shaken for faking, I will awaken you, taking a beat
Waiting in havens, I have escaped since you make 'em compete
Ape in the jungle, I rumble, make MCs take a defeat
Taking away their fakeness, erasing the way that they see
Patient the cadence, here's some what take us away, make us free
Fakers are famous and lame, yo, hate but you ain't a MC
Really, you hustle my flow
You are not busting no domes
You just a customer, hoe
Grilling me up at my show
Killing me silly, you simply ignorant, really
You are the children of Willie Lynch just fulfilling his vision
Really I'm still in this, killing this
I'm as ill as some killers
I'm a gorilla with iller intentions, hit 'em and hit 'em again
A menace to innocent lyricism, I'm venomous
In a minute you finna be chopped up into a million pieces
Like centipedes entering my dimension of lyrics
That are stupendous and endless for those that sit in my cinema
Like some chicken I grill 'em up
Rappers slid 'em up, then I'mma
Eat their innards up, when I erupt
These niggas are dinner and supper
If you are fitting to come and get with this infinite brother
Lyrically, then you will suffer, it will really be some fucked-up
Shit, I am really the illest MC
I just haven't come around to revealing it
So consider this here as a warning
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Venomous, penning this verse
Feeling adrenaline burst
Enter dimensions with the intention of lyrical murder
Of your villages, as I pillage some killings occur
Women and children should leave the building when Gift is in your
Radius, haters hating
It's crazy, the way I play 'em
What way I'm creating paintings of sages and aliens
Make their way through my way of patiently waiting for greater vibrations
Making their way through my spaceship, patient they wait on your playlist
Up, up, and away, fucking 'em up when I play
Suckers with other shit, what the fuck is it, come and get slayed
Stop going up against this, rough and a snuffing you'll get
Cutting enough of the pieces of you, I'm up to offense
Suckers is nothing, I let it bubble
Then something inside my rumbling stomach tells me to dominate hundreds of men
I'm on the attack, horrid deplorable acts
All of my competition is falling like dominoes, flat
I'm so abominable, atomic and sonic with flow
A scholar with scholarly power all on your honor roll
So honorable, I'm on a roll
Abolish you and the particles breaking your collarbone, I am gone
You never heard another rapper with a hotter flow
Stay tuned, an album's coming soon, right now I gotta go
