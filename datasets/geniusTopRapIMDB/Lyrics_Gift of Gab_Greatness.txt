Greatness Lyrics[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
Shit is bad, healthy to bomb
Drop of the arm topper on
Hop in the car
Stopping your awe
Blockin' your thoughts
You're coppin' it raw
I contort your tropical core
Conquering y'all
Could not stop him at all
The bar toppler dawg
I'm rock, rocking them, mopping them
Shock stopping they hearts in spots
Poppin' at they broads at the mall
Stop popping your chops ya hobgoblin
Drop beyond garbage it's not at all
Logic is wrong
So stop talkin' 'cause I concoct talk-isms
Hot beyond lava
To drop the whole lot of ya all
Stop blockagin' all
The cock blockers
They talk about poppin' the raw
But not rockin' the floor
You Top Ramen in pots
I'll mop all of ya shocks
That's bog rhymin' your cop
And watch all of ya fall
Dollars and nines I clock holla
I got new hot caliber raps
To rock all of they noms
Through calm traveler
Romp through spots all over
Chops through abdominal
Stock you like animals
Rock you raw tenants through pop
You fought and your crew flop
You not damage
Do not, do what you can or do
Lock onto the savage who's not
At all average in thought
You all banished and shot when caught
Poppin' your jaw
[Verse 2: Versatyle]
Hold the meaningless reading really redundant
Feeble easy to come with
Any dreams of defeating
The V you better bring hundreds
Hung with nunchuks and weapons from
A dozen dungeons
Bazookas and M-1 government funded gunmen
This number one stunner
Stunned with cunning conundrums
Cold War word product like Osiris was summoned
I'm old jazz with a vocab of a man-sized landslide
Avalanche style franchise hang-glide good god
Get whupped on punished for life to push far
Soldered it on slash soldier nigga
I'm a certified hood star
Flashback my urban stat verbiage that
Is searing all diversion back
You're folding bibs in the back with burger shack
Thiefin' I should slap you what they call boy box you sleepin'
Wake up coward and be a man and take this beatin'
Touch mics and trash talk
Of a crushed ice toon to breathe
The universe cracked a path and made room for me
Greatness
