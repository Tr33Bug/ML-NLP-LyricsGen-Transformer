In A Minute Doe LyricsKeep growin'...
Keep growin'...
Keep growin'...
Keep growin'...

[Verse 1]
It's like we more like brothers than nephew and uncle
Comin' up at times seem survival is like a jungle
Understanding takes time, some lessons we gotta go through
I remember when we was young and the price tag on those days and nights
Can't be measured or bought
Sometimes I wish we could bring 'em back
Sundays at church, comin' home from work
Kept it on the low you lent me two dollars for them burritos
Headed out to the bay to focus on dreams
Sometimes I feel I shoulda been there for guidance
But I was learnin' what it means to be a man, still am
And every time I think I figured it out the universe expands
We was supposed to bring you out on the road
When dough got ripe
We ain't even had a chance to chill, it's just not right, man
I guess the street life had other plans, but I'm gonna see you in a minute doe

(Ohh.........)
(Ohh.........)
Keep growin', keep growin', keep growin', keep growin'
(Ohh.........)
(You gotta) keep growin', keep growin', keep growin', keep growin'
(Ohh.........)
Keep growin', keep growin', keep growin', keep growin', (you gotta) keep growin'

[Verse 2]
There's a purpose underneath it all, divine plan a scheme of all
Then do what you got in it, growin' learnin', find your proper callin'
Stay strong and take in all the knowledge that you can
Stay healthy and keep in touch, I get them letters flowin' fam
This ain't goodbye, all it is is just a test to make you stronger
Be a soldier, from here we only move forward
Upward, onward, and over the hump
And yo, I know that it's a lot of years
But it's a whole lot of precious life left for you to live
God dwells within, find Him inside, free you soul
No matter what they'll never lock up your mind
So let your thoughts flow, free
And be the best you can be, learn from your mistakes
You got a destiny, man, your life's purpose is to take it there
Recipe, expand your mind, read and work out, get your plans together and focus
The day you come out, we all gonna party like it's two-thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine
But I'm gonna see you in a minute doe
Sincerely, Uncle Tim, Gift of Gab, Supreme Lyrical
