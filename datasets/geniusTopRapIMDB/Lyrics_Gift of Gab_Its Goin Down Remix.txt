Its Goinâ€™ Down Remix Lyrics[Talib Kweli]
Your diamonds is major, my shinin' is greater (yeah)
I silence the players with violence and chaos (my people)
Got dominate ways to abolish the haters shit
I spit so slick you can polish the cadence (playa)
The way I rock, they study me like Geology
I make my point, cuss loud, swear solemnly
Prob'ly change the music like Charlie did on Anthology
Try to front on me? You'll be more sorry than apology!
I holler B R double-O K
Blackalicious done repped the whole bay
Oakland to San Jose
Vallejo and Humboldt County then blaze crops
My blades chop right into your head like J Pop (?)
My name pop up in conversation when you're talkin' big shit
Your wig split, when I'm in the house you get evicted
Puff spliffs for upliftment, relax and kick it
Don't get yo' ass busted for some shit your lips did
[Hook - Gift of Gab and others]
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
It's Goin' Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
It's Goin' Down again
Stars'll never shine as bright as these again
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)

[Lateef the Truth Speaker]
Och Katch Bo Botchy, Banana Fanna Fo Fatchy
As I begin co-opting your mind'll spin backwards
Counter-clockwise 'til the timepiece your watching
The foundation for the brand new hypnotic
Eavesdroppin' it, ain't no stoppin' it
So, Olley-olley oxen free free free
All other MCs can come out from their places of hiding
With their toys G.I. Joes bikes and playthings
To be greeted by Lateef, Gift of Gab, and Kweli
To show all y'all respectively
To approach respectfully
Each man I ever saw in my life
Was once a baby held protectively tight
To his mother's fresh milk recipe
So, when it comes to justice, don't test me
Trust me and let it be
That the bluebird on my shoulder should I kill it or will it be
The source of soliloquies when I'm like 83
Still the call is militant
Only because we diligent
Tearin' away the innocents/innocence
Don't you dare get belligerent

It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
It's Goin' Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
It's Goin' Down again
Stars'll never shine as bright as these again
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)

[Gift of Gab]
The verbal Matador and categories of our own
Ignite and have your blurry vision
Weary patterns turnin' on the light
To wrestle with your thoughts
No more without the dawning of the Tights(?)
Within the lights, cameras, and actions
Of this happening called "life"
And when it all unfurls and nothing's left
But just this fleeting second
Speeding decadently past you
Where you merely seein' heaven being relevant
To right now in the present tense
In front of you is true and breathing, live, physical evidence
Existing all the tiiiime, forever in this
There's one Eternal Now that never, ever ends
That's right, I said it; go and tell a friend
I came to conquer villages upon the backs of elephants
I came to pour these lyrics in me out from out my head again
Come out, Come out

Bring the inner feeling to the plane of physicality
And spread it all around
Drown in the aura for ya sure to lure ya
Auditory fully reaching deep and keep it tight, it's goin'
It's goin' down!

[Hook]
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)
It's Goin' Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
It's Goin' Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
It's Goin' Down again
Stars'll never shine as bright as these again
It's Goin Down again, down again
Sure act of breathing (?)
