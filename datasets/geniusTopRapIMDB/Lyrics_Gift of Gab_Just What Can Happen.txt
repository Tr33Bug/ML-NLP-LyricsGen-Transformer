Just What Can Happen LyricsJust What Can Happen x 5
Verb and add a metere
Prime time for your mind staff
Lyrically I be the illest monster
Stomp ya
One for the treble
Touching on board, Concorde
Stopping the Flight 11
Soaring way beyond ya

Comprhension, watch the engine
Toppling and mock the opposition
Not to knock my vision
Slaughtering and not to mention
Hostages and morph inside the fortune off
And while I'm scoping
Popping open bottles
Dropping tokens-where i'll get off
And stopping ain't an option
Dropping solar cosmic rhymes
And toxic poems, Quannum sock ya
Who can rock and
I'm a mess
Test a G
I rap and see
You're back
You're knowing me
A half a thousand penance back
I leave your Adam's apple swelling
Felons laughing like I'm Adam Sandler
Smack an average amateur
Towards your slacking, savage, radical, oral path
I'm motal rapping
Black immortal tan and tab
And over Spanish black
You know the man is
Cracking open planets, graphics ultra maim
And that shows there has been infactual in
Gab and black you know it's mass impact
You roll and pass and flinch
I make it happen

Just what can happen x 4
To crush a brain
You never bust in vain
And must you train
Amongst insane
The youngters craving
Aiming for the jugular vein
Complain above your range
I strain to shove you out your lane
It's pain
I came to snub your aim
And duck your lame
And uplift
You might also likeAncient culture angles
Tangle up
Your mangled structure
I done just broke your brain
It's over - novacaine ain't up ta
My Alien Invasion y'all
A crazy in erasion all
Occasionally making y'all
Amaze, ventilate, win all
My (???) is gone
My nature is to take your break your arm
And leg and make it call me
Make it, take it, come away and hurt ya

ALL NIGHT - Crying in your dreams
And Rhyming when I scheme, I'm silent
Let you beam
And set your screen
Ablaze with FIRE

It's the pride, humble, markster
Posted like a lion
Sitting in the cut
Know when you sleeping on me
Bout to rudely wake you up
And who, be take the cup to profit
And shake you up
Captain rapping
Rock the boat
I shock
You know I'm not a soldier, kid
I make it happenEmbed
