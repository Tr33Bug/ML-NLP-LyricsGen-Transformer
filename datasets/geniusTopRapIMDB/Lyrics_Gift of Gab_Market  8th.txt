Market & 8th Lyrics[Scratched sample]
Back on the journey again

[Verse 1]
Wanna cross the block to buy a loaf of bread
A homeless man yelled out
"I haven't had any food all day
Man I'm down on my luck, can you spare some change?"
All his friends looked up, like as if to say
If you got it like that, throw something my way
So I had to keep stepping, put foot to pavement
I really would have liked to help up but, hey...
About twenty meters up the sidewalk
Eye contact with a girl that I saw
Soul windows as the cold wind blows
There was no one home, she was gonna lie but
Dead to the world with a head in a whirlwind
Yes, she was smiling, she didn't look sad
Maybe in a mist, she's oblivious
And they call ignorance bliss, hey, how about that?
All walks a life, all playing in the game
Ain't a game to be playing some don't have a plan
All in the one block radius
Market off 8th, summertime in the streets of San Fran
[Hook]
It's loud on the block now we got sounds

[Verse 2]
Yeah... uh...
Ten meters up seen a brawl
Two dope fiends going hard for a stray dollar bill
Owner of the Chinese food store
Came out with a pistol, like "Take it outta here!"
One man with a sign saying hungry
One with a sign saying buy me a beer
And you try to push through in your own zone
Chilling 'til you peep, there's a guy in your ear
So I sped up my pace
Man I want these salespeople out my face
I don't know what they selling but I ain't debate
For the hook line sinker man I'm out
It's crazy when you can't mind your own can't find your space
And they take it personal then you walk away
All in a day, deep in the heart at the Bay
Summertime, San Fran, Market and 8th Street

[Hook]
It's loud on the block now we got sounds

[Outro]
It's loud on the block now we got sounds
Everybody listen, come to this town
Gift of Gab on the mic, bringing it down
Taking it, breaking it, shaking it, all around
