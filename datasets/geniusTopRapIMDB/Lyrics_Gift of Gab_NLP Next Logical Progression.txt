NLP (Next Logical Progression) Lyrics[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
Now everyone complaining how the bar is low
Travel in rabbit hole and see how far it goes
The conveyor of light is shining like an oracle
If you know what the game is missing what you snoring for?
If you calling it dead you're adding onto the death
If you ain't resurrecting it judgement and resentment hard for those
Grab a pen and pad and show them all how to flow
Could be since you know everything go on and spark the ho
Resurgence of lyricism ain't current apparent the yearning the colorful ways of busting
No other could ever enter the zone
Image alone couldn't give you the throne
Man you bugging I thought you was pissed why you sitting at home?
Chilling this isn't some cold
The start of this is some whole another other dimension travelling through infinite zones
You ain't adding onto the pot in the kitchen be gone
And stop blaming it on the industry my nigga be grown
[Hook: Gift of Gab]

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
I eat a rapper like a plate of Okra and Potatoes
Hoping you make it with an array of monotonous phrases on top of the pay
I say on top of the fake emcees can make up shit like they make up shit
It doesn't take a bit of talent to do what they do the game is fully jaded (yeah)
I'm contradicting the first verse now I tried so hard not to go in notice moment like everything is fabulous
Because it would be hate if I critique and talk about all the whackness that is blatant I can see
These artists aren't really nourishing I can't wait until I can eat
They aren't garbage they're like all the bacon I can eat
I'm lyin' everybodie's lying too take a higher fee
And sell out so when you go too hell tell Satan bye for me
Go take the lower road I will make it flying free
Elevate through the heavens by making ryhmes to beats
