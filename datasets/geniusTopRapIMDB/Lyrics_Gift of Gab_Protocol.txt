Protocol Lyrics[Chorus: Samantha Kravitz]

MCs come and MCs go
Street cred big but they can't flow
Please respect my protocol
One by one I'll drop them all
Just call me a conscious fool
Who rhymes circles around you
Please respect my protocol
One by one I'll kill you all
[Verse: Gift of Gab]

Party people
You're about to witness
Something ya never heard before
Thank God for listening
My hobby and job
Take y'all to infinite states
Lost in rhythm it's great
Your deliverance
Better than a case
Of eight ball or Guinness
This ain't for the timid
I break jaws and ligaments
Rappers step up
And they take falls
I flow like the great falls
And rivers Y'all ain't raw
Ya'll niggas is cake
For the picnic plate
All ya lyrics I make
Ball up all of the paper
And throw it away
Aw, ya kidding me right?
Nah, ya killing me
I should murder all y'all
On documentary
Pun-cock (?) delivery
One thought from this
Is beyond ya whole clique, ya squad
The whole chemistry
Y'all possess isn't a fourth of
The rhythm I store
In one kidney, come on
Ya'll come get me it's war
You know diddly squat
I know rhythm
It's like I'm Bo Diddly
Rock 'n' roll history
Stocked in your memory box
Your flow it'll be chopped
And whole cities and blocks
Will go instantly nuts
When I'm killing the cut
I'm not giving a fuck
I'm hot living it up
It's quite iller
The knock is godzilla
I sock holes in buildings
With nocturnal vision
And rock for the children in Watts
And south central, the Bronx
And Boston and the spots
That's not loving the cops
They like "nigga that positive
Shit is not hot"
We don't listen come out
To our district and cop
The whole village and not
Cos your vision is not
How we living it's hot
And blood spill in the lot
We ain't dealing with chakras
We dealing with choppers
And innocent bystanders
Feeling the drop
We just getting it out here"
