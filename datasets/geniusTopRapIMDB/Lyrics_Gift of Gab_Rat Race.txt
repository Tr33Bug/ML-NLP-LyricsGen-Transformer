Rat Race LyricsRunning, moving, stressing, fussing
Cussing, drinking, smoking, killing
Dying, stabbing, shooting, thinking
Walking, pacing, running, falling

Yo, check it out, one time

All the bull stop's here, I'm the matador
Here to introduce a new rap category
Climb on top of my music, mine Matterhorn
Rhyme for rhyme, you don't really wanna battle boy
Just another clip added in my catalog
Get your money young playa, I ain't mad at y'all
Here to bring soul like stas-gladisol (?)
Drop the fatter raw verbal mic analog
Sorry y'all, but I didn't bring a Gatt along
Just a pen that does tricks like a magic wand
Get my cadence and a whole rap pattern on
As the sky just falls over Babylon
Travel on Pluto, Venus, Earth, Saturn on
To the place many sane brains haven't gone
When it come to this here
'specially in this year
Frankly I don't have it all
Running, moving, stressing, fussing
Cussing, drinking, smoking, killing
Dying, stabbing, shooting, thinking
Walking, pacing, running, falling
Striving, climbing, scratching, clawing
Growing, knowing, guessing, acting
Working, looking, peeking, seeking
Peeking, counting, seeking, searching

It's the Gift of Gab's new rap seminar
Male groupies please show me where the women are
In a world full of shyst type criminals
Make a LP feel like cinema
Bring light like a rhyme prime minister
Send ya up write it off on adrenaline
On a scale of one to ten it's a ten and a
Half, feel my wrath now, sucka nigga what?
Used to puff on a daily pack of cigarettes
Til I bought a pack of chewin gum, Nicorette
Come to find that I had to get rid of that
Now at shows I got more wind in the set
Wrote a alcohol free song in the next
Thirty days drunk again like hypocrites
Dude, my ego isn't quite that deflated yet
Signed a deal with a major haven't made it yet
Got a past cable bill haven't paid it yet
Crazy wit, now I love my life takin it
Where it hasn't been taken yet
Go against the grain of the rat race daily it's
