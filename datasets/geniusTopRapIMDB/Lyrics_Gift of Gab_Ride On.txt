Ride On LyricsBuckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on

Many years ago I asked this cat if he could be my DJ
He said, “when?”, I said “forever!”
And ever since then, my big pen
Seemed never to be able to resist when
I hear a beat, I grip then
Through clarity and awe
Of where I see it all
Just cause I’m rhymin’ from the spirit, tearin’ free of all ego is
And please don’t get it twisted, never flee a star
If you ever try to block my path, I’m tearin’ through your jaw
When I write it’s like I get a greater sense of who I am
Way beyond this life and death, every moment is new again
You gotta get into it to get into it, intuitive
Synchronicity cause nothing is really coincidence
Livin’ for today, yesterday, and tomorrow
Cause it’s all a fleeting moment for a soul moving through time and space
And most the stuff I rhyme about some say I shouldn’t talk about
But yet the words just seem to seep out way before I say em’, or think em’
I’m thinkin’ of a master plan
Rhymes all fall like avalanches with the force of Anakin
Walkin’ on the sky again
Zonin’, feelin’ higher than
Climbin’ to the highest land
Givin’ back what I am handed
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
