Rise Lyrics[Chorus: Gift Of Gab]
And through the trifling times, Hail Mary to the world, can we heal em with rhymes?
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise[Chorus: Gift Of Gab]
And through the trifling times, Hail Mary to the world, can we heal em with rhymes?
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials, just let the rhythm guide you, heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within

[Gift Of Gab]
They say that substance is a thing of the past in rap
And some holler that its even a handicap
I want to open up eyes but I find that I talk more than I walk, so its sort of like the blind leading the blind
Still I see the divine inside, all my people inheritance??(til the)?? Kingdom reside in the Matrix
Money is not the key of true freedom, but when I say that to the starving it doesnt feed them
I speak of meditation, people thinking Im weird
Im talking about yogis, mothafuckas think of a bear
I want to empty out all the chatter and go in and dwell
To find an inner god with them and say youre going to hell for that.
My fan base is not who I grew up around
Im touring the world but my folks is still struggle bound
The more I learn, I learn I dont know nothing
I say lifes great, brothas is like Let me hold something?
[Chorus: Gift Of Gab]
And through the trifling times, Hail Mary to the world, can we heal em with rhymes?
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials, just let the rhythm guide you, heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within

[Raashan Ahmad]
Said Im a weirdo, underground, conscience, and crazy
Can I scream God and at the same time Pay me?
Would your head nod if I talk about ladies and how I wanna do them? Is the whole song ruined?
Im doing all my best, play on lifes court
Can I study Rumi and still quote Too Short? YEEAAAH
I am just trying to find balance, do the best that I can
But I always backslide because I am only a man
Trying to be that change but things dont change
So tryna to change course, but I am stuck in the same flow
Speaking on the highs and the rut of these same lows
Make me wanna cry, too soft for you lame-Os
Do I got to die for my art like Ramo to validate confusion that I feel? Gotta say no
No, cus still I rise and make a little progress through all my tries. I rise

[Chorus: Gift Of Gab]
And through the trifling times, Hail Mary to the world, can we heal em with rhymes?
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials, just let the rhythm guide you, heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
You might also like[Zumbi]
You might have heard me holler Jah Jah, Buddha, Allah
Praise be to the most High, baba
And thats I, when I fly like manna
Fall from the sky, relax top gunna
And no wonder you can feel what Im under. Im shooting up for heaven with my head in a slumber
Kind of sleepy but still you can peep me
Serving juices, fruit like litchi. See these speeches beseech me
And these leeches they teach me beef is beneath me
Tryna ?(fith)? with the kitchen ?(greasy)? and people believe wouldnt life be so easy
But the ice is so freezy thats between you and me that you cant feel my steezy
Its an everyday thang keep it breezy. God is in all so its all to the geezy


[Chorus: Gift Of Gab]
And through the trifling times, Hail Mary to the world, can we heal em with rhymes?
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials, just let the rhythm guide you, heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
Again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials, just let the rhythm guide you, heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise; rise again, maybe one day well merge with the god within
