Spotlight Lyrics[Hook]
Lay low,  get dough, control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Ye-eah!
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Ye-eah!

[Verse #1]
I like to flow like water
They like to blow the fuck up
I get the dough
But on the low
I'm about to show you what's up
Phenomenal the rhyming poet
I've been holding your touch
It might engulf your mind
[?] and goals in life [?]
To show you're not up
To par with
The rapper it's not cool
To spar with
Finding it better to lay in the cut
And watch it
Unfold
Don't expose it
If I'm folding large bills
It's not as valuable to me as the riches of the soul
I'm lyrically intense as the vision
Of men and women
Scattering in the middle of an evacuation from villages
This is that instant vintage lyricism
Intended to get you lifted
Essentially your mental is targeted
Autistic expression
Is manifesting your limits
But not in my psyche
That's why I can't be involved with it
All energy I'm around is selected
Authentic
And genuine
Cause a lot of them would like to see you fall
So I-
[Hook]
Lay low,  get dough, control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Ye-eah!
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Ye-eah!

[Verse #2]
I never needed the gold or the diamond
Bagging more than my family
Man, getting older
I find it ain't important
To dazzle and impress thoughts
In the minds of strangers
Who wouldn't throw me a preserver if my life was in danger
Fuck it!
Lay in the cut as these days are numbered
Some say that what's up is simply [?] abundance of life
I'm about to re-up my spirit today
And come with the verbal ingredients
To intoxicate your circumference
Operate at a speed or capacity that's not among us
Some will hate us
They are afraid of potential greatness coming through you
Later for that I could never stay in your dumbness
The game you're playing is sad and your energy may get self-destructive
I thought your front
That's why you stepped to the other side of the street
While you're crying, looping, and sighing
I kept on hustling
Not just for green but for any freedom of being me
I'm forever shaking your opinions
And weak assumptions, Buster!

Lay low,  get dough, control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Ye-eah!
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Ye-eah! (repeat)Embed
