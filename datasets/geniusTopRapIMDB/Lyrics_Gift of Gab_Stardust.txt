Stardust LyricsYea...

Yea..

Rhyme to the rhythm
When I slip in to the zone
And zero deep into the groove
So as to astonish my opponents
When I'm on it like I own it
Make the whole galaxy go nuts
Script and held ya deep within a different world
Like Lisa Bonet on D'Wayne Wayne mane
Never plain, stained brains
Strive to elevate from here
Not just to simply maintain

To the bang bang boogie watch my spirit bling bling
I don't need no chains or jewelry
I don't need a dang thing

Hang, rappers like a noose
That don't produce another product
It's my soul's interpretation
If you want it, here I got it
Only so much time allotted
Many thoughts that must be jotted
Clearing out the minds are clotted
Not I'm writing on some 'Pac shit

In the month of August, take a break out to the farthest region
On my rocket ship now y'all MC's can eat my stardust
See the crew I rep is Quannum
Y'all the bench, we the starters
We the meal, the main course
For your belly, y'all some toddlers

Keep it modest, dope and honest
I don't claim to be the hardest Killer, wit' a gun, I really
Only wanna be a artist
Travel the entire novice, global trotter
Got a lot a proper type of sharper, riper, Ahnken conscious here to offer
You might also likeIn the middle of the sky, you see my trail, a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some psychedelic clarity to breath within the madness

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned

When you're out and you're far away from home
And your heart and your mind, they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned

Left the planet Earth to get a wider life perspective
On the bigger picture, now I'm steady cruising through the nebula
Headed out to Mars, where souls and minds are more connected
Build with elders, how to conquer ignorance
The mighty predator

I be the cosmic editor
And when it rains, I let it pour
And if I'm short on tour, I guess I'll be the lyric peddler
I'm deadly with the medley
Steady, ready with the metaphor
MC's are R.I.P. if they love life, then why they set it for?
Headed for your head, it's gonna erupt, I'm blowing up
And popping, this it's court I be the judge and jury
With the Johnny Cochran
Savvy, plus I hit the cabby green up really often
When I'm rocking like I rock it now, stopping is not an option

Powered by a force inside, that never will run out of ammo
Used to build with Pharaohs, riding through the desert on a camel
Ran into a camel by the name of Joe, thought he was wacko
All he did was smile and pose and get my folks hooked on tobacco

I crackle as I rap, and pro attack a slacker
Never clever, sever heads
I'm clever, yes, I'll never dread a battle
If they white, they put their thumbs up, a black fist if it's a Afro
In the Bay I'm hella tight and plus I'm filthy in Seattle

In the middle of the sky, you see my trail, a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night, it's dusty, yet it's clear
Like as if you was dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some psychedelic clarity to breath amongst the madness
