Sun Donâ€™t Shine Lyrics[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
The sun don't shine
With rhythm and enhance and every day
I come throw rhymes
And leave ya lifted up into the sky like humble kind
And show you how a true lyricist does it one more time
With the gung ho fun flow what do you know

Uh oh prime time in the jungle
Rhyme flyin' into one soul
High tide, better run for it
Night light in a rumble
Right, right, left, and a uppercut cold
Clockin' em, rockin' 'em stoppin' 'em in their tracks
One flow after the next
I'm holda grudge over
When I grabbed the mic and ripped it
And I left a smudge over your career
Today I'm quiet
Because I am much older
Not the type to kill a rapper that would
Cry on your shoulder
Live from the solar system
Jehova made over
Play it over and over again
And it will never fade away, stay sober
Color outta the lines like Crayola
Only way you're ever outranking my skill is payola
It's the naplam bomb droppin' and stay calm
I'm poppin' and ray[?] [?]
Innovate cum laude
Choppin' it Bay down to H town
To way down south
Rockin' it way down to a town
Like hey now now
Quannum and they drown sounds[?]
Will never fade out bounce
Or far and way out mountains
How I lay out styles
It's how I make loud doubters
Into straight out followers
Don't ever play round
I may pound ya, stay down clowns
[Verse 2: Lateef]
Is there a three ring circus in town?
I've heard it performing on the underground circuit
Around here somewhere, somehow
Better stay with that sound out of earshot rounds
Cause me and Gab will pound
That bullshit into submission, truth be told
I don't wanna give the false impression
That you could stand around smilin'
If you can't stay down silent
Fight for your options
We don't play around drownin' fools
Surround your crown and
Overwhelms your sensibilities
Turns you out
Unless you got a natural predisposition to divinity
It might be difficult to listen to it
Let alone mimick me
It's alright I don't charge much for my tendency
If you let them set up a tent in your cd changer
Stranger things have happening
One of them involved me stopping rappening
One of the reasons rappers are in danger of
The thing is that the manglers of the microphones
Will strangle you with the slang
The g will pain and take your soldiers
Jostle slingin' things remain

Pen and pad
Annihilator violator
Higher state I'm wide awake
And rhyming vital tidal wave
Into this recital
Play the mic all day
Microwave
Mental frequencies
As we take over your mind and makeEmbed
