The Ride of Your Life Lyrics[Intro]
Enter in to the spacecraft filling up
That won't touch back again 'till the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
It's a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light
And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up it's the ride of your life
[Verse 1]
Riffin in the octave of the
Infinite provocative
Come get within a rocket ship
Dimensions of a positive
Inventions that is monstrous
I'm givin' it my all
It's just my sentiments
Evolving as I give in
To the power of just livin'
In the now, I put the div-idends
I holler from the spirit
Within all of us
I'm driftin on a cloud up in
Your mental feel the shower
Follow in, as I devour
Y'all with synonyms and vowels
Ladies and gentlemen
It's our time to dig within a tower
Over ignorance, the final hour's
Here so come and crowd around
And listen up on how I'm stayin driven
By the sound I feel it liftin'
Higher how my daily livin' is
The styles are like my children
Seen scoured through the villages
And towns, and when the Gift
Is in the house
I bring the lyrics
That come down from up
Inherent to the sound
From a mysterious, profound
Very indigenous way out
Chief inner-vision, and
I think I've really truly found religion now

That won't touch back again 'till the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
It's a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light
And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up it's the ride of your life
