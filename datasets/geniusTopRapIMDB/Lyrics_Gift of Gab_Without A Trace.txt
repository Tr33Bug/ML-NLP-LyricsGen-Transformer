Without A Trace Lyrics[Verse 1: Gift of Gab]
Verbal murderer
Lyrical pit-bull
Gone totally shitfaced
Raw impeccable
Vicious general of emcees
That rip graceful
Pure incredible toxic
Vocally on some federal swift
Make space age literal flows
On melodies that cut like switchblades
Stuck when I spit rays
Ixnay niggas better get they
Kin-sake put 'em in a shelter
'Cause I'm gonna melt the foundation
Get sprayed
When I'm on a big rage
This page turns just
Burned up all stages
Imminent a big whirlwind
Put 'em in a big burl bin hey

Get up in a diss
Agelessness
That rip nations quick
Get equipped
Niggas better get a grip quick
They nickname is "hit me"

Do it in a big way
Dip Gift slayed
I engage in intake
Of lyric intelligent
Highly of relevance wind and
Get praises for six days
My lyrics and pen was all I just stayed with
It pays to just sendin' it in and kick flavors
Mentally lyrically every which way
Emcees in a dismay
Innovator of the art
Penetrator of the heart
And plus I get paidYou might also likeEmbed
