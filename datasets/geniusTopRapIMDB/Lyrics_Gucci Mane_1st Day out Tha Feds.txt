[Verse]
I'm hearin' shooters loadin' pistols while I'm brushin' my teeth (Dang)
I get so many death threats, it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray (Nope)
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive (Lawd)
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room (Ah)
Trying to be patient, but nigga, I can't wait (Nah)
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case (Yeah)
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me or against me or you in my way (Pussy)
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree, but hell, I don't breed 'em (Grr)
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama (Mama)
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later, still don't know shot up my Hummer (Hmmm)
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take (I take)
Black gloves and black tape, nigga, it's my first day (Wop)
