Big Boy Diamonds Lyrics[Intro: Kodak Black & Gucci Mane]
Big boy diamonds (Burr)
I'm that big boy stepper, I'm that stepper
All my steps calculated, I'm that stepper, nigga (Free Kodak, ASAP)
Remember that, I'm the one that's stepping, nigga
I'ma step, one thing about me, yeah
I'm in London, got my beat from London (Go)

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Gucci Mane]
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin' (Damn)
This ain't a grill
Ice on my teeth, yeah, it's permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
Big boy diamonds
[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Beat down your lady vagina, rockin' the latest designer
Pull off like abracadabra, boo-hoo
Pull right back up in a Jag' with voodoo
Milkin' these bitches like Yoo-hoo
Shit on these niggas, I doo-doo
I'm passin' gas like I farted
Boy, if you smelled it, you dealt it
Water on me like I'm meltin', water
Fuck on your daughter, don't call her, water
Come here, lil' bitch, I'm your father, water
Call me daddy, I'm your papi
Comin' over, drop the addy
I was on Xannies already, I be on mollies already
Fuck all the talkin', I been done shot 'em already

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Gucci Mane]
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
This ain't a grill
Ice on my teeth, yeah, it's permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin' (Go)
Big boy diamonds

I'ma be icy in Heaven
Diamonds on me and they white like a wife at the wedding
I done shot dice with my celly
I taught a lifer a lesson
I put that knife on the peasant (Huh)
I bought the choppers already
Gucci the G.O.A.T. but you know it already (G.O.A.T.)
Scope on the rifle, I'm holdin' it steady
Diamond AP like Elvis Presley, dancin' (Wop)
Play like you hard, but you sweeter than jelly
Bitch, I'm the shit, it ain't shit you can tell me (Huh)
Her stomach on flat 'til my dick in her belly
Think I'm a lick, spend a brick on a Presi'
Christmas, I want a stick for a present
Baguette Chopard, it's factory setted (Bling)
Run up on Wop and you'll never forget it
I broke the dam, I told 'em to flood it
I want the cash, I don't want the credit
Went in my stash and gave me a budget
My pockets so budgy that bitches is callin' me handsome
That then, was callin' me ugly (Huh?)
I caught a rash from countin' the money
I'm changin' the climate like global warming (Bling)
She seen the charm and said I'm charming
The watch on my arm, it come with an army
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
This ain't a grill
Ice on my teeth, yeah, it's permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
