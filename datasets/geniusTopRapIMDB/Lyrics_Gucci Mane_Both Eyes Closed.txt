Both Eyes Closed Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Hah
Huh?
Huh?
(We got London on da Track)
Drop-top
Wop
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh?)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I've got a chick so fine, make a blind man see her (Woo)
She runnin' through my mind, that's a fine idea (Yeah)
And I ain't Blake Griffin, I don't drive no Kia (Huh?)
If it ain't ten mil', I can't sign no deal (No)
I'm all about a check, fresh Nikes, let's do it (Checks)
And I spy a bitch that wanna straight get to it (I spy)
Trap tutorial, ridin' down Memorial (Yoom)
From the bando to the Waldorf Astoria (Woah)
If you don't like to see niggas shine, then close your eyes then (Huh)
We on a private island, vibin' to violins
Autobiography, Gucci Mane the author
And I'm the trap sponsor, Gucci Mane's the father (Yeah)
An eight-figure nigga just walked into Walter's (What?)
If you ain't gettin' money, then move out of Georgia (Go)
Hundred tapes and goin', go check my discography (Woah)
The freshest nigga livin', go check your photography (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh?)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed
You might also like[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just drove the Tesla with both eyes closed (True)
Made a hundred thousand on the one-eyed stove (That's right)
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG (Tell 'em)
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Ch√£o
Makin' money in piles, sellin' people the pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to rock just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, wore the 'Ye to the game

[Chorus: Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz & Young Dolph]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt, wow)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? True)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand (Hah)
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed (Hold up)
[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Don't mean to brag and boast, but I be fresher than most (Ayy)
Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast (Trap)
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
She said, "Let's make love", want me to fuck with my eyes closed (What?)
But lil' mama so fine, when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it, both eyes closed
(You crazy, bruh)
Hah, wait a minute, I'm fresh as fuck, let me strike a pose (It's Dolph)
Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold (Yeah)
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe (Hah)
Since a juvenile, I stuck to the G code (Uh-huh)
Servin' out the kitchen, but I never touched the stove (Nah)
I told my bitch, "You mines now, you ain't gotta work"
Just keep it real and let's go spend the mils

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? Fuck 'em)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed9Embed
