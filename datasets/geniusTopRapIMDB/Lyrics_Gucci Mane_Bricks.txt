Bricks Lyrics[Intro: Yo Gotti]
It's your boy Yo Gotti, yeah
Gucci Mane La Flare
My nigga Ralph in here
Zaytoven on the beat, nigga
And it's a street nigga holiday
My nigga DJ Holiday, yeah

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks, all-white bricks
Off-white bricks, light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks, thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick, want a bad bitch?
Gotta have bricks, yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits, but I still take bricks
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
So Icy CEO, I'm a fool with the snow
They think I'm putting VVS jewels in the coke
My watch a cool hundred, paint-job a cold twenty
And after this flip, I'm quitting the trap cold-turkey
Psych, the pack in and I'm working
Drought season in, charged your ass a whole thirty
But right now you can get it for a low number
The fish scale white, same color my Hummer
Zone 6 polar bears never see summer
It's winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It's bricks, all-white bricks
Off-white bricks, light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks, thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick, want a bad bitch?
Gotta have bricks, yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits, but I still take bricks

[Verse 2: Young Ralph]
I'm like a waitress in the trap, I've got something to serve
That's sixteen bars, same price for a bird
What you need, a bird? Or a couple pounds?
I'm on Cleveland Ave, you know my side of town
So many bricks I can build my own apartment
You better have a check when you come in my department
Yes, I break 'em down and I sell 'em whole
Try me, watch your whole crew fall like some dominoes
I got a trap house and a trap car
A hundred thousand off a cap, that's a trap star
All this smoke got me feeling real nauseous
Riding with them bricks got me feeling real cautious

Bricks, all-white bricks
Off-white bricks, light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks, thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick, want a bad bitch?
Gotta have bricks, yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits, but I still take bricks

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Tony Montana, all I have in this world
Is my hundred-round chopper and my white girl
Oil-based bricks, shit hard to cook
Call the plug back, tell him he got took
Know what that mean? This shit free
That means none for him and more for me
I took something, I'm gutter, bitch
Don't trust me dawg, this that North Memphis shit
Old school, new Porsche
Couple choppers just in case they wanna go to war
Bricks, AKA my best friend
Twenty-eight inch rims, call 'em grown men
Dope stepped on, call it step-child
I got that Slim Shady, we call it 8 Mile
I'm from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown
Gotti Street and nigga, that's my brick house
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Bricks, all-white bricks
Off-white bricks, light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for fifty more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks, thirty-six zips
That's a whole chick, want a bad bitch?
Gotta have bricks, yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits, but I still take bricks12Embed
