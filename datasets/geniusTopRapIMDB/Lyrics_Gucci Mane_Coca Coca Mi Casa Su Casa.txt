Coca Coca (Mi Casa Su Casa) Lyrics[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boil-a, boil-a, boiling water, damn I got a forced game
Snort-a, stort-a, make an offer, no prob', I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja than reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me, Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave ten birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop 'em, Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after, try me then your skull get fractured
Ransom your little handsome son, so sad that your first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thought-a, if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce, a half, a eighth, a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard, got from my father, take no shit, got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boil-a, boil-a, boiling water, damn I got a forced game
Snort-a, stort-a, make an offer, no prob', I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna, my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Only one dude and I'ma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay lowkey, get dough with my people
Maybe try to find me a blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got low, bitch dropped a few pounds
Count a few checks, deal 'em out
Shoot a little dice, blow a little loud
Sell a little powder, make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug every nigga on my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day, they said I wouldn't be shit
Tell them fuck niggas, "Nigga, look at me now!"
Money on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense, we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club, everybody like, "Wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club, I'm stunting on the couch
Balling like a baller, me and Gucci ballin' out
Shawty got it for the low, who said it was a drought?
Swag run so hard, man these hoes like (Ow!)
Well known in the North, raised in the South
Connected out West, get 'em in, get 'em out

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie glasses
Stupid Brick Squad chickens in, stankin' through the plastic
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
I'm the hottest thing walkin' 'round in East Atlanta
So I'm like a baby, shittin' like a damn Pamper
Ooh, they hate my swag cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca-Cola, where's the water? Watch this dough, I serve this order
One on the window cause the police just might smell this odor
Barber shops and beauty parlors just to cover dirty dollars
White girl was super dirty so I put her in the shower

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, coca cola, yayo bought me everythang
Yola, yola, baking soda, cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila, boila, boiling water, damn I gotta forced game
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya

Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Soo Woo! To the B gang, it’s a G thang, see me
I’m eyeballin' shorty, Gucci got the work and Flocka got the 40
Work the wheels and hold the gun
Smoke out my pistol, I wish you’d run
Nigga win some like, "Which one?
Hundred round chopper or the handgun?"
Heard I ain’t never lost none, got nicks and dimes, you want some?
I’m a legend in the hood like Big Pun
Got bales of the mid you want some? I bought them
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
I’m gutter, gutter, gutter, gutter, I put that shit on Gucci Mane
Brick Squad is what the fuck I claim (Brick Squad)
God y'all niggas off the chain (Loony)
Lookin' like he want my chain, I smoke him like some Mary Jane
(Bow, bow, bow, bow!) And shorty that shit real talk
(Bow, bow, bow, bow!) And shorty that shit real talk

[Verse 5: Shawty Lo]
Shawty Lo, call me Escobar
They try to retired me like the great Brett Favre
Still got no wife but the white be my girlfriend
Even Nicki fuckin' with my girlfriend
Yeah, we share that bitch
Got Waka Flocka, Gucci, Rocko in that bitch
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I'm still on the highway takin' a risk
Back and forth from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Feds coming after us, niggas talkin' 'bout jackin' us
Married to that white girl so bitch, I ain’t no bachelor
Brick Squad, Re-Up Gang, motherfuckin' yayo club
Lookin for another one cause I ran off on my last plug
Off white Jag, white truck, white Lambo
All white Porsche four door going HAM ho
You know who I am ho (Yo Gotti!) you say I robbed your brother
I don’t give a damn though; he must've had the yams low
He must've had them grams off, weighing what I paid for
Too many of them bands, now he laying on his man's floor
I’m Yo Gotti nigga, and I’m from North Memphis
In East Atlanta Zone 6 and I got the North with me

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj]
I got that hard Gucc', you know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi, I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm takin' trips with Papi (You walkie-talkie copy)
I got them Pookie fiends, might rock some Juicy jeans
I mean some Juicy sweats; maybe some blue Giuseppes
I play foul, no free-throw
Bitch I ball, no free show, deadass, no peep-show
Bought our own condo, water-front condo
Daughter, son dundo; watchin' Telemundo
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
What you coppin'? Keep that work inside my Pippi Longstocking, bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Coca, coca, Coca-Cola, yayo bought me everything
