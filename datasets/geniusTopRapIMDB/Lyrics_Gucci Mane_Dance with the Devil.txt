TranslationsTürkçeDance with the Devil Lyrics[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye, Lil Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing
[Verse 1]
Dancing all night ten grand make you dance, dance
Hundreds in my pants turn your chick to my girlfriend
Gucci in the batter's box I just walked out the bullpen
Pitching dog food, make a junkie out your husband
Hundred stacks'll make 'em shoot you clean in your dad hat
Catch you at the trap and shoot you clean out your Hellcat
Everybody wanna be the kingpin, man
The feds snatched 'em up, now we ain't seen this man
2017, everybody get high
Taking street drugs like they ass can't die
And I ain't tryna preach 'cause I got high too
I'm an ex-drug dealer, nigga how 'bout you
I'm an ex-con, ex-hood, long with a dope bomb
Niggas don't make twenty-one where I come from (Wow)
Took a chance and fucked a hood hoe, no condom
Took a chance and put a price tag on your loved one

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing

Tattoos all over but she bougie
Acting stiff but her booty keep choosing
In every neighborhood there's a Gucci
The neighborhood dealer with an Uzi
Baby started off right as a good girl
Now she's tryna act hard like a hood girl
Tryna catch a nigga playing for the Falcons
But steady sucking up the nigga with the dragons
Diamonds on my neck and wrist lit, it's a combo
Yellow bitch, her dark skin friend, call it gumbo
Pull up in a lot and the car cost a condo
Leave with your chick but send her back with a grand though
Yeah, yeah, it's Gucci Mane and Metro
If Metro don't trust you I'ma foot you in your asshole
Yeah, I started from the bando
I took her to the 6 but no, that's not Toronto

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
