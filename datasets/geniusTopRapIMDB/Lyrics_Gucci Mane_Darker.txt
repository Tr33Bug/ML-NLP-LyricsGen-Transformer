Darker Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, yeah, Wop
Guwop, burr, burr, burr (1017)
Huh? Hoo (808 Mafia)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
The tints on my shit, they look darker
Pourin' up drank, nigga, my shit darker
The kush came in, this time look darker
I'm whippin' up a brick and the work look darker
Kush came in, this time look darker
Pourin' up drank, nigga, my shit darker
The work came in, this time look darker
And the tints on my shit, they look darker
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Dark tint on my soowoo red Charger
The niggas round me drink lean, not water (Woo)
I could never hold a job down like my father (Gucci)
But I could hold a block and push the rock, Shawn Carter (Skrr)
Bitches on my dick 'cause my skin real darker (Huh)
Got a yellow bitch and the devil wears Prada (Mwah)
Got the narcs on me, say my cartel got bothered (Woo, woo)
Big fish in little pond, get swallowed (Well damn)
Dark weed, super dark weed, Cali OG (Huh)
Dark lean, super dark lean, straight codeine (Lean)
Dark meat, pretty brown bitch that adore me (Dark)
Dark tint on my dark Bent' on a dark street (Woo)

The work came in, this time look darker (Skrr)
And the tints on my shit, they look darker

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's a dark night, had a gun fight with a dark clique (Shh)
Set up by a dark skin bitch, she was dumb thick (Shh)
Gucci Mane keep pulling up in darkly painted cars (Cars)
Dropped the top on your bitch, now she looking at the stars (Gucci)
Diamonds dancing on my wrist, you dancing with the star (Bling)
Gucci Mane so geeked up, he don't care you light or dark, ho (Icy)
I just paid three hundred 'cause didn't have nowhere to park, ho (Dang)
If Gucci Mane just bought it, why the fuck he paint it darker? (Huh)
That shit was already hard, now he made it harder
Cali kush, just touched down, nigga, and this pack a lil' darker (Cali)
Dog food bricks and cocaina them, now they look darker (Woo)
Dark skin brick, I'm touching it and with it, then whipping away from the water (Skrr)
