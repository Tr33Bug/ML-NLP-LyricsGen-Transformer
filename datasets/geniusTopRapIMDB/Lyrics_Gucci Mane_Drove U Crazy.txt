Drove U Crazy Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh, yeah, it's Gucci!
Tiller! Brr, brr-brr!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in a Lam', it'll drive you crazy
Had to cut her off cause the bitch too lazy
She wanna ride the wave, but my waves too wavy
And your car too slow, you need to drive Miss Daisy
Jumped out the feds like, "Fuck you, pay me"
Got her foamin' mouth like the bitch got rabies
Got me runnin' out the spot like the spot got raided
'Cause I'm so much different then the nigga you dated
Smilin' in the camera like, "Bitch, I made it"
Big Guwop got the whole club faded
Got a bitch so bad that my ex bitch hate it
Tell me how you feel when you see me skatin'
Nah, you don't call me baby
We ain't finna go to the mall,Ms. Lady
When you leave me feelin' standin' tall, Ms. Lady
Like can you take it, take it, take it all, Ms. Lady?
Never get a love like this
Never ever, ever meet a thug like this
Never met a plug like this
Never seen a nigga in the club like this
Never hug like this
Never pour Ace of Spades in the tub like this
Never got drunk like this
Or beat from the back on the rug like this
[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them, what?
Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Aye, lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah
Lil' mama say she fuck with me tough, yeah
Her ex-boyfriend's words cut deep
Aye, Young Tiller in the cut, yeah
Aye, Young Tiller goin' up, yeah
At your head with that uppercut, yeah
I'm still on the motherfuckin' come up
But y'all already know where I'm from, yeah
Straight from the 502, hey
Southside Dirty, I grew, hey
Now they wanna show my moves, hey
Every little thing that I do and say
My old bitch said she need closure
I just think she wanna get closer
I just think she want some exposure
Tell people how crazy I drove her
Tell people all the dreams I sold her
I'm sorry, you cannot lean on my shoulder
I already got too many burdens
Most of them 'bout to give to my attorney
I got too many niggas in my face now
This ain't the time 'nor place now
This for my niggas that stay down
Fuck all you niggas that wanna hate now
You might also like[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
What? Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them, what?
Tell 'em how crazy I drove you
Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me
Talk about them
Talk about them lies you told me
Talk about true colors you showed me
Talk about them
