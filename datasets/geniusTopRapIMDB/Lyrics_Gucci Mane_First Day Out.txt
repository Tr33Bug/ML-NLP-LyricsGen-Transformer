First Day Out Lyrics[Intro]
Holiday season (Ayy)
Shouts out my nigga Zaytoven (Huh? We back in the buildin')
We workin', Zay (Holiday Season)
Right back like we never left, nigga (Holiday season, nigga)
Waka, what up, homie? (Huh?)
Shout out my nigga Woo (We back in the buildin')
My nigga Frenchie, Nicki Minaj
Shouts out my nigga OJ Juice (Huh?)
Shout out my nigga G Boy (Gucci)
DJ Holiday, Writing On The Wall (New mixtape, skrrt, skrrt)
("First Day Out") You know what it is
Ayy, Gucci, how you gon' start the day off, nigga?
[Verse]
I'm starting off my day with a blunt of purp (Damn)
No pancakes, just a cup of syrup (Well, damn)
Baking soda, pot, and a silver spork (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
You already know it's time to go to work
I'm back up off the kitchen workin' with a chicken
You get 63 grams for like twelve-fifty (Wow)
50 pounds of purp, 50 pounds of midget
As soon as it's gone, I sell another 60 (Huh)
My baby need some shoes, my aunty need a purse (Huh)
Summer coming real soon so I need a vert (Damn)
I hop up out that van with that duffel bag (Gucci)
And if a nigga try me, I'ma bust his ass (Bow)
I'm countin' up money in my living room
Birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room (Damn)
Pills in the cabinet, pounds in the den (Gucci)
Attic full of guns, basement full of Benjamins (Holiday Season)
Two AK-47s and a blow torch
Couple junkies knocking hard on my front porch (Huh)
A couple old schools in my backyard
If I don't know you, I'ma serve you through my burglar bars
Gucci back, bitch (Back, bitch), yeah, I'm back, bitch (Huh)
Did you miss me (Did you miss me?) or miss my wealth bitch? (Huh)
This that new shit (What?), that county jail shit (True)
That 7th floor, Rice Street, straight out a cell shit
You on my shit list, I'm on the Forbes list
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch (Gucci)
I got a sick wrist (Bling), it cost 'bout six bricks
I'm on that slick shit, that Zone 6 shit (Huh)

Huh, huh, what's happenin'?
So Icy CEO, we in the buildin'
Huh, huh, huh, Zaytoven on the track, huh, damn, damn
Burr, burr
Wow
