Fuck the World Lyrics[Intro]
Ear Drummers

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Money owed, dope sold bitch you already know
White birds black birds serving pigeons and crows
I whip the dope so good, a benz jumped out the bowl
Motherfuck the ATF and the border patrol
Me and my amigos at the table shots of Don Julio
I fucked your bitch a week ago, but I ain't gonna fuck her no more (Psych!)
I got the stacks under the mattress so I sleep with the dough
I got them bricks stuffed in the wall so yea I live with the coke
It's Bricksquad and I know you niggas mad cause you broke
He seen my video on the TV and he broke the remote
I'm like Pablo in his prime, shoulder deep with the snow
I read yo paper work nigga man yall niggas some hoes
[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got all eyes on me like Pac did
But I ain't trying to go broke like Joc did
I ain't trying to fuck my dealer did like Block did
I'm trying to stack them free bands like Rock did
Tell the truth I never thought that I get this big
I think I'm about to buy some choppers like Tip did
I came in, flexing jewelry like Flip did
Got every penny out the 6 I swear I milked it
That Bricksquad shit I built it
I put Flocka in the game and he killed it
I did a song with Lil Wayne and I killed it
My only wish my nigga Dunk was here to rip shit (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit

My uncle Ronnie died from smoking cane
My cousin suicidal, he blowed out his brain
They gave my nigga 30 years, he in a chain gang
I just had to drop a 40 racks up on my ring
I'm in Giuseppe's walking in the rain
I can't even help it I been through some things
I put my heart in every verse and when I'm on that plane
I'm thanking God for all my watches, and all my chains
I'm in Chanel and I'm in Ferragamos
These bitches know I'm worth these commas
They know I got that llama
And my lil sister just got out that coma
That sickle cell hurtin' her bones
Free my nigga Bomma

[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit15Embed
