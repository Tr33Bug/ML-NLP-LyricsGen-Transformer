Gucci Please Lyrics[Hook]
Gucci please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me Gucci please
Gucci please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci Please
Gucci please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci Please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, tell me tell me Gucci please
[Verse 1]
Baby freeze, I know a nigga look like 900 keys
Baby say my ring look like a hundred Ps
I got college bitches fallin' out calm down breathe
If yall keep runnin' on the stage then I'mma have to leave
I'm bout to drop the top so I can feel the summer breeze
Its a cold blooded motherfuckin rollie on my sleeve
It feels like I'm the freshest nigga out or is it me
He getting a lil' money but that nigga isn’t me
G-U-C-C-Icy I'm the one girls wanna see
G-U-W-O-P I'm the one boys wanna be
Lil mama got her hair fixed is hers or it weave
Shit I don’t give a damn just know that you look like a queen

[Hook]
Gucci please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me Gucci please
Gucci please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci Please
Gucci please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci Please
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze?
Tell me that you love me, tell me tell me Gucci please

[Verse 2]
Can we pretend that I'm your man and that makes you my girlfriend
And we have a one night stand in my brand new Benz
And we ain't gotta worry bout nobody peeping in
The windows tinted black so it ain't no lookin in
Bitches talking bout my house, I think they tryna climb the fence
They say that when my dick come out that it's a big event
Pool in my backyard, do you like to swim?
Cause imma work you out and I'm not talking bout the gym
Gucci just got out but God damn he goin in
These lil' boys don't ball like Guwop, he play above the rim
Women on my page like damn he gettin slim
Caucasian women see me and be like is it really him?
