Guwop Home Lyrics[Intro: Young Thug]
Mike Willy with me nigga

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Big Guwop home
We no longer miss you, yeah
I know Guwop home
We all no longer miss you
I can't wait

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]
Dream, it's a young nigga dream, yeah
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah (Wop)
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans (it's Wizzop)
Nigga act so tough it's startin' scene, ooh
In blue flame, yeah the Trap God throwing green rain
Nice guy, mean chain, pull up in a cream Range
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich ass nigga, I got everything
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Rose gold watch, but my bottle pink gold
Three red hoes walking round in red robes
Can't stay the night I'm not the type to be on Skype, ho
Wrote me off, said that I was gone, that was a typo
Take a white girl out a trailer make her Iggy
Take a black bitch outta Magic make her Nicki
Pissy yellow Rollie, baby pissy in her feelings
My young bitches show respect they call me Mr. Millions
Brown skin chick and she love to wear purple
Her nails purple, lips purple, pussy hair purple
Big titty Amazon in my black Benz
I'm rich black man got a couple white friends

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]
Dream, it's a young nigga dream, yeah
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans
Nigga act so tough it's startin' scene, ooh
In blue flame, yeah the Trap God throwing green rain
Nice guy, mean chain, pull up in a cream Range
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich ass nigga, I got everything

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My teeth white like a toilet tissue
Stop the cappin', boy you know you miss her
We hit the lobby then we saw you kiss her
Lil' mama crazy she gon' try to kill you
I got the weed, bring the molly with you
I got the syrup, bring the Jolly Ranchers
You talk to 12 we gon' off your body
You tripping boy you need some knowledge in you
Boss man from the 1248
For the clan, nigga 12, 40 plays
Living good, everyday my birthday
Pockets full of money, Master P, ay
National bid day
Free the Wop nigga, National Siblings Day
Call the dentist day
Pull up to the public, come and see the bae
Run it up to the top
Get out and ran it back to the top
Flood your ear, your neck, your wrist, your fingers
And put it all on rocks
Say Guwop home and yeah it’s official, grab some tissues
What's wrong with you?
