I Heard Lyrics[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
Heard that bitch got a thing for them Boss niggas
Heard she be lyin' on them boys that floss nigga
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
I heard (ugh) I heard (what) I heard (what)
I heard (Rich Homie) I heard (Gucci)
I heard (what you hear?)
I heard (don't talk to them)
I heard
[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard that bitch stay on her shit
So you know the ho loyal
I heard that bitch got a bitch
Come to find out she been lyin', she from Florida
Shawty make sense (cents), she a dime and a quarter
She pay her rent and she spoil her daughter
And that don't mean shit cause the bitch still lied
No eyes, I'm blind
To the fact that a bitch
Ain't even got a dime, she broke
But she fine, she need help
She tired, they listenin'
She wired, she snitchin'
Be quiet, I'm runnin'
I'm hidin' my truck
Outside, it runnin'
And I'm out I'm smashin'
Me and Gucci, we wildin'
We laughin', Cinemax
It's a movie, hit the gas
And we'll lose 'em fifty bags
And I'll move 'em, nigga ask
I do this, four bitches one jacuzzi

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
Heard that bitch got a thing for them Boss niggas
Heard she be lyin' on them boys that floss nigga
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
I heard (ugh) I heard (what) I heard (what)
I heard (Rich Homie) I heard (Gucci)
I heard (what you hear?)
I heard (don't talk to them)

She suck the dick like no teeth
She on her knees like she got no knees
It's three and we ain't got no lean
Gotta call somebody need more PT
I walk straight in it don't frisk me
Don't run up on Wop that's risky
I'm a black silverback with big nuts
Big bomb, big pistol
Hundred fifty in this handgun
Fuck with me, nigga fuck with me
I met a bad bitch, she was a bad bitch
But no draft pick cos she a broke bitch
Go hang yourself here the rope bitch
Drink two shots of Clorox, bitch
God damn you got a mouth on you could be a model
Can't really put no price on you, cause baby swallow
Suck my dick and lick my balls all night girl you a baller
And if I ever see the bitch in LIV she get a bottle
For my ex girl at Central Station, 300 dollars
And you can keep your husband, I don't want your ho don't need the problems
Sippin' lean while she suckin' my dick, I got a boner
Smokin' weed while she eatin' other bitches cause I'm a stoner
Rich Homie Quan and Gucci, we trap scholars

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
Heard that bitch got a thing for them Boss niggas
Heard she be lyin' on them boys that floss nigga
I heard she can do some tricks with her mouth nigga
I heard (ugh) I heard (what) I heard (what)
I heard (Rich Homie) I heard (Gucci)
I heard (what you hear?)
I heard (don't talk to them)
