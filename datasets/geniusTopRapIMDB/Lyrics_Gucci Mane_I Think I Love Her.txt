I Think I Love Her Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody
He don't love nobody (Uh-uh)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you?
Let me show you how I do this shit (Get money)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)
[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why?
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon app√©tit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat

Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click clack, p-pop-pop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her5Embed
