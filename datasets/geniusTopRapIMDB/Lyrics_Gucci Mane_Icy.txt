Icy Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane & Lil Will]
Gucci Mane La Flare
Yeah, where yo ice at?
Where yo chain and yo rings at?
Where yo bling at?
I'm icy, I'm icy, so icy, so icy
I'm so icy, I'm icy, so icy, so icy
[Chorus: Lil Will & Jeezy]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it
I'm so icy, so icy
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited (uh, uh-uh, uh, chyeah)
I'm so icy, so icy (uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, ayy, ayy, let's go)
[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Got a house around my neck and my wrist on chill (chill)
Any given time, 250 in your grill (a quarter million?)
All I do is talk shit (ayy)
You can even add a couple grand for my outfit
Yeah, you better act like you know man (what?)
In my hood they call me Jeezy the Snowman
You get it? (get it?) Jeezy the Snowman (chyeah)
I'm iced out (ayy), plus I got snow, man (ayy)
Let it marinate, y'all niggas slow man (slow man)
(Man what the fuck y'all? Dumb ass)
I used to get nineteen for a beat (chyeah)
Call me Ginuwine, the same ol' G (ol' G)
I'm the shit bitch, I need toilet paper (damn)
And some air freshener, nigga, fuck a hater
These niggas don't like me (why?)
I'm with the Gucci Mane and I'm so icy

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it (ooh, you know they like it)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby)
Girl don't try to fight it (don't try to fight it)
All your friends invited (all your friends)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, girl you know I'm icy)

She digging my fit, she think I'm the shit (think I'm the shit)
Is this the chain on my neck, or the watch in my wrist (the watch in my wrist)
Maybe the ice in my ear, or the bracelet (my bracelet)
But she look like the type that could take a dick (take the dick)
Uh, young Gucci Mane (Gucci Mane)
Don't kiss me baby, you can kiss my chain (kiss my chain)
Uh, you gotta be a dime piece (dime piece)
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece (time piece)
Uh, I come through in a drop top Jag (drop top tag)
Or a old school Chevy with the antique tags ('tique tags)
My pockets so heavy that I can't walk steady (walk steady)
Niggas copping ice we done done it already (oh!)
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie
I ride big Chevys cause a nigga ain't petty
I'm icy (so icy, so icy), so motherfuckin' snowed up
Little kids wanna be like Gucci when they grow up
Uh, me, Jeezy and Boo
We ain't hatin pussy nigga go and do what you do
'Cause we icy (so icy), so icy (so icy)
We icy (so icy), so icy (so icy)

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it (ooh, you know they like it)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby I'm so icy)
Girl don't try to fight it (don't you fight it)
All your friends invited (all your friends)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, I'm so icy)
[Verse 3: Boo]
Yeah, I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out
You can still see my chain even when the lights out (lights out)
'Cause that's how mobsters do it
Spit a little game, give 'em that flossin' music
I'm the man from the C-H-I
These lames runnin' 'round thinkin' they so fly
Got a little buzz but Boo been too high
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick
I tell her holla at Jeezy if you wanna pop Cris
Get at Gucci Mane cause he on some hood shit
And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my .45
Like let a nigga trip, nah we ain't runnin'
We just takin all your chicks, buyin' drinks, gettin' blunted
Groupies, show you how to do this son
We throwin' out hundreds while you savin them ones, nigga

[Bridge: Lil Will]
I got so many rocks, in my chain and watch
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick
I know I'm the bomb, just look at my charm
I know I'm the shit, my chain hang down to my dick

[Chorus: Lil Will]
All these girls excited
Ooh, you know they like it (oh you know that them girls like it)
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby)
Girl don't try to fight it
All your friends invited
I'm so icy, so icy (I'm so icy, baby I'm so icy)

[Outro: Lil Wil]
Look at my charm
My chain hang down to my dick
