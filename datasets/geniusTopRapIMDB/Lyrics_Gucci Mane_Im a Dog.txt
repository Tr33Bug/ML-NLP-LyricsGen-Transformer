Uh, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Every dog has it's day, man, every dog
And you know I'm the only dog (Gucci)

[Verse 1]
See my knot very dumb and my girlfriend twenty-one
And I know that's kinda young and I only feed her crumbs
My Jacob watch is short bus, man, it's special ed
'Cause these girls be droolin every time they see the VVS
Got a drop top Vette and the thang so stupid
The rims are off the set, girls be jumping in my bed
I'm a dog, a St. Bernard, and that dick get hard as hell
We can leave the bed made up, I can fuck you on the chair
A boss run with dogs, man, I don't fuck hoes with fleas
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team
I'm a boss, run with dogs, man and I don't fuck hoes with fleas
Hundred fifty thousand dollar dog collars for the team (So Icey)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'ma treat her like a dog (Huh?), feed her like a dog (Huh)
Beat her like a dog (Yeah), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Treat her like a dog (Yeah), feed her like a dog (Yeah)
Beat her like a dog (Huh), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)

[Verse 2: DG Yola]
I got every kind of bitches droolin' on a nigga style
'Cause my pockets fat, I smoke the 'thrax while they blow Black & Milds
I hit the club with Zay, we in the front, all these niggas' bitches choosin'
Gucci got 'em rollin', so I know they down to shoot a movie
Niggas baller-blockin', hatin' on a killa movement
Out the bed to grits and eggs, head and sum booty
I'm young doing numbers and all the women love me
Just because I'm gutter, Black, got a bank and I'm thuggin'
I never love a broad 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' dog
You can ask a couple about me, bet they tell you I'm off the wall
I got doctors, lawyers, dealers, even strippers on my team
And I never show favoritism, everyone's treated the same
I'm a boss of all bitches, so they never complainin'
They respect this gangsta shit, 'cause I got so much game
You ain't gotta ask about me, nigga, you know who I be
I'm a motherfuckin' dog, can you understand me?

Beat her like a dog (Yeah), then pass her to my dogs (Yeah)
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Treat her like a dog (Yeah), feed her like a dog (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Chasin' cats, chasin' rats, Gucci got them power packs
Got 'em, them straight from the 6, East Atlanta, proud of that
This fine broads looking at me, damn, I see a puddy cat
And I like them freaky girls, they know how to throw it back
Put up your shot, I'll throw it back, Throw Back, please roll up the 'thrax
Throw Back get sum jaw while I'm killin' this bitch from the back
Put up your shot, I'll throw it back, Throw Back, please roll up the 'thrax
Shawtie get sum jaw while we killin' this ho from the back

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
