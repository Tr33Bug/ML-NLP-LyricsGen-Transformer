Intro (El Chapo) Lyrics[Intro: News Sample]
He's known as El Chapo or Shorty and he's no doubt the most feared and the most dangerous drug lord in all of Mexico. Police turned up four more bodies, churned in the trunk of a burned-out car near the....

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo
[Verse 1]
I live a life so crazy make me start smokin' newports
And you ain't comin' in, I'ma serve you in the front porch
My plug he comin' in, I'm about a scoop him from the airport
And ain't no room for nothin' else but money in my condo
Ballin' like a bitch you think my grandmother Griselda
These suckas they can't wait to double cross you like Diego
I'm whackin' niggas, taxin' niggas similar to Pablo
I'm big chained touchin' every penny like I'm Castro
Boss shit mob hits Lucky Luciano
Bricksquad Records like the damn Gambinos
The shit that I done did has only been done by Latinos
Dope so good you think it came from El Chapo

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo

[Verse 2]
Plane just touch down thanks to Amado
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load
Severing niggas heads off like El Loco
A hundred bricks is nothin' if you Jesus Elizando
My big toy Emilio got it in the choke hold
Spent a half a million last year on Forgiatos
And no I am not a catholic confessin' is a no no
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a snow roll
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo
A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle

All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo14Embed
