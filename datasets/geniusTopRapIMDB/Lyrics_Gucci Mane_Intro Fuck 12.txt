Intro: Fuck 12 Lyrics[Intro]
It's Wizop
Huh? Huh?

[Verse]
I still don't give a fuck how a fuckboy feel
How you gon' keep it real and your diamonds not real?
I do it so big, I make a hater feel little
I can't tell you why they hating, but I have an idea
You never liked me, probably don't like me still
But a nigga liking me ain't never paid my bills
I'm the realest nigga living, let's get one thing clear
And if you wanna get it popping, we can do it right here
I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear
I got post-traumatic stresses like I can't shed tears
I ain't even been out 6 months, but I spent 6 mil
Got a million dollar grin and a 10 million dollar crib
And my heart done turned burr-burr like my adlibs
In the kitchen going skrt-skrt tryna make a mil
Got these bitches screaming Bling-Blaww, diamonds in my ear
I send my shooters then it's pow-pow, another tatted tear
Yeah it's 2016, so it's Guwop year
When I was 16, I was making drug deals
These niggas say they getting money, I can't really tell
I made more money than them and I was in a jail cell
[Hook]
I'ma say it once again, trust God, fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Say it once again, trust God, fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop

[Interlude]
I'm down on that red, this right here gon' get hard. Gon' get hard. Every day I'm getting fucking harder, I am...

[Outro]
Wop, fuck 12, Wop, fuck 12
