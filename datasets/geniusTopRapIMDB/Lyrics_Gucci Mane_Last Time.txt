Last Time Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane, Travis Scott & Zaytoven]
Zaytoven
Hah, Wop, Trav, hah
Just took half of it (Ooh)
Just took half of it (Wizzop, hah, okay)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I love when my bitch get drunk 'cause she talk greasy to me (Mwah)
Nigga with an attitude, this shit gettin' easy to me (Easy)
The last time I drunk some lean, I was out of my mind (Lean)
Tried to give me twenty years and that's a whole lotta time (Fucked)
A married woman divorced her husband to spend the weekend with me
He think it nasty when she squirt, but that shit sexy to me (Hah)
The last time I took some molly, took a gram and a half (Ooh)
Niggas think they know 'bout Gucci but they don't know the half
See, I'm an ex-X popper and online shopper (Ooh)
Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper (Proper)
Convicted felon worth 10 million, I'm a well-known robber (Wow)
Like Shawty Lo, I got 10 children
Yeah, yeah, Lo my partner, Wop (Lo)
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
'Cause last time I took pills, I had to smash a bitch (Geek)
And last time I smoked gas, I almost crashed a whip (Skrrr, skrrr)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Half)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah, wow)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time we took drugs, you just took half of it, yeah (It's lit)
Stretchin' out my jeans just to make cash fit in (Yeah)
Wake up every mornin' to some ass and grits, yeah (Yeah)
Raw dog all my birds, I'm tryna have some chicks, yeah (Brr, brr)
Fee-fie-fie-fo (Yeah), Zone 6 to the Mo (Yeah)
La Flame linked with La Flare
Yeah, that's heat and snow (Yeah, yeah)
Goin' in all year, three hundred plus days long (Straight up)
Makin' money all year, talkin' fifty-two weeks strong
Better back up, give me space (Yeah)
I want ice cream on her face
Goin' Pharrell Williams on the case (Oh my god)
Oh, then we skate-skate-skate away (Yeah)
720 with the grind, landed, landed all fine (Yeah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it
'Cause last time I took pills, I had to smash a bitch
And last time I smoked gas, I almost crashed a whip
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)

The last time I went to Onyx, man, I ordered a dub (Ooh)
Tried to leave with every big booty bitch in the club (Yeah)
I bought a Rolls Royce and a Lambi when I went to Miami (Vroom)
The last time I seen lil mama, she wasn't wearin' no panties
Last time I went to Vegas, spent 200k gamblin' (Wow)
I'm just an east Atlanta nigga servin' junkies in Chamblee (Skrrr)
The last time I tricked out, I brought four hoes to my place (Hah)
They call me Gucci Mane Picasso, 'cause I painted they face (Guwop)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Gucci Mane]
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
'Cause last time I took pills, I had to smash a bitch (Geek)
And last time I smoked gas, I almost crashed a whip (Skrrr, skrrr)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Hah, wow)
Last time I took drugs, I just took half of it (Burrr)

[Outro: Gucci Mane & Travis Scott]
