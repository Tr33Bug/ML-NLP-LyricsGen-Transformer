Met Gala Lyrics[Intro: Offset]
Hey
Southside
Wizop
Offset
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Woo!

[Chorus: Offset]
Mil' in a week (Hey)
I bought a iced out Philippe (Ice)
Yeah, playin' for keeps (Keeps)
Suck up the gang, she a leech (Leech)
Came in the game with a key (Key)
My pockets blew up, Monique (Monique)
Ooh, she got that perfect physique (Ooh)
I'll tape a brick to her cheeks (Brick)
Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get come-ups (Come-ups)
This a good week, I've been stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' (Wraith)
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal (Normal)
Thankin' the Lord for them blessings
I just left the Met Gala dressin' up formal (Formal)
[Verse 1: Offset]
Look at my boogers, they big as you (Booger)
You could get shot with your nigga too (Bow)
The stick make a nigga do boogaloo (Brr)
Bentley Mulsanne but the seats masseuse (Skrrt)
I'm havin' more stripes than Adidas boost (Havin' that)
Dick in her mouth like a edible (Dick in that)
Nigga start shootin', you better move (Brr)
I fight for my gang, I won't let 'em lose (Gang)
Your bitch, she wantin' the pipe, aight
This shit all started off likes (Huh)
Hopped in my DM and wrote me a kite, flight (Yeah)
She on the very first flight (Go)
Finesse a nigga then get his shit bike (Huh)
Psych, right, nigga, goodnight (On sight)
Poppin' that shit 'cause he thinkin' he pipe, pipes
Hunnid rounds drum with the knife (Brr)
Me and the Wop, Biggie and Pac (Wop)
But we so different, we keepin' the Glock (Bow)
I'm on a yacht and the yacht on my watch (Yacht)
Fuckin' a thot on the ocean, Dubai (Thot)
I'ma play dumb but I see all the plots (Plot)
She know what I'm 'bout (Hey)
You hit this dope and your heart gonna stop (Hey)
They callin' the cops (12)
Hop on the jet, this a twenty passenger (Jet)
Offset a maniac, I'm the massacre (Hey)
I take your heart out and shoot your bladder up (Agh)
Get to the top and we blew the ladder up (Top)
Ran up my money, I'm talkin' lateral (Bag)
Got that bitch high off a Perc' and Adderall (High)
Pull out the fire and you better grab it all (Brr)
Bitch, I'm Offset and I'm 'bout to set it off (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane & Offset]
I'm havin' this shit but you had it (Havin' it)
Show me respect like your daddyâ€™s dad (Respect)
Yeah, Gucci the magnet, cash in the cabinet(Guwop)
I just woke up in a palace (Woo)
I did a walk through, I'm in Dallas, man (Walk through)
Flew in two bitches from Cali (Pew)
Big Bs on me, I'm rocking Bally (B)
They drunk and they just walkin' barely
I'm headed to Paris to pick up a bag (Go, go, go)
And they treat me like one of the Jacksons
These niggas ain't trappin', ain't makin' transactions (Nah)
A nigga rob you, he be practicing (Bow)
Four bitches all tryna swallow this
I feel like I'm fightin' an octopus (Woo)
Thought it was killers camped out in my bushes (Brr)
To come to find out it's photographers (Flash)
Feds watch me with binoculars (Feds)
Mad 'cause a nigga gettin' popular (Grr)
Flexin', your ho wanna lock me up (Flex)
Drop Top Wop but the top is up (Skrt, skrt)
Negative turn to a positive (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care none 'bout no obstacles
I could care less 'bout the bloggers, boy (No)
80K stuffed in my joggers, bruh (80 ball)
