Nothin On Ya Lyrics[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
I swear them hoes ain’t got nothing on you
That nigga broke, he ain’t got nothing for you
I swear these hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I fuck with you cause you’re very loyal
And you’re so fine, you make my blood boil
I have to go and get another lawyer
She took the charge, they ain’t got nothing on her
I swear to God they ain’t got nothing on her
Huh, we in the airport, she got something on her
We ball out in the mall in California
We might just pull up in twin Californias
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s nothing, claim they aren't, but they bluffin'
Come home and I hit it hard, and she gives me head that’s concussion
I’m stunting, OG Kush what I’m puffin'
In the club you know me, I spend it all
My homies gon' get to bustin
Got a quarter million to spend
Just came home from tour and I crushed it
Just bought my wife a pair of glass shoes
Cause her ass thick as a pumpkin
They ain’t got nothing on her
She don’t want no other nigga, she fuckin with a stoner
And if I’m up in this bitch, then I’m prolly with the owner
Hella bottles, hella marijuana, anything you want, my niggas got it
We got liquor, we got mollies, we got bitches tryna ride, taking pictures
We just standing on the couches, they could try but
You might also like[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on her
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin'
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I fuck with shawty cause she very loyal
We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya
I won’t ignore you and I won’t divorce you
Let's have two girls and call them Rolls and Porsche
I respect that girl, I accept that girl
I’ll do anything I can to protect that girl
If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl
But I’m unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related
We got faded at my spot, I swear we're so wasted
After the third shot of patron, I swear can’t even taste it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
Hoes ain’t got nothing on you
I think that shit just paranoia
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin
Girl, these hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you15Embed
