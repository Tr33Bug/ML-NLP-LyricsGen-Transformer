Off the Leash Lyrics[Intro]
Honorable C.N.O.T.E

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I put it down so long and so strong that your bitch will leave home
Do wrong and your bitch is off the leash
Two days gone she been gone so long you can't get her on the phone cuz that bitch has been with me
Say she wanna' hang when she wanna' hang bang, Gucci wanna bang bang baby you can be a freak
Like Big and Diddy don't bring your bitch around me better marry that girl get your ass on one knee

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bitch got a camel toe you know I gotta reach
Ass too fat for them lil' thongs she got the cheeks
Stay down for them macaroni cook that dope like ravioli Rollie like a Rollie-pollie 'ollie, yee
Burr burr burr Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, jewelry freeze
All black diamonds just like pepper make me sneeze
Got off all them bonds and now we showing Rollie, like a Rollie-pollie 'ollie, buy my bitch a brand new pair Kanye's
Woo, woo dope dancing like Chris Breezy
Woo, woo hiding that's DeKalb county police
They behind me but they on the nigga right behind me rear
Goddamn look at this shit here
I just started my fucking career, yeah
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I put it down so long and so strong that your bitch will leave home
Do wrong man your bitch is off the leash
Two days gone she been gone so long you can’t get her on the phone cuz that bitch has been with me
Say she wanna' hang when she wanna' hang bang, Gucci wanna bang bang baby you can be a freak

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Got a girl with four degrees but she keep it so street switch that game up on me she treat me like a piece of meat
Got me weak in the knees SWV, gave me head on the beach she a motherfuckin' freak
Pretty teeth and pretty feet and some pretty ass cheeks I ain't fucked her in two weeks wait til she get a load of me
If you broke, man, then leave her leave her
If you gangster keep her keep her
If you not then leave with me when I see him say "Nice to meet you"
Ima paint my Bentley purple cause you got on purple sneakers
Ima paint my Phantom purple cause we smokin purple reefa
Maybe we can go to Puerto Rico you dont need your visa
We’ll sneak back two illegal people and a cheaper pound of reefer weed

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I put it down so long and so strong that your bitch will leave home
Do wrong man your bitch is off the leash
Two days gone she been gone so long you can’t get her on the phone cuz that bitch has been with me
Say she wanna' hang when she wanna' hang bang, Gucci wanna bang bang baby you can be a freak
Like Big and Diddy don't bring your bitch around me better marry that girl get your ass on one knee

Somebody need to call Tyrone and tell him that his bitch is with the boy Peewee
I done stayed down so motherfuckin long, paper long, they call that boy Peewee Longway (Longway, Longway)
I got gas packs so motherfuckin strong start crush a blunt, smoke like a bong, I got that pack from PeeWee Longway
I’m outta space, I’m outta space, that molly on me
I’m skeetin it in her face can’t wait to show the homies
I’m hittin' it from the back I think she buffered her body
Two foreigner’s back to back but I got that new body
Been pushing them narcotic packs but don’t you tell nobody
(Been pushing them narcotic packs but don’t you tell nobody)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I put it down so long and so strong that your bitch will leave home
Do wrong man your bitch is off the leash
Two days gone she been gone so long you can’t get her on the phone cuz that bitch has been with me
Say she wanna' hang when she wanna' hang bang, Gucci wanna bang bang baby you can be a freak
Like Big and Diddy don't bring your bitch around me better marry that girl get your ass on one knee31Embed
