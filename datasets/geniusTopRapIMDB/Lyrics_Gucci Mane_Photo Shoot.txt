Photo Shoot Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Listen to this track, bitch

[Verse 1]
Like Tommy Lee and Pamela, I'm fucking on the camera
More stamina than animals, Gucci is no amateur
Jeru the Damaja, could damage you or handle you
Two girls on my bike, one on the back, one on the handle bars
Ferrari F-130, so I call that bitch Tarantula
Got Canada on calendar, so shout out to my manager
I walk through in South Africa
I jumped in my four Acuras
I flip it just like spatula (Listen to this track, bitch)
So suck me just like Dracula
Polo like a college boy
No I'm not a college boy
I am a So Icy boy, I'm tatted like a biker boy
We are the So Icy gang, tatted like a biker gang
Dreaded up, breaded up
Wet it up and bet it up, bitch, you don't want bet
Pull up in my Chevy 'Vette
Nah, you ain't ready yet
Wetter than your girl get
Dolce 'Bana, Dolce shades, don't you wanna see the boy?
See the boy, see the boy
Come and take a Polaroid, Polaroid
Camera flash, camera flash, I see your ass
Looking with your looking ass
So come and take a camera flash (Ha)
Jewelry game amazing
Car game crazy
Gucci Mane LaFlare walking 'round the city, say cheese (Listen to this track, bitch)
[Chorus]
Riding with my broad, it's a photo shoot
When I hit the mall, it's a photo shoot
When I'm in the club, it's a photo shoot
Go on and get your camera phone on, it's a photo shoot
It's a photo shoot
Girl, it's a photo shoot
Girl, It's a photo shoot
Girl, it's a photo shoot
When I'm with your girl, every time it's a photo shoot (Verse two, it's Gucci)
Go on get your camera phone on it's a photo shoot (Listen to this track, bitch)

[Verse 2]
Photogenic chain, man, photographic memory
I can fuck your thang but I don't fuck hoes in industry
Gucci Mane LaFlare, So Icy, you remember me
Remember me from TV, turning on your TV
Hip-hop police say they looking after me
How you looking after me? You know I had a murder beef
Yeah, I got a murder beef, I'm just tryna get something to eat
Me and my lil' main squeeze, give a nigga break, please
Chain on Frigidaire, watches on refrigerate
'Frigerate, refrigerate, I'm freezing like a polar be
Red carpet shawty and the paparazzi chasing me
How they gon' catch me? I'm riding in a Lamborghin' (Listen to this track, bitch)

Girl, it's a photo shoot
It's a photo shoot
Girl, it's a photo shoot
When I'm with your girl, every time it's a photo shoot
Go on get your camera phone on it's a photo shoot (Listen to this track, bitch)

[Verse 3]
Me and Boosie smoking fruity, it look like a photo shoot
Shout out to my nigga, Webbie, my hoes independent too
Me and Shawty Lo in a Duely smoking purple dro
Me and Gotti in a Benz, man, you know we get it in
Me, Black, And Gorilla Zoe in the studio by Club Enzo
And Zone 6, Morning Avenue, Memorial Drive, you know for sure
Shawna fine and Trina tight, I kill them girls like Killer Mike
Killer Mike, I kill the mic so shout out to slick, Killer Mike (Killa)
Me and Plies, chinky eyed, back to back in Hummers
So it's tint, tires, double wide, 30 inches on you guys
UGK my favorite group for years been riding with them guys
8 Ball told 'em lay it down and I did that 'bout 30 times
[Chorus]
Riding with my broad, it's a photo shoot
When I hit the mall, it's a photo shoot
When I'm in the club, it's a photo shoot
Go on and get your camera phone on, it's a photo shoot
It's a photo shoot
Girl, it's a photo shoot
It's a photo shoot
Girl, it's a photo shoot
When I'm with your girl, every time it's a photo shoot
Go on get your camera phone on it's a photo shoot (Listen to this track, bitch)12Embed
