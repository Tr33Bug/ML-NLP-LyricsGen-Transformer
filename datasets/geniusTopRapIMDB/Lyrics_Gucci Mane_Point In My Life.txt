Point In My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
First thang first, baby girl let's get acquainted
My name Gucci Mane, baby tell me what you dranking
That boy is a lame, he don't got no super game
My name Gucci Mane and baby girl that's just a name
Tell me who you came with and the reason that you came
You don't need to be here girl you should be ashamed
Baby let me help you, I'll be your shelter in the rain
Let me be your doctor tell me where you feeling pain
I can be your pill baby, I can keep you sane
And I can be your whip, I can whip you off the chain
I know you heard bout Guwop and my boys we off the chain
I'm the boss and spilling sauce
Cause Gucci don't know how to sang
[Hook]
I'm at this point of my life, important part of my life
I'm at this point of my life, that I don't really have time
I'm at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside
I'm at the point of my life, I'm having sex with your mind

[Verse 2]
To all the hustlas worldwide, and from coast to coast
Put your glasses in the air and propose a toast
Grab the pretty girl that you love the most
Ladies grab your boyfriend, baby hold him close
I got a girl From a Island and she love me mo
Got another girl and she love my boat
Got another girl love to sell my dope
Got another girl love to buy me coats
But they ain't you bae, no they ain't you babe
It's just somethin else I can do when ain't nohin to do babe
See they ain't you babe, it's me and you babe
And there ain't nothing else I can do but be with you, babe

[Hook]
I'm at this point of my life, important part of my life
I'm at this point of my life, that I don't really have time
Come at this point of my life, girl would you set me aside
I'm at the point of my life, I'm having sex with your mindYou might also like10Embed
