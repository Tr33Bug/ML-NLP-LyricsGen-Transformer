Pussy Print Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Wizop!
Yeezy Mane
Mike Will Made It
Burrr!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bitch, stop the comparisons, I'm not these other artistses (No!)
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, my neck on that real retarded shit (Brr!)
Keep a towel with me 'cause my watch be drippin' water, bitch (Woo!)
And I only featured Kanye 'cause we both some fuckin' narcissists (Yeezy!)
Narcissistic tendencies with psychopathic pockets, bitch
My bank account is crazy, bitch, I think it needs some medicine (Woo!)
My straitjacket Giv-enchy-ahnchy-ahchy (Ooh!), can't even pronounce that shit
Designer jeans, designer drugs, just bought me a designer bitch (Yeah!)
Why this bitch keep hittin' my line? She knowin' she ain't no dime and shit (Nope!)
Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste, be fuckin' around with no nickel, bitch (Huh?!)
Your nigga pinchin' pennies, but I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for 'cause I got all the presidents (Racks!)
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie all day, she think she elegant (Mwah!)
It's an elephant in the roomâ€”guess who's the motherfuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci)
Maybach in the garage, elevator in the residence (Huh?)
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop, yeah)
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print (Huh?)
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah! Yeah)
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop making super moves
Making stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feeling mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me going OC
How her friend only gonna watch that, that is so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster; you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you; at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guest room
In the restroom, fuck it, every room (Yeah!)
Tryna see that...

Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah!)
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Mwah!27Embed
