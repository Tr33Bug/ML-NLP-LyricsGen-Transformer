Shooter Lyrics[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
This a whole bunch, a whole bunch of shooters in this house
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
If you wanna go to war, fuck it, nigga let's shoot it out

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Walk up from my spot, sit down, have a seat
I just been in 5 shoot outs last week
He bought the run division, plus he moving in the kitchen
Nobody make a move, nigga, when Scooter handling business
Reaching in his pocket, Gucci slap him with the pistol-
[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Get your bitch ass down nigga, motherfucking move nigga
Hood rich!

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Brick strapped to your sister I'm a send her in a rental
I don't give a damn about her, but I'll make millions with the tender
I got money in the fender, tryna buy my kids Christmas
Me and Scooter ain't twins, but we got twin choppers
Got Waka Flocka Flame, a nigga hit em with the yapa
I'm a street nigga, never be a partner to a copper (No)

[Verse 3: Young Scooter & Gucci Mane]
What the fuck going on nigga?
Who the fuck let these police ass nigga in here?
I don't know
Fuck out the spot nigga
Snitching ass niggas got caught with a brick
Same day call my phone for a thirty-six
I can see with one eye open like Slick Rick
Fuck the police that's why I rap about them bricks (Me too)

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
I ain't Diddy nigga, but these bricks get remixed
When the chopper start spitting, nigga head 'gon get split
Nigga robbed me at the carwash, that was 1996
Ever since the day, them niggas ain't tried me since

God damn, bruh
Talkin' 'bout a nigga robbed you in '96
No, you geeked up, boy
He did
You still gotta pay though
I know

[Verse 5: Young Scooter]
Nigga owed me a brick, that was three years ago
Seen him in the club, nigga, shot him in the throat
Black amigo Scooter still rob 'migos
And I still got a lot of shooters on the payroll

[Bridge 3: Gucci Mane & Bankroll Fresh]
Hold up Scooter
I got shooters
You got a shooters
Aye man what?
Get the door man that's Fresh man, you don't see him on the camera?
I need 'em bruh
Yea, let 'em in
Aye, open the door nigga

[Verse 6: Bankroll Fresh]
I need 50 of them pretty mids, this nigga at the store
He waiting right now, Gucci is it a go?
I hope it is, 'cause if it is, my shooters, they on go
Shooter on the Scooter, bring them bows
He want them right now, he just came from way up the road
Ten millimeter with thirty shots, make your fuckin' head explode
[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
I got a trap house mansion with some hard wood floors
Can't come in, I got burglar bar doors
Trap going crazy, but I got it under control
I just bust 'em open, fix 'em up, and move 'em out the door
Who this nigga in this Buick, man get Scooter on the phone
I'm like a NBA coach 'cause I keep shooters at my home

[Verse 8: Young Scooter]
All I know I never seen his face in my life
Street smart so I know this nigga ain't right
Pull up at my spot, cut your car off hit your lights
Before you hit the door, you get robbed on sight

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
This a whole bunch, a whole bunch of shooters in this house
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
If you wanna go to war, fuck it, nigga let's shoot it out
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
This a whole bunch, a whole bunch of shooters in this house
Its some shooters in this house, its some shooters in this house
If you wanna go to war, fuck it, nigga let's shoot it out4Embed
