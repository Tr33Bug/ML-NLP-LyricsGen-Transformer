Solitaire Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Burr
I'm out pussy
It's your worst nightmare
Glacier, hah

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I was just sittin' in a cell playin' solitaire
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, said she love them solitaires
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Four mil for the crib, one point five just to keep me chill (One point five)
Who my neighbors is? Jack and Jill, still trap up the hill (Through the hill)
Fiji water, talkin' Aquafina, glass, crystal clear (Clear)
Ice there, ice here (Ice), I just iced the atmosphere

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Huncho), I'm walkin' real light (Walk)
It's somethin' like skatin' on ice (Skate)
Your ho wanna fuck my vibe (Sheesh)
Huncho Brett Favre, throw pies (Huncho)
Uh, try the gang and we dumpin' (Dumpin')
Glacier Boy, it's a global warmin' (Yeah)
Now everybody wanna come join in (Gang)
Niggas born in, they ain't sworn in (No)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I was just sittin' in the cell playin' solitaire (Huh)
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires (Wow)
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, say she love them solitaires (Mwah)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Bitch, I don't play no solitaire (No), I'm a fuckin' millionaire (Yeah)
Trap stars everywhere (Trap), bad hoes everywhere
Right wrist quarter million dollars, that's no lie, huh
Left wrist, all baguettes, I put it in the sky
You might also like[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
All my stones single, man, they ain't with the mingling
Damn near smashed the whole clip, but we ain't with that kinky shit
Wop be on that Nicki shit, my whole clique robbin'
Lookin' at the robbers like, "Y'all ain't finna take shit"
Glacier Boy, amazin' shit, your jeweler ain't up on this
Crazy diamond bracelet, I'm jealous of my own wrist
You ain't spent a million yet, you probably won't agree with this
Make jewelers compete for us, we keep on coppin' pieces (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I was just sittin' in the cell playin' solitaire
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, say she love them solitaires

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Wop, hah
