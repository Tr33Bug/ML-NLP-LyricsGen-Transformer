[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga, please
You ain't got as much guap as me (Uh)
You don't wanna go dollar for dollar (Ball)
You don't wanna go bottle for bottle (You don't wan' do it)
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch (Huh?)
'Cause all I ever fuck with is models (Yeah)
I'm a motherfuckin' player, my nigga (Player)
If she bad, I'ma slay her, my nigga, yeah (Push it, push it)
Stuntin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Pimpin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Ballin' ain't nothin' to me (Ain't nothin')
Poppin' bottles, that ain't nothing to me (That ain't nothin')
Flyin' foreign cars, that ain't nothin' to me

Stuntin' ain't nothin' to me (Uncle Jxmmi)
Look at this shit, it ain't nothin' to me (Woo, ayy)
[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
You don't even know what I'ma do
When I'm in the zoo lookin' at the zebras (Ayy)
All these hoes, they some fuckin' cheetahs (Ayy)
Uh, they some fuckin' cheetahs (Ayy)
Throwed off, nigga, on the reefer
I've been drinkin', drinkin', drinkin', drinkin', drinkin' (Henny)
Hennessy goin' all through my system
Don't let your bitch be a victim (Nigga)
These niggas lookin' sad (Hey)
I'm running 'round with bags (Rich nigga)
I'm into popping tags (What?)
I don't even got your brand (What?)
Money talk for me
I'ma do the money walk down the street
I'ma do the money walk down Hollywood
Need my name on Hollywood, nigga (Uncle Jxmmi)
Your pockets looking brittle (What?)
You a rat, Stuart Little (Get away from me, nigga)
Ten-thousand-dollar outfit
She can tell I'm a rich nigga (Ball)
Came out my mama like a boss
Got these hoes singin', Diana Ross (Huh?)
Makin' big moves constantly
EA need to sponsor me (2K)
Swagged up, can't take it off of me
EarDrummers, we a damn monopoly (What?)
I remember I ain't have a pot to pee (Ugh)
Nowadays, I'm everywhere the guala be (Yeah)
Want a follow? Bitch, you gotta swallow me (Swallow)
I ain't trickin', bitch, it ain't Halloween (Nah)
We can't kick it, bitch, ain't no soccer team
I don't wanna talk, I ain't Socrates (Trippin')

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Stuntin' ain't really nothin' to Wop
Like a jack in the box, I hop out the drop
Don't leave it to Beaver, just leave it to me
Gucci Mane makin' two million a week (Woo)
Gucci earrings two hundred a pop (Brr)
I cop when I shop, I don't know how to lease (No)
Grindin' like I don't even know how to sleep (Go)
You remind me of my Bentley GT (Hah)
On Magic on Monday, I throw up the money
I'm a man crush every day of the week
I'ma ball hard like it's Super Bowl Sunday (Wow)
A fool with the chewin', she chewin' the D (Chew)
What in the hell is she doing to me? (Woo)
SWV got me weak in the knees
Give her the trophy, the throat of the week
Gucci the G.O.A.T., got my foot on they throat
And my feet on the wood like I play in the league
Criss-crossing the country like crossin' the street
And I feel like the Pope, all these crosses on me (Brr)
If you still sellin' dope, then I'm givin' you hope (Skrrt)
'Cause ain't none of them gettin' more money than me (No)
I'ma keep givin' them something to see (Hah)
Honestly, none of them fuckin' with me (It's Gucci)

Get a new bitch every day, ayy
Fuck what you heard (Yeah), fuck what you say (Fuck it)

You don't wanna go shooter for shooter (You don't wanna do it)
You don't wanna go million for million (You don't wanna do it)
You don't wanna go bitch for bitch
I got bitches in Hawaii (Yeah)

Some millionaires and some boostin' (Uh, yeah)
Might call your bitch to make a movie (Ayy, come here)
And you know it's X-rated (It's Dolph)
Like you know my weed strong (Yeah)
And the Sprite I'm drinkin' medicated (Raw)
Break out the dice, let's shoot (Let's shoot)
I'm selfish, I only buy coupes (Coupes)
Told the bitch to bring one friend
Hardheaded-ass bitch brought two
Looked one of 'em in the eye, said, "I already fucked you, why she brought you?" (Hah)
I'm a player, these bitches, they love me (They love me)
In the club passin' out bubbly (Here, take that)
Bitch, I'm the shit like Ruffin (David)
Can't a nigga tell me nothin' (It's Dolph)
I'm out in Hollywood druggin' (Druggin')
Young nigga paid and thuggin' (Yeah)
Dolce Gabbana tuxedo (Hah)
Trap nigga like Nino (Brown)
Just had a bad bitch trio
One Mexican and one Creole (Hah)
