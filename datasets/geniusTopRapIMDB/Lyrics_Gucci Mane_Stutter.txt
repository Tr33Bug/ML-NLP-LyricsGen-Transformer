Stutter Lyrics[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad, lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna fight it off, ain't tryna nut too quick
She make me wanna take her, she's another nigga bitch
A bitch that Gucci Mane can't get, man that bitch don't exist
This dick so good, I take it from her, she might slit her wrist
Bling blaww burr, I put diamonds on her clit
Fucked her in the air, yeah she ride me on the jet
His and her fur, yeah I bought my chick a fit
Like Edward Scissorhands, yeah she cut up on that dick
G-g-g-good God, so why she standing back like a pic?
Spaghetti straps in my Maybach, she showing off her tits
She ran off on the plug, so I'ma smash her at the Ritz
S-skeeted in her mouth so now she talkin' with a lisp
[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit

[Verse 2]
I told her bring a friend with her but she just brought some twins
Three girls and one Gucci Mane goddamn I'm goin' in
All these Franklins on me man I said my name was Ben
Magic City Monday night, I just threw up a ten
Nigga with a attitude I feel like Cube and Ren
These two ice cubes in my ear they cost a quarter M
That pussy hairy scarin' me, goddamn she need to trim
The way that bitch took care of me she might get her a Benz
She suck me 'til it tickle me, slow down the neighbors listenin'
I got on like ten necklaces, you know my diamonds glistenin'
She fucked me then she shot me with her friends, I think she trickin' me
Her nigga know about me but goddamn he can't get rid of me
She st-t-t-stutter step, around the suite in lingerie
I beat it up like MMA she drank it up like Aliz√©
Eight Latinos in my room I feel like it's the fifth of May
Pull up on the kid, you dig?
But bitch I ain't got time to play

[Hook]
I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
Stutter when you hit
Stutter when you hit
S-s-stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
I-I can't even lie, that bitch so bad lil' mama so thick
The way she throw it back it make you stutter when you hit
