Tell me who can ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down (huh, hol' up, it's Gucci)
Tell me who can ball like this

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Huh, pull up, froze up with the door up
Chopper in the club, I don't care who show up
Watch lookin' like a glow up, when I throw up
East side Bouldercrest Road where I growed up (huh?)
Hold up, lil' homie, tone it down
‘Cause the jewelry that you rockin’ is for kids, I’m a grown up (huh?)
Sat courtside right next to the owner
Lookin' so good, make his wife pick her phone up (Wop)
Big gold boulders in my Rollie
Look like Fred Flintstone when he pick a stone up (ring!)
If everybody got a watch like that
Then why would I want that watch? I’m a loner
Damn near had the temper tantrum
'Cause he got that car ‘fore I got it, now I really don’t wanna
You never seen a nigga glow up like this
Not a nigga that was trappin’ on a corner (it's Gucci!) (Yeah)

Gucci Mane and CB, jewelry lookin' 3D
Tryna be like me ain’t easy (wow)
Niggas hate me, women wanna date me
‘Cause I got on all these VVS pieces (yah)
In that great thing
2018 Rolls Royce truck, no reason (huh)
Water on my time piece wetter than a Fiji
Parked in front of the St. Regis (burr)
Artists wanna meet me
Ballin’ like an athlete, but I ball all four seasons (ooh)
Diamonds dancing just like Breezy (damn)
Take it easy Breezy, go easy (ha)
Big stones in all my pieces (ha)
Gucci Mane stunt like Meechie (Meechie)
Jewelry so cold, I’m sneezin’ (achoo!)
Pull up South Beach, no ceiling

Fire weed, hit it, have a nigga seeing ghosts
Tell me what it do 'cause I’m tryna get to know you
Champagne, takin’ shots, won’t have a hangover (Yeah)
