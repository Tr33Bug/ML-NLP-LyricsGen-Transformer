Traphouse 3 Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
What's happenin',  nigga?
Trap House III, fuck nigga
What's happening?
Ayy, T, come out, man
Man, we outta cut again?
Fuck

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I told partner bring the presser, huh
Apply some pressure to the jack, yeah
I got a thousand keys uncut, nigga
Guaranteed I make this money stack, nigga
I'm trying to make this money fast, nigga
I'm trying to keep this shit together
I call that boy Eggbeater Fat
I cook good, but he cook way better
Sipping Coronas with my vato
Me casa you know es su casa
Big cat we used to call El Gato
Now, GuWop, they call me El Chapo, nigga
I use to trap out all the bandos
Abandoned homes with boarded windows
Who the fuck that is peeking in my window?
Fuck boys know I keep that extendo (GuWop)
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap house
Trap house, trap house, trap house, trap
Trap house, trap, trap house, trap
Trappin' off a pack, know I trap house trap
Trap house, trap, trap house, trap (Maybach Music)
Trappin' off a pack, know I trap house trap

You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding 'round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Trap House III, got a K with me
And three young niggas that stay with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
Hope these niggas don't play with me
'Cause my MAK-90 stay with me
