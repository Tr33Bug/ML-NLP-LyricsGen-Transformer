Use Me Lyrics[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Who me? Ain't’ shit…
Sittin’ court-side at All-Star
And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, walking my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex
[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)
Baby use, me – baby, use me
Baby use, me – baby, you can use me
Baby use, me – you can use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
No niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)
…makin’ no noise
Them niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
If you’re an ugly ho, I can’t leave with ya
If you’re a broke nigga, can’t smoke weed with ya
If you ain’t a boss then I can’t sip lean with ya
I’m not a rapper, bitch, I’m a mob figure
4-58, it’s a centrepiece
These ho niggas ain’t seen half a million
Got a pimp cup, I’m in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me
LaFlare, nigga, I’m rare, nigga
Caveman Shit Drag Her By Her Hair Nigga
You a bear nigga? Well I’m a bear killer
You a fuck nigga, I don’t fuck with ya
2 Chainz, nigga, my cuh-cuh
All my cousins sell drugs
My brother sent a pack, I fell in love
And told everyone I know I sell bud
You might also like[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
All I rock is designer clothes
All I take is designer drugs
So geeked up couldn’t find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)
2 Chainz, two times, got major money
More money than a label tryna sign a thug
And ya CEO say he wanna sign with me
‘Cause the artists you’ve got ain’t hot enough…

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)
Baby use, me – baby, use me
Baby use, me – baby, you can use me
Baby use, me – you can use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
No niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)
…makin’ no noise
Them niggas ain’t makin’ no noise (nah, nah)
…makin’ no noise
That nigga ain’t makin’ no noise (shut up)5Embed
