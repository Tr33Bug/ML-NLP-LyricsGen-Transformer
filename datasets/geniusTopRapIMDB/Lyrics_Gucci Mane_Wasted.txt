Wasted Lyrics[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Ha (Ha), ha (Ha, ha, ha)
Ha (Ha), ha (Ha, ha)
Wasted, I'm wasted, so wasted, so wasted
Take it, FATBOI

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, "send me twenty more cases!"
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney (Wasted)
Gucci no hippie, but he stoned like Jimmy (Jimmy)
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy (Crazy)
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted (Wasted)
Purple Codeine Sprite pink: don't waste it (Waste it)
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it (Taste it)
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted (Wasted)
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me, I'm a drinkie, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it (shake it)
Club life, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted (wasted)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
"Party, party, party!" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, "send me twenty more cases!"

[Verse 2: Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor (on the floor)
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that .40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Whole clique faded, we geeked up crazy (crazy)
Big boy bracelets, we "white-boy wasted" (Wasted)
No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting (wasting)
285 Eastside, me and Plies wasted (Wasted)
Racing, Chevy beating, booty/butt chasing
Spring bling, 50 thousand, white girls shaking
Some dancing naked, but everyone's wasted (Wasted)
Magic City Monday, ball-player wasted (Wasted)
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted (Wasted)
12-pack wasted, I need more cases (Wasted)
And Gucci's not a racist all my diamonds caucasian

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, "send me twenty more cases!"

We get wasted (Wasted)
