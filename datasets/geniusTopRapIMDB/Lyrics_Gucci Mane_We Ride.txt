We Ride Lyrics[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we ride
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Look I don't trust nobody like I trust  you
I know you'll never hurt me 'cause it will hurt you
Everybody turn their back on me but you
And when I did time you was doing time too
Looking back at it, Hell what we went through
It's like I prayed for an angel and he sent you
They used to say you was a fool 'cause you loved me
Now look at them they like damn I wish it was me
But tell me can you hold me down in the bad weather?
Cause anyone can hold it down through the fair weather
That's why the rock so big 'cause when you wave at 'em
I want them hoes to run and hide like you sprayed at 'em

[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we ride

It's me and my ride or die, that's my right hand
Got me thinking, "Damn who gon' be my best man?"
Built a house for 10 mil on your own land
And showed your best friend how to build her own brand
Have you ever seen a street nigga slow dance
In a white tux with a live band playing?
It's like the new Gucci talking to the old Gucci
Gotta have 20 M's to see what I'm saying
Who'd ever think I'd get this far, I was just trappin'
Who ever thought I'd get this rich when I started rapping?
This make a street nigga stand up and start clapping
I'd never thought I feel this way but then God happened

[Chorus: Monica & Gucci Mane]
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride
Even when it don't go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms can't fight, we ride
(Get somebody that gon' ride for you) Even when I lose my breath
(Who gon' die for you) Even when I hurt myself
(Who gon' cry for you) Even if it means my life, we rideEmbed
