Feel the Music Lyrics[Intro: Baybe]
Feel the music
Feel the music

[Verse 1: Guru]
Times like this make me clench my fist
Then I'm caught up in the midst of the musical bliss
Guru, blow a kiss to the ladies in my corner
Caress the mic and kick my game like I wanna
What? You never see the brother Guru falter
Respect is due, praise me like the altar
The crew, we're as true as they come, son
We come from ill life experience, and take rap serious
Feel the music
[Chorus: Baybe]
We hold the key, to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind, sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane we're goin'
Can you feel the music?

Feel the music

[Verse 2: Guru]
Original baldhead Crooklynite, rudebwoy instructor
I came back to lay down law to the suckers
I'll crush ya, if you ain't actin' like my brother
Make one false move and with the mic, I'll bust ya
Just lay back and feel the music

[Chorus: Baybe]
We hold the key, to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind, sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane we're goin'
Can you feel the music?

Feel the music
Feel the music
Feel the music

When I step into the club, I come to do work
No hesitation, because I'm fully alert
Like Max Julien, I'm an authentic Mack
Many others can't compare, I'll bet on that
Dialect and vocal tone, completely exact
I react, then I max in this mellow track
In fact, I'm knockin' MC's out the frame
'Cause I'm smooth like jazz, Guru is my name
Feel the music

Feel the music

[Chorus: Baybe]
We hold the key, to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music

[Verse 4: Guru]
New reality.. a higher level of consciousness
Don't play yourself; get out of line and get stomped with this
Negativity is a chronic disease
But I'm like the cure, causin' infections to freeze
I'm not gonna let up, until you get the picture
My sound gets around, so you know I'm always with ya
Feel the music
Feel the music

[Chorus x3: Baybe]
We hold the key, to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind, sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane we're goin'
Can you feel the music?2Embed
