Fine And Free Lyrics[Hook: Vivian Green]
Ooh, summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
That's the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze, cool and free
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fresh off tour. I'm the best, I'm sure
More thirsty than before. Boy, I guess I'm raw
I'm like James Bond, mixed with Julian Bond
That's why bouncers never frisk the side my toolie is on
Now the venue is bubblin', gettin' close to a frenzy
Ladies rush up to the front with high hopes to tug me
They lust for me. They know I'm trustworthy
Rich girls wanna empty out their trust for me
So, city by city, and town by town
My performance is gritty, you know how I get down
And I'mma bless you with more than just a nice song
Yeah, I'mma leave a mark that's life-long
[Hook: Vivian Green]
Ooh, summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
That's the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze, cool and free
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm married to this heart yo, I love my spouse
The stage is like my crib and yo, I love my house
I'm shoppin' with switchblades, my presence is felt
Anything I desire I'mma get it myself
I'm prettier, smarter, wittier, harder
It's time to push the envelope a little bit farther
When I touch the mic, ain't no fuss and fight
And if there's somethin' out of line then I'll adjust it right
I can be cool and calm but when the duel is on
Might even spaz on that ass until your cool is gone
I heard you sold your soul for a hundred G's
Guess that's why all you can rhyme about is pumpin' ki's

[Hook: Vivian Green]
Ooh, summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
That's the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze, cool and free
Yeah, yeah

They say that good things come to those who wait
I found that bad things come to those who hate
So to each his own and when I reach my zone
Hearts throb, the hunnies can't leave me alone
See my voice is like an aphrodisiac
Soon as they hear it they dreamin' 'bout me in the sack
See I'm sort of like a tutor in Kamasutra
I'm like Dexter St. Jock when I'm punchin' the clock
Well, enough about my prowess with the ladies
Man, the culture is sufferin' 'cause these cowards are lazy
Their whole repertoires consist of jewels and cars
What's the point? He's just another foolish star

[Hook: Vivian Green]
Ooh, summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
That's the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze, cool and free
Yeah, yeahEmbed
