For You Lyrics[Intro: Guru]
Dedicated to all my peeps, who looked out over the years
KnawhatI'msayin? This one's for you

[Chorus: Guru + Me'Shell Ndegeocello]
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you

[Verse 1: Guru]
To my moms and my pops, I'm glad you stayed together
I don't know too many people to demonstrate true love better
Nowadays kids don't have anyone
But you were there and determined, to make me get plenty done
Yes to achieve although a lot of times I hurt you
But I'm matured now, I'm showing you my true virtue
As I deliver to you, an oath of never ending love
Admiration and respect, for there is nothing above
A mother's strength and a father's concern
There was guidance, no matter which way I turned
Yo pops if I could be half the man you are I'd be a star
Moms thanks for pushing me real far
As I proceed through the tundra and harsh winds
I think reviewing what you've instilled within
So I'm taking time out to let you know
Once a boy now a man thanks for helping me grow
[Chorus: Guru + Me'Shell Ndegeocello]
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you

[Verse 2: Guru]
Going out to my peoples for all the times we've spent
Fifty deep up in the party getting crazy stupid bent
Around the block puffin lye, cruising in the car
Whatever we was doing, I won't forget it Baby Pah
When I had no dough, you were there
You hooked me with some ends, to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other faking clowns tried to start hanging around
See you were always genuine
That's why respect is due and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
We're rolling thick, hitting harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
I'd rather check my man so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college, some MCs would flunk out
Sending shouts to my peeps, crazy love no doubt
You might also like[Chorus]
For you, dedicated true
I'm doin this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doin this one for you

[Verse 3: Guru]
A true friend kid, is mad mad rare
Trusting others is a risk, a lot of things ain't fair
'Cause where I be at, a lot of strange things happen jack
You can know a kid for years and still he'll stab you in the back
But that's alright cause I'm a good judge of character
And me and my family, we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star, we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealing with the struggle, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
Yo under pressure, we're the best
No matter what the circumstance, no matter how much stress
Our force has the power to bring forth change
I'd rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always, I said always be applauded

[Chorus: Guru + Me'Shell Ndegeocello]
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doingthis one for you
For you, dedicated true
I'm doing this one for youEmbed
