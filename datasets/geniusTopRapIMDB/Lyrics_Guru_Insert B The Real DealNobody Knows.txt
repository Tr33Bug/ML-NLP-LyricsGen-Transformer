Insert B (The Real Deal)/Nobody Knows Lyrics"So when you think you know the whole
You don't even know the half" --] Guru, _Mostly Tha Voice_

Chorus: Shara Nelson and Guru (repeat 2X)

[Shara Nelson] (Guru)
Nobody knows Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all
What I'm goin through Nobody knows what's behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams.. bout the dreams..
[Guru]
I'm catchin a flashback of the days when
My pockets were dry, I only had a few friends
Those same brothers now my family
We've been through it all, in this industry
Mad frustrated, ready to flip
Because the company was playin me like some dumb kid
Video out and I'm still ridin the train
Workin and hustlin, no pain no gain
Now here comes the spotlight, still somethin's not right
I gotta pay my rent by five o'clock tonight
Livin on fifty cent noodles
But I'm playin the game, that the brothers know I'm true to
Can't let up, although the journey is rough
Focus on the goal like it's the Stanley Cup
I gotta play this thing for keeps
My only stress relief is the hip-hop beats

Chorus: Shara Nelson and Guru

[Shara Nelson] (Guru)
Nobody knows Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all
When I close the door Nobody knows what's behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
They try to kill my dreams Nobody knows about the dreams.. bout the dreams..
You might also like[Guru]
Skippin the turnstyles, everyday lifestyle
Lookin at this world with mad anger cause it's wild
People thinkin that I'm blowin up
But they don't understand, the young man is growin up
Now who you think I should trust?
Better rely on self, no time for missin the bus
Fake people, phony characters
They begin to swarm, so I built up barriers
To block em out, but they still dwellin
Makes me wanna just start yellin
But I play it cool though, cause I'm no fool yo
See chumps'll always try to break down your flow

Chorus: Shara Nelson and Guru

[Shara Nelson] (Guru)
Nobody knows Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all
What I'm goin through Nobody knows what's behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams.. bout the dreams..

[Guru]
No time for misery, no time for empty wishin
'fridgerator's bare, killin roaches in the kitchen
Just spent my last on a 40
To sip away my troubles, now it's worse, cause I'm hungry
I check my man for advice
He lent me 20 dollars and we lounged and got nice
I told him nobody knows about the wack side
I feel like a slave gettin whipped on my backside
Chorus: Shara Nelson and Guru (repeat 2X)

[Shara Nelson] (Guru)
Nobody knows Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all
When I close the door Nobody knows what's behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
They try to kill my dreams Nobody knows about the dreams.. bout the dreams..

Chorus: Shara Nelson and Guru (repeat 2X)

[Shara Nelson] (Guru)
Nobody knows Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all
What I'm goin through Nobody knows what's behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams.. bout the dreams..Embed
