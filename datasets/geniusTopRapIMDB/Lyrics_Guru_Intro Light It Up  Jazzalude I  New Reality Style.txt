Intro (Light It Up) / Jazzalude I / New Reality Style Lyrics[Part 1: "Intro (Light It Up)"]

Bring the lights down,bring the lights down
We all gotta do something really serious
If you have a lighter in your pocket
Light it up!
All the way in the back
From the back to sides,to the front
Bring the lights down,down wit’ the lights
Word up!
All the lighters,light them up
This is for a real good reason
I wanna see everybody do it
If you have a lighter, light it up
Let’s see it
Ok,the right side is better
But the left side fill it up,fill up the middle
In the middle,in the back,waay in the back
C’mon ya’ll!
[Part 2: "New Reality Style"]

Yeah!
Welcome to Jazzmatazz II, The New Reality
Stressing the importance of family
For too long the black family structure has been systematically divided
And specially here in America
We must start pay more attention to one and other needs
We must start showing more respect for one and other
Knowwhatimsayin?
I’m talking about a mind revolution
A 360 degree mind revolution
Redefine our purposes, organizing, and utilizing our resources to gain focus
So we can create positive changes ,yo
This is serious!
I take this rap stuff really serious
Anyone that knows me,knows this
Plus I got a whole mob of incredible jazz artists and vocalists on this album down wit’ me
They gave me crazy love
So with no further delay
Dig the vibe,relax max and enjoy
Yours truly , Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
The GURU
One love!You might also likeEmbed
