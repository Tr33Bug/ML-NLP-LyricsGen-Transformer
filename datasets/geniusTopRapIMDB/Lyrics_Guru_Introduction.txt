Introduction Lyrics[Intro]
Peace yo, and welcome to Jazzmatazz: an experimental fusion of hip-hop and live jazz. I'm your host the Guru. That stands for gifted, unlimited, rhymes, universal. Now I've always thought of doing something like this, but I didn't want to do it unless it was going to be done right, know what I'm saying? 'Cause hip-hop, rap music, is real. It's musical, cultural expression based on reality. And at the same time, jazz is real and based on reality. So I want to let you know that it was indeed a blessing and of course a pleasure to work on such a project with so many amazing people. For instance, I got Donald Byrd, Roy Ayers, Lonnie Liston Smith, Branford Marsalis, Ronny Jordan, N'Dea Davenport, Courtney Pine, and MC Solaar all in the house. Plus I got Gary Barnacle, Carleen Anderson, D. C. Lee, Simon Law, and Zachary Breaux doing much work. So without further delay, I say to you, listen and enjoy, and check it outYou might also likeEmbed
