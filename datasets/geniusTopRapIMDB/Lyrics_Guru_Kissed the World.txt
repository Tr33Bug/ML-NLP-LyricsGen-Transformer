Kissed the World Lyrics[Chorus: Caron Wheeler]
Georgie, Georgie don't run
Kissed the world and made it cry
Gonna just say no, this has gone too far
You better kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you don't care
Mama's birth (?) isn't ready for this
You need to handle yours!

[Verse 1: Guru]
This land is my land, this land is your land
This land is my land, you're sure man? Sure?
Cause Georgie wanna rage war on all fronts
And me? I'm a peace seeker when it's all said and done
We got enough problems here, why we messing with that?
Politics in the mix and now we're guessing again
Speculations as to who's a threat
Shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up Georgie, 'cause you'se a vet
Who's up next now? I guess the Rootin' Tootin'
Invading and raiding is what you're used to doing
And I can understand war tactics#
But without dialogue there's just more caskets
And everybody's scared to death
Turn on the news, bad news, be prepared to step
And there goes our favorite guy
George kissed the world and made it cry
.
Chorus:
Georgie, Georgie don't run! Kissed the world & made it cry!
Gonna just say no - this is gone too far! Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm!
Waste the bodies this you don't care! Mama's birth (?) isn't ready for this (?)
...you need to handle yours!
.
[Verse 2: Guru]
How dominating do you have to be?
When it only ends up as a disaster, G
After me there will be no more to warn you
There will be no emails, no voice messages to inform you
That Georgie's got a beef to settle
And you say no to weapons, he says keep the medal
Sending troops of our native sons
Straight into battle, no talking just blaze your guns
And I'm from the home of the brave#
You go against the mission, you're gonna go in a grave
And that's the way Georgie wants it
'Cause I don't think he's happy, unless there's conflict
So many soldiers on the front line
It's getting tense everywhere, when they're in a crunch time
And there goes our favorite guy
Georgie kissed the world and made it cry
.
Chorus:
Georgie, Georgie don't run! Kissed the world & made it cry!
Gonna just say no - this is gone too far! Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm!
Waste the bodies this you don't care! Mama's birth (?) isn't ready for this (?)
...you need to handle yours!

Kissed the world and made it cry. Why'd you kiss my world good bye?
