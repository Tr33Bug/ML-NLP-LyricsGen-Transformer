Lifesaver (DJ Premier Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Guru]
Mmm, is this really the end, or is it a new beginning?
A new reality

[Chorus: Guru & Baybe]
So many misconceptions (Don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions (Don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
[Verse 1: Guru]
Scooby doo wah, scooby doo wee
Like a jazz player, I improvise wisely
Free with the style, I flow like the Nile
But remember, don't mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin'
Like ancient African griots, precise is my timin'
But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin' here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin' there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin' to kill me and all of us, my friend
But don't bend to the mental strain
Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life the Lord gave ya
And that's a message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver

[Chorus: Guru & Baybe]
So many misconceptions (Don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions (Don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (Oh, I am, I am, I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Baybe & Guru]
Oh I am, the life (I am the lifesaver)
I am, the life, yeah

[Verse 2: Guru]
It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off
'Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer
And as for me, no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life that's been torn apart
Over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence
That the money only takes precedence
'Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die during every hour
I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver

[Chorus: Guru & Baybe]
So many misconceptions (Oh, don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions (Don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (Oh, I am, I am, I am)
I've come to give direction (The life)
For I, am the lifesaver
[Verse 3: Guru]
People talk about the Armaggedeon
And nowadays everyone you know is packin' lead, son
Each day's another test
Ayo I better do my best, 'cause a lot's ridin' on my chest
So when I lead you to the water
You best know how to swim across, so you can reach the border
It's international, the message and the flavor
So here's some more important words from the lifesaver

[Outro: Guru & Baybe]
The lifesaver (I am the life)
The lifesaver (I am the life, oh oh yeah)Embed
