Look To The Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]

I keep the city balanced
Meet every gritty challenge
Stay low baby bro, ?things? get pretty violent
I got love for my people
Bust a slug for my people
Whether booshie or ghetto there's some wonderful people
I'm the man of the year
You better clam up and hear
What I'mma say cause I don't play
You're gonna stand up and cheer
At the top of your lungs
Ain't no stopping the Sun
It's a movement, so move it
Yes, the prophet has come
Bringing truth that was hidden
From the proof that was given
Make you forget about the life you used to be living
Time to make a change cause nothing stays the same
With discipline we can win and escape the pain
The spark will be within
Then hearts will beat again
What we've been taught must be forgot it's time to see again
Up from the bottom, we rise like the cream
They can't fool us nowadays we're too wise for their schemes
[Jazz Interlude]

[Verse 2]

Cut all the tough talking
We've seen enough ?coughing? +coffin+
You better recognize the time and get some stuff popping
No way to cheat us now
The babies need us now
Don't run, look to the Sun
They can't defeat us now
See us now as we expose false ?knowledge G?
Give new meaning for your life and for your own psychology
Bring our people higher
?Begin? reaching higher
For sure it's time to nurture grow a deep desire
You see nothing's going to change unless we change ourselves
That's why I don't complain instead I came to help
It's like: War and Peace; Yin and Yang; Life and Death
You have to respect someone with my type of rep
So ink to the paper and paper to ink
Ya'll go ahead and be stupid for me it's safer to think
I speak to those who hear me
I speak to open minds
I speak of more than theory
And we shall know in time
