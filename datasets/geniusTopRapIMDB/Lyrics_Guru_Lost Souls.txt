Lost Souls Lyrics[Intro: Guru]
Doing it in the house like this
Going out to the lost souls
Doing this for you and yours
Comin' straight to you from the Guru and the crew

[Hook: Guru]
To the lost souls
I hope you find your way someday
That's why I sit and I pray
For the lost souls
I hope you find your way someday
That's why I sit and I pray
[Verse 1: Guru]
Sometimes I wonder why
Some people can't see what's beyond the naked eye
So therefore I must fortify
Techniques of communication
For beyond what is considered to be
Normal conversation
So I need some proper 'ticipation
Am I giving what you need
Yes true indeed
As greed grows like weed
Many bad seeds start to contaminate the crop
I think that needs to stop hops
Brothers are slain over respect and clout
While thier mothers're trying to figure out
What's it all about
But when you give up on self that's when you lost
Cause you're playing with your life
Like it's a coin toss

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Guru]
No doubt I release a form of speech
Relative to urban outreach
Transmitted messages to each true listener
Rhymes divine but rough
Like the skin on blisters
Cause the truth hurts
Plus I got no time for runnin' around chasin' skirts
So see my sound is a corrector
A profound lecture
Quality texture
That's because of what I see
Alot of mc's are gassed like helium
Word up g
Alot of people in general are straight up no good
Makes me wanna shoot 'em
Aiyo maybe I should
But instead I parlay
Maintain self control
And say a prayer for the lost souls

[Verse 3: Guru]
Get up stand up
Come on
Stand up for your right
One two
I go to new heights with my insight
Whipping my mic tight
With the height of a scholar
Equipped with the gift to make crazy dollars
But that ain't the whole
See my heart is in it
That's the only way one could even attempt to win it
Dj spin it while others critique
But the science makes 'em weak
Check the words that I speak
See it's ridiculous for us
Not to discuss
The real issues
Like all you phonys
And why I dis you
Dismiss you as a lost soul

[Hook]
[Outro: Jason Kay of Jamiroquai/Guru]
If you don't watch where you step
You can become indirect
And you know that you will lose your soul
And if you truly want to lose
Until there's nothing to choose
Then you know that you will lose your soul

To the lost soul
I hope you find your way someday
So I sit and I pray
For the lost soul
I hope you find your way someday

Lose it
You can lose it
You can lose it
You can lose your soul

To the lost soul

Hope you find your way

I hope you find your way somedayEmbed
