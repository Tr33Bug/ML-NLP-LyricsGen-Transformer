Lounginâ€™ Lyrics[Intro]
Yea, I'm loungin', I got my man Donald Byrd on the horns
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man, Miko, he's 2 years old
He's away visiting his grandmoms but I miss him dearly

[Verse 1]
Check it out
If I rhyme this, you will find this situation shall advance
You could take a glance or dance
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd
Now tell me who's the man to show you how
Many legacies of brothers who get busy
And I do it fluid 'til the suckers get dizzy
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street
And check the flow that's unique
[Chorus]
For loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'

[Verse 2]
Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this
'Cause my voice is the smoothest
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work
And sold tons of other jerk
Donald Byrd word on the track, quite exact
Giving you the format, Jack
See we gotta pave the way and display

[Chorus]
How to loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin'

[Verse 3]
Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try and clear
My throat, check out what I wrote
You can't tap into this unless you know the roots
Word shoe like life absolute
For real so now you gotta know the deal

[Chorus]
For loungin', just loungin', mellow out and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', mellow out, check it out, and loungin'
Loungin', just loungin', mellow out, and just loungin'
Loungin', loungin', peace to Brooklyn where I live
You might also like[Verse 4]
Realistic, kind of mystic when I kick this
You should witness the slickness
Of the horn player and the dope rhymesayer
Quite emotional and inspirational
Philosophical, and yes, very logical
Teaching you the method for loungin'

[Outro]
Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back
Kick their feet up, y'know
Listen to some good music and just lounge
That's right, I said lounge1Embed
