Plenty Lyrics[Hook One: Erykah Badu]
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Then she gets plenty more, uhh
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Then she gets plenty more, uhh

[Guru]
Watching her driving by in her new whip so fly
Wish she could sing me a lullaby
And set me free like a butterfly
In her eyes is a flame that burns right through my soul
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control
Yeah, I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me
Wow, I have to sit down, and gather my wits now
I wanna caress those hips now, wanna kiss those lips now
[Badu]
Hello? Hey, babyyy
I know you called and I didn't answer twice
But baby that's oh-kay, it's nice
For you to call anyway see, okay, see, uhh
Hey, babyyy
You know it's okay if you don't call me
Anymore, 'cause I got a-plenty
Truckload of niggas like you at my door

[Hook One: Erykah Badu]
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Then she gets plenty more, uhh

[Guru]
Yup
And every day is her day, every year is her year
Anyone tries to violate, they could straight disappear
She don't care if you play yourself, trying to step to her
The wildest of gangsters are showing respect to her
Truly glamorous, she ain't impressed and it shows
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose
Do you suppose I could luck up and spend time with her?
She's like how I dreamed — I'd bust my nine for her

When she gets plenty, she gets plenty
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
Any damn thang she wants

[Guru]
Uhh
Surgeon General — I provide vitamins and minerals
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal
Said 'never put the two before the one, son'
Always cultivate your Wisdom, to help to build your kingdom
I wanna be the answers to every question she has
When I wish to enter, she be lettin' me pass
I know I'm gonna be her G-O-D eventually
Still, she's got everything; ah, the girl's got plenty

[Bridge: Erykah Badu]
Flowers in her bedroom
Perfume on her neck
Nectar from a mason jar
Seven dollar dress; she's
Super cute, and plenty bad
Thirty, twenty-two, thirty-six-and-a-half
I, hope the dude will realize
She got the sexy bedroom eyes
Baby, baby, please don't break yo' neck
'Cause you gon' have a wreck
'Cause when it comes to love I get plenty
Degrees, one-twenty
My thigh slipped out my dress - OOPS!
[Hook Three: Erykah Badu + (Guru)]
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty (She gets it all)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (Uhh)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (C'mon)
And she gets plenty more (Plenty more) ahh
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (Mm, she gets it all)
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty
And any damn thang I want, right? (That's right)

[Guru]
In this game of life it takes a lot to win
Plenty more baby's what I got to give

[Badu]
Yeah, yeah, baby, that's really nice
But I'm tryin to read my book and you're in my light

[Guru]
Uhh - a woman like you could help me reach the top
If I get a chance to love you, huh, I won't stop

[Badu]
Oh huh, what? Huh, whaaat?
I didn't hear you, I was thinkin' 'bout some stuff

[Guru]
Baby, you so fine, I wanna smack myself
I don't need no support, I'm gonna back myself

[Badu]
Hooo, baby, you so sweet
Now can you get the lotion and rub my feets

[Guru]
In massage therapy, I got a Master's degree
I'll give you plenty more, than what you asking from me

[Badu + (Guru)]
I need a little bit of space, a little bit of wealth (Okay)
And oh - about the feets, a little to the left (Like this?)
Mmmmmm (M'hmm, like that?)
Yeahhh (Feels good right?)
Ohhhhh
Ahhhhh (Yeah, heh heh)
Hehehee! (You don't really care)

More lotion! (C'mon...you got plenty!)2Embed
