Revolutionist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't even try it, punk
You'll never have no wins here
You got no friends here
Your heart pumps fear, I know you've been scared
I'm prepared
To face the pressure when I put it on ya
Blame your peoples y'all
Somebody should have warned ya
That the day would come
When the truth would certify your lies
Nigga be dickriders, it's like undercovers wearing wires
Wanna infiltrate
Wanna know what makes the god tick
My voice is crucial to the track
Like the snare and hard kick
Each bar is sick, I spit phlegm in the form of gems
Listen how I glisten, watch the storm begin
Harsh winds, and then will come the downpour
Succas be faking, Jacks don't know what they're down for
I pop your dome with high incantation
Your feeble ass brain still enslaved like on a plantation
Like Frederick Douglass, I be the abolitionist
Breaking your chains, a modern revolutionist
[Chorus]
Too many tears of sorrow, too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood, too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available, too few schools equipped
Too few role models, so behold the revolutionist

Too many tears of sorrow, too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood, too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available, too few schools equipped
Too few role models, so behold the revolutionist

[Verse 2]
(Go ahead)
The revolutionist I blessed, refuse to kiss ass
Quit fast, I'm wearing the mask 'cause of my tormented past
Swallow the pain, follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of [...] nowadays to maintain
[...] bloodstain
Face bruised and [...], eyes reflect agony
Of dreams that were shattered, it never mattered
To the so-called general public
About my nation's situation
And how we rise above it and they love it
When we self-destruct and kill our home
And the grade of responsability yes is still our own
We should know by now
That the system's designed for our demise
If we are wise we'll be left behind
The dollar size rule, but what about the fool
Who falls victim to the material world
Yo pick the jewel I can't see myself
All my fame in that type of gem
The rebel, the militant, yeah I'm not that type of man

[Verse 3]
Worldwide famine, poor people demanded
That somebody do something soon
And let's examine the facts
Behind the violent acts, behind the daily gunplay
The cocaine and the crack
Thug season
That's the reason for the trees and everybody wants to eat
Some gotta resort the faithin', believin'
That the hustling help 'em get by
Well for anyone that gets over
Another hundred will die
What has to come ? Will my heart grow numb ?
How will I save the world ? By using my mind like a gun
Seems a better weapon, 'cause everybody got heat
I know I carry mine, since the last time I got beat
Ain't nothing sweet
I turn a stickup kid to a soldier, put him down with the cause
Make him feel real bold and more intelligent
Plus aware of the tricknology, the revolutionist
Grab your shit and follow me

[Chorus]Embed
