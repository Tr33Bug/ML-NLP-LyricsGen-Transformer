Something in the Past LyricsI haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it was something in the past

Yo you look good, how you been?
How's my little man, how's he doing?
And umm.. did you get the package that I sent?
I hope that he knows that there's someone who loves him
But I'm gettin vexed at you and I
I can't front baby, yeah you still look fly
And as I try, to get my words together
There's a lot of nice times that I start to remember
The good shit always outweighed the bad
I never wanted to make you sad
So think of me, as one man
Who has crazy respect for you, as a woman
Although the plans didn't work out
It doesn't mean I won't look out
For you and yours, I wish you the best
Because it's over I guess
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it's something in the past

Now I'm livin the life, of a true mack
Devoted to my music, tryin hard not to look back
But on occasion I can see your face
The memories, they got me driftin a little taste
But now you're doin your thing, I'm takin care of mine
And so we're movin on, leavin the past behind
I guess relationships they ain't for me
That's why I had to set you free

I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it's something in the past

Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it's something in the past

My personality is magnanimous
That's why the ladies always cause a fuss
It's in the past what we had
Aiyyo respect to your moms and peace to your dad
I'm glad, that we've been through this
Because you know what? I've noticed
A lot about myself, see I wanna gain wealth
They say, that chasin women is bad for your health
You might also likeI haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We have the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it's something in the past

Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man, I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize.. it's something in the past

Somethin in the past
Somethin in the past
These moments never last
Somethin in the past

Dedicated to all the ex girls
You know I'm on with the next girl
