Supa Love Lyrics[Kelis] From - last night (repeat 9X)

[Kelis - talking over repeat]
Yeahh baby
Last night was.. y'know
I mean..
When you touched me I, I couldn't believe it was..
Ohh baby
You don't know what you do to me baby
Ah-ahhh..
[Guru]
Supa love, baby you know youse a trooper love
Youse a dove, I hold you truly above
All the pigeons chickenheads golddiggers and them
You got it goin on, your game's bigger than them
Take me back to the sensual feelings, your sexual healing
Soothes me, after a day of business dealings
What you wearin? I know you look good, you even cook good
And I'mma steal your love like a crook would, watch me

[Kelis]
You must be, out of your mind
If you think you're gettin away (yeahh, uh-huh)
What you did to me last night
Baby you've gotta stay (come again, come again)
I understand there's other places you must go
(yeah, but wait a minute)
But there's one thing you gotta do
Baby before you go, so give me that love

Love, that supa love
The kind that keeps you all day dreamin of
(gimme that love baby)
That's top rhythm love
Still feels good when you know it would
(yeah, I need that love)
Love, that supa love
The kind that keeps you all day dreamin of
(ohh, I can't stop)
Love, chocolate love
Melt it down with me.. (mmmm)

There's not a problem that I can't fix
Not a hot track, that I can't flip
There ain't no sex style, that you can't pick
After my supa love, you'll be like you can't switch
You'll be hooked, shook cause you took the time out
To let me have your body plus turn your mind out
I was caressin you tight, blessin you right
You was suggestin to continue that, all last night
The best love, check how I do it with finesse love
Swing it with me, go on and put me to the test love
I'mma do the same to you..
And make sure you're takin care of the job you came to do

[Kelis]
I can't get it outta my mind
What you did to me yesterday (welll, uh-huh)
Baby this is so not right
It's unfair how you play (come again, come again)
What you did to my heart, to you it's just so so
(yeah, but wait a minute)
But there's one thing you gotta do
Baby before you go, so give me that love
Love, that supa love (that super)
The kind that keeps you all day dreamin of
(gimme that love)
That's top rhythm love
Still feels good when you know it would
(yeah, gimme that love!)
Love, that supa love
The kind that keeps you all day dreamin of
(I need it!)
Love, chocolate love
Melt it down with me.. (mmmm)
