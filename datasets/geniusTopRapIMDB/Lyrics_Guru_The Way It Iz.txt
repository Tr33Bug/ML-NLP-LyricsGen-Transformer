The Way It Iz Lyrics[Intro: Guru (Kai:Bee)]
Yeah (New York, New York)
Time to get up in that hit-ass (Brooklyn)
Uh, the rap savior (representin' kid)
Ill behavior (let's break it down)

[Hook: Guru, Kai:Bee and Lil' Dap]
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause it's my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
[Verse 1: Guru]
Your raps get bombarded
Allahu akbar, baby pal don't disregard it
Wanna be slick chicks, why you act so retarded?
All you pseudo-tough guys end up dearly departed
As a young juvenile I started, learnin' from some older dudes
From the pimps to stick-up men
And back then you had to know the rules
The peer pressure it can get ya, knocked and locked-up
Or laid the fuck out upon a stretcher

[Hook]
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause it's my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

[Verse 2: Kai:Bee]
Peep the melody, Brooklyn is deeper than a felony
Raps are full of violence, who wanna challenge?
Cause Kai rap whatever Kai choose to kick
A man's child from the Nile
Look at my style ain't it raw?
But too mature to be labeled wild
Ain't nothin' fake I create, I don't tolerate static
My brain'll cause drama like an automatic
So bang, I'm livin' large like a king
The addict, I'm kickin' pure mathematics
With the power to rule, I give my knowledge as a tool
Plus I'm invisible and I apply by usin' my third Eye
Stimulation and high off the lie
And better yet I'm a vet as I manifest
Wise words from my breath
And my wisdom'll flow until my dyin' day of death
With topics and subjects to every aspect
I bless the mic with intellect
You might also like[Verse 3: Guru]
Don't pay attention you'll get stuck, you're straight outta luck
Cause niggas been beamin' you and they schemin' for fast bucks
While chickenheads be awestruck by the thugs
With ill mugs who act bugged and don't give a fuck
It's systematic when flippin' dough like acrobatics
Fiends and addicts gettin' served by cream fanatics
It's savage, Jakes more corrupt than we are
In the alley behind the bar
Bringin' product from Panama and Bogota
Rulin' the game superior
The crime biz, the way it iz in America
I'm killin' rappers like I've gone mad
My heat is righteous, too many brothers have gone bad

[Verse 4: Kai:Bee and Guru]
At times I lay in my bed holdin' my head smokin' weed
Like a dred drinkin' liquor for dough, fact of myself
One question (Yo, what's that, huh?)
Why adolescents gotta get murdered to learn a lesson?
Stay on point with the joint in my Guess
Cause ain't no tellin' us when slugs might touch my chest
Feelin' like I'm blessed
Livin' life by the day, Monday through Sunday
Involved in gunplay, it's like a warzone
That's why I think with the chrome and hold my own
Whenever walkin' these streets alone
It's like I walk on top of high heat with no shoes on my feet
Watchin' the flames get higher as the gun shots fire
[Hook]
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause it's my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

[Verse 5: Guru]
I'm supposed to give up guns 'til my probation is done
Still I'm waitin' for son to bring the three-eight long one
They try to deny what's happenin' to us
But nowadays it pays to be strapped ready to bust
Let's discuss, what would you do?
If you're confronted with jealousy you at least get a twenty-two
Plenty of us go through this syndrome
It's better to fight than die poor and alone
The mob guys be gettin' loot for protection
They live and die for their profession

[Hook]
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause it's my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

[Bridge: Lil' Dap]
Yeah, we doin' it low budget environment style
It's like walkin' through the ghetto when the feelin' is fine
Everybody know the time, uh, East New York Style, uh
Yeah, East New York Style

[Hook]
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause it's my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate2Embed
