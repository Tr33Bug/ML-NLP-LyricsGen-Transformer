Transit Ride Lyrics[Hook]
"Watch the closing doors!" (cut and scratched 4x)

[Verse 1]
Right now I'm gonna take you for a ride
Hold on tight, so you don't slip or slide
This train is packed, you don't get no seat, yup
You gotta stand on your tired feet
Where we goin don't worry, you'll be there in a hurry
But you better watch you pockets cause the thieves work quickly
This is a New York transit thing
Don't wear too much gold and hide your diamond rings
And don't smile at anyone
'Cause people out here, they like to travel with handguns
You say you like this trip, well are you sure?
You better step lively, and watch the
Watch the closing doors
[Hook]
"Watch the closing doors!" (cut and scratched 3x)

[Verse 2]
Here we go, as we ride, through the underground
Coming from Uptown, taking you downtown
Headed for Brooklyn, Brooklyn the planet
Somebody stinks in here - I hope you can stand it!
Homeless people everywhere holdin cups for change
And if you don't have none, they may look at you strange
But this is all part of the scene
And yo check those kids 'cause they're startin to scheme
See them lookin at you up and down?
Oh yeah they can tell, that you're somebody from out of town
Think they won't harm you? Well they might
And that ain't right, but every day is like a fight

[Verse 3]
Ah ahh, ahh ahh ahh
I can't quit, I gotta do what I must
'Cause I can take you on a ride with the lyrics I bust
'Cause I'm a master, try to diss and I'll blast ya
Any wack MC that steps up, is gettin plastered
Straight against the wall, cause I don't stall
I give em drama and trauma, til they all fall
And for those who don't know, about the city life
It's where we take no pity, and the kiddies are trife
Takin the train is just part of it
The next stop is Brooklyn, you're comin to the heart of it
You never know what will occur
So just keep to yourself and watch the closing doors
