Universal Struggle Lyrics[Chorus]  (x2)
It's a struggle - it's got a hold on me
The universal struggle - it's got a hold..

[Verse 1]
From Sofia, Bulgaria to the New York interior
You see poverty and crime throughout these areas
And people with tattered clothes, babies from battered homes
Pure hard times, just they're dying from that alone
From U.S. shores, to countries overseas
This universal struggle's got a hold on me
Every city's got a ghetto, the prisons are filled
The police and the military in position to kill
And I just wanna live my life with less pain
Seems like only a few moves left in this chess game
I guess change has gotta come soon
I can't live my life in fear waiting for doom
And actions of course speak louder than words
It's much harder when you standing in a crowd to be heard
So I walk alone and look forward to better days
I'm not the same anymore, I endured with better ways
[Chorus]  (x2)
It's a struggle - it's got a hold on me
The universal struggle - it's got a hold..

[Verse 2]
From the hoods of Los Angeles to Toronto, Canada
You can picture the struggle without no camera
The wealthy get wealthier, cause that's the aim
The less fortunate get desperate, and that's a shame
Who's to blame we complain, nobody responds
So our only alternative is to try to move on
And show resilience in the face of danger
Determination and strength to replace the anger
Great people of the world rise up from despair
Historically our kind has always been here
To lead effectively when we need the recipe
For peace, so we educate the seed respectfully
And this is how we beat the struggle
Staying tuned and keep out the reach of trouble
The bloodshed, the oppression, the violence, the famine
We can trace it through various events we examine

[Chorus]  (x2)
It's a struggle - it's got a hold on me
The universal struggle - it's got a hold..You might also like2Embed
