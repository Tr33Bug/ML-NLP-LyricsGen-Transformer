When Youâ€™re Near Lyrics[Guru]
Uhh, yeah you're something else
You know I love it when you're near me, you're near me

[N'Dea]
I like the vibe I get from you babe
I get, from you
And it's your style that I like too babe
That I like, too
I like it when you're near
Speak to me in my ear
Come closer over here
[Guru]
Please, give me more, I need it I want it
You can see I'm all up on it
So can you come up for a second baby, second baby

[N'Dea]
You and me, can be so free
You inspire, to take me HIGHER
I want you now, to show me how
To relax me, and light my fire

[Guru]
If I tell you that your touch is precious
Would you not forget this, would your heart protect us?
Endless, are my emotions for you, heh
I guess that's why I do the things I do, I do

[N'Dea]
Your look is definitely tempting
I want to, seduce
I know things I wanna do to you babe
I want, to prove
I like it when you're near
Speak to me in my ear
Come closer over here

To relax me, and light my fire

[Guru]
You're brilliant, no I can't conceal it, I feel it
The signals that I get from you, tell me you're with it
And I'm gonna wine and dine and romance ya
Take the chance to let you know that I dig ya
I figure, that my time won't be wasted
The way I'm gonna kiss your lips, yo I can taste it
It's not about just hittin the skins
It's your style, your vibe, SEEN?
