Drink The Kool-Aid Lyrics[Verse 1]
This ain't Sinatra!
This ain't the Carter!
I am the chaperone nigga...Who brought ya!
I am the author! This is Holy water!
From the Holy Father...The Rock of Gibraltar!
Step up to the altar! Step up to the slaughter!
Get circumsize son and turned into a daughter!
Niggas know they oughta drink the fucking Kool-Aid!
Industry laid out authorities are too late!
MC's passed the due date! Niggas? They do hate!
You are Bobby Boucher, I'm the Mane like Gucci!
I rock the Louis! But not like Kanye!
Nigga see me kinda like...Harry Belafonte!
Step into the room they be like: "Ah, Day-O!"
Yeah, cause they know a nigga ain't play-doe!
Shots all fatal! Is this Laredo?
Boarder town knock them down just like Lego's!
[Bridge]
Drink the Kool-Aid!
I make a motherfucker drink the kool aid!

[Hook]
(Let them know!) Do you (Let them know!) Do you
(Let them know!) Know who you fucking with? Know who you fucking with?
Do you (Let them know!) Do you
(Let them know!) Know who you fucking with? Know who you fucking with?
Always (Always!) Always (Always!)
Know who you fucking with! Know who you fucking with!
Always (Always!) Always (Always!)
Know who you fucking with! Know who you fucking with!

[Verse 2]
I ain't the Doctor! This ain't the patient!
This ain't that nigga always on vacation!
This ain't no white boy's rehabilitation!
This is crazier than a boat full of Haitians!
This is inflation mixed with degradation!
This ain't no dead rappers reincarnation!
I heard it was a New West Coast, I ain't worried!
I murder more stars than Conrad Murray!
I got more bars than the penitentiary!
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary!
Young bucks try to step up to the harim!
Looking for some pussy I'm an old buck, I dare them!
