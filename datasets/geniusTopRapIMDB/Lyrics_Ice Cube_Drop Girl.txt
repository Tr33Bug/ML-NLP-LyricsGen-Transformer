Drop Girl Lyrics[Chorus: Redfoo & Ice Cube]
Drop girl
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass drop)
Drop girl
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass drop)
[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Stop, drop, and roll it
I like bad bitches in that club that control it
If you tote it, uh huh, you get voted
And to my haters, I'm back moded
And we exploded on you motherfuckers
We took shots and reloaded on your motherfuckers
Ayy, I can't hear you talking to me
Don't interupt me when I'm talking to the booty

[Chorus: Redfoo & Ice Cube]
Drop girl
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass drop)
Drop girl
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass drop)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Stop, drop and pop it
And after you pop it, please put it in my pocket
Look here, I need a sponsor, we can turn the city out
You remind me of my drop top, titties out
Ooh yeah, and can spend about 50 thou
All you do is make 50 thou
We can run and go spend it now, haters
Realize it just don't stop, see you at them pearly gates
Hit the button that make you, make you...

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Drop drop it, lemme see you squat it
Type a nigga gettin' private dances in the public
Hit her from the back, grabbing on her shoulders
Hair weave killa, girl don't you get nervous
Cleaning some detergent, all my cars got curtains
I left her like Ginobili
My Rollie cost a car, and I don't have a car note
I took her from the bar to the car to the condo

[Hook]
Drop girl drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop

[Outro]
Brought to you by Drop it like its hot and pick it up likeâ€™s not production
Dealers in funky music and round jiggly shit you can play with
