Friday Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know it ain't no stoppin' all the dogs I'm droppin'
It's Friday night so everything is poppin'
I gots ten to spend on the Hen
So let the games begin
Yakety yak don't talk back or it's on
Callin' up Earl on the car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court
Rollin' through the hood in his super sport bumping Too $hort
Eighteens got the rear view mirrors vibratin'
And deep-dish Daytons
You know how we do it
Ain't nothing to it but the floss
Overcrowding Harrison-Ross
'Cause if you fuck with ours
We leave scars
Out of G-ride cars
Livin' like stars
Might hit the highway
On the Vegas run fool 'cause it's Friday
[Hook]
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care

[Verse 2]
Standing outside on a Friday living on the edge
'Cause we all got them hard heads
It's seems like we all are waitin'
For a drive-by playing tag with Satan
But we chillin', yeah, we ready and willin'
Ya hear about the latest westside killing?
Forty sippin', set trippin', fo' dippin'
Pistol grippin', neva slippin'
BGs trying to hang out
But OGs sayin' "Take your little ass in the house"
My big homie just got out
Used to be down, now he's just cracked out
He's bout hard as Darth Vader
In his sweatshirt, khakis and Chuck Taylor's
Just seen him in the driveway
Getting beat like a smoker a fool, 'cause it's Friday
You might also like[Hook]
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Fool

[Verse 3]
Why must I be like that and chase the cat?
Or settle for a hoodrat
Dookie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of town with half a chicken in her cock
And I love her, 'cause she down
To fuck around with the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up, make a nigga down to ride
Smoking indo, playing that Super Nintendo
Hear a rat-a-Tat-Tat on my window
Gave her ass that pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound to bust
In the oven, in the nappy
I had on two so I was happy
'Cause that HIV'll make your dick hang sideways
And that ain't cool, fool, 'cause it's Friday
[Hook]
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care

[Outro]
Throw the West side in the air
Throw the East side in the air
Throw the South side in the air
Throw the North side in the air
Oh yeah!14Embed
