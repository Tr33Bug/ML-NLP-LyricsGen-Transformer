Good Cop Bad Cop Lyrics[Intro]
Turn me loose
Break 'em off some
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Good cop, good cop rollin' with that bad cop
Whatcha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots, they fly through that drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground, hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse that'll make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast warlord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course
[Chorus]
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

[Verse 2]
Lazy cop fuckin' with that crazy cop
Always bragging 'bout the new case he got
Do-or-die cop with that suicide cop
Tell-the-truth cop, with that you-a-lie cop
Are you fuckin' high, cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox
Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider
You's a roll-up, yep the controller
Make me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands (What's up?) up you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive niggas off the porch (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Tell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place (Let me out)
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

[Outro]
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop13Embed
