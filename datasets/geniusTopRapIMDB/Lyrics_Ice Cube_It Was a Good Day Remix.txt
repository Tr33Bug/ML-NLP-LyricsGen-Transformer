It Was a Good Day (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Hahahah
That's right
Smooth, hah
Yeah
Hahahahah

[Verse 1]
Just waking up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl, I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-fo'?"
I gotta go, 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
"Which park are y'all playin basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week messed around and got a triple double
Freakin' brothers everyway like MJ
I can't believe, today was a good day
[Verse 2]
Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a brother's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Little Joe
Picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', "Domino"
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day

[Bridge]
Hahah
Hahah

[Verse 3]
Left my homie's house paid
Picked up a girl, been tryna do since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punani
And my Jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp"
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good dayYou might also like2Embed
