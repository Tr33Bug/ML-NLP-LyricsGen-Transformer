Nobody Wants to Die Lyrics[Intro]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Y'all thought I was soft as cotton
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messed around and forgot I was rotten
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
You know my resume
You tell 'em I'm on my way
But nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)
Ah nobody wants to die
[Verse 1]
I keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny
Don't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny
I'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain
See the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game
Haters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang
Arrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang
But let me explain, like Abel and Cain
That the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper
Revenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge
It depends if I can live with my sins
Lose family and friends (lost em all)
Now you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed
And you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud
If you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth
I'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick

[Hook]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, son)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (yeah)
But nobody (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody)
Ah nobody wants to die

You forgot where I come from, you forgot what I do
You forgot what you was sayin', cuz I'm blockin' your view
Now I got you on cue, you about to turn blue
Get around me now you actin' like my little nephew
Boy what you wan' do? You ain't gon' do ish
But go take a ish, is 'bout as funky as it get
Now I'ma have to admit, that I was prolly too nice
But take my advice or I'll take your life
Now if you still wanna slice, let's start with the fingers
Let's move to the toes, and end with the penis
See men are from Mars, now you from Venus
How dumb you got to be tryin' to think with the genius
It's the big payback, you can't clown James Brown
See a brother been down ever since Jamestown
You either swim or you're drowned, you either gagged or you're bound
Now you can't make a sound, boy look at you now

[Hook]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, Crip)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (Go on)
But nobody (Nobody, na)
Ah nobody wants to die18Embed
