Sic Them Youngins On â€™Em Lyrics[Produced by Jimmy Anthony]

[Intro]
Lench Mob incorporated
Fuck with the godfather
See what ya get
Punishment
Consequences and repercussions
Understand me
Y'all know what I do
[Hook]
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

[Verse 1]
Try to go H.A.M. on Porky Pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
Barbed wire, come through, split your wig
Y'all can't wrestle with the giant squid
Try to get that to the iron fist
Act Al Green, I'm hot as grits
Yarn in my hand, no pinky ring
Godfather, nigga, I pull the strings
Do what I tell'em, buy what I sell'em
Puppet master, I'm Jim Henson
See my muppets, they like ducats
Y'all better run when you see that bucket
Hit that corner, do what I wanna
Get another jar for the organ donor
Ice Cube, nigga, I know better
But you ain't gotta fight
When you got that cheddar
You might also like[Hook]
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

[Verse 2]
Try to have beef with a fucking bull
With no teeth I'm about to pull
I'm that dentist this the finish
All the spoils go to the winners
Don't go mad cause my hands are clean
I'm the king, never flee on the scene
Wizard of Oz, if you need a brain
Need a heart? Here's a start!
Don't you worry if you need the courage
Y'all motherfuckers know where you heard it
Gangsta, gangsta, thank me now
Rap god nigga, please take a bow
Can't take bullshit from a cow
Don't ask who, I'mma fuck it out
Thurston Howell, will get you murdered
Come to the boss if you need some work
Come to the boss if you need some hurt
White collar boy, if you check my shirt
Here come my sons just like Levert
Gotta get my boys up out the dirt
Putting the rap game on alert
Fuck with them and I will revert
Back to the old days, back to the old ways
Back to the AK's fucking up doorways
[Hook]
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

[Verse 3]
Try to play chicken with a fucking rooster
Don't you worry, I'm not the shooter
I am a fucking computer, with a whole army of boosters
Nigga got out one piece, five piece, dime piece
Cause my crimies move like zombies
Wha? Being heads since the '90s
Don't act like you don't know where to find me
Now, if you wanna get slimy
Look at all the grimey
Niggas all behind me
You don't wanna go to war so you start to singin why can't we be friends?
We can be friends, pussy ass niggas buy extenze
Pray to the God, repent your sins
Ice Cube ain't like the rest of them

[Hook]
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em
Sic them youngins on 'em

[Outro]
Try to go H.A.M. on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
Try to go H.A.M. on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
Try to go H.A.M. on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
Try to go H.A.M. on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did15Embed
