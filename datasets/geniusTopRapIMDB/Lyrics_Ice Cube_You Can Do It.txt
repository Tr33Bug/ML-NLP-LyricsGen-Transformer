You Can Do It Lyrics[Intro: Ice Cube]
Yay-yay
Get your ass up and hurr' up, uh
Ice Cube, baby
Ninety-nine, baby
I'm on the grind, baby
All the time, baby
Show me something

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
You can do it, put your back into it (Uh)
I can do it, put your ass into it (Uh-huh)
You can do it, put your back into it (Yeah)
I can do it, put your ass into it
Put your back into it, put your ass into it (Brr)
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Tick, tick, boom, hear me banging down these back streets
Bumpin' Blackstreet, treated like a athlete
Life ain't a track meet (No), it's a marathon
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on
We be clubbin' 'til the day we die (Yay-yay)
Nigga, ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga, think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim, you got to think to win (Uh-huh)
And if I drink this Hen', everybody'll know it
'Cause I ain't going for it, so pray to the Lord
That I don't pull out, cuss out and bust out
Go the nigga route (Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click), make the trigger shout, uh
You can try to smoke an ounce to this
While I pronounce this shit, baby, bounce them tits
Mama, move them hips, baby, shake them cheeks
I got dick for days, you got ass for weeks (Yay-yay)

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Cube, Ms. Toi, Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
Don't stop, get it, get it (That's real)
Don't stop, nigga, hit it (I will)
I'm gon' do it (Do it), gon' do it (Do it)
Gon' do it, do it, do it (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it (C'mon)
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it
Put your back into it, put your ass into it

Now all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones (What?)
The thug ones, relatives and my cousins
And I got 'em by the dozen
When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband
This is for my niggas locked away
Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great (The great)
Soon as I get a word, we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great
It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight
I'm still coming with that underground gangsta shit
No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Cube, Ms. Toi, Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
Don't stop, get it, get it (That's real)
Don't stop, nigga, hit it (I will)
I'm gon' do it (Do it), gon' do it (Do it)
Gon' do it, do it, do it (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it (C'mon)
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it
Put your back into it, put your ass into it
[Verse 3: Mack 10]
I do hard core rhymin', hard time grindin'
Gorilla pimp hoes while other niggas wine and dine 'em
Gotta love this thug shit, S-Class in the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit, OG, lyrical Blood shit
I don't rent, I buy shit, niggas jealous of my shit
Unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rootin' and recruitin', nigga, 6-8 hoopin'
I was in the hood shootin', plus I had the wife whoopin'
I come from Pyrex bowls and oversized jars
I'm past up stripes, I got stars and bars
No time for playa hatin', Mack paper chasin'
Kicked out the substation to the hip-hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figgas
Done developed the status of a Platinum-plus nigga
Bust the first bad ho, fo' sho, I can I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it, don't stop 'til I get it, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Cube, Ms. Toi, Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
Don't stop, get it, get it (That's real)
Don't stop, nigga, hit it (I will)
I'm gon' do it (Do it), gon' do it (Do it)
Gon' do it, do it, do it (Say what?)

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
You can do it, put your back into it (Uh-huh)
I can do it, put your ass into it (C'mon)
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it
You can do it, put your back into it
I can do it, put your ass into it (C'mon)
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Cube, Ms. Toi, Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
Don't stop, get it, get it (Never, never, that's real)

I'm gon' do it (Do it), gon' do it (Do it)
Gon' do it, do it, do it

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Ms. Toi]
You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon, yay-yay)
