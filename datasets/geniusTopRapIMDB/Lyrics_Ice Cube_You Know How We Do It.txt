You Know How We Do It Lyrics[Produced by QDIII]

[Intro: Ice Cube & Evelyn King]
Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can kill, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
[Refrain: Ice Cube & Evelyn King]
Comin' from the Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Westside, comin' from the Westside
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
And who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
"Planet of the Apes"
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Just like George Clinton
S-K-P is down to catch a body
Put on "Knee Deep", we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) you know how we do it
You might also like[Refrain: Ice Cube & Evelyn King]
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) You know how we do it
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
With a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) You know how we do it

[Refrain: Ice Cube & Evelyn King]
Comin' from the Westside, Westside
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) Nothin' but the Westside
It's hittin' on the Westside
Fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) you know how we do it
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)43Embed
