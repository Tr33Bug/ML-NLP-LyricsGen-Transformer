Donâ€™t Hate the Playa Lyrics[Intro: Too $hort/Ice-T]
TS: Yeah, man, we just sitting back, chilling
Bunch of players listening to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doing his thing with my nigga Ice-T
Don't fake the funk

I: Ice-T baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin' like a brother done did somethin' wrong
Cause he got his game tight
Don't hate the player, hate the game
[Hook: Ice-T]
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searching fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin' room, I guess I'mma willy
I don't get high, so I don't split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: "Oh really?"
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin', I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You don't really wannna test an L.A. vet though
Most of my crews' on Death Row - the real
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You whack, you looking for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel

[Hook x2]
You might also like[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Don't hate, cause my game's much tighter than yours
My girls, finer than yours, my jewels shine, brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face
Then you act like you don't see me
You wanna be me, you hate my motherfucking guts
Licking nuts - what's the deal? It's a level playing field
My game's against yours, hustling wars
Roll the dice, risk your motherfucking life
Bank rolls and low hoes, anything goes
Ridin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks
I'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane
Crystal Meth, F.C.C., and crack, cocaine
Got a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view, too, but I'll shoot
Every bitch I meet is fucking up to something
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumping
Gat pumping, they'll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game, motherfucker, don't hate me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Yo, my name will sell better than rap like the Acropolis
Suckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus and gators on my shopping list
Make a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you, and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig
Bald-headed hoes step back; bitch, go and cop a wig
When I do a show, best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps, best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up, then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops, I'm still folding fat knots
Catch me on the weekend, floating my yacht
Say, "Ice, kick some game," and I'll teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block
[Hook x2]

[Outro: Ice-T]
I don't know why a player wanna hate T
I didn't choose the game, the game chose meEmbed
