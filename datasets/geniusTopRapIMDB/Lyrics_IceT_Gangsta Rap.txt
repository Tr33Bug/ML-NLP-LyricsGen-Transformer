Gangsta Rap Lyrics[Opening Skit]
(*someone whistles*)
What's up?!
What's happening Cous'?
WESTSIIIDE!!

[Ice-T]
Here we go, another one
Iceberg, Gangsta Rap 2006, 8th album, SMG

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Time to take you back to the days of old
64 Chevys, big fat gold
Out to the west where the gangstas roam
South Central, L.A.. my home
We was out there feeling that Hip-Hop beat
But couldn't connect to the New York streets
So we took our bandanas and we tied them up
Rolled up in the studio and laid it rough
Ice Cube and them niggas with the 'tudes
Showed a motherfucker how to blast at dudes "BLAW!!"
COME ON!! Dr. Dre, N.W.A
Eazy-E and 'Ren, Fuck what you say!
Too Short kept it raw for them niggas up North
Geto Boys, we was like to fuck the law
W.C. nigga, sag your pants
We taught you how to gangbang and to crip dance
[Hook: Ice-T X2]
This ain't no R&B this is Gangsta Rap
Bitches get smacked, busters get jacked
Front if you want, you'll get laid on your back
It's about guns and drugs and ho's and clubs

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Cypress Hill made a nigga understand
How I can just kill a man
Long Beach out of the dark, came Snoop
Skinny little nigga not scared to shoot
Dogg Pound Gangsters, Kurupt and Daz
Suge had the whole Death grow on blast
King Tee motherfucker Warren G
Nate Dogg reppin that 213
Don't front motherfucker don't hate
Compton's Most Wanted, MC Eiht
Throw your sets up niggas like you don't give a damn
Inglewood, Mack 10, Watts was KAM

[Hook: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
So you wanna really know what's real on the Mic!
My little homie 'Pac lost his life
East coast, West coast, Gun-talk rules
Cocaine, big wheels, ho's and jewels
Down South, gold teeth, niggas is real "Dirty South"
Gangsta Rap got mass appeal
Little white boys in 'burbs got heat
A ghetto is a ghetto and a street is a street
Eliminate the poverty disease
And we'll start rapping about birds and trees
You can get shot, no matter how much fucking cash you got
You can never get away, the streets stay hot (*Gunshot*)
And gangsters ain't the ones to push
They'll kill you a second ask president Bush
