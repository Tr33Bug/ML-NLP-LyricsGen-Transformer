Girls L.G.B.N.A.F. Lyrics[Verse 1]
1-2, 1-2-1-2-3, I'm the emcee called Ice-T
That's DJ Evil E, Islam creates the beats
You girls look so sexy
I wish you all were up here with me
You drive me crazy with them big ole butts
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I'm trying to make this real clear, dear
I've no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove your fears
I just wanna get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama call smut
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck
[Verse 3]
Come on, you know you wanna do it too
It's good to me and it's good to you
I only speak what's true
You say you don't, but I know you do
Come on up to my room
We'll undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and I'll caress that butt
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 4]
I mean real stupid and nasty
I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me
Just lay back and I'll operate
Jimbrowski will go to work and penetrate
And then we'll both feel great
Make your move tonight, girl -- don't hesitate
We both want it, don't make it tough
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 5]
Homeboys, you know the situation
You're trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air, turning you down
When you really wanna say, "Yo baby, let's get down"
But you don't, you keep fronting
Kicking conversation, ain't talking 'bout nothing
When all that's really on your mind is what?
"Yo baby, let's get butt naked and fuck"

That's right, if you're a man you want it
If you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it, I autograph it
The Syndicate don't lecture
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night

[Verse 7]
Islam takes the pictures
And girls, I'mma say Evil E's gonna get ya
Get ya illing in a nude mode
A double X-rated episode
Hotel rooms cold explode when my posse unloads
Sex in effect when we're on the road

[Verse 8]
Put your hands up in the air
If you love sex -- I know you're out there
Safe sex that is
Ya gotta be careful with this '88 sex biz
But that's another song
Girls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys, move in on that butt and say
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck2Embed
