High Rollers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Speed of life: fast
It's like walking barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick, decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition: street player, you know what I mean
The high rollers (x2)
[Verse 2]
People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game that's why y'all boast
Because you're high priced, high speed, high post
High roller

[Verse 3]
Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits
Hair always fresh, eel-skin boots
Large hearts â€“ though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' Pusherman
Yes, their fashion's high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Gucci's, not the swap meet
Eat very well, much clientele
And whatever you need, they probably sell
The high rollers

Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers

[Verse 5]
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
Yes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own, choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right?
You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller
You better watch your back if you wanna be a high rollerEmbed
