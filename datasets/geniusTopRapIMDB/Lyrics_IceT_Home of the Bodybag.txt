Home of the Bodybag Lyrics[Intro: Ice-T]
Syndicate fool!!
L.A. -- Home of the Bodybag
Ice-T; a young player bred in South Central

[Ice-T]
Colors, colors, Syndicate fool
A young player bred in South Central
Six in the morning, Ice-T
L.A. -- Home of the Bodybag
You played yourself with Syndicate fool
Ice-T, Ice-T; a young player bred in South Central
High Rollers, High Rollers, Syndicate fool
Ice-T, L.A., Home of the Bodybag
My lethal weapon is my mind, my lethal weapon is my mind
Ice-T, Ice-T; Syndicate fool
I'm your pusher, I'm your pusher
Ice-T; a young player bred in South Central
Squeeze the trigger, squeeze the trigger, Syndicate fool
Ice-T, pimping ain't easy, pimping ain't easy
Drama, drama; Ice-T, Syndicate fool
Peel their caps back, peel their caps back
Ice-T, Ice-T; a young player bred in South Central
Power, power, Syndicate fool
L.A. -- Home of the Bodybag
Iceberg, iceberg, Ice-T
Syndicate fool,Let's get butt naked and fuck!
Let's get butt naked and fuck!
Ice-T, Ice-T; a young player bred in South Central
Sex, Sex, Ice-T, L.A. -- Home of the Bodybag!
