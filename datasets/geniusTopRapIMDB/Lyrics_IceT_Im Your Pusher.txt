Iâ€™m Your Pusher Lyrics[Intro]
Yo what's up man, I need to get high man
I need to get hold of some big time dope man
You know where I can get a ki?

I know where you can get an LP

LP, man? Have you went crazy man?
I'm talking about some dope man
I need to get high right now man
Why don't you hook me up with a 5-O?
I can hook you up with a 12 inch
12 inch? Man have you went crazy?
You don't even know what time it is
Out here on the streets and don't know what time it is
Man youse a fool
Yo homeboy you a fool
You don't know what time it is
Out here, messing up your mind
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is Ice-T talkin' to you boy
I'mma tell you what time it is

[Verse 1]
Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E, pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an' axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play
You might also like[Bridge]
Aww man, I like this dope here man
It's feelin' alright boy
What you say your name was man?

[Hook]
I'm your momma
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your brother when you need
A true player to emcee
You know me, a true friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
MC Ice-T
I'm your pusher

[Verse 2]
I know you're lovin' this drug as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T
[Bridge]
Aww man, you ain't ever lie, man
This dope's alright man
I gotta get back with you man
Let me get your number man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot 'em up
Cops found 'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean 'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave 'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give makes me invincible

[Bridge]
Aww Mr. Dopeman
I'm lovin' you man
You got it goin' on man
What else you got?

I got some of that Kool Moe Dee
Aww yeah man, I want some of that

Got some Doug E. Fresh
Aww yeah gimme an ounce of that
I want that all night long

I got some Eric B. & Rakim
Aww that is some real dope right there

I got some LL Cool J
Nah, nah man, I don't want none of that
You can keep that man

I got some Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One
Aww now you're talkin' man, come on

Public Enemy
Yeah don't stop, don't stop

Biz Markie
Makin' music with yo mouth Biz
I love it

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

[Bridge]
Word up my brother
You got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight
Ice-T, man you alright

[Hook]

I'm your pusher1Embed
