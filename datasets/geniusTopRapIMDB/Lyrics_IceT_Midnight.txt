Midnight Lyrics[1 Verse]
Midnight chillin' at A.M P.M
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
Armor All-ed tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpin' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' 'bout "Get out"
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool thru his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A
Without a gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!
[1 Interlude]
"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Take you on a walk through hell"
"South Central"
Yo, E, drive, drive, drive, man, drive, fuck it, let's get the fuck outta here, man!

[2 Verse]
We boned down Vernon
Made a right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
"E, where we goin'?"
He didn't even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come?
Bang! Our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!

"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Midnight, time for a homicide"
"South Central"
Come on, man, y'all bleeding bad, man, you gotta keep up, man, we can't stop here!

[3 Verse]
I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' crazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!
[3 Interlude]
"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Take you on a walk through hell"
"South Central"
Y'all just lay down on the floor of this car, fuck the police, man, i'mma handle this

[4 Verse]
When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin'Embed
