Mind Over Matter Lyrics[1 Verse]
It's been a long time
Since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selections
From the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a brother like me
Write a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rushing to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it really ain't
How much you say
It's what you say
I got no fucking time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talking that weak and
Popping that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers
Are now looking from under me
Wondering what I did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my fans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothing soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allowing me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfucking
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I made a promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checking
More bank than ever
[Hook]
Mind over matter
(So you gotta have mind power, like the fellas say)
Mind over matter
(Mind power)

[2 Verse]
I can drop rhymes in twos
And threes and fours
And still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Motherfucking ducks
Should stand clear
Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courage
Get out my damn way
Cause the car I'm in
Is rolling full of men
Not kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin to
Hook the fucking track up
Syndicate's making the move
With the ski masks
And I'm housing the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright
Cause I knew I'd make it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not have liked me then
But I'mma keep impressing
Stressing my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessing
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
You might also like[Hook]
(I can understand)
Mind over matter
(I know what it means)
(Mind power)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)

[3 Verse]
Wise up
Move to the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you trying to prove
VU's max as Evil E
My nigga dogs the wax
My brain's a hand grenade--catch
I'mma hit you with an overload
Of bottomless thought
Reversing all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
When you sleep
You'll be saying these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be busting a check for it next week
[Hook]
(I can understand)
Mind over matter
(I know what it means)
(Mind power)
Mind over matter

Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
