New Jack Hustler Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop

Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this 'cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin' right
Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight

So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a $50,000 dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet

'Cause I don't wanna hear that crap
Why? I'd rather be a New Jack Hustler

[Chorus]
Hustler
Hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

[Interlude: Kid drop in]
Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?
You might also like[Verse 2: Ice-T]
What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis

Got my crew in effect, I bought 'em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin' at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)

That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gun smoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin' with the New Jack crew

[Chorus]
And I'm a hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new-New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Here I come, so you better break north
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothin' 'bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents

Sound crazy? Well, it isn't
The ends justify the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout

I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan and I don't understand
God damn, you got me sinkin in quicksand

But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh

Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well, shit gets hot

Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam

You don't come here much and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, some motherfucker gets shot?

That's how the game is played, another brother slayed
The wound is deep, but they're givin us a band aid
My education's low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me, a hustler

[Chorus]
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new-New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler

New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack Hustler
New-new-new-new-new- New Jack, New Jack Hustler2Embed
