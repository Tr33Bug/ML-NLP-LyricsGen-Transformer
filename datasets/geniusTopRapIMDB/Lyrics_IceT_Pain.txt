Pain LyricsDeuce deuce revolver
Was my problem solver
Had a def girl, really didn't
Wanna involve her

In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up
I'm just a punk low rankster

Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth
My own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell

No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor

But now I'm on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crime-smart, searching hard
For some new street tricks

I think I'll join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name
You might also likeFresh sneakers, silk shirts
24/7 work
Nine-to-five to survive?
You gotta be a jerk!

I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me? At Micky D's?
It wouldn't work, no way

I'm a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer

Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras

My bank's bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years

But I'm unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money, true wealth
My eternal quest
I hustle all night long
There ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Blood's on my chest

I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend!
My boy had me set up!
This wound would never mend

No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her

Got a light sunburn
From too much pool-side sittin'
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there ain't no quittin'

Mind's in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie--
Got a female overload

Young street messiah
Professional liar
19, got a Benz
21, I'll retire

Crazy money it ain't funny
Suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door
That didn't even knock!

Task force boomin'
Doggin' my crib out
Can't shout!
F.B.I.'s got a gun in my mouth

Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress
And was lookin' for more

Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max!
When they seem my money kickin' it
In twenty-G stacks

Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue--
Some that I couldn't pronounce!

They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin' out with a crook

She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the city's health

The sweat of hustler's greed
Is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x5)

Yeah, that ain't nothin'!
Cause when I get outta here, I'mma get right back in the money
Cause they don't know that I know what time it is, ya see
I done learned something. I did half my time, but I can learn more when I was in here
And I'mma go right back out and get paid, you understand what I'm sayin'? Cause I did half my time. Word!
I only got nine years left
