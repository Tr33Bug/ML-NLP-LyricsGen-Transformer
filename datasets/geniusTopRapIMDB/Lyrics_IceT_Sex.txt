Sex Lyrics[Intro Ice-T, DJ Evil E, Ice-T & DJ Evil E]
One-two, one-two, in the place to be, my name is MC Ice-T
And my name is DJ Evil E
And on the beat rocks, the man, there's none hotter
Son of Bambaataa, prince of charm, Afrika Islam, oh yeah
But wait a minute, E, what's up with this girl right here?
Oh, man, she look pretty down, man (Oh baby, baby, baby)
I think that's what I want (Baby, baby, that's what I want)
Sex in the morning, sex at night
Sex in the afternoon's alright
Ain't a man on Earth that can stay alive
Without a sex drive
[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex
Sex
See (Uh)

[Verse 1: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MCs was on the bite
Bitin' all my rhymes, stealin' my style
Bitin' on the Ice like a crocodile
You know I rock so hard, it wasn't true
Won the virgin girl and her mama too

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex (That's what I want)
Sex (Oh, yeah)
Sex

[Verse 2: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young girlies wanna take me home
Party's over, take me to the house
Throw me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say, "Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes, your thighs, your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriend's name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move, I can't forget
I came and came, I came again
Felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars, my jewels, my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight, fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match Ice-T"

Sex
Sex (That's what she wanted)
Sex
Sex

[Verse 3: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Then she turned out the lights, threw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
All at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best, the Ice-T chill
Startin' with the tongue up on the back of my leg
You didn't stop 'til I hollered, screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over, took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex
Sex (That's what I want, yeah, brother)
Sex (Oh)

[Verse 4: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
I put it in they blouse or in they bra
In their little panties that they boyfriend saw
Send it through the mini skirt, up their thigh
Deep, deep girls, I wanna make you cry
Move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm in around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth, girl, no joke
I take it out, girl, don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack
I put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat, the only way to dance
[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E]
Sex
