Straight Up Nigga Lyrics[Intro]
Yo check this out
A lot of people get mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what I'm saying they don't like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you a black man I tell em I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'm a say what I wanna say I call myself what I wanna call myself
You know what I'm saying
So they can stay off my dick

[1 Verse]
Damn right I'm a nigga
And I don't care what you are
Cause I'm a capital N-I double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad
Cause they don't see
That they're looked upon
As a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Coloured man
Or a Black, or a Negro
Or Afro American, I'm all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud
Well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner
I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish
But I'm badder and bigger
And most of all
I'm a straight up nigga
That's right I'm a nigga

My man Lord Finesse is my motherfucking nigga
You know Evil E's my nigga, Islam's my nigga
That's right they're my niggas

[2 Verse]
I'm a nigga in America
And that much I flaunt
Cause when I see what I like
Yo I take what I want
I'm not the only one
That's why I'm not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga!
America was stole from the Indians
Show and prove, what was that?
A straight up nigga move
A low down shame
Yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain
When a nigga snatch
Their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout
From a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hyped
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eatin'
Billionaire meetin'
Cash money makin', movin' shakin'
Corporate jet glidin'
Limousine ridin'
Writin' hits, filthy rich
Straight up nigga!

[3 Verse]
Now I'm a write this song
Though the radio won't play it
But I got freedom of speech
So I'm a say it
She wanna be lez he wanna be gay
Well that's your business, I'm straight
So nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got somethin' for ya
I'm a nigga with cash; a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon chitlin eatin' nigga down south
But a nigga that'll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking best champagne drinkin'
Ten inch givin' extra large livin'
Mercedes benz' drivin' strivin' to survivin
All the way live n' and kickin' hi fivin'
Strokin' rap and happenin' deal doing
Fly in from Cali to chill with the crew in
Rhymin' groovin' fly girlie grabbin'
Horny gun shootin' long hair havin'

Nigga
Straight up nigga
Nigga
Straight up nigga
Nigga
[4 Verse]
Nigga that's right fool look at me
Just the kinda nigga you'd like to hang from a tree
But all you KKK type grave diggers
Ease back fool cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin
But I don't celebrate bullshit Thanksgiving
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twisted up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad iron clad always mad
Fly nigga takin' off from a helipad
Rolex drivin' buck wilin' cash pilin'
Sportin' link chains and medallions
Intellectual hi-tech cashin' seven digit checks
And still breakin' necks
The ultimate male supreme white woman's dream
Big dick straight up niggaEmbed
