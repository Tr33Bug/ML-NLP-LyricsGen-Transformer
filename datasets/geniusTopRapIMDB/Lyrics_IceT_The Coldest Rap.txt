The Coldest Rap Lyrics[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Some people claim that I'm born to play
'Cause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day
I make the goers come, the leavers stay
I make the lovers kiss and the workers play
I make the runners walk, the quiet talk
I bust so viciously, I make the blind man see
I'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream
I got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend
I'm tired of these DJs going around
Talking about how they go down to town
'Cause I'm the best Rapper that you have found
So all you lovely ladies, let's party down
Take all your rapping records, throw them in the trash
Ice-T is the only brother that you got to blast
Hook up the stereo, turn up the watts
We're gonna rock 'til the niggas call up the cops
We rock rock y'all with no fear, and
If you don't dig it turn off your ears
We rock rock y'all and keep on, and
If you don't dig it take your damn self home
'Cause I'm a player, the best alive
I prefer fast money to a Nine-to-Five
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame
[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Well I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad
I'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad
I may be small but I'm willing to say
I jam this party in one hell of a way
The powers I got are hard to find
I'll be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds
They be giving me money, and buying me things
But I spend their cash and pawn their rings
If they treat me right, I'm willing to show
The coolest young brother they'll ever know
But if they do me wrong, I hate to say
I'll never teach them how to rock this way
'Cause back in the thirties when times was hard
I had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards
A turned up collar, a turned up hat
A .38 hustle and I stole that
I walked in the party, there were women for days
And I started dancing one hell of a way
I was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete
I turned out the party with my Ice-cold feet
'Cause I'm a player, that's all I know
On a summer day, I play in the snow
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
We're born to play, and brought up that way
We catch the women night and day
And when I want to, I'll talk to you
And you'll become one of the chosen few
Can't you see that now I'm me?
I'm the brother known as Ice-T
And umm.. I'm the brother whose like no other
Who's black in soul but not in color
You dig the race, and a hit to the case
When you're trying to get outta my face
I'm trying to tell you I'm a brother that's nice
I'm sweet as honey, I'm cold as Ice
But if you say something to me that ain't too down
You'll be picking your booty up off the ground
You can ask your father, your sister or mother
I got a Rolls Royce in every color
I keep my rides tuned to perfection
I got a Stutz for every direction
I'm the pimp, the player, the women layer
The holy dueler, the whorehouse doer
I just play young whores, slam Cadillac doors
I'm the black Mack of the heart attack
But I don't smoke no whack, I don't cut no slack
I'm here to rock y'all, so rock rock
I'm Ice-T when I dress, I never jive
I do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive
When I leave the pad, I'm never loud
I'm just so sharp, I cut through the crowd
I got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days
When I put some in, I got to throw some away
'Cause I'm a player, some call us Macks
With private phones in our Cadillacs
From the womb to the tomb, we run our games
'Cause we're cold as ice, and we show no shame
[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
The ladies say that I'm heaven sent
'Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride Rag-Top Rolls with rocks on my hand
Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have an ocean liner, private jets
Bel-Air bookies place my bets
I own islands off the coast of France
Now I wear designer shirts and pants
When I was brought into this world
My mamma never asked if I was a boy or a girl
First I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss
She said: Your daddy don't rock me like this!
When the doctor hit me on the behind
I broke on down with a funky rhyme
The nurses said, I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint, in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo, please, please, please check it out
'Cause I'm a player, I'm always clean
I bought a Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Verse 5: Ice-T]
Then I met this madam named Angel Adams (?)
She said she liked my style
She said sit down T, let me rap to you, for just a little while
She was a gravedigger, pulled .38 triggers
She's a lady in love and sent from above
She wasn't sly, she wasn't slick
Just made that money real quick
She had a way of getting it fast
It came from dealing in cold cash
She ran her game with the utmost ease
To break a player down to his knees
I said lady, put freeze on that rap, and
Prepare yourself for a heart attack
I took her by her hand, I said come with me
We drove off in my vicious eighty three
I took her to diner, I took her to the show
I took her to the Snooty cause she begged me to go
We got to the room, (?) man after long snaps
So she shook herself and broke herself came up with a gat
She went through the door, I didn't cut no slack
I had her on the floor, on her stomach, on her back
I had her on the wall, on the hall and on her knees
I put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze
I took her out the hot tub then I put her on the floor
She said: "Ooh Ice-T, I can't take no more"
I put her in the bed then she looked up in the mirror
Screamed so loud, I think the East Coast could hear her
I rolled on my back, I put her on the top
She said: "Ooh Ice-T, will this ever stop?"
I said No! The freaking has just begun
We hit fifty more positions before I got done
When we've got finished, it was no longer dark
We had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark
Then she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye
And said these words to my surprise
She said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could
I came here with you, cause I thought I should
I tried to freak you, cause I thought I could
But oohh baby, you sure are good
She said: baby you're one hell of a man
Ain't no better riding than Disney Land
Now to all you ladies that think you're fly
And can out freak the average guy
Don't ever come venturing through my door
I'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more
Yo, please check it out
All the ladies in the house come check it out
'Cause I'm a player with jewels on every hand
So deeply in pocket I control demand
But we all know how I earn my pay
'Cause you don't wanna work, when you got to play

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Brothers when you wine and dine a fox
You don't take her to McDonalds or to Jack In The Box
Don't pick her up, in a bus or a cab
She needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap
You can take her to dine at the finest spot
Or you take her to a disco that's really hot
You can take her home and while you're all alone
Don't forget to disconnect the phone
You can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets
Rock her butt to the rhythm of the beat...3Embed
