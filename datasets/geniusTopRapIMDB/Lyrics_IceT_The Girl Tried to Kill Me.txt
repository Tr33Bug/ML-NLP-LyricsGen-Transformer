The Girl Tried to Kill Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one
I said "Why?", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, "Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?"
She said, "All the above"
[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

[Verse 2]
Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one

[Verse 3]
Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say "No!"
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said "Shit!"
This girl had crazy plans for the night
You might also like[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

[Verse 4]
Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talking about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, "Don't...don't...don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!"
And then homegirl stripped, 38" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one
[Verse 5]
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, "Gimme gimme gimme"
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end

[Hook/Outro]
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yo...yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin' his wife
Yo...2Embed
