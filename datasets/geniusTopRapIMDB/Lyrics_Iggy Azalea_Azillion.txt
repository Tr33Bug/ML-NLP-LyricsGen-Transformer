Azillion Lyrics[Refrain]
Headin' for a zillion
Thumbin' through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Okay
Headin' for a zillion
Thumbin' through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Okay
[Verse 1]
Headin' for a zillion
Thumbin' through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
What the fuck is a million?
Gotta stack bread, home pride to the ceiling, uh
All my bitches say let's get it on
One time for my bitches that can get it on
Represent for the ladies that be working
Who we schooling? Who you ruling?
Pussy power, 'til I'm passin' on
Uh, six feet to the dead beats
Six feet to those that don't understand me
Six feet to the lame dudes talkin' who scared to put a ring on it
Yeah, you know you hear me
Listen up this is therapy
There is no one ahead of me
A hundred bad chicks are backin' me
Uh, the rest of y'all are just nominees

[Pre-Chorus]
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point 'em out, every penny, penny
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point 'em out, every penny, penny
You might also like[Chorus]
Now what's a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi, keep it trillion
We lookin' pretty in the building
Lookin' like a trillion
Feelin' like a zillion
Now what's a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi, keep it trillion
We lookin' pretty in the building
Lookin' like a trillion
Feelin' like a zillion

[Verse 2]
This is when I kill it, when I flip it
When I get it on
Money got a flip it, get my spendin' on
Fuck 'em with the silvers and golds
I'm gettin' commas and O's like cheerios needs to get a song
Uh, who tryna get it, tryna get it with me?
From December to the motherfuckin' Igguary
Body bags puttin' covers in the cemetery
New Classic just the preliminary
This a rap bitch obituary
Pop queen, many weeks on the chart, it's scary
Got my squad no time for a little fairy
Raw shit, salmonella, gotta fuckin' bury
Legendary, kept it hustling, go for nothing, it was temporary
Seen it all before it happened I'm a visionary
Now the game, that's mine, it's necessary
[Pre-Chorus]
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point 'em out, every penny, penny
Who tryna get it, tryna get it with me
If I can do it you can get it with me
Guacamole, come and get it with me
Point 'em out, every penny, penny

[Chorus]
Now what's a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi, keep it trillion
We lookin' pretty in the building
Lookin' like a trillion
Feelin' like a zillion
Now what's a milli to a billion?
Forget a billi, keep it trillion
We lookin' pretty in the building
Lookin' like a trillion
Feelin' like a zillion
Feelin' like a zillion

[Refrain]
Headin' for a zillion
Thumbin' through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
Headin' for a zillion
Thumbin' through a billion
Gotta keep it trillion
What is a million?
What is a million?

[Outro]
Listen up
This is when I kill it, when I flip it
When I get it on
Money got us fickle think I want to spend it all
Fuck them with the silvers and golds
I'm gettin' commas and O's like cheerios needs to get a song
Gotta stack, stack, stack, stack bread
Gettin' commas and O's O-O-O-O-O
