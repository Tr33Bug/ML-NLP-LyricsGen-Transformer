[Verse 1:]
I got twenty racks on my new jeans
I got ten more in my blue jeans
I walk in and I turn up, pimp tight like I'm permed up
I heard broke bitches talkin' like they rollin' like us
Man, these bitches sound shermed up
And these bitches be mad at us 'cause these bitches so down to fuck
Claim that shit, I can bang that shit
Fuck me, fuck a team, I'mma train that bitch
I hope you ain't wife that bitch
Cause I know a couple homies that'll pipe that bitch
Lifestyle flashy like a Nikon pic
And your bitch chose me cause you walk out with
My ass thick and my drinks mixed, say I'm sick, I say no shit
Better fo' drip, and that's a fo' sip and all my flows is slow piff
Closed case, I'm killin' shit, heard your flow, I'm not feeling shit
My brand right and I'm on one and these bitches don't want none
(These bitches don't want none)
(These bitches don't want none)
[Hook:]
I shine bright cause I grind, bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my time
I shine bright cause I grind, bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my time
I shine bright cause I grind, bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my time
I shine bright cause I grind, bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my timeYou might also like7Embed
