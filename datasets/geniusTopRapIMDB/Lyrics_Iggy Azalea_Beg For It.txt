Beg For It Lyrics[Intro: MØ]
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, (Oh) but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous (Shake, shake)
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing 'em on purpose
I-G-G-Y, did she just have to do it?
Baby, ride with me, fly living, there ain't nothing to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Yeah, my bake on, cake long, that's automatic
[Chorus: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
P-p-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour (Right)
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours  (Right)
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that
Now Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me (Ay)
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

[Chorus: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
(Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh)
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
(Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh (Oh ayy oh) nuh-uh

[Chorus: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Outro: MØ (and Iggy Azalea)]
Got you hooked boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
(Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it)
You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
(Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it)85Embed
