Boom Boom Lyrics[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Okay, supercalifragilistic
Ambionic, go ballistic
Coldest summer
Chain and wrist lit
Automatic Sonic facelift, uh
One time gotta hit 'em with the, uh
Two time like a backstabber
Baby, come and hear the pitter-patter
Kiss my (Hey) back-scratcher
Do you smell a lie lie lie? (Hey)
Dunny drunk la-la-la-la (Hey)
Dosie dough la-la-la-la
No time for the (Shh), wait a minute
Do you smell a lie lie lie? (Hey)
Dunny drunk la-la-la-la (Hey)
Dosie dough la-la-la-la
No time for the (Hey), wait a minute
[Pre-Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Shotgun, left the scene
Poppin' out the magazine
Click-clock, set it off
Real ones in the parking lot

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
I got that boom boom
Baby bring the bass
I got that boom boom
All up in your face
I got that boom boom
Baby bring the bass
I got that boom boom
All up in your face
Boom boom all up in your face

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Wavy so often
Chordz made this on Slauson
Go crazy you lost it
My ladies you awesome
You got it, got it
Just drop it, drop it
Who 'bout it, 'bout it?
Who 'bout it, 'bout it?
Ugh, nah nah nah nah
Tell me if you ready to ride or die
Do you smell a lie lie lie? (Hey)
Dunny drunk la-la-la-la (Hey)
Dosie dough la-la-la-la
No time for the (Shh), wait a minute
Do you smell a lie lie lie? (Hey)
Dunny drunk la-la-la-la (Hey)
Dosie dough la-la-la-la
No time for the (Hey), wait a minute
