Bounce Lyrics[Intro]
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hurt ya, but I'm about to work ya
Watch your mouth, drop real low
I'm turning you up, I'm burning the clutch
Full speed, both feet to the floor, feet to the floor
DJ running that back once more, time to party, that's all I know
Grab somebody, tell 'em, "Baby, baby, baby let's go"
[Chorus]
Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Make it bounce

[Verse 2]
Iggy Iggy, gettin' 'em tipsy
Tippin' em broads, hundreds and fifties
Pullin' up, NASCAR, black car
Shittin' on everyone, sippin' whatever we feelin'
Real real good, hands to the ceiling
Dancin' we dizzy, we spinnin', we spinnin'
All about money, the night's never ending
We party 'til morning, tomorrow, we kick it

[Chorus]
Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Make it bounce

Let ya hair down and shake that shit
Shake that shit, shake that shit
Sweat it out, go nuts in this bitch
Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips
I see you watchin' my hips
Crazy, move your body like Swayze
Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go, go, go
Girl shake ya thang like you made it, get low, low, low
Then show the good like you're wasted, po', po', po'
And spray the crowd with amazement, fo' sho, sho, sho

[Outro]
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (We go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (We go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (We go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Make it, make it bounce, make it bounce, make it bounce
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce16Embed
