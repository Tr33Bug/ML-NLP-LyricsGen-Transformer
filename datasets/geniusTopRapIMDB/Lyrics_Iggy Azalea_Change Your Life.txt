Change Your Life Lyrics[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & (T.I.)]
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it (Yup)
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it (Hustle Gang, homie)
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it (Real talk)
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it (No bullshit)
I'ma change your life, life

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
You used to dealing with basic bitches, basic shit all the time
I'm a new classic, upgrade your status from a standby to a frequent flyer
Hop out your past life and I'll renovate your future
Then I integrate my genius shit, we purchasin' not perusing
Yeah I love your hustle, baby, just let me add a little bit of muscle, baby
Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up and I up your wages
On a private island, Dolo, where one meal cost a car note
Them broads before me was locals, through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn
Stamped passports where they all pass ports 'til the clocks fast forward
There'll be dark blue shores where they don't do chores, we just get chauffeured
Damn, this is the life, exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand and they landin' on top of all the mansions
[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & (T.I.)]
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life (Ayo)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
If you could listen more than you speak
I get you everything that you need
I'm talking 'bout red bottoms LV
Even Extensions Plus in your weave
I be blowing on strong weed when we ride
And everybody just lookin'
But ainâ€™t nann nigga gon' hop up
They like "Nah shawty, she tooken"
I'ma get you you up out that corner shop
Put you up in Neiman Marcus where you supposed to shop
Hey let me show you that watch
You supposed to wear, hey get up out
That Honda Civic get your ass in here
Tell your mom and dad that you strange
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet
Hustle Gang on your chest,
Ain't no time for no stress

We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors
On acres without the neighbors
We fast-forward four years more
We a long way from piss poor
And all the shit that we endured
I told you what you was in for so

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life
I'ma change your life, I'ma change it
I'ma change your life, life

[Post-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby, I could help you make that change
I can show you how to do this thing
Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby, I could help you make that change
I can show ya, show ya, show ya, show ya...
[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & (T.I.)]
