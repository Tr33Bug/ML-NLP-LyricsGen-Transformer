Clap Back Lyrics[Intro]
J White, I need a beat I can go off on (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I talk like this and my ass fat
They be saying Iggy tryna act black
Hatin’ broke hoes get laughed at
All they do is cap like snapbacks
He hit me up, he said he having flashbacks
You're my ex for a reason, I don't backtrack
Gimme 50 feet bitch, back, back
I got time today, I’m finna clap back
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)

Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
I got time today, I'm finna clap back
[Verse 1]
I-G-G, play with that girl
I'm gon' get on your head like a snapback
Bad bitch, got a bag, and her body stacked like flapjacks
AP cost 21, no blackjack (Oh)
I can make the dealer bust (Uh)
And I could give a fuck who ain't feelin' us (No)
Brand new range in the driveway
Squattin' on Forgis, no shoestring, sittin’ up
10 bank accounts and all of them got to fillin’ up
You gone, but the home girl (What?) is a millionaire (Uh)
Got Ben Fran in a choke hold 'til he tap out
Know these broke hoes feel like giving up
Hey, still litty on ’em
Pigeon-toed, thick form girl, that mean Iggy on 'em
Need a bad boy 'cause I'm tryna go Diddy on him
I don’t even have to say shit right here and I shitted on 'em

[Chorus]
'Cause I talk like this and my ass fat
They be saying Iggy tryna act black
Hatin' broke hoes get laughed at
All they do is cap like snapbacks
He hit me up, he said he having flashbacks
You're my ex for a reason, I don't backtrack
Gimme 50 feet bitch, back, back
I got time today, I'm finna clap back
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
I got time today, I'm finna clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)

They call me racist
Only thing I like is green and blue faces
None of my exes could say that I'm crazy
We not the same, baby, you shop at Macy's
Take a pic and then go say that we date
If they don't got a story, I swear they gon' make it
No more questions, I ain't giving no statements
The shots I send back do not come with a chaser
Heard 'em say that I got dropped from the label
But that did not happen, please stop all that capping
I'm clapping, I'm off now, I own all my masters
My downfall, they pray on that shit like a pastor
I love all my haters, I'm being sarcastic
I left, but I'm 'bout to bounce back like elastic
Fuck all these other bitches, I'm the baddest
From now on, you can call me Iggy the savage

[Chorus]
'Cause I talk like this and my ass fat
They be saying Iggy tryna act black
Hatin' broke hoes get laughed at
All they do is cap like snapbacks
He hit me up, he said he having flashbacks
You're my ex for a reason, I don't backtrack
Gimme 50 feet bitch, back, back
I got time today, I'm finna clap back
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
I got time today, I'm finna clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Ooh)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
Clap back (Ooh), clap back (Yeah)
I got time today, I'm finna clap back
[Outro]
