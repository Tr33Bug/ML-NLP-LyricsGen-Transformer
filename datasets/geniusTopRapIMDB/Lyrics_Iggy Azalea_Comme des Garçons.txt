Comme des Garçons Lyrics[Intro]
Rico's going crazy again

[Chorus]
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that's Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that’s Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
[Post-Chorus]
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce

[Verse 1]
One more shot of 1942 would have me nice
If I threw all my jewelry, you'd be skatin' on this ice
I'm VIP, you not important, you get no invite
I do every bit of two hunnid, runnin' red lights
Hit a right
You not the one for me, can't hit this twice
They always come for me, I win in spite
Ain't no man ever said I'm not his type
Bitch, I'm piped, pussy tight
Expensive taste, big appetite
If you hate me, bitch, get your life
Them hunnids stacked high got me hyped
No lie, I get anything I like

[Chorus]
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that's Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that's Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce

I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce

[Verse 2]
I got drip, I got sauce, you not real, you knock off
I work hard, no time off, won't climb off my high horse
Don't test me, I'm not soft, swing at you like Top Golf
It's me, myself and I-G-G-Y, I'm my boss
These lights make my eyes clear, on point like spiked hair
I'm not your average white girl, got a Big Apple like Times Square
Talk shit, but when I come around, they get quiet like the library
Bad Dreams, LLC, we give these hoes nightmares
Look at the top, I'm right there, and I don't plan on leavin' (Leavin')
This how I spend my evenin' (Evenin')
I made 'em shut down Neiman's
Yeah, anytime I post a pic, they go nuts like semen
Girl, whenever they see me, I kill it and have 'em grieving
'Cause my

[Chorus]
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that's Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
Outfit by Dior, this hot bitch on all fours
I got bands, a lot more, I'm dripping in all sauce
Shoes, they got hearts on, that's Comme des Garçons
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
[Post-Chorus]
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce
I got drip, I got sauce, I got drip, I got sauce4Embed
