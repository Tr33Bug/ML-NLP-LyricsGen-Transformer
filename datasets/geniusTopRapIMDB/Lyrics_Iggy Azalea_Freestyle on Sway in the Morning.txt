Freestyle on Sway in the Morning LyricsYou got a house on a hill
Sits in the valley
Said he tryna move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride, cuz I don't want us overlappin'
She spendin' money on MAC, that's cute
I get checks from them in Paris
Better check my tax bracket
What you think was gon happen
Naggin, now he's leavin'
And y'all broke up like madmen
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch
She no house wife, just desperate
And I know you tryna let it go but accept it
Cuz the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
And we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down yo party
Man, his and her gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon hate, she gon have somethin' to say
When I hop out his new whip, fresh in some new shit
Damn she is too thick, who is this
Yeah, I'm his new bitchYou might also like2Embed
