Iam The Stripclub Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hit it one time, two times? Too live
Laying poolside and it made me woosah
Too fine do ya own thing, I'ma do mine
I'm on Cloud 9 'cause the vibe too high
Fat ass, lap dance, pop it on a handstand
Big bags, big cash
Hit a hundred car fast, don't crash
If you ain't ready, don't ask
Talk a big game, but I know you won't last
Keep the dollars on me, keep designer on me
Man start trippin', I'ma find a homie
Swear he Ginuwine, tryna ride the pony
Face get exposed, you can't hide the phoney, you know
Top of the line bitch, numero uno
New coupe, two door, two high, Pluto
Trippin', said he wanna kick it like judo
Miss him, Iggy been pimpin', listen
[Chorus]
Don't need dark rooms (I am the strip club)
Don't need red lights (I am the strip club)
I do the lap dance (I ride the pole up)
I am the, the strip club
Don't want your love, don't want your problems
Just need all of, all of your dollars
I do the lap dance, I ride the pole up

[Post-Chorus]
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club

[Verse 2]
I woke up like a bad-ass bitch
Pretty face with some perfect tits
Called my job, told 'em suck my dick
Send my cheque, I'm not clockin' in
Dick magnet, who's askin'?
Big Birkin, put cash in
Hold my bag, I'm 'bout to get ratchet
Get ghost and twerk on a Phantom
Like when girls come back from vacation
Brand new ass she use to get payments
Use her mouth for more than just statements
Wanna be rich, she don't wanna be famous
Run it back, yeah, let's do it over
Wanted dick, but I lost composure
2PM on the Rum and Cola
Sloppy drunk, but I do it sober
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't need dark rooms (I am the strip club)
Don't need red lights (I am the strip club)
I do the lap dance (I ride the pole up)
I am the, the strip club
Don't want your love, don't want your problems
Just need all of, all of your dollars
I do the lap dance, I ride the pole up

[Post-Chorus]
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club

[Bridge]
Don't wait for the night time (No)
We can get dirty in the daylight (Go)
Watch sweat drip from my waistline (Oh)
Four shots deep, it's playtime (Yeah)

[Non-Lyrical Break]

[Chorus]
Don't need dark rooms (I am the strip club)
Don't need red lights (I am the strip club)
I do the lap dance (I ride the pole up)
I am the, the strip club
Don't want your love, don't want your problems
Just need all of, all of your dollars
I do the lap dance, I ride the pole up
[Post-Chorus]
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club
I am the, the strip club5Embed
