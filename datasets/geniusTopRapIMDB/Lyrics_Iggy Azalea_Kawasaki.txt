TranslationsEspa√±olKawasaki Lyrics[Chorus]
They tellin' me be humble, but they know I'm cocky
Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me
He wanna pop a wheelie, ride him like a Kawasaki
Big Phantom grill, cook the streets like hibachi
I'm sippin' sake, I'm raw like ahi
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby?
He wanna pop a wheelie, ride him like a Kawasaki

[Verse 1]
Ah, I'm goin' live, sit down and watch me
You're rockin' Jordans but you're Dennis Rodman
I used to get the chicken fingers, now I get the lobster
Or I get the pasta, yeah, all my bitches mobbin'
Halloween team, fame turned me to a monster
I make him fight for the pussy, I'm Ronda Rousey
Playin' hard to get, ring around the rosey
If we're lock in, keep it low key, shit, I'm going live
The block is hot, bitch go inside
Barry Sanders tryna juke the truth, we know you lyin'
She poppin' pussy, pussy swollen, pop a Motrin now
I can take my jewelry off, still be the golden child
I'm going live, she just wanna watch
She with you 'cause you're rich, she just wants a watch
[Pre-Chorus]
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mmm, mmm)
Fuck you hoes, I came from nothin' (huh!)

[Chorus]
They tellin' me be humble, but they know I'm cocky
Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me
He wanna pop a wheelie, ride him like a Kawasaki
Big Phantom grill, cook the streets like hibachi
I'm sippin' sake, I'm raw like ahi
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby?
He wanna pop a wheelie, ride him like a Kawasaki

[Verse 2]
Ah, I'm going live, close your eyes, open wide
I could act like I'm humble but you know I'm not
You mean to act like I don't know when I know I'm hot
Act shocked when my shit blow, woah
He wanna rock to my tempo
I'm in the endzone, he in the friend zone
If you really on, where you team at? Put them on
Lookin' in the mirror, only bitch I depend on
Ah, I'm going live, sit down and watch me
See my ass tan, I was in the tropics
'Bout to catch a flight just to go shoppin'
This a 1 to 1, what you know about it?
Big amounts, big time accountants
I can only vouch for my account
And who I hold it down with
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
They told me to be humble, so I started humming (mmm, mmm)
Fuck you hoes, I came from nothin'

[Chorus]
They tellin' me be humble but they know I'm cocky
Let me feel myself, yeah, daddy know I'm cocky
Ah, my wrist is rocky, come try and stop me
He wanna pop a wheelie, ride him like a Kawasaki
Big Phantom grill, cook the streets like hibachi
I'm sippin' sake, I'm raw like ahi
Boy, why you always wanna meet me in the lobby?
He wanna pop a wheelie

[Outro]
Ride him like a Kawasaki
