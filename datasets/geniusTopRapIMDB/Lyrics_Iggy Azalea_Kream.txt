First you get the money
Then you get the power
Respect
Look at Wallis
Hoes come last
Oh my God, Ronny!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea & Tyga]
Uh, open up the safe, bitches got a lot to say (Raw)
Pussy in your face, that'll put you in your place (Boom)
Seven letters on the plate, fuck you when I brake (Bitch)
I got cars, I got bags, I got real estate (Cash rules)
Foreplay, I ain't come to play (Huh)
I got big fish money, he gon' bite the bait (Yeah)
Can you drop it down, make that ass talk to me?
Keep that energy, gone off the Hennessy
Ass, I need my bag quickly
Separate six degrees, bitches think they know me
Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, wet you when it's horny
Hit me on my cash app, check it in the morning
Cash, in this bitch shinin'
Dressed in designer, she could get grimey
And it's perfect timing, gin with the tonic
Bella Hadid, homie could get it
