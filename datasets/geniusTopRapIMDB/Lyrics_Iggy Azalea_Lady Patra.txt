Lady Patra Lyrics[Intro: Mavado]
No pussy can come in our place
In our arena, in our establishment
And try talk the talk and walk the walk
And act like them don't know where we from
Like we don't have the biggest in hundred
Ya don't know how we a gwan and kick up
Iggy, what you say? What you say?
Bullet!

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
Classic, Sinatra
Bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I'll be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra
Classic, Sinatra

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Paper planes, roger that, 10-4
Got money, been had it, still gettin' more
Oh y'all in the building, but on different floors
Y'all couldn't see it how we see it on yo tippie-toes
Iggy so killing, so pretty, still pretty
Talkin' hits on hits, McGuire, Bonds, Griffey
Mash it up, bring the queens of the dancehall with me
Pearl handle on the pistol, tell this world to come and get me
And I'm thumbin' through designers to pick which'll fit me proper
Paid dues, climbed through the ranks, but we ain't Shabba
Need me a rude boy, something straight outta shottas
That could drive a girl crazy, all the way off my rocker
Versaces over eyelids, lookin' like Biggie Poppa
Know they thought I wouldn't make it, I'm lookin' like what's the matta?
But tell them money talks, and them man not saying nada
This the new classic, signed sincerely, Lady Patra

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
Classic, Sinatra
Bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I'll be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra
Classic, Sinatra
Bad, Phantom of the Opera
Shuffle the deck, I'll be the queen in the pack
Gotcha, Lady Patra

She's special and phenomenal, body strong like a stallion
She got me wild like an animal
Chop it, chop it pon de floor, drop it drop it pon de floor
Your patra whine dynamical
Billion dollar shape, trillion dollar looks
Tell them broke bitch, read it in the books
Yuh ting tun up, you got Louis on your foot
You know you got gully on the hook, Mr. Brooks

[Bridge: Mavado]
Said she need a real man
Oh yes, she want a real one
So she fuck with a Jamaican don (haha!)
Your body lookin' like a billion dollar
The baddest bitch you ever seen
The one I want to be my baby mama
I fuck her like my enemy
