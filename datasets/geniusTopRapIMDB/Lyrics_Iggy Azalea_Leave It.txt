Leave It Lyrics[Produced by The Invisible Men]

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
First things first, I'm the realest (Realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (Let ‘em feel it)
And I'm still in the murda bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics (Right, right)
You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist)
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back (What?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that
[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Stuntin', Ric Flair on ya
My stock high, blow the whole share on ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, I could leave it right there for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I'mma leave it right there for ya

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
And get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
And I swear I meant that there so much that I'll give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who dat, who dat? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be the I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been workin', I'm up in here with some change to throw

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Stuntin', Ric Flair on ya
My stock high, blow the whole share on ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, I could leave it right there for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I'mma leave it right there for ya

Now tell me how you want it, and tell me how it feels
When you ride with the queen in the fast lane, makin' fast change
Baby, uh, for real though
Now let it, pour that, leave it right there for yah
So now you ain't scared, are yah? Still down for me
I'm on the go, hope you bound to get around with me
Now wait—

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Stuntin', Ric Flair on ya
My stock high, blow the whole share on ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, I could leave it right there for ya
Tell me how you want it, I could leave it right there for ya
Aye, gotta know that I'm prepared for ya
Tell me how you want it, I'mma leave it right there for ya19Embed
