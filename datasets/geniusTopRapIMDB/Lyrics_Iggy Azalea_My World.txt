My World Lyrics[Hook:]
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches

[Verse 1:]
Drugs Gang
I'm in the zone
Aussie, hoe
Put my country on
G shit
I'm what you ain't
6-4 dip with a candy paint
I get done, what you can't
White bitch down Slauson, gangstas faint
Shut it down, go and hate
Had enough of these hoes, no time to waste
Amazing grace, embrace the place
Basic bitch, get out my face
On the phone closing deals
George tell 'em next, half a mill
On the phone closing deals
George tell 'em next, half a mill
[Bridge:]
Cotton candy, laced in gold
Stack that money, sushi roll
Bottles up, feeling throw'd
V.I.P, overload

[Hook:]
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
Ugh
Hands in the air
This is for the bitches getting money up in here
My world
Rhyme vicious
White girl, team full of bad bitches
My world
Rhyme vicious

Ugh
Enough of that
Now I'm finna kill this shit
Chordz 3D with another hit
Call me the pound
I'mma kill this bitch
Pound for pound around town
I'm the illest bitch
You see me, be the realest bitch
You high off lines
You snorting shit
Higher than a motherfucker
Better never been no other rhyme in the gutter
Got 'em saying she the other color
Me and your man, secret agents, we under covers
My team on the scene, stay clean on these other brothers
Talk shit get his nut fucking nutter butter
Iggy Pop, I'm gone bitch
Burn rubber
Bottles over here, more 'till I die
Sparkle every bottle, see the glare in my eye
Turned over here
It's the 4th of July
White, Black, Asian, Latin hoes, Middle Eastern
It's time to show we run this shit, gotta let them know
[Bridge:]
Cotton candy, laced in gold
Stack that money, sushi roll
Bottles up, feeling throw'd
V.I.P, overload
