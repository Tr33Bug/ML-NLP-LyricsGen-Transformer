Got it on smash

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Think he got a chance with a bitch like me, he ain't rich enough, rich enough (no)
Calls need to stop he ain't callin' 'bout the guap, I ain't pickin' up, pickin' up (brrp)
Y'all lil' hoes can't sit by the pool, you ain't thick enough, thick enough (go)
Weave so long and the pussy so wet, gon' eat it up, beat it up

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo feelings (yah)
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo' feelings (yah)
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
He said it tastes so good, I should just serve it on a plate
Bought that Wraith fresh off the lot, that bitch ain't even got no plates
I be looking at the stars while my pussy in his face
How the fuck could I fall off? I get 250 just to play
They takin' shots like Plaxico, I'm ridin' waves in Mexico
You bitches gassed like Texaco, ain't bout that bag don't hit my phone
Make sure your money match your mouth before you ever talk 'bout me
And if you want me to pull up, just know I'ma need a fee (yah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Think he got a chance with a bitch like me, he ain't rich enough, rich enough (no)
Calls need to stop he ain't callin' 'bout the guap, I ain't pickin' up, pickin' up (brrp)
Y'all lil' hoes can't sit by the pool, you ain't thick enough, thick enough (go)
Weave so long and the pussy so wet, gon' eat it up, beat it up

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Wiz Khalifa]
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo feelings (yah)
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yeah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo' feelings (yeah)
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking on some Sticky Icky, need a bitch like Iggy
Hit my phone up for a quickee, no shade but I'm picky
Told that bitch to ride my dick, she tried to pop a wheelie
Got so much ass, on a traffic stop to see it
I be rollin' tropical weed up
I be on a flight with my feet up
I get on the track and I eat it up
Get her in the bed, I beat it up
Bang, I get the bitch and I change her
Got you bringin' weed on the plane
Everywhere, throwin' up gang (hahaa)

[Pre-Chorus: Iggy Azalea, Wiz Khalifa]
Think he got a chance with a bitch like me, he ain't rich enough, rich enough (ah, no)
Calls need to stop he ain't callin' 'bout the guap, I ain't pickin' up, pickin' up (brrp)
Y'all lil' hoes can't sit by the pool, you ain't thick enough, thick enough (go)
Weave so long and the pussy so wet, gon' eat it up, beat it up

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo feelings (yah)
Oh my God, this shit different (yah)
Oh my God, Gucci slippers (yah)
Oh my God, my wrist vicious (yah)
Oh my God, might hurt yo' feelings (yah)
