Pu$$y Lyrics[Intro: Grace Jones & Eddie Murphy]
Merde alors!
I mean I don't believe this!
You are going to turn down a pussy like this?
Staring you smack in your face
No man can turn down this pussy
(Will you stop it?)
I don't know any man that can refuse this pussy
Will you stop saying pussy? People are eating in here
Pussy, pussy, pussy, puss-y!
Pussy, puss-puss, pussy!
Trying to find our cat
Where is that cat?
[Refrain]
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
D.R.U.G.S

[Verse 1]
Iggy Iggy, pussy illy
Wetter than the Amazon
Taste this kitty
Silly Billy popping pilly's
Smoke it like a Swisher
Lick this Philly
Mold 'em, ah! Soak 'em, ah!
Hook 'em like crack, after shock
Molten, ah! Lava drop
This should be outlawed, call me Pac
(Pu$$y, Pu$$y)
The illest on the planet
Better play ya cards right, Mr. Gambit
If you wanna hang here, ain't no hammock
Never, not better, law should ban it
Never, not better, law should ban it
I do it right with drugs, understand it
I do it right now, please, sir, pan it

Left, right, back to the middle
Head on a swivel neck 'til I quivel
Open ya' mouth
Taste the rainbow, taste my Skittles
I said left, right, back to the middle
Head on a swivel neck 'til I quivel
Open ya mouth
Taste the rainbow, taste my Skittles, ah!

[Refrain]
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y
Pu$$y, Pu$$y, Pu$$y

[Verse 2]
You know bitches envy me
'Cause you won't get rid of me
When you cum, I run
This cat got you missing me
Bad boys get a mouth full of pussy aka Listerine
Here to make you lose your mind
Gonna need Sherlock Holmes to solve your mystery
I'm nasty
Baby, what you thinking? Aka Titanic
So much wet will have yo' ass sinking
Treat that tongue like a bullet
Give me head, Abe Lincoln
This is so out this world
But no, you not dreaming
[Chorus]
Left, right, back to the middle
Head on a swivel neck 'til I quivel
Open ya' mouth
Taste the rainbow, taste my Skittles
I said left, right, back to the middle
Head on a swivel neck 'til I quivel
Open ya' mouth
Taste the rainbow, taste my Skittles, ah!

[Refrain]
