Sally Walker Lyrics[Intro]
J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
I said go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), drop (Go)
[Verse 1]
Lil Sally Walker, uh, shake it proper, uh
Bend it over, make it wobble, uh, got a lotta buns
Pick it up and drop it, uh, for the proper funds
Anything to make the profit come, get them dollars, hon'
Add that shit up just like mathematics
If you do it for free, then it's ass backwards
All of you bitches is mad at me
Pro'ly mad 'cause you ain't in my tax bracket
You bitches is broker than glass crackin'
You ain't gon' do shit, you just act ratchet
Play with me, you gon' get backhanded
I toot it up and look back at it

[Chorus]
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
I said go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), drop (Go)

Watch me throw it back and toot it, they love how I do it, uh
I'm the truth, you can't refuse it, plus my body's stupid, uh
He wasn't even shot by Cupid, but your dude's a groupie, uh
You would think it's gettin' evicted how my booty movin' (yeah)
Better yet, I need a U-Haul
One of a kind, I don't do malls
These bitches talk more than group calls
Shut the fuck up with them loose walls
Matter fact, I'm not gon' go back and forth
With you bitches like Duval and Snoop Dogg
These bitches front like a new bra
Don't get your ass dragged like RuPaul

[Chorus]
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
Lil Sally Walker, walkin' down the street
She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me
I said go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), stop (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go)
Do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go)
Go on, girl, do yo thang (Go), do yo thang (Go), drop (Go)
[Outro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go (Do yo thang, stop)
Go, go, go
Go, go, go (Do yo thang, drop)86Embed
