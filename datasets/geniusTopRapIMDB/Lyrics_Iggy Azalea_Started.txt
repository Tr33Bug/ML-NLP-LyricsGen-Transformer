TranslationsEspañolStarted Lyrics[Chorus]
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain’t looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain’t looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip

[Verse 1]
Ayy, bitch, they lookin' at me, they not lookin' at you
I don't mean to be rude, I'm a ten, you a two
He be blowin' me up like a fuckin' balloon
I just tell him give me space like the man on the moon
You know that I’m the best, is that why you depressed?
Say you gettin’ a check, girl, you be frontin' like breasts
I look good for myself, I got no one to impress
You better ask your GPS, I ain’t the one to address
Lil' bitch, look
[Chorus]
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin’, now you love my drip
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip

[Verse 2]
Do you hate that you love me or do you love that you hate me?
All you bitches be bitin', I hope you don't give me rabies
You can say what you want about me as long as you pay me
I'm just tryna get them Ms and I ain't talkin' Slim Shady
Bitch don't look at me crazy or you'll be pushin' up daisies
On this watch, I spent eighty, got me lit up like Las Vegas
Yeah, my house is so big, I'm sittin' on acres and acres
I have never seen my neighbors, no du-rag but Iggy wavy
Goddamn

[Chorus]
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip

Well, okay

[Chorus]
I started from the bottom and now I'm rich
I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since

I got in my bag and I ain't looked back since
I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit
You started out hatin', now you love my drip63Embed
