(Ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh) Uh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh) It's Iggy Iggs!
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh) What you want? Look, look

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy
Shoes cost more than the rent due, you know that
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?
Why you come through, shut down the mall?
All that ass deserve an applause
[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & Iggy Azalea]
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)
There I go again (Here we go, here we go)
Play your role, play you role
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Turns reality (Turn reality)
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
(Ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle (Ooh)
You know what it is when I flex that muscle (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I don't even know what a real one do
Talk that talk, I can back it up too (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter
I'm flirtin', you get it later (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
You could get it from the inside out
No hands, you could put it in your mouth

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Switch it up, the Lamb, the Bentley truck
He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up
My account getting bigger, it's growing up (Oh, oh)
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar (Ooh; Oh, oh)
Popstar but I run with the mobsters  (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh Oh, oh)
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
(Ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch

(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
(Ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light (Had to switch it up on 'em)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh; Switch, switch, switch it up on 'em)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch (I had to switch it up on 'em)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh; Switch, switch, switch it up on 'em)
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get (Switch it up, switch it up on 'em, switch, switch, switch it up on 'em)
