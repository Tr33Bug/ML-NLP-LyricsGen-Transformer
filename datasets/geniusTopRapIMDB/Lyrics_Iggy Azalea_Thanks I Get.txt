Thanks I Get Lyrics[Intro]
J White I need a beat
J White I need a beat I-
J White I need a
J White I need a beat I can go off on (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm the one that kept it cool with all you bitches
I'm the one that’s 'bout to school all of you bitches
I'm the one that had to show you how to grind
I'm the one and only, I'm one of a kind
I'm the one that kept it real from the jump
I'm the one that showed these bitches how to stunt
And this the muhfuckin' thanks I get?
This the muhfuckin' thanks I get?
[Verse 1]
I'm the one to hit the news on you bitches
Debut at number one and number two on you bitches
Matter fact, as I recall, I hit that ooh on you bitches
Counting blues, fuck checkers
Went chess moves on you bitches, hello
I remember day one and every single face that was there
This bitch rare, six inches inching up the stairs
Seven years here, still can't no bitch can compare
And even though there's all these little me's everywhere

[Chorus]
I'm the one that kept it cool with all you bitches
I'm the one that’s 'bout to school all of you bitches
I'm the one that had to show you how to grind
I'm the one and only, I'm one of a kind
I'm the one that kept it real from the jump
I'm the one that showed these bitches how to stunt
And this the muhfuckin' thanks I get?
This the muhfuckin' thanks I get?

[Verse 2]
I'm the motherfucking truth, ayy, if I do say
Name stay in bitches mouths like they got a toothache
I be mindin' my own business, I don't need a suitcase
Pockets pregnant, everybody askin' me my due date
I'm just saying I'm the one, let's keep it real
I'm that child's mother, baby, this really no big reveal
I'm the one that made it possible for you to get a deal
I'm the one that fixed your plate
I'm the one that gave you a meal
Let me make myself clear
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm the one that kept it cool with all you bitches
I'm the one that’s 'bout to school all of you bitches
I'm the one that had to show you how to grind
I'm the one and only, I'm one of a kind
I'm the one that kept it real from the jump
I'm the one that showed these bitches how to stunt
And this the muhfuckin' thanks I get?
This the muhfuckin' thanks I get?

[Outro]
I'm the one that kept it cool with all you bitches
(Cool with all you bitches)
I'm the one that had to show you how to grind
I'm one of a kind5Embed
