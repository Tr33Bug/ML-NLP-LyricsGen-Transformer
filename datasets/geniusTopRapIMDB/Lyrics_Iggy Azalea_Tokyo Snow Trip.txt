TranslationsEspañolTokyo Snow Trip Lyrics[Intro]
Rose from, rose from...

[Bridge]
Rose from the cracks with the rats and the roaches (roaches)
Bust a duffel bag open (open)
Hush money in the sofa (shhh)
Bitch, you know what I'm totin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Came, came in a Benz, not a Focus (Focus)
My dope, the dopest
Fall asleep with the stove lit
Ho-hocus Pocus
[Chorus]
Pinocchio nose drip, Tokyo snow trip
Wake up in Mexico, buenas noches (noches)
Ya bae got no chest (no chest)
Hit the gym, make that ass stretch
Fuck me in the Ghost, that's slow sex

[Post-Chorus]

Fuck me in the Rolls, get the Rolex
Tell ya chick don't approach us
My bitches will chase ya like Moët mimosas
