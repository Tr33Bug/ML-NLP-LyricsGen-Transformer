TranslationsPortuguÃªsTrouble Lyrics[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
'Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
'Cause (Ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Don't you come here thinkin' you ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match
And if we (Ooh), you're gon' want to pay back tithes
'Cause when you finish, you gon' feel like you was baptized
See, baby, now you fiendin' for a test drive
'Cause you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And, baby, trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Don't you come here thinkin' you ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
I got it bad for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position and
I shoulda have never got involved in the first place
But second place never get the recognition, hmm
See what he doin' to me make have to shout it out
Got a hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters

Just 'cause all the girls are fallin' at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
'Til you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me
Just 'cause all the girls are fallin' at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me
'Til you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

[Bridge 2: Iggy Azalea & Jennifer Hudson]
I shoulda known you were bad news (Oh, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, knew you were bad news (Knew you were bad)
From the bad boy demeanour and the tattoos
Ooh, ooh, ooh, all of the tattoos (Oh, no)
I shoulda known you were bad news (Oh, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, knew you were bad news (Yeah)
But I'm undecided tryna figure out if that's you (Oh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, trouble to me)

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Don't you come here thinkin' you ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it (Ooh, ooh, ooh), you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me35Embed
