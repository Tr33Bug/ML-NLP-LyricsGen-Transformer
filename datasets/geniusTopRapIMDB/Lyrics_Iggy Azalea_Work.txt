Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from
[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!
You might also likeYou don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause it's all that I ever had

[Outro]
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit278Embed
