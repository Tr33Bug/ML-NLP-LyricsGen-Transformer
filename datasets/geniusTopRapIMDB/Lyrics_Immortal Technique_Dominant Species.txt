Dominant Species Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, in a hundred years from now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really, all the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what you're ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fuckin' remember that
When you challenge a motherfucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species
[Verse 1]
I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Neurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity
Between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spittin' out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me, ‘cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and you're nobody so what you tryna say?
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement

[Hook]
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite, like possibilities
But you don't have the capability, like infertility
‘Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like tryin' to contradict the theory of relativity
What I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me, like the bitch in Misery
But break out, like a father runnin' from responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea Tar Pit thick, so don't ever talk shit
And remember somethin', nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head, but you can't
You might also like[Hook]
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

[Verse 3]
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggas are too stupid to understand it, like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite, I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic
With anything but success when I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with Kaprosi’s sarcoma coma type sickness
My style is like a ten-year-old child with a slit wrist
Too much reality for the fuckin' hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist
So you can get dissed, even if you're locally gold
Vocally bold, or globally, multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm givin' you chills
I drop knowledge while these motherfuckers clumsily spill

[Hook]
And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet8Embed
