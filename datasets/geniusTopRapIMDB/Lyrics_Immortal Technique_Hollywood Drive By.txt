Hollywood Drive By Lyrics[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Somebody talked shit to me in L.A. and never lived
Cause brown roll deeper than red or blue ever did
I got bullets that'll rip through your ribs
More painful than watching R. Kelly piss on your kids
Here's the ultimatum mothafucka
Give me that *ASCAP*
Or give America Biggie and 2Pac flashbacks
Some niggas don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty
'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey
I fire rockets at generic topics
Your lyrics don't hold weight
Like two-dimensional objects
Cause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat
To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
I won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
For a whole generation with their fathers in prison
You live inside the image of an Era that's gone
Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
I'll leave niggas traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide
And I don't market revolution, I live it
What you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick
Jealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you
Like a child prostitute born into a life of servitude
Until we murder you making the red carpet burgundy
The Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
You're on some bullshit tracks I spit them full clip raps
While most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats
The real Gs stay strapped in full combat
What you see in the videos is full on acts
The streets don't believe you homie
Armaggeddon in the rap game is coming and we lead the army
Rock 'Terror Tape' out of your sounds
Got hostages in pink, this is what they call hip hop now
I keep that metro shit out of my whip
Man that dummy rap is thru, making money is about to extinct
You know the radio is trying to kill rap with that shit
The only thing dying is the DJs when the K spit
We'll hit his CEOs and blow up A&Rs
Im taking your chips like crashing your game of cards
This is how I eat holmes I will give you bars
And take the life of these stars for the state of ours

Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it

[Verse 3: Sick Symphonies]
Im from the city of fallen stars the home of bangin hard
Waitin for them at the Radio City Hall to snatch em out their fuckin cars
Expose em for what they are: narcs, jakes, snake informants
Feeding us horse shit, blaze up all of them
They say hip hop doesn't exist
Rappers talking hard dressed up like punk rock kids
Pumped up by some corporate endorsement dead corpses are voiceless
No one hears ya homie, ya little fame is over
We'll send little homies for closer like bankers cuz you owe us the mortgage
For exploiting the lifestyle that many died, jailed up for storage
Leaving most of us hopeless homies radio focused
What we're building got em all afraid
Gimme the K I'll be honored to ignite the flame
That'll burn down the game, whats fame? Keep it..
A movement.. a sonic war, motherfucka you sleepin
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it4Embed
