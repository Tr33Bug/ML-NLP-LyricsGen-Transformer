Internally Bleeding Lyrics[Verse]
The things I've seen in life will make you choke by surprise
Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
Provokin' my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside
Like the feeling of 50 million people hopin' you'd die
And niggas wonder why my heart is full of hatred and anger
'Cause some bitch killed my firstborn son with a coat hanger
I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty and cold
Crippled and worthless, so I thought that it could never be sold
My mother told me that placin' my faith in God was the answer, but then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer
Killin' her slow like the Feds did to the Black Panthers
The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christian
I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs
The severed head of John the Baptist speakin' in tongues
Like Che Guevara, my soliloquies speak through a gun
Pain in slow motion like trees that reach for the sun
Nigga, the preachin' is done
'Cause I don't got a DJ, like Reverend Run
I curse the life of any man who kills benevolent ones
I never asked to be the messenger, but I was chosen
To speak the words of every African slave dumped in the ocean, stolen by America, tortured, buried, and frozen
Written out of the history books your children are holdin'
Internally bleedin', cold-blooded, stripped of emotion
I go through the motions, but there's no life in my eyes
It's like I'm hooked up to a respirator, waitin' to die
Hooked up to the fuckin' chair, waitin' to fry
Soothin' an electrocution currently used in my execution
Producin' thoughts at the speed of light, burnin' confusion
I'm losin' my sight, breathin' is tight, the evening is white
I made my peace with the Lord, and now I stand on his right
[Hook]
(Death is a another part of life!)
These are my last words, I'm havin' difficulty breathin'
Dyin' on the inside, internally bleedin'
Angel of Death draggin' me away while I'm sleepin'
Watchin' my world crumble
In front of me, searchin' for meanin'
These are my last words, I'm havin' difficulty breathin'
Dyin' on the inside, internally bleedin'
Angel of Death draggin' me away while I'm sleepin'
Watchin' my world crumble
In front of me, searchin' for meanin'You might also like7Embed
