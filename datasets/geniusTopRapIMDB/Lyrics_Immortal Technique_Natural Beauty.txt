Natural Beauty Lyrics[Hook: Mela Machinko]
Their lies can't fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Don't forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny what's natural

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
They corrupted the priceless African image of Isis
Replaced with a lifeless, anorexic white bitch
The fashion industry got 'em in a funny spot
Self-hatred leakin' our their mouth like a money shot
Movie-star Hollywood Babylon fantasy
Bunch of peacock bitches in a cocaine canopy
And if you're healthy they make you think you're a manatee
Look how they invented this Eurocentric insanity
Got your brains washed to the point you're bleachin' your skin
Blind to the truth, and can't see the beauty within
'Cause ain't nothin' wrong with exercise
And tightenin' your thighs; but there's somethin' wrong with contacts that lighten your eyes
We're goin' backwards from hip hop in the park
To the experiments by Dr. Kenneth Clark
So, after the cannabis, I'ma have to handle this
Release the pressure on her and open her like an amethyst
[Hook: Mela Machinko]
Their lies can't fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Don't forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny what's natural

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
The business of beauty isn't a natural model
It's built to be the opposite of the cultures we topple
These magazines got you caught in a hustle, 'cause when you starve yourself your body doesn't burn fat, it burn muscles
And men who don't even like women control the business
That's why the women look like men and the men like bitches
I'll break it down as God as my witness
Remember Sambo caricatured characteristics?
Now who got the collagen under their lipstick?
Implanted Arabic hips, surgical sickness
A bipolar society that claims to be righteous
Sprayed paint an artifical melanin, tryin' to be like us
Livin' in a pathetic epidemic
Schizofrenics buyin' a syntetic body with credits
You mad that I said it, but you know that I'm right
Find the natural beauty and get you some natural love tonight

Their lies can't fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Don't forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny what's natural5Embed
