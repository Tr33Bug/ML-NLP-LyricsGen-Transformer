No Mercy Lyrics[Intro: Malcolm X]
"Brothers and sisters, and friends, and I see some enemies
{Laughter and then applause}
In fact I think we'd be fooling ourselves
If we had an audience this large and didn't realize
That there were some enemies present."

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm a weapon that fires lyrical projectiles
With no mercy, I'm cold-blooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of x-files
Enlighten juveniles livin' life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devils nervous
Competition is worthless like the electoral vote
If you provoke, I'll break your motherfuckin' neck in a yoke
Your better off throwin' your shitty life away sniffin' coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
I'll fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talkin' shit, or I'll make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But I'll break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
I'll burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary chemistry's my destiny
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
When I fight you, I won't snipe you
I'll use a HIV-infected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you I'll force your children
At gun point to bite you, and rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
I'm comin' at'cha to catch ya by surprise in the cyph
Nobody's stupid enough to back ya when I tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And you're a played-out dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher; but Technique never get captured inside the rapture
'Cause I mastered the art of causin' natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin' decibels
Even though my starvin' people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist, corporate tentacles
I spit raw kinetic energy that's immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
I'll break your fuckin' brain down into psychological chemicals

No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me12Embed
