Revolutionary Lyrics*Men talking*

Yo load the fuck up (locked and loading)
You too (locked and loading sir)
Remember break that window when that cop comes in
And blow that motherfuckers head off
--multiple gun shots-- (Got him)
Yeah load it up again cause these motherfuckers
Are gonna come back for us. (We're ready)
We gotta be prepared in this day and age, we gotta
Be prepared for whatever comes the fuck at us. (Word up)
Cause we are living revolutionarily. (Definitely)
You cannot second guess yourself in these days and times
They're gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta
Be prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything
[Malcolm X]
"It's liberty or it's death
It's freedom for everybody or it's freedom for nobody!"

(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely
Immortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily

[Malcolm X]
They don’t want to hear you old Uncle Tom
Handkerchief heads talking about the odds

Technique will force you into strategical retreat
Because I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets
There ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech
When I reach higher positions
Without the recognition of pissed on competition
Cause I conquered their renditions
In a systematic form like a religious tradition
My mission is to take you, lyrically break you
Lyrically assassinate you
Lyrically incinerate your body and recreate you
To destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you
Cause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you
You're my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you
The revolution of the mind that bring me generates you
But when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you
Cause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin
Is to be ashamed of your skin
My rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin
Intoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy
Don't make me choke you down like Jon Benét Ramsey
Something demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily
God commanded me to be a technological disease
And psychologically do battle with the best emcee's
Upper-case the 'T' in Technique
Cause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible
Aztec; Lecter, Hannibal
Rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibals
Your just a fucking animal but I'm the Neosapien
Cause my original civilization was based upon creation
You know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing
I'll put your best disciple on academic probation
Fuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations
And fuck the president I voted for assassination
I'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations
Fuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination
Using my people for experimentation
And if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station
You might also like(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely
Immortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily

[Malcolm X]
Revolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems! (crowd cheers)

Yo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers
These days everybody trying to be a thug or a player
Where did all the real motherfuckers go in the game
Bring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame
I remember hip hop before the mic gun clapping
Cause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers
Lyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification
Your not dope enough, spit self glorification
So don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation
Life is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been through shit
If you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit
Don't you understand the audience will listen and dance
In the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance
To be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher
Why do you think project rooms look like the cells in Rikers
I'm explaining the significance on the reason behind it
They're preparing your children for the prison environment
When you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement
But I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains
Cause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain
The system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory
Close to hell but I rebel as begin to spark an L
And tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in
Because they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape our women
So I leave the system Unforgiven like Eastwood
Cause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could
You should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young
My word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son
Cause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it
I'll make Jesus turn around and say "yo pop this nigga flipped it"
So talk about whatever and be what you wanna be
But don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy
Cause through the highest frequencies in the NYC
I'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's
(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely
Immortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily5Embed
