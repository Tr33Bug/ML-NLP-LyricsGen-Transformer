TranslationsFran√ßaisSpeak Your Mind Lyrics[Intro]
You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind

[Verse 1]
Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied that's metaphysical
Man, fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
To individuals who believe in Biblical miracles
Instead of themselves, 'cause they're not thinkin' original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched with the umbilical
Only a fuckin' imbecile would think they're uncorrectable
'Cause you're susceptible to becomin' more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh, your blood, and your body are dissectable; I'll beat you until you're a vegetable
And wake up in a hospital, covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position with your face sewn to your testicles
Thinkin' that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique, I'm like your soul, nigga, indispensable
With no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution
'Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me
'Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me, but now I can see
Now I'm mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadenin' horizons about what my people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot, locked, or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizin' weed is virtually impossible
So it won't be legalized, and that's another obstacle
But I'm still rollin' up pocket fulls of tropical
The government's involved directly, so it's unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins
That invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand
And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
'Cause I'm tryin' to save the Earth
But you're just gettin' in line to rape herYou might also like4Embed
