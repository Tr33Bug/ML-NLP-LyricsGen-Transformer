The Cause of Death Lyrics[Intro]
Immortal Technique
Revolutionary Vol. 2, yeah
Broadcasting live from Harlem, New York (Yeah)
Let the truth be known

[Verse 1]
You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?
That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the federal government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Technique’ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant
Sniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president
[Chorus]
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line
So here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge
Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!
Rockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September 11th
You might also like[Chorus]
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul

[Verse 3]
And just so conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Lookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell ‘em your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the government lies
Read it yourself instead of askin' the government why
'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die
[Outro]
Father
Forgive them
