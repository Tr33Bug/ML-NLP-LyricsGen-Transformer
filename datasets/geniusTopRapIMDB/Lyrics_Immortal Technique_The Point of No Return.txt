The Point of No Return Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, it's that real this time around
Immortal Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return, I can never go back
Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped
Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete
The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple
Al-Aqsa, the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me
No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?
Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back
[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2]
This is the point of no return, nigga, you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians: criminal-minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone
So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie
You might also like[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore22Embed
