TranslationsEnglishItalianoMotiv8 Lyrics[Intro]
You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

[Verse 1]
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!
[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm

[Verse 2]
Woah, suddenly, I feel like takin' a PJ
(Get money)
Fly to D.R. on a weekday, eatin' ceviche
With like half of a mili' inside of my briefcase
A couple of freaks play
And they don't speak ingl√©s
But the money is somethin' that they could comprende
And I got bread like I'm Green Day
(Get money)
I come around and their heads turn
Used to like bitches with hair permed
Now I like it "natural, actual, factual"
Naps and shit, bougie, still do ratchet shit
Not afraid to pass the clip
Before I make the ratchet spit, blaow!
