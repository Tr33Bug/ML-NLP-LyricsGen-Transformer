TranslationsEspañolTürkçeEnglishItalianoPhotograph Lyrics[Chorus]
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me
[Refrain]
Niggas be talkin' so slick (ugh)
I'm not the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart in a click (yeah)
Can't see my heart, it don't fit (yeah)
Don't think I'm built for this shit (yeah)
Too busy thinking what if (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
Niggas be talkin' so slick (yeah)
I'm not the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart in a click (yeah)
Can't see my heart it don't fit (yeah)
Don't think I'm built for this shit (yeah)
Too busy thinking what if (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (mmm)

Yeah
Feel like I gotta say somethin'
Thought of you got my heart jumpin'
But I can't come up with nothin' (no)
But I can't come up with nothin'
I put it off for a day
I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
And I did not come here to play
But I did not come to observe
Feel me
