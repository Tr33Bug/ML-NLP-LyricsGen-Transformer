Ainâ€™t Nothin New Lyrics[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Seeing if a seven-digit check cleared
All in the connect's ear
Driving cars that come out next year
Block lit, all I did was come out for some fresh air
Big chain, nice watch, fresh gear, heck yeah
Killers respect killers, soft niggas respect fear
Crazy 'cause I love it but I hate it that I rep there
Sad part about it is that I made it when I left there
Sorry to whoever anticipated my death here
You die, they hope, don't sleep, stay woke
The more money you get, the more it's your fault they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood that's how they do though
'Cause ain't nothin' new, yo, what?!
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah, but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, see, see this an everyday thing
No, it ain't nothin' new

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Never turn down when it's on, I'm front line
Always respected what's real, I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin' in life, you so live
If you have some smut on your name, you can't grind
Over reputation and pride we gon' die
When the police asked for the truth, I told lies
And when I finally got in this booth, my soul cried
Once you off the stoop it's through, you no child
Ain't make no excuse for your youth, or no size
See me, I graduated these streets in '05
Still live and die by these rules, you know why?

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah, but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, see, see this an everyday thing
No, it ain't nothin' new

HA-HAAAEEH!
Nah, the bars are still lethal
You ain't the top 'til the stars are underneath you
God shuffles the deck, but the cards come from the people
Speakin' from a place where the odds are under equal (Y.O.)
Yeah, end of discussion
Ain't nothin' new, I vocally destroy any production (woo!)
Go get your crew, put my prints on the semi, I'm bustin'
Grateful, I know the difference between plenty and nothin'
I'm on the block, on the crate, sippin' Henny and puffin'
And even though it's all love, keep your enemies lustin'
Lick a shot off then let two go
Let me off the leash, I'm like Koojo
This ain't nothin new yo, what?!

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah, but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, see, see this an everyday thing
No, it ain't nothin' new1Embed
