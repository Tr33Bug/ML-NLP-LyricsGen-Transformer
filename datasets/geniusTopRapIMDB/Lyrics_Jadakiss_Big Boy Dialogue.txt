Big Boy Dialogue Lyrics[Intro: The-Dream]
All my niggas, get your figures
And all my bitches, work that body (OWW!)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, boss talk, nigga -- start the car, let the Porsche talk
Crib big as AC, yard like the boardwalk
Models in the master bedroom, get your cough on {*coughing*}
Haze lit, kush lit, I move and I push shit (uh)
I could send niggas to war like George Bush did (uh huh)
LV gators on, 20 G footprints (woo!)
Top 5, I could give a nod and the shot fly
I was in the drop top when I dropped by (yup)
You know it was a 2014 (uh)
The work is white, but the money is all green (green)
Big boy dialogue
All the real niggas with integrity
And respect, salute, I admire y'all
[Chorus: The Dream]
Me and my niggas
Furs to the floor, Ace in the glass
Been out all night, grabbing on ass
Riding round getting it, my own bitch mad
I'm way too rich to be acting like that
She got an attitude, I used to love her
But now she mad at me 'cause I don't fuck her
Peep the courtroom like I'm fresh out the store
Wired like I'm on that blow, fur down to the floor
Yeah, yeah, fur down to the floor
Me and my, me and my niggas, fur down to the floor

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uhh, uh huh, HA-HAAAEEH!
I got the perimeter covered
It's what the thugs die for, but the women'll love it (uh huh)
Hands on with the people, I blend in with the public (yup)
Lyrically nobody equal, that's the end of the subject (that's it)
That money still coming, them packs ain't slow up (nah)
They try to implicate me, but the facts ain't show up (stupid)
It's simple, all you gotta do is ask -- they know us (they know us)
Rocking that new shit before the racks even go up (fresh)
They lust him, my attitude came from customs (foreign)
Andy Warhol, Dom P's and mushrooms (haha)
Yeah, fuck it if itâ€™s good, buy it all
Desert Eagle firearm, big boy dialogue, what?

Me and my niggas
Furs to the floor, Ace in the glass
Been out all night, grabbing on ass
Riding round getting it, my own bitch mad
I'm way too rich to be acting like that
She got an attitude, I used to love her
But now she mad at me 'cause I don't fuck her
Peep the courtroom like I'm fresh out the store
Wired like I'm on that blow, fur down to the floor
Yeah, yeah, fur down to the floor
Me and my, me and my niggas, fur down to the floor

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, HA-HAAAEEH! Uhh, yeah
Yo, my dialogue is Domiere
Red bottoms and mamis that wear Cartiers (mami)
Racks in the club if I partied there (racks)
Bricks from Enrique's little brother named Javier
Italian whips laced with Versace seats (laced)
Got more ice than a hockey meet (ha)
Yeah, we could do this shit properly
You could buy a block, learned that from Monopoly (uh)
Your girl getting top from a girl while she topping me
Top 5 dead or alive, no stopping me
Big boy dialogue, look but you'll never find a flyer don
Trying to get money like Viacom, what?
[Chorus: The Dream]
Me and my niggas
Furs to the floor, Ace in the glass
Been out all night, grabbing on ass
Riding round getting it, my own bitch mad
I'm way too rich to be acting like that
She got an attitude, I used to love her
But now she mad at me 'cause I don't fuck her
Peep the courtroom like I'm fresh out the store
Wired like I'm on that blow, fur down to the floor
My, my, my, my, my fur down to the floor
Me and my, me and my nigga, fur down to the floor

[Outro: The-Dream]
All my niggas, get your figures
And all my bitches, work that body
All my niggas, get your figures
And all my bitches, work that body
Work that body, baby work that body4Embed
