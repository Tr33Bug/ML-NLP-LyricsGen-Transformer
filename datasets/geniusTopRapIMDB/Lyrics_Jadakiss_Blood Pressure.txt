Blood Pressure Lyrics[Intro]
One
The headphones is on fire this time around, Styles
My blood pressure is building
Yo, last time I'ma tell these niggas, man
Niggas can't fuck around, man
Jada, man, whoever, old nigga, new nigga, what?
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Who really the best rapper since B.I.G. ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Kiss in here
When you see me, don't ask me nothin' about us
And don't definitely ask me nothin' aboutâ€”
Fuck it, you owe me one, I owe you two
I woulda smacked you with the burner, but I know you'd sue
And I ain't talkin' to him, I'm talkin' to you
Matter of fact, talkin' to y'all, life is like walkin' a yard
Niggas will stab you with a fork in the heart
And The Source got motherfuckers thinkin' they hot
Like my dope got fiends thinkin' they shot
When you thinkin' of the best, nigga, think of The Lox
I'll cut your fuckin' hand off if your pinky ring's hot
Then come through your block in a sticky green drop
Hop out, let off fifty-three shots
Wouldn't care if I hit fifty-three cops
Giuliani might as well be murkin' niggas
'Cause the time that he givin' out is hurtin' niggas
And all these record labels jerkin' niggas
And you never was a thug, you's a workin' nigga
And you heard that shit right there? I started that
Don't make me put somethin' up in your Starter hat
No matter who you are or where you from
Screw all of that, I'm not tryin' to hear that, son
[Chorus]
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada

[Verse 2]
Don't you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip
That's gon' get the second half of the clip, know what I'm sayin'?
Or be the other nigga in the front of the the whip
Runnin' his lips with a gun on his hip, feel me, dawg?
Everybody walk the walk 'til they run into Kiss
Then they get stabbed or hung, or stung with the fifth
How you think your man hard when son on my dick?
'Cause I can get his ass bodied plus front him a brick
Got a chick named Superhead, she give super-head
Just moved in the buildin', even gave the super head
I cop big guns that spit super lead
So play Superman, end up super dead
Call me Kiss or the kid from The Lox
That'll twist your moms out and do a bid with your pops
We was in jail, you probably won't get no mail
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales
When your CEO know you can't fuck with I
I make a million by June, I'm sayin' fuck July
And I beg you to try me while I'm holdin' the Tommy
I'ma have your body all over the lobby
I already helped y'all, I'm about to melt y'all
Tell the truth, dawg, I ain't never felt y'all
This album, we gon' bubble like Seltzer
If it ain't Double R, who the hell else is hard?
You might also like[Chorus]
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada
Who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss)
And who the fuck gon' bleed? All y'all haters
'Cause none of y'all niggas can't fuck with Jada2Embed
