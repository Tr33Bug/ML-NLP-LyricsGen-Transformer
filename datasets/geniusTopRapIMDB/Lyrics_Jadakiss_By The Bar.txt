By The Bar Lyrics[Chorus: Jadakiss]
By the bar by the bar
Ho I'm by the bar
50 racks on me 120 in this car
By the bar by the bar
Ho I'm by the bar
Iced out dog tags Presidential R

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Presi on my arm shit cost me a car
Step into the building
She like he a star
Couple of bad bitches
We might just menage
Maybe quadruplet just to check on my to do list
I got money I got shooters I got swagga I got hoes
I got work and I got bricks and break em down and I got o's
On my J z nigga I got those 100 pair that I don’t wear
Shawty say she got a man
What? and I’m like I don’t care
Bitch look at this audemar
Ho look at these clothes I wear
Look at this whip I drive, G5 up in da air
All this money I get damn y’all niggas ain't even there
All this bitches I fuck y’all niggas can't compare
Black whip, I'm wit'a bad bitch
With a black glick and it's plastic (Glock!)
See y’all niggas been talking mad shit
And till we catch u stretch u like u elastic
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
By the bar by the bar
Ho I'm by the bar

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Daytona she want me to bone her
Damn all I bought her was a shot and a corona
Smoking on that good you know the aroma
I guarantee if you don’t die it leave you in a coma
Niggas hate they home I fall
I get the love across the board
I got pills in west Virginia
I got dope in Baltimore
NYC I'm heavy here
I got bitches everywhere
You know you can count on me to drop an anthem every year
I'm in the hood I’m in the trap
I can hustle I can rap
Be in barney's, be in bloomies, be in neiman’s be in sakks
We be working with them hawks
We be playin with them gats
Put my young boys on the strip
We been playin with the packs
Never that, bring that cheddar back
If not hear the baretta clap
Your fault you shoulda measured that
Bad white bitch guess where I met her at..

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Real bout shit kick back wit my feet up
All day I dream about stacks adidas
My double cup runneth over, and I ain't talkin' lean
Forgiatos rollin', Im thinking on a bean
Everything exotic, I ball with Resilience
The whip the italian my bitch she Brazilian
Cut color clarity ice game is brilliant
Ferrari moon walking no floors no ceiling
Oops my bad I shit it on the ho
Check got..spit it on the low
I know dat was disgusting but the watch'll make you sick
Cuz the perpetual moving roley don't tick
All black everything call me Darth Vader
Got an old black bulldog I make it bark hater
I fuck with real niggas every side of the equator
Form Yonkers to Decatur
Salute my nigga jada
