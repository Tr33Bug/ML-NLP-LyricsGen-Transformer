By Your Side Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss & Barbara Lewis]
I'll be by your side, I'll always find a way
General, we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 1]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They can't stop me, even if my brakes was on
I'm still (by your side)
I'm always here, nobody’s perfect, life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care
When it’s too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right (by your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (by your side)
Where I’m supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it’s the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team (by your side)
[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 2]
As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (by your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc, right (by your side)
Puttin tubes in you
And you can’t even eat right, they puttin’ food in you
Your body’s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (by your side)
Nothin but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and y'all under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front
At least I'm gonna be (by your side)
You might also like[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 3]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan
And fuck the money, just keep my little man (by your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he know how it's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs
Hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right (by your side)
You know Kiss
Don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be (by your side)
The answer's plenty
'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly
And if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep 'em (by your side)
[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side
By your side
By your side
By your side5Embed
