Canâ€™t Stop Me Lyrics[Intro: Ayanna Irish] (Jadakiss)
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe (Gets even better) Baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe, baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Ummm hmmm yes I does that
Stays hot I ain't gotta get my buzz back
What everybody tryin to be now I was that
They could never stop me, that's why I love rap
Been livin the life, crazy ice
Hit the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny cause I had the +Vision+ since Coleco
Back then, still ain't reach my peak though
Louis loafers, Polo peak coat
Call me, whenever the bosses meet yo
Uh, I drove papi crazy
So the industry never 'gon stop me baby
[Chorus: Ayanna Irish & Jadakiss]
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm a call it confidence cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing they can't stop me
Whether I'm on 5th or L.A. at the swap meet
It's all good cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one, niggas can't guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knock kneed
Got too hot for the grams who got weed?
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six, quick to blow three
Audio heroin so you don't O.D
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy can't stop me baby, uh!

You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, once I start, I ain't 'gon stop the squeezin
And the gauze ain't 'gon be able to stop the bleedinN
And your girl ain't 'gon be able to stop the wheezin (nah)
When she get that phone call from the doc, we even
You could not stop me, so stop believin
Ringtone rap, this is not the season
Punch lines hard enough to stop your breathin
And the ladies'll still pay a lot to see him
I'm a get rich long as I got my freedom
Usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds'and
Watch your Qs'and, be on your Ps' and
Thank y'all all for comin out this evening
Havin a good time with your liquor and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me
What?
[Chorus: Ayanna Irish & Jadakiss]
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

[Outro: Jadakiss]
Uh, uh, uh, Neo, Da Matrix!
They can't stop me
(You, can't, stop, me baby)
I'm too strong, too strong! Way too strong
(You can't stop me babyyyy...)
They can't stop me! Hahahaha!
Ha-HEEH!! (Nooo..., can't stop me baby)
Heheh...yep4Embed
