Gettin’ It In Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss]
Ah-ha!

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Uh-huh)
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Yeah)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (Uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Uh-huh)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why (Yeah)
Because they ain't gettin' in with me (Yo)
[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
You know me—I'm with a ghetto diva, stiletto fever
Jell-o shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply: I'm back on top
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of Patrón, gettin' top on yachts
The medallion's a mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know when this Lock gon' drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't give brains, I told her, "Let me get some knowledge of self"
Then I told her, "Be proud of yourself and dig deep
And try to see what you could get out of yourself"
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all-black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn' if I call back, what!

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Uh-huh)
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Yeah)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (Uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Uh-huh)
She said, "I brought some friends with me" (Yeah)
But I don't know why (Kanye To The)
Because they ain't gettin' in with me (Yeah)

I'm with this bad Ethiopian chick, drinkin' straight-up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian—that straight-up nigga
Now, is it just me, or do them Uggs
Have girls' feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs?
Some rhyme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies—are you into astrology?
'Cause, um, I'm tryna make it to Uranus
See, that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John' name
Niggas tryna figure out, since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year—me or LeBron James?
They say, "Whoa, don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight"
Well, if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money 'til you're broke—my nigga, live your life! (Ah-ha!)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Uh-huh)
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Yeah)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (Uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Uh-huh)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin' in with me
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me
600 Benz with me, she wanna spend with me, ugh
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club
'Cause I got my mans with me, ugh
She said she leavin' her friends for me
They ain't gettin' in with her, 'cause she gon' bend for me, ugh
Her tongue spin like a rim for me
Do what she can for me, look like a ten for me, ugh
Now, shorty is out with me
Usin' her mouth for me, she lookin' out for me, ugh
She said, "'Kiss, where you live?"
I said, "You see the bridge when you step on the balcony"
Let's go

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Uh-huh)
Shorty gettin' it in with me (Yeah)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin in with me (Uh-uh)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Yeah, yeah)
Shorty gettin it in with me (Uh-huh)
She said, "I brought some friends with me"
But I don't know why
Because they ain't gettin' in with me (Ah-ha!)1Embed
