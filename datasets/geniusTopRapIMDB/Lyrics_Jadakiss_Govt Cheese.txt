Gov’t Cheese Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss]
One thing about pain, pain is universal
It don't matter how much money you got
It don't  matter how bad your financial situation is
Pain is the one thing that everybody in the world can relate to
You can't run from it, you can't escape it
It's really a part of life
It's all about how you deal with it
Them decisions you make on how you deal with it will determine
Just how bad your next experience with pain will be
And that's a fact
[Chorus: DeJ Loaf]
Sometimes I ask the Lord, "Is this my calling?"
So many days (Ayy), the sky feel like it's falling
Mama said, "Pray (Pray), you got the devil on you
Gotta clean your spirit 'cause your past is tryna haunt you"
I was gettin' so high, I couldn't even function (Yeah)
If you don't want to die, you gotta do somethin' (Mm-mm)
So many nights I cried early in the morning (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, you gotta do somethin' (Oh)
Sometimes I ask the Lord, "Is this my calling?"
So many days (Ayy), the sky feel like it's falling
Mama said, "Pray (Pray), you got the devil on you
Gotta clean your spirit 'cause your past is tryna haunt you"
I was gettin' so high, I couldn't even function (Yeah)
If you don't want to die, you gotta do somethin' (Mm-mm)
So many nights I cried early in the morning (Yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, you gotta do somethin'

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
(Nino Man)
In my crib, it wasn't food snacks or BET
Just a old-ass TV and EBT (Shit)
No cable, just a bootleg DVD
I quit school and got my GED (I'm out)
I went straight to the block
Started trappin', Mama said she ain't got it
Reason why these niggas wild 'cause it ain't shit in their wallet (Gang)
While these niggas moving foul, I'm tryna get a deposit
How you broke but think you gettin' it poppin'? (Nah)
Man, these niggas be chillin' (Chillin')
Wastin' time but they think they be livin'
Out their mind, who they think they be kidding? (Who?)
Gotta make a decision
Find a drive, then go make a collision (Skkrt)
I would die for this shit that I visioned (Word)
Most these niggas is lames (Lames)
They be chasin' waves lookin' like big phonies
Lost in the sauce, callin' young niggas, 'Big homie' (Clown)
Glove on, Mick Foley, look at this big .40 (Woo)
People got their hands out and never did shit for me

Sometimes I ask the Lord, "Is this my calling?"

[Verse 2: Millyz]
Look, Codeine in my liver, feelin' disconnected
Reachin' out to God, but he ain't get the message (No)
Wakin' up at noon, cigarette for breakfast
Mama said I'm livin' reckless, Yola got the crib infested (Mama)
They think this rap shit lit
Drinkin' heavy 'cause I seen my man cap get twist (Damn)
In my city, all that dope runnin' rampant
The youngins OD before the plug get to stamp it, goddamn it
Henny in my body, got my liver too (Faded)
If brodie up the pole, then that's a business move
They don't remember what you did, just what you didn't do (Don't remember)
You think you know, but you don't know the shit we livin' through (Gang)
Shit, I've been out my mind since my brother died
Eyes rollin' back in his head, starin' above the sky
Santeria couldn't make him come alive
Probably with the other side, Reaper sung a lullaby
[Chorus: DeJ Loaf & Jadakiss]
Sometimes I ask the Lord, "Is this my calling?"

If you don't want to die, you gotta do somethin' (Mm-mm)
So many nights I cried early in the morning (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, you gotta do somethin' (Oh) (Haha)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
They say the biggest part of life is accepting your role (Know that)
And everything is for sale except for your soul (Uh-huh)
And everything is reachable except for your goals
It's just pain, no love (No love), no X's and O's
Had to cover up the mouse holes (Mm), drugs in the household (Uh-huh)
Sneakers too tight, you had to wear 'em without soles (Facts)
Sleepin' with a sweatsuit on 'cause the house cold (I'm freezin' in here)
Searchin' through the loaf to find the bread without mold (Woo)
Intro's done, I'm just workin' on the outro (Word)
Bank account is on steroids now, 'bout gold (Haha)
They know I could buy it, they give it to me, that's a clout goal
Although I'm successful, I can't figure this shit out though (Can't figure this shit out)
Had to open my mind for me to free it (Uh)
It wasn't designed for me to be it (Nah)
They don't understand (Uh-uh), the Union is similar to Soviet (Woo)
If you look in my eyes, then you could see it
Something's wrong, yeah

[Chorus: DeJ Loaf & Jadakiss]
Sometimes I ask the Lord, "Is this my calling?"
So many days (Ayy), the sky feel like it's falling (What?)
Mama said, "Pray (Pray), you got the devil on you
Gotta clean your spirit 'cause your past is tryna haunt you"
I was gettin' so high, I couldn't even function (Yeah)
If you don't want to die, you gotta do somethin' (Mm-mm)
So many nights I cried early in the morning (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah, you gotta do somethin' (Oh)

[Outro: DeJ Loaf]
So much pain in my body, I had to do something
I had to do something
Take a little pain, storms in the rain
They say, "When life give you lemons, you gotta make lemonade," yeah
They say, "When life give you lemons, you gotta make lemonade," mm, yeah
They say, "When life give you lemons, gotta make—"
Fuck that
They say, "When life give you lemons, you gotta make lemonade"
They say, "When life give you lemons, gotta—"1Embed
