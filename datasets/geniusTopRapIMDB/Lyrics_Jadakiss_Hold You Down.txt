Hold You Down Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss]
I Love You! Muah! EH HEH!
Uh! Yeah! Yo!

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Lot of square feet choppin speed is the minimal
Talk all subliminal in love with a criminal
It's all comin back to the pot no chemicals
She can get hired on the spot no interviews
(WOO!) No carbs just vitamins, minerals
Ridin shotgun in the Coupe with the general
Yo go hard for the kid so I'm into you (Yeah!)
Hold you down, that's what I'm fittin to do
[Hook: Emanny] (*Jadakiss)
No girl will ride, like you do for me baby
Girl, I'll, hold you down! (That's why I) Hold you down!)
Them girls on the side! Ain't got what I need baby!
(That's why I) Girl, I'll, hold you down! (That's why I) Hold you down!
(*Yeah! EH HEH!)

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Yeah! Cash comin rapid and chicks comin after me
Here cause I wanna be, not because I have to be (Uh Uh!)
You the one I wanna be with ma actually (Yep!)
I knew you were special cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guard up at first now you attached to me
Got to give you all of me, can't give you half of me
You can take your girl we 'gon move carefully
The hot bath water (Uh Huh!) The meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me
And I love mysel fjust need you to care for me
You done more than enough I owe you now (I got you!)
So it's only right that I hold you down

[Hook: Emanny] (*Jadakiss)
No girl will ride, like you do for me baby
(That's why I) Girl, I'll, hold you down! (That's why I) Hold you down!
Them girls on the side! (*Hey!) Ain't got what I need baby!
(That's why I) Girl, I'll, hold you down! (That's why I) Hold you down!

No need for lookin (*Uh Huh) Cause there be, none, that's, like, you, girl!

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yo! Listen I ain't tryin to play with you I'm tryin to stay with you (Uh!)
Nah mean, spend forever and a day with you (Yeah!)
Never mind them side chicks and they issues (Never mind)
That ain't nothin but bad luck that they wish you
It ain't about them though It's 'bout the two of us (True!)
They can't stand to see us doin us (Uh!)
And I told you, this is what I go through
But words can't explain this no I gotta hold you..down
