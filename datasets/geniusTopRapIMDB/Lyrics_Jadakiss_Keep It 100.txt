Keep It 100 Lyrics[Intro]
What up, Noc?

[Chorus: Christopher Diaz & Jadakiss]
Just keep it one hundred with me
You ain't gotta lie just to ride, being real
You should try to just keep it one hundred with me
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
You ain't gotta lie just to ride
Just keep it one hundred with me (Yeah)
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
If I kiss you and hug you, I love you, that mean you better
Keep it one hundred with me
Yeah (Haha)
[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Some'll love you, some'll use you (Some)
Nothin' wrong with that as long as you know who's who (Who?)
Gemini, do what I want when I'm in the mood to (Yeah)
Soon as they think you need somethin', that's when they lose you (Gone)
Soon as you know they need somethin', that's when you get 'em back (Ah)
Crazy when you know what they want, you never give 'em that (Never)
Better to let her do her thing, I like to give her slack (Go 'head)
Smoke a lil' bit, but she drink, I like to get her smacked (On God)
Walk downstairs to the kitchen, I like to get her snacks (What you want?)
She get on my nerves, but I can live with that
All the bullshit that I did, gotta consider that (Uh)
She just keep applyin' the pressure until a nigga crack (Crack)
German engineering, she pullin' up (Woo)
Time to get out of here, we did the hood enough (Out)
As if a nigga ain't hood enough (Yeah)
Naw, baby, '99 ain't good enough

[Chorus: Christopher Diaz & Jadakiss]
Just keep it one hundred with me (What's up?)
You ain't gotta lie just to ride, being real
You should try to just keep it one hundred with me (Real talk)
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
You ain't gotta lie just to ride
Just keep it one hundred with me
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
And I don't ask for much, so if I dap you up, just please
Keep it one hundred with me (Haha)
Uh, yeah

I gotta keep it real as the song is (Real)
Friends turn in to brothers when they been with you the longest (That's right)
I know I ain't the brightest, I ain't sayin' you the wrongest (Naw)
But the maintenance man already told us that they was on us (Told us)
Thought I had a buyer for the P's, they ain't like those (They ain't like those)
Left 'em in your room, then you tried to catch a flight, yo (Why?)
Deep down in your heart, you know that wasn't right, bro (Uh-uh)
They fuck around and ran up in the crib same night, yo (Damn)
Six pounds of haze in your closet is what they see in there (Haze)
Forty-eight K in my closet, I wasn't even there (Cash)
Work wasn't mine but the money sure was (Yep)
But what I shoulda knew is that it wasn't all love (Uh-uh)
You bailed out and told me you was gon' get the bread back
Your man was right there, he can tell you you said that (Yeah)
Had to separate, I can't do the pretend shit (Never)
The charges got thrown out and so did the friendship

[Chorus: Christopher Diaz & Jadakiss]
Just keep it one hundred with me (Word)
You ain't gotta lie just to ride, being real
You should try to just keep it one hundred with me
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
You ain't gotta lie just to ride
Just keep it one hundred with me
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me (What's up?)
You ain't gotta lie just to ride, being real
You should try to just keep it one hundred with me
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me
[Outro: Christopher Diaz & Jadakiss]
You ain't gotta lie just to ride
Just keep it one hundred with me (Yeah)
Should never be hard to be real
When you keep it one hundred with me (Haha)
Keep it one hundred with me (Haha)Embed
