Kill Lyrics[Click here to see what Jadakiss has to say about working with Lil Wayne on “Kill”]

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
What am I (a real nigga)
This coupe I'm in cost a quarter mil, nigga
Niggas hating, I feel niggas
AK-47 locked and loaded 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
AK-47 locked and loaded 'bout to kill niggas
[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Real niggas love me bitches they ain't never stop
Hating niggas fuck them they can eat a bunch of cock
I'ma move this white shit all you do is punch the clock
Nobody arrested all they did was rush the block
Do it for my realies 'cause they the ones who feel me
Til God calls for me or 1 of these niggas kill me
As far as the rap game go, I'm the Achilles
Last man standing, quit flipping, fast gramming
My back against the wall what I do blast cannon
Pre-meditated, I already planned it
Let you see that barrel burner to your eye
It's assault if he lives but it's murder if he die (fuck him)

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
What am I (a real nigga)
This coupe I'm in cost a quarter mil, nigga
Niggas hating, I feel niggas
AK-47 locked and loaded 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
(Huh now what you say) I'm 'bout to kill niggas
AK-47 locked and loaded 'bout to kill niggas

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Don’t start no shit won’t be no shit
She a cancer I hit her with the chemo dick
I’m married to the mob my tuxedo fit
Now can you treat a blood like a mosquito bitch
I’m the exterminator they call me terminator
I cock this motherfucker back and Arnold Schwarzenegger
I'm still a Martian, nigga, approach with caution, nigga
I'm 'bout to kill 'em baby no abortion nigga
Toss a nigga in a river wearing cement shoes
Smokin' quarters and pounds I'm on my Ps & Qs
And my redbone taste like strawberry shortcake
I'm still trying to find a pain pill for heart break
I'm in this bitch kush in this swish
I'm with my niggas, y'all witnesses
Yeah, RIP to them fake niggas
Uhh, VIP for my skate niggas, Tunechi
