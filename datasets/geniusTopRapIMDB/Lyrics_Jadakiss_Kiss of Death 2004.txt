Kiss of Death (2004) Lyrics[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now and it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin' by with these hell of a gimmicks (Haha)
They act like it's all love, all they love is your money
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy? I'm neither
But I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever (Ha)
And I don't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
But fuck rap, I make mil's off reefer, I'm a man first
Tired of punching niggas so I'ma shoot niggas 'cause my hands hurt (Let's go)
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
38 revolver flow, it's hard to trace, what
[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
Fuck that, pop off 'til nothing in the clip left (Pop off)
'Til nobody in his clique left (Nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard 'til none of them bricks left (Nothin' left)
Stick it up 'til not a crumb on the strip left (Take that, take that)
Make sure it ain't a chain or a chip left (Uh-uh)
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell 'em Kiss (The Kiss Of Death)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
This is Loxville
And even white America'll let y'all negroes know Jada got skills
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville (Haha)
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel (Damn)
And you ain't worth my shells (Nah)
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires (Word)
Walking 'round town, fronting like they got mil's
For what it's worth, I'm one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth (Yeah)
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels (What)
New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels (Haha)
Look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick (Woo)
I don't spit bars or distribute the crack fluid
All I'm really waiting is for niggas to act stupid
You might also like[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
Fuck that, pop off 'til nothing in the clip left (Pop off)
'Til nobody in his clique left (Nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard 'til none of them bricks left (Nothin' left)
Stick it up 'til not a crumb on the strip left (Take that, take that)
Make sure it ain't a chain or a chip left (Uh-uh)
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell 'em Kiss (The Kiss Of Death)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waitin' (Sorry)
It's ironic, but the god was beefin' with satan
I love y'all though, my niggas for even relatin', (I love y'all)
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speakin' for Jason (Mwah)
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin' (Uh-uh)
Niggas jaws is like laws though, easy to break 'em
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm gettin' on it
Come to me with ya hand out, I'm spittin' on it
I don't wanna hear what happened (Uh-huh)
Matter of fact, I don't even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin'
'Cause my bones is old (Ah), gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin'
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened
The thing better than money, is respect
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what
[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
Fuck that, pop off 'til nothing in the clip left (Pop off)
'Til nobody in his clique left (Nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard 'til none of them bricks left (Nothin' left)
Stick it up 'til not a crumb on the strip left (Take that, take that)
Make sure it ain't a chain or a chip left (Uh-uh)
If they asked what happened (Tell 'em its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell 'em Kiss (The Kiss Of Death)2Embed
