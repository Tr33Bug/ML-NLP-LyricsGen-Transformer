Kisses to the Sky Lyrics[Intro: Emanny & Jadakiss]
Ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Just tryna beat the odds
That all, yeah
I like this (So Raspy)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
This is called livin', don't ever forget it (Uh-uh)
Sky is just a view, baby, it's never the limit (Never)
You playin' the game, then you better be winnin' (Win)
Glasses of wine, cheers to better beginnings (Cheers)
The world don't stop, you know it keeps spinnin' (Spinnin')
This sorta like me (Me), you know I keep spinnin' (Spinnin')
I got a good heart, let the snakes keep the venom
Come out when you see that big boy with the emblem (Come on)
And I ain't lookin' at you, mamí, I'm lookin' through you (Yeah)
I can take you to places you probably only could Google (Oh)
Them bitches in your ears, just jealous, don't let 'em fool you (Jealous)
They waitin' on they chance, they wish they could do what you do (Hmm)
Nah (Nah), but we ain't jackin' 'em, no (Uh-uh)
We on the Benjamin wave and we stackin' 'em though (Stack)
Put your seat belt on, we in the fast lane (Come on)
And I think I want you to share my last name
Kisses to the sky, what's up
[Chorus: Emanny & Jadakiss]
Oh, this the life (The life), kisses to the sky (Hey)
A fabulous life, you could live (Uh), if you lucky
The things I've seen, the places I have been (I seen it, I been there, only God knows tho', yeah)
Only God knew how much it took to get here, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Foresight, speak it to existence (Third eye), I'm the boss type (Yeah)
Nah this ain't Off-White (Uh-uh), I got rich off white (Haha)
Even though every body's entitled to a off night (Yeah)
Doubt we ever have one (Uh-uh), luxury, mad fun (Yeah)
Counter-top action, while the water in the bath run (Ooh)
I come home, bag full of money, you could have some (Take that)
Question who? You don't even have to ask none (Uh-uh)
I love you like that, you ain't gotta get your ass done (I love it)
Closet stuff, you ain't never wear the last one
Call Chanel, tryna find out when the bags come
Your friends be hatin', I ain't even gon' blast them
They see me and speak, I keep it movin' right past 'em
I ain't the first (Nah) and I won't be the last son
Watch those that only come around when the cash come (Watch)
Yeah, 'cause they be vicious in disguise
No militia or mischief, just kisses in the sky
What's up?

[Chorus: Emanny & Jadakiss]
Oh, this the life (The life), kisses to the sky
A fabulous life, you could live, if you lucky
The things I've seen, the places I have been (It's my part right here)
Only God knew how much it took to get here (It's the breakdown baby, only God knows), oh-oh-oh
You might also like[Bridge: Emanny & Jadakiss]
But you can lose it all in the blink of an eye
Don't take it for granted (Take it)
'Cause in this world nothing's promised (Come on)
'Cause I know which way is up
And I know nothing lasts forever
So I'm living like there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow, oh (What's up?)
(No tomorrow, oh)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, Maybach Music
Fat boy in better shape than I've ever been
Got a team full of hittas, no need for lettermans
Crack the cream in the luggage, can't leave no evidence
Jesus pieces be flooded like it was Heaven sent
In a room full of demons, how can we make amends?
He took a chance and took the stand, you gotta check your mans
Rayful Edmond in '86 and I'm livin' that (ugh)
Mercedes full of 80 bricks, look where I'm livin' at (Woo)
One eye open like I was Fetty Wap (Bah)
Two Glocks on me, pull 'em, I bet he drop (Bah)
Big belly rude boy, yes a top shotta
Bombaclot, you pussy hole, go and suck yuh madda
DEA got all you niggas petrified (Fuck 'em)
Only reason you testify, to get lesser time (What?)
Lamborghini got all your few bitches mesmerized
I double park it at Target before I step inside (Boss)
Feds raided, so I'm goin' Larry Davis (Boss)
Mad haters, jealous, mad that we made it (Maybach Music)
Louis luggage carry the 1.5 (Woo)
Two bitches, few kisses, it's time to live my life (Huh)
[Chorus: Emanny]
Oh, this the life (This the life), kisses to the sky (Kisses to the sky)
A fabulous life, you could live, if you're lucky (Oh-oh)
The things I've seen, the places I have been
Only God knew how much it took to get here, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So RaspyEmbed
