ME Lyrics[Intro]
Rain, rain or sunshine
I'm gonna love you anyway
You can call me day, day or night time
Go anywhere you want
Know that I'll follow
No matter (They can't hold me back)
It feel so beautiful (Hol' up)
Don't you agree? (Can you give your love to me?)
Kiwi, what's up baby? Ha ha, ha ha
[Verse 1]
Now let's go (Uh-uh)
As soon as they hear the voice and the flow
They already know it's (Me) Jada'
And I ain't even in the game but as soon as somethin' happen, who the first one they blame? It's (Me)
Do your time, you a lame, stop mentionin' my name, my nigga
Why you worried 'bout (Me)? (Why?)
I'm in a group meetin' (Uh), they took Pick from us
Now it's just Louch, P and (Me)
I'm the one they call on, gotta feed the family, if not then it falls on (Me)
Who else?
This is real talk, funeral arrangements whoever put they paws on (Me)
Who be in the Wrangler off road, nigga with the roof and doors gone (Me)
Hah, and who else be in the field, front line 'til the war's gone? (Me)
