Man In The Mirror Lyrics[Intro]
Top 5, DOA...

[Chorus]
I'm on a paper chase they want me outta my zone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone, yeah
Yeah, high as fuck, driving alone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone, yeah
Sometimes you can't feel the hate when its nearest
I can see it clearer than the man in the mirror (yeah)
Feeling down and I'm telling myself cheer up
I'm only scared of God and the man in the mirror
[Verse 1]
Your destiny’s in yo hand inner strength a Conan
Too much time spent in the hood will have u programmed
Or in ya cell writing a kite listening to slow jams
The 2-3 ain't workin' on me they gotta go man
I got the ball movin’ I rock a small Cuban
I'm too famous to deny some of my wrong doings
Its never about what you’ve done, what can you do for them
Family and friends I begun rapidly losing 'em
Look at they name think about it before deleting it
Before you sit down at the table watch who you eating with
Hopefully those ain't the people that you competing with
Too focused to quit my journey before completing it
Wassup

[Chorus]
I'm on a paper chase they want me outta my zone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone, yeah
Yeah, high as fuck, driving alone
Spread the product get the profit I'm gone, yeah
Sometimes you can't feel the hate when its nearest
I can see it clearer than the man in the mirror (yeah)
Feeling down and I'm telling myself cheer up
I'm only scared of God and the man in the mirror

[Verse 2]
It’s a difference between what you doin' and what you tryna do
Price you pay for not being humble is astronomical (sky high)
Especially when you in the jungle what would the lions do
If you can do the math on that then do the science too (yeah)
Move around wit the four pound or a nine or two
Hometown hate I receive ain't worth responding to (no!)
I'm the one that made them believe in the Yonkers dudes
Even though they hated on me I'm responsible (me)
First they gonna try divide then they conquer you (yeah)
Try to make u swallow your pride cause they sponsored you
Yeah, I only fear two beings, (man upstairs) one I can talk to
The other I can see him (myself), wassup

I can see it clearer than the man in the mirror (yeah)
Feeling down and I'm telling myself cheer up

[Verse 3]
684, peddle to the floor
Blunt to the face ready for the war
You already know something heavy in the door (heavy)
Any kind of funny movement I'm letting off
Life is the one thing you can't get a pair of (nah)
While I'm here I'm make my surroundings I'm aware of (yeah)
Made enough money kids taken care of (believe that)
I'm only scared of God and the man in the mirror
