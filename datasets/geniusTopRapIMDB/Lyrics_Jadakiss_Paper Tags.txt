Paper Tags Lyrics[Chorus: French Montana]
Sippin' on that 'gnac
Rollin' off a bean
Shorty on her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Verse 1: Wale]
New whip, paper tags, save checks, spend the cash
A young black nigga on a fucking rap
But that’s some bad luck years if you in the path of a jag
Got much to say, hallelujah I do it
If pussy was music, I would have Lollapalooza groupies
Montana, nigga stay schemin
8G’s in my P's killing Atrium
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
V12, paper tags
You know I like mine in the paper bags (racks)
Cop and go, make it fast
Cut it with the Roxies, make it last
Tread mill then I’m in the sauna
When you getting money you get caught up in the moment
All that sucker shit, real niggas don't condone it
You can get it, depending on how bad you want it

[Chorus: French Montana]
Sippin' on that 'gnac
Rollin' off a bean
Shorty on her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Bridge: French Montana]
Cocaine, D block
Double MG, we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sipping on that 'gnac, rolling off a bean
Shawty on her back, I’m trying to get it in

[Verse 3: Styles P]
New 9, paper tags, Staples Center but you ain’t where the Lakers at
Waterproof Uzi when I take a bath
Mongoose nigga cut a motherfucking snake in half
Montega, ton of it
Big ass guns stand in front of it
It’s only real niggas I get blunted with
I only give a fuck about the niggas I get hunneds with
You might also like[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Triple beam, paper tags
Give you the whole thing, just pay for half
Think about it, do the math
Wired it to my account, screw the cash
Coke is corporate
Give them a good batch and they won’t get off it
Shop closed but they still open of it
I ain’t satisfied till they close the coffin

[Chorus: French Montana]
Sippin' on that 'gnac
Rollin' off a bean
Shorty on her back
I’m tryna get it in

[Bridge: French Montana]
Cocaine, D block
Double MG, we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sipping on that 'gnac, rolling off a bean
Shawty on her back, I’m trying to get it in1Embed
