Pearly Gates Lyrics[Intro]
(Ah-ha!)
It's like
Life is crazy

[Verse]
Ain't no benefits when you part-time
We did enough dumb shit
From here on out, we on smart time
The love and hate joint is different from the chalk lines
'Cause real niggas are built off hard times
The odds were against us
So either I'ma be a point guard or
I'ma sell hard 'til they pinch us
Senseless, they couldn't box us in so they fenced us
Now we pullin' off the lot with the Tempesta
Some niggas traded, other niggas faded
Some are still around, if you don't see 'em, then they hated
That's usually how it go though, the journey is for the chosen
Throughout it all, all I can do is remain golden
Right and left wrist and my neck will remain frozen
Word to Nip, ten toes down and we ain't foldin'
Can't say you're doin' your thing when you ain't holdin'
Movin' that water in the spring but it ain't Poland
Alkaline, yeah, I'm out for mine
I share thoughts with my son, he got a alpha mind
Long as he think out of the box and stay out the lines
He get a nice piece of change and a house of mines
Yeah, it's just work to me, that call is action
All these Bergdorf bags and all this Saks and
All this money I'm makin' and all this taxin'
You get the picture, I just gotta finish the caption
So Raspy so you don't gotta keep askin'
One head shot, so you don't gotta keep blastin'
Before you pick up speed, you gotta get traction
To see yourself bleed is a different reaction
What you want and what you need is a different attraction
End of the day, long as you gettin' your back-end
Before we split the profit, we puttin' it back in
In the name of Ignatius Maurice Jackson
[Outro]
Yeah
Icepick Jay forever
We love you
We miss you
We gon' keep this shit solid
Your kids are straight
Everything is intact
Believe that
On everything I love
Uh, in the book of Ephesians, chapter six, verse ten
The apostle Paul says
"Be strong in the Lord in his mighty power
Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firmly
Against all strategies of the devil
Put on salvation as your helmet
And take the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God
Pray in the spirit at all times and on every occasion"
