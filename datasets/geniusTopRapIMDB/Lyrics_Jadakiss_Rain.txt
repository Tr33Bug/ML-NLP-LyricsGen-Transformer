Rain Lyrics[Click here to see what Jadakiss has to say about the making of “Rain”]

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
HA-HAAAEEH!
Thunderstorm in the forecast
More time to meditate on ya war path
To the face with a whole blunt
All my chains and a watch on, that's a cold front
Yeah, they wishing I come around more
But when I do they don't notice the heavy downpour
Haters praying on my death, on my downfall
They got me looking for my shadow like the ground hog
It's get frightening, all you see is the lightning
Niggas ungrateful, bitches is just trifling
Can't be real with yourself, you're not right then
Different from everybody else, we're not like them
Need the respect gotta have the power
If I squeeze this TEC, that's a scattered shower
Guaranteed that it's gonna touch you
Hoes wanna fuck, niggas wanna hustle
No offense but y'all better D up
Whenever it rains is the best time to re-up
Niggas you wanna kill, family members is ill
Shit that you think about as each drop hits the seal
Crib paid for, the kids get a couple mill'
You smoke a lil' weed, you might pop a couple pills
Sharp as a Ginsu, everybody's against you
Things that you get yourself into is all mental
It's a lot of pain in my tears
Dark thoughts turn into criminal ideas
Shit like, where do you see yourself in five years?
I've always been a superior to my peers
Yeah, and my reign ain't stop yet
Even though it was mostly the lames that got wet
I'm all about a profit, I pull it out and pop it
And no umbrella or raincoat can't stop it, rain...
[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
They say life's a bitch, nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah, well fuck it nigga I'm miserable
They say when it rains it pours (rain)
They say when it rains it pours (rain, rain, rain...)

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm the president of this veteran sport
Make it feel chill like you need ya Pelle back on
I'm cosmic, I'm full storm from the projects
Yeah, it's in the air, you ain't gotta tell 'em who Nas is
Skies is red, winds is 7 miles per hour, light showers
Visibility clearly, no one real as me, cowards
Never speak to cops, only speak to attorneys
Had to leave the block, took the whole hood on my journey
Hear these niggas talking, who they talking to?
I ascended from heaven, I can walk on the moon
Everybody's a killer, guess everybody's a goon
Not every don is a don 'til a don walk in the room
Right? State of emergency
Autumn leaves, Mother Nature, feel the urgency
The reign, I rain hot spring
Nueva York, they throw salt
Kama sutra in female thoughts, I'm stalked
So I pray like it's Jumu'ah, it rains...
You might also like[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
They say life's a bitch, nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah, well fuck it nigga I'm miserable
They say when it rains it pours (rain)
They say when it rains it pours (rain, rain, rain...)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, when you on top of the world, the game is yours
And ya dope is uncut, ya 'caine is pure
The problems start coming it rains it pours
And ya money is not long enough to change the laws
'Cause you figured everything'll be done in one night
All you want is the shine, but the sun is on strike (damn)
The cash comes in then the love stops (over)
Ice in the bezel, that's a flood watch
Heavy precipitation (uh)
There's nothing you can do that could better the situation
They ain't say it ain't safe to drive in (nah)
It's on you how you go about surviving
In the rain, nigga

[Chorus: Styles P & Jadakiss]
They say life's a bitch, nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah, well fuck it nigga I'm miserable
They say when it rains it pours (rain)
They say when it rains it pours (rain, rain, rain...)
(Rain, rain, rain, rain...)2Embed
