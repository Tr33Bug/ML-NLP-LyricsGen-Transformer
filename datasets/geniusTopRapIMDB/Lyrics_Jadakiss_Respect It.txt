Respect It Lyrics[Intro: Nicky Santoro]
If You dont have my money for me
I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everyone in the bank
In just about the time that I'm coming out of jail
You'll be coming out ya coma
And guess what Ill split your fucking head open again

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
When I ain't chilling, I'm killing
So there's no competition
A real nigga with money
That's one hell of a composition
Only costing me five, make it look like it's twenty
They say I look like my mama, I say I look like my money
You can't tell me I ain't looking like a motherfucking million
Played my cards right, now I'm the motherfucker dealing
Got the LV on like a Runnin' Rebel
Duke chain, got cross full of blue devils
No college or nine-to-five, but I'm a grinder
Not the kind of nigga who major in something minor
My shooters like recruiters, they'll come and find ya
Heat every day, I call them the summertimers
Truth be told, you niggas never told the truth
I'm guilty of getting money, and I show the proof
Buy a car like fast food, roll up to the booth
Then I order a new coupe and tell them, hold the roof
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I get mine by the seconds, nigga
Shining on them out here 24-7, yeah
Don't trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and don't sleep
Like the city that I'm repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section, yeah
Ain't no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon' respect it

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I had the crown for so long, can't put it up in the closet
I get millions of dollars, I make heavy deposits
Ain't no if, ands, or maybes, I probably let it go
The one who fathered your style, the guardian of your flow
If your dope is a nine, it's hardly ever slow
I'm in Versace again, probably head to toe
I keep my hands to myself, but I know how to touch you
They say I know how to rap, I say I know how to hustle
Trying to get wavy on me, but I know how to brush you
And now you think you the shit, but I know how to flush you, yeah
Shhh! Quiet money off of loud packs
Watch out for Kentucky, cause they some wild cats
Kingpins turn to wild rats
When you get that paperwork, that's wild facts
I was raised on a hard block
Flipped it twice, get the drop and the hard top
What?

I get mine by the seconds, nigga
Shining on them out here 24-7, yeah
Don't trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and don't sleep
Like the city that I'm repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section, yeah
Ain't no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon' respect it

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Zone as my jewels hit
Dozen bottles when I'm on my cool shit
Hundred thousand on me times two, chick
Woke up in something, I had to start with her buzzing
They never looked just about me, now they react like they love him
I hate you suckers with a passion
Man of the ugly, plug me in
I come to win, kingpin win, I'm mashing
Screams while I'm stepping through
Some kind of respect is due
Chief with the spear like the Seminoles, FSU
Countin' on my higher power, I don't trust a soul
Put all my enemies together and crush em slow
First I need a statue, then I need it dumped in gold
Flyer than all that new shit, in something old
Fuck your statement if it ain't about a payment
If you see me make mistakes, I'm glad to see you've seen me naked
Take a look at how I'm living
Live my days like my last
Last time I was there
There were tables of cash
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I get mine by the seconds, nigga
Shining on them out here 24-7, yeah
Don't trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and don't sleep
Like the city that I'm repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section, yeah
Ain't no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon' respect it2Embed
