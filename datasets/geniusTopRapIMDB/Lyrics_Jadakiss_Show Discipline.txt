Show Discipline Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yo
Uh
Uh-huh
Uh, yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Never will it stop, handguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club with a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower
Our beats is knockin', hooks is rare
I earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin' with beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgundy thing or the black on black
Matter fact, go get your chrome, 'cause I'd rather be
Broke together than rich alone
Clappin' 'em down, backin' 'em down (Uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm what's happenin' now
[Chorus: Nas & Jadakiss]
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab your guns, soldiers ride (Show discipline, nigga)
Kill your moms, kill your pops
Kill your seed, kill your girl (It's principle, nigga)
Sell your crack, sell your coke
Sell your E, sell your smoke (You hustlin', nigga)
Grab your nine, grab your pound (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Grab your TEC, grab your pump (Uh, uh, you bustin' at niggas, what? Uh, uh)

[Verse: 2 Nas & Jadakiss]
We Bravehearted
I had bitches try to poison me, niggas who killed loyalty
Set me up, vested up, I move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and nightsticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killin' over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch 'em, they feel like they froze
Speech totally calm, holdin' dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin' flag, plus it's on the Quran
This on the Bible plus America, cussin' at every car that's drivin'
Holdin' a homeless sign and you focus, you know this Nas and
Prince of the globe leave no prints of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankincense with a ghost
I learned to do good plus erase the evil
And do what it takes to keep a smilin' face on my people (Uh-huh)
I was raised by the apes in this dark creep show, but, yo
You might also like[Chorus: Nas & Jadakiss]
Gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab your guns, soldiers ride (Show discipline, nigga)
Kill your moms, kill your pops
Kill your seed, kill your girl (It's principle, nigga)
Sell your crack, sell your coke
Sell your E, sell your smoke (You hustlin', nigga)
Grab your nine, grab your pound (Yo, yo)
Grab your TEC, grab your pump (Yo, yo, yo, yo, you bustin' at niggas, what?)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Think about when I splatter your mask (Yeah)
My niggas is happy, your momma is sad
If your niggas is riders, the drama'll last
If your niggas is snitches, the judge in my ass
And they said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin' the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder your mans, I'm gone in the mist
Caught his girl after dark, so we tore up the bitch
We ain't care 'cause the whore wasn't shit, dog
I ain't takin' a L or wastin' a shell
I bring the heat like I'm Satan hisself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in your drawers
I'll make your grandmother get on the floor, tie you up
Then beat you to a pulp, say this is a war
Fifth and a four, MAC and a pump, act and I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jumped
[Chorus: Nas & Jadakiss]
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab your guns, soldiers ride (Show discipline, nigga)
Kill your moms, kill your pops
Kill your seed, kill your girl (It's principle, nigga)
Sell your crack, sell your coke
Sell your E, sell your smoke (You hustlin', nigga)
Grab your nine, grab your pound
Grab your TEC, grab your pump (You bustin' at niggas, what?)
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab your guns, soldiers ride (Show discipline, nigga)
Kill your moms, kill your pops
Kill your seed, kill your girl (It's principle, nigga)
Sell your crack, sell your coke
Sell your E, sell your smoke (You hustlin', nigga)
Grab your nine, grab your pound
Grab your TEC, grab your pump (You bustin' at niggas, what?)1Embed
