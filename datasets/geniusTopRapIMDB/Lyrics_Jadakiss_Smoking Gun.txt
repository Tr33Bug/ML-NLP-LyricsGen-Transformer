Smoking Gun Lyrics[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
You're the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know you'll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh, with a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh, with a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh I know you'll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun
[Jadakiss]
Yo, shorty is courageous, going through the stages
Of where her body is more mature than her age is
Far from the daddy's little girl type
Can't even imagine what her world's like
It all started off from a young'n
Stepfather used to touch her and she couldn't say nothing
The more she in held to the pain, it kept coming
Eventually, it scarred for life as a woman
And then he just kept touching her
Inside, that was crushing her
I got something to discuss with her
I'm coming with the tech with the air holes and the muffler

[Hook]


[Jadakiss]
Yo, now she really stressed bad, baby by her step dad
Her and little man all alone up in Westhab
Tough road and without a car, it's a tough walk
Worst part about it is her mom think is her fault
Word get around yall, you know how the town talk
Babygirl is innocent, labeled her a town whore
Suicidal thoughts on her mind, even now more
First the abuse, now she gotta raise her child poor
And that's why I feel for you
That's why I'm ready to kill for you
That's a black girl lost for you
Call me, I'll come through and let it off for you (Blaow)

Yo, it ain't your fault boo, I'm always here for you to talk to
Hold your head high when you walk though
Sometimes the devil's temptation will force you
But one thing about the lord, he'll never cross you
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you
And you still queen of the earth and you're beautiful
Everything happens for a reason
If you ever need me, call me, I'm coming through squeezing (Blaow)
