Timeâ€™s Up Lyrics[Intro]
A-ha, uh, yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
I'd rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or over-trust them, uh
Yeah, them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the TEC will spray
When I spit, everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord, but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over
While you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you underground

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I know how to get my peers off me
Make 'em cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbing your head, you know that he's sick
You know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homie, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi
I'm just waiting on a Q like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap, for the fact of how real he is, what up?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over
While you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you underground

Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin' with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gon' change the game, so don't get out of line
'Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over
While you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you underground7Embed
