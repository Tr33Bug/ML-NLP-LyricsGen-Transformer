U Make Me Wanna Lyrics[Intro: Jadakiss & Mariah Carey]
Let’s go
K-I-S-S Me (Uh-huh, yeah, ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love (Uh-huh) Love (Yeah) Love (Ah)
I love it, when you say…
K-I-S-S me (Ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love, love (Ah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
A yo, the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains, you was there when I was on the bench hurtin’
Now that I own my team, it’s only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can’t let her get lost now, she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understand she fine, understand she mine
She understand the grind, cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever she wanna push I’mma cosign
And if I ain’t got it already than I’mma go find it
I guess I’mma lucky don, and she’s a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones and she know that I’m in the hood
But she also knows that I’m coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
‘Til the first time we getting nasty, ah
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jadakiss]
K-I-S-S Me (Uh-huh, yeah, ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love (Uh-huh) Love (Yeah) Love (Ah)
I love it, when you say…
K-I-S-S me (Ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love, love (Ah, yeah, ah)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a women’s point of view
And that’s why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin’ in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she’s real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I’m from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the New Island, we been to all them
Four-five times, come on, mommy, you whilin’
You might also like[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jadakiss]
K-I-S-S Me (Uh-huh, yeah, ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love (Uh-huh) Love (Yeah) Love (Ah)
I love it, when you say…
K-I-S-S me (Ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love, love (Ah)

[Bridge: Jadakiss & Mariah Carey]
When things was ruff only person I could call was you
Now everything I do I do it all for you, ah
Come touch me, come kiss me
Come love me anyway you wanna, boy
And I’m hood as long as I’m close to you
And we doin’ what grown folks is suppose to do
Come hold me, come feel me
Come take me anyway you wanna, boy

[Verse 3: Jadakiss & Mariah Carey]
A yo, the money is great, but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart, it’s more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Those far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn, I’m thinking that you gotta hate it, but yet and still
You tolerate it (We gon’ make it)
That’s why ma we gotta make it (We gon’ make it)
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jadakiss]
K-I-S-S Me (Uh-huh, yeah, ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love (Uh-huh) Love (Yeah) Love (Ah)
I love it, when you say…
K-I-S-S me (Ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love, love (Ah)

[Outro: Mariah Carey & Jadakiss]
(Take it, baby)
K-I-S-S Me (Uh-huh, yeah, ah)
(Kiss me, hold me)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love (Yeah) Love (Ah)
(Touch me, feel me)
I love it, when you say…
K-I-S-S me (Ah)
And I just wanna make…
Love, love, love (Ah)
You make me say ahhh
