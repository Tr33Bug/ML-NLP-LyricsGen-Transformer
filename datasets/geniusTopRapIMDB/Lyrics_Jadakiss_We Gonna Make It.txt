We Gonna Make It Lyrics[Produced by The Alchemist]

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'ma take it
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking
Nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing capital pun, pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run while I rapidly peel, uh
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it

[Verse 2: Jadakiss & Styles P]
I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares?)
Talking 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard
You might also like[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Jada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean (he be aight though)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
"Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!"
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it17Embed
