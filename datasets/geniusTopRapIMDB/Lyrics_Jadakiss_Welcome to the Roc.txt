Welcome to the Roc Lyrics[Hook: Jadakiss]
Depening on the mood I'm in, I might holla
I love seeing niggas get shot and I like dollars
Light a dutch, pour the yack, take a light swallow
It's funny because my criminology is white collar
Depening on the mood I'm in, I might holla
I love seeing niggas get shot and I like dollars
Light a dutch, pour the yack, take a light swallow
It's funny because my criminology is white collar

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Bow down to no man, no need to stress them
Stand up and pray just to receive my blessings
Known to go back to the future or to the essence
So you better get a tutor or either review your lessons
Dope weigher, yay cutter, smooth as shea butter
Classy but I, stay gutter
And it ain't like I'm braggin' or boastin'
I just don't give a fuck about niggas emotions
I'm well determined, dedicated with devotion
Never a smooth sail, it's rough water in the Oceans
Higher in the ranks, I'm hotter than you think
Throw the chinchilla in the fire like Frank
Money is a issue, respect make you much more official
But you can lose them both from a pistol
A nigga nobody is next to
There's never a drought, the joints just go up a few points extra
I was point guard, you was poindexter
Maybe the same cloth, definetly different textures
I took the base route, you took the pace route
You got accepted in, I got chased out
Routines with Sheek, haircuts from Safe's house
Dustheads naked in the hallway spaced out
I'm on a higher echelon
My niggas do pushups with the cards till the entire deck is gone
You already know we extra strong
And the AK is on the same dresser that the tech was on
Godfather, .38s in the restaurant
Headshot, so you can go an keep your vests' on
Money that you want to imagine
Snowball fights out in front of the cabin
Gourmet dinner with my neighbor in the Aspens
Or either in the jets, can't sleep take your aspirins
Next hot nigga or a has-been
Whoever is in the race, won't past him
Everybody is such and such but on the up and up
Y'all all fucking suckYou might also likeEmbed
