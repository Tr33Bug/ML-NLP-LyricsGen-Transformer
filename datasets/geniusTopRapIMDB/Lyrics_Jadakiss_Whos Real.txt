Whoâ€™s Real Lyrics[Intro: Swizz Beatz] &  (Jadakiss)
He's phony, she's fake
That's the type of people I hate (uhh)
Hey, hey, Jada Jada! (AH-HAHHHH!) Jada Jada!
Point 'em out, point 'em out (uh)
Point 'em out (uhh)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
He's phony, she's fake
That's the type of people I hate
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
Wait a minute - who's real, who's not?
She's real, but he's not
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
AH-HAHHHH! Uhh, yeah, yo
Guns gon' clap, packs gon' move
Blood get drawn, skin gon' bruise
Real gon' win, the fake gon' lose
The love overpowers the hate by twos
All they left was the yellow tape and his shoes
It's real when the funeral and wake make the news
Load the trey-pound so we six up on 'em
So when they act phony we just switch up on 'em, what

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
He's phony, she's fake
That's the type of people I hate
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
Wait a minute - who's real, who's not?
She's real, but he's not
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Who's phony, who's fake?
Silver Hummer, on eights
Life's good, I'm straight
Clap your hands one time you relate
Can't keep it 100, them the ones I hate
But I'mma keep it 200 for the ones that fake
Red and black car on the red chrome skates
Young Juiceman push a burner on my plate
You might also like[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
He's phony, she's fake
That's the type of people I hate
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
Wait a minute - who's real, who's not?
She's real, but he's not
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Uh, yeah, yo
Pocket full of cash, wallet full of plastic
In and out the lanes, dippin through the traffic
We ain't hustlin no more, we doin gymnastics
Couple of flips and then stash it, bastards
Real gon' recognize real
Phony gon' recognize steel, I reckon I will
Expose those who are, if you ain't or you are
I done gone too far, sorry, MWAH
Get yourself a fresh flesh wound or a new scar
Bullet holes all on the side of your new car
Load up the AR, spray y'all, okay y'all?
It's real on this side, phony wherever they are, what!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
He's phony, she's fake
That's the type of people I hate
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
Wait a minute - who's real, who's not?
She's real, but he's not
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}
If you real and you know it clap your hands {*clap clap*}1Embed
