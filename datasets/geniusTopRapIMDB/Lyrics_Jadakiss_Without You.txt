Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
From third grade to the stage
Getting arrested and thrown in the same cage
I'm a little older, but we still the same age
Really the only one to tolerate my strange ways
Yeah, that's why I would die for you
Everybody gonna die
But, who gonna die loyal?
Sometimes I be wishing I could do that time for you
My spirits ain't the same, always got my mind on you
Thought I had the right plan
Up until the Feds amputated my right hand
The money started blowing away, just like sand
And whatever was left all went to the white man
[Bridge]
Then I just bear down
Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now
Damn

[Verse 2]
I ain't wanna do one of these joints so I grabbed two
I ain't have a good night sleep since they grabbed you
On the way to get your passport when they bagged you
I'ma hold you down, you my nigga, I'll be glad to (got to)
And they don't be letting niggas go
But if you never would've had the ratchet, they'd of had to
Shit that they been doing
Hate when a nigga come at you, how K doing?
Pshh, staring at him like a weirdo
Tell him he doing better than niggas out here though
Are you being nosey?
Or do you really care dough?
That ain't something I wanna share yo

[Bridge]
Then I just bear down
'Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now, yeah
Then I just bear down
'Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now, yeah

Hold your head my niggas
Be home soon
You already know I got you
Everything happen for a reason
Everybody on lock down
From DFY to the motherfuckin' Feds
Hold your head my niggas
Real nigga shitEmbed
