All There Lyrics[Intro]
Tre, Tre, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
Dope boy, '95 Air Max on
Came from up the road boy you know we tax homes
You want a whole thing hit me on the black phone
Hood nigga Hot Cheetos what I snack on
Hood nigga it ain't nothin to get you at home
Trap nigga, nigga serving back to back jawns
Rap nigga wanna be a trap nigga clone
Standing in the kitchen with my wife beater on
[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh & Jeezy]
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
Yeah I just ran through the bag it's all there
Pull up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
28, 36, a 1000, all there
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
And I just ran through the check it's all there
Pull up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
900 in my pocket, big faces all there

[Verse 2: Jeezy & Bankroll Fresh]
Skydweller blinding, they ain't seeing this shit
Kenmore stove, I'll whip a B in this bitch
Automatic I don't need a key up in this bitch
Cartier don't you see the 'C' up in this shit
In that yellow Bentley, bumblebee up in this bitch
When I wrote my first song, breaking down my first brick
That was '05, I was in that '06
Had the GMC van on 75 doing tricks

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh & Jeezy]
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
Yeah I just ran through the bag it's all there
Pull up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
28, 36, a 1000, all there
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
And I just ran through the check it's all there
Pull up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
900 in my pocket, big faces all there

Pull up, look nigga make sure y'all there
I just left Walters nigga, I bought all pairs
Pull up to the spot, you might just see your dog there
Pull up unannounced you probably see your broad there
Dope jumping out the pot, like a frog yeah
Pyrex smoking looking like it's fog yeah
You having plenty money she'll suck you off yeah
You having blocks, nigga I'm having plenty guap yeah

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh & Jeezy]
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
Yeah I just ran through the bag it's all there
Pull Up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
28, 36, a 1000, all there
Selling dope by the pot, straight drop it's all there
And I just ran through the check it's all there
Pull Up if you wanna buy a half it's all there
900 in my pocket, big faces all there8Embed
