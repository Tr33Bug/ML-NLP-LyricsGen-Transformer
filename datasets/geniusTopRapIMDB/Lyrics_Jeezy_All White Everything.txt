All White Everything Lyrics[Intro]
I got this
Shawty Redd
Young Jeezy
103 Nigggga (2x)

[Hook]
I said I'm married to the game
She even got a wedding ring
Six white cars and I put that on everything
White Benz
White Porsche
White Bent
White Range
White Vette
White brains
All White Everything (3x)
I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer
I'm doin' All White Everything
(repeat)

[Verse 1]
I Gotta White Bent
White Pit
Even Gotta White Bitch
When I Say White I Mean Whiter Then A Light Switch
White This, White That In My White Sox Hat
Used to Hide them White Packs Where My White Socks At
Nigga Say He Sold White He Tellin A White Lie
Never Sold No White And Ain't Neva Seen A White Pie
Man I Swear To God I'm Being Followed By A White Guy
On Ya Boy Man I Mean Harder than A White Tie
White Rolls White Wheels Whiter then Some White Pills
White S550 Sittin On Some White Heels
Niggas Thinking Furs for the Winter I'm Thinking White Fox
Pull Up In The White Ford Dually On Some White Chucks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I Gotta White Lac, White Lade both got White Suede
Big White Crib, Inside Gotta White Maid
White Sinks, White Towels, White Rags, White Tiles
When I Say White I Mean Whiter than the White House (Yeaahhh!)
White Couch, White Pillows, White Candles, White Rugs
Since We Talking White Just Know I Had A White Plug
White Doors, White Walls Even Got Some White Halls
Bathroom Coke White Floors With The White Stall
White Man, White Yard, White Trees, White Leaves
Go And Get My Mail In A Pair Of White Spike Lees
Yall Think I'm Trippin When I Say I Want A White Horse
Right inside the 5-9-9 I see the White Porsche

[Verse 3]
I Gotta All White Harley Jet ski Even Match My Boat Man
Gettin Them White Boy Checks Ask My White Postman
White Socks, White Drawers, Polo White Tee
Triple White Turbo..."Ooh I Think She Like Me"
Past Right By A White Flash Like What Was That?
Niggas Still Wearing Fruity Stones Man Who Does That?
White Platinum Gold Rolly With The White Stones
Looking Better Then Lisa Raye In A White Thong
Somewhere On A White Beach In Some White Sand
Playin In A White Bucket Building a White Snowman
White Sky, White Clouds, You Say It's A White Day
White Sky, White Clouds, I Say It Look Like Yay
