And Then What Lyrics[Intro - Mannie Fresh]
Niggas, bitches, bitch ass niggas
Dyke ass hoes, black ass, bright ass hoes
Fags, hags, and scalawags, get y'all motherfuckin' ass on the floor
It's about to go down like a motherfuckin' plane crash ya heard
It's about to burn like a bad ass perm
Ya boy, Mannie Fresh, with Young Jeezy ya heard

[Hook - Young Jeezy and Mannie Fresh]
First I'm gone stack my flo' (And then what?)
Then I'm gone stack some mo' (And then what?)
Close shop then I do my count
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house(And then what?)
Get fresh and jump in one of dem cars (Yeah)
Hit the club and get one of dem broads (And then what?)
It's a wrap, we on the way to the house; by 3:45 I be kickin' her out
[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Patty cake, patty cake, microwave
Suckas make a square, goddamn I'm paid (ha ha)
I'm so cool, but I'm so hot, and
I'm, I'm so fly, and you, you're so not (nope)
Show me what you're workin' with just like that (like that)
Turn around, bend over, bring it back (bring it back)
Snowman and Mannie Fresh bring it back (bring it back)
It's Mannie Fresh and Snowman, it's a wrap
Strapped up in the club, yeah I'm so crazy
These other rappers actors like Patrick Swayze (ha ha)
I tried to tell 'em but these niggas ain't hearin' me
Mossberg pump I'm ridin' shotgun literally (daaamn)
Live from the projects, you know what it is
Ay, Snowman, (what up), can I get a ad lib? (yeahhhhhhh)
Get the club crunk, can't take that from me
Ain't dropped yet, still got Lil' Jon money

[Hook - Young Jeezy and Mannie Fresh]

I see you lookin', with you lookin' ass
Catch Snowman in the kitchen with his cookin' ass (cheaa)
I'm so clean, but I'm, I'm so grimey (alright)
So dirty but yet, I'm so shiny
My nigga Kinky B told me finish my meal
Def Jam, seven figures, we can finish the deal (yeaaah)
Some say I lucked up; I call it perfect timing (yeah)
Nigga I can't lose; the whole city's behind me

[Verse 3 - Young Jeezy]
I got million dollar dreams and federal nightmares (ay)
We pop Cris' my nigga, and still drink beers (dat's riiight)
What did you expect man, I came from nothin' (nothin)
Real street nigga and wouldn't change for nothin' (nah)
Got my niggas out the hood, it's such a wonderful feeling (chea)
Three car garage with the twelve foot ceilings (ay)
It oughta be a crime just to feel this good
I swear it oughta be a crime just to be this hood (ayy)
