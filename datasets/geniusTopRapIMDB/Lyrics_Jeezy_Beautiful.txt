Beautiful Lyrics[Chorus: The Game & Jeezy]
I got a bad bitch from Vogue, told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs, that bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo', two doors, two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues, man, that bitch beautiful
Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains
Two-mile-long driveway, man, that ho beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Came up in the projects, dreamin' 'bout them mansions
Wit' the coke white walls, flow like bowlin' balls
Murci' in my garage, course it is supercharged
Wake up to a m√©nage, then get me a massage (Haha)
Closet filled wit' designer, Donatella recliner
Suede headliner, all that whippin', China
I ain't talkin' Sprite when I say I need soda
Bought my first Caprice, put fifty in the motor
Bricks, they was beautiful, yeah, Mona Lisa
The streets introduced me to money, nice to meet ya (What's up?)
Ray Charles in these Ray Bans, why?
Yeah, I touched them keys with both hands
If I die, remember me like Don Killuminati
Bury me on the left, right next to John Gotti
Play nothin' but that Cocaine Muzik, that Yo Gotti
Tombstone ready, took shit from nobody
[Chorus: The Game & Jeezy]
I got a bad bitch from Vogue, told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs, that bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo', two doors, two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues, man, that bitch beautiful
Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains
Two-mile-long driveway, man, that ho beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful

[Verse 2: The Game & Jeezy]
Mirror, mirror in my garage
Tell me which Lambo' I should park at the L'Ermitage
Pull up at the The Mirage, it's Phantom's and Mazi's
Out here, expensive taste, my car is camouflage
Speakin' of camouflage, R.I.P. to Camoflauge
Just drove through Savannah, Georgia, that shit beautiful
And his .4-5, is unusual
Push your shit back like nail shops do cuticles
Snowman, tell these niggas that we livin' it
Front yard like a soccer field, and we kickin' it
Sick condos, pockets full of Rondos
Choppers wit' extended clips long as El Segundo
Jeezy like Versace so we rented out the mansion
Fuckin' European models, skin white as Marilyn Manson
Came a long way from a nigga first advancement
Test drive the new Bugatti, hold that bitch for ransom (That's right)
You might also like[Chorus: Rick Ross & Jeezy]
I keep me a jet model, keep a black bottle (What's up?)
Meal ticket wrapped in plastic, that bitch beautiful
Keep some rose gold on my arm, bottle of Avion
FNH with the drum, man, that bitch beautiful
Baby girl, she out of Broward, smooth with the powder
Tats on her neck, straight checks, this bitch beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My Chevrolet a seven trey, Dade County dope boy
I'm talkin' heavyweight, I hustle everyday
We squashed the beef to get the money (Huh)
We set examples for rich niggas in Maseratis (Woo)
My killers in the lobby, bitches keep my name ringin' (Boss)
Execute a nigga, Abe Lincoln, two-hundred squares for the same ticket
Out in L.A., I'm with my main bitches
Tiptoein' on marble, got me trippin' on these painkillers
I'm still the same, I never changed, nigga (Woah)
Went from razorbladin' rocks, no more holes in my socks
Fuck her like a champ, got me livin' like I box
Sugar Ray Leonard, nigga, I just want the drop
First nigga with the Wraith, underneath the stars (Woo)
Better look me in my face, tell the tears' for my dogs
Fuckin' the same hoes but we got them different cars (Huh)
And beautiful are my odds
[Chorus: The Game, Jeezy & Rick Ross]
I got a bad bitch from Vogue, told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs, that bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo', two doors, two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues, man, that bitch beautiful
Baby girl, she out of Broward, smooth with the powder
Tats on her neck, straight checks, this bitch beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky, 'fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie, man, that bitch beautiful
