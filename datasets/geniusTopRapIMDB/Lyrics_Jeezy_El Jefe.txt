El Jefe Lyrics[Intro]
I can't tell you why
I just changed, from one day to the next
I grew tired of everything
So, I decided to express my frustrations
You know what the thing about revolutions is?
You don't plan them, I didn't at least
There just happened to be alot of people that agreed with me
I happen to be the voice that spoke
They called me El Jefe
[Hook x2]
Niggas wanna go , we can go nigga I’m talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now I’m fed up
Hatin’ on another grown man get your bread up
If your bread down, nigga, then keep your head up

See timing is everything
Right now , you and I watch
Streets been watching us since ’04
And they still ours

[Hook]
Niggas wanna go , we can go nigga I’m talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now I’m fed up
Hatin’ on another grown man get your bread up
We can bread down nigga then keep your head up

[Verse]
Niggas tryin’ to take the spot yeah you know they gon’ try
You ain’t gotta say a word know them numbers don’t lie
I ain’t spazzing , I ain’t hating, I ain’t trippin’ I’m just focused
Came back to claim what’s mine I think everybody noticed
Ye I know ya’ll feel, is that nigga really real?
What’s understood ain’t gotta be said you niggas know the deal
Got a whole one from my partner one time he charged me thirty
Got a nigga wanted 2 way I need another birdy
I’m a genius when it comes to gettin money; kinda nerdy
Started counting at 6:15 be done by 7:30
If your subject is some real shit, you know I’m goin ham
Keep your opinions and your comments niggas I can’t give a damn
You might also like[El Jefe]
I wasn’t surprised to find my enemies
I could see the "el odio” in their eyes
They wanted to stomp me for my accomplishments
I thank them though, because without them, I wouldn’t have no one to stand above

[Verse 2]
Say, that’s the way it is
That’s the way it’s gonna be
Won’t be happy till I’m in the same place as Max B
For them niggas do your thing dog you know how cats be
Anything you wanna know about them things just ask me
See I might be from the ghetto but I’m gonna be classy
You can hate it if you want but I’m gonna be flashy
See I do it for the time that I was broke and ashy
Bitches say you want them clothes all week ,you nasty
See Pac said it best , real niggas don’t die
How you niggas so opinionated you don’t know the guy
If you think you’re going forward then you don’t know the guy
If you thinking there’s a limit then you don’t know the sky
You ain’t feeling me guess you ain’t fucking with the game
If you ain’t feeling me I guess you fucking with them lames
Gave you niggas hope how the fuck you gon’ doubt me
Let you niggas in, how the fuck you gonna out me

[El Jefe]
I knew that nobody could stop me
I knew that I would make it through this point…
Yo sabía como jefe
El Jefe… I represent everbodio
I say, look at me, because I’m here right now
Yo estoy aquí
And I will be present, and I’ll be here permanently. [Speaks in spanish]
Se acabó
