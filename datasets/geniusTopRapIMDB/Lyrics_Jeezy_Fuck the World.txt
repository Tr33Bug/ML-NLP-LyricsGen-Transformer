Fuck the World Lyrics[Chorus: August Alsina & (Jeezy)]
When these streets is all you know (All you know baby)
It's hard to tell whose a friend or a foe (No question)
All I need is a beautiful girl (Yeah, wassup)
So me and her, can fuck the world
Middle finger with her legs in the air
Getting money so it's hard to care (It's hard to care baby)
All I need is a beautiful girl
So me and her, can fuck the world

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
She like Avion on ice, a lil Belvee
And once we get together ain't nothin' you can tell me
One thing about my G, she might just bring a friend
And when the night started, sometimes it never end
I said she grown, just the way I like that
And she open minded, just the way I like that
I like the way she touch me, she do it so mature
Bet I can make her lust me, I'm a hundred percent sure
And even from the start, she seemed so hesitant
We here now, long time coming that was evident
She want me I want her, think that's an attraction
Yeah she 'bout that life though, baby 'bout that action, that's what I told her
[Pre-Chorus: Jeezy]
I tell her that I need her, she don't believe that
I miss her when she go like "Where my G at?"
In a league of her own, she a bad one
Never felt like this, you never had one
She bad, I'm fly, we high
And the shit we on, nigga, fo' life 'til we die
'Til we die, came from the bottom just aim for the sky
If it's motherfuck the world, put your fingers up high, yeah

[Chorus: August Alsina & (Jeezy)]
When these streets is all you know (All you know baby)

Middle finger with her legs in the air
Getting money so it's hard to care (It's hard to care baby)
All I need is a beautiful girl
So me and her, can fuck the world

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I said she never been to college, got brains
And one thing about it, IQ is insane
My G gon' keep it up, she ain't gon' let it be
Then once she get it started, it might not never end
Hit her on the late night, tell her that I'm 'bout to fall through
Said it's been waitin' on you nigga, get us all you
She got a little paper, might just tell her "Let me hold some"
I said I'm on my way, you just go ahead and roll one
She said just come through, and I'mma roll a few
And make it stand tall, then I'mma roll on you
If she was Bonnie, I be Clyde, we been down since way back
Swear them lips will be illegal, they addictive like crack, that's what I told her

And the shit we on, nigga, fo' life 'til we die
