Gangsta Music Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah hey motherfucking business here nigga
Yeah all you hating ass niggas
With your sneak dissing niggas
I see that you don't get your own
It's gon' get you hurt nigga
If you a hater and you know it fuck you
Y'all not rapping ass bitches
I rather listen to your instrumentals nigga
Haha bitch ass nigga (do something) do somethin' nigga see these
[Verse One]
I'm here now, you old news
Gotta couple Porsche trucks, couple old schools
I'll line your ass up, push your tape backwards
Cuz I'm a real nigga and I don't like rappers
And that ain't this and this ain't that
And bitch I'm strapped
Fuck wit real niggas that'll cut ya throat
And they don't drink Pepsi, they just sell Coke
All I do is talk blow its like my brain on drugs
See me out nigga I do my thang in clubs
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle
Stack up 20-dollar bills two bands in the middle
[Hook]
All the gangstas they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and
This is gangsta music
All the hustlers they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
This is hustler music
And this is hustler music
You might also like[Verse Two]
We don't talk on the phones 'cause it might stick
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick
Dirty birds nigga, we play wit them falcons
Know some niggas in the Decatur that pay for them falcons (That's right!)
Talking young hungry niggas eat your whole plate
Jeezy place the order niggas eat your whole face
You got me misconstrued, all fucked up
Jump out hit the switch light your ass up
Carbon 15 wit the hundred round drum
Got plenty for any nigga think he wants some
We don't leave 'em at the house we bring 'em out (bring 'em out)
My chain for your life - we can swap it out
[Hook]
All the gangstas they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and
This is gangsta music
All the hustlers they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
This is hustler music
And this is hustler music
[Verse Three]
The hoes love my voice; make they pussy moist
Certified G shit and I'm the gangsta's choice
Niggas popping off, I hope they bullet proof
Leave holes in you the size of a sunroof
Mac-11 in the club and a snub nose
Swear to God I'll knock you niggas out your fucking clothes
Lay your ass flat like a doormat
Niggas asking for but they ain't want that
In the rap game takin' niggas clientele
White ones like the powder that I used to sell
Give a fuck about a playa hater
Hit 'em wit the tool flush his whole radiator

[Hook]
All the gangstas they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and
This is gangsta music
All the hustlers they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this
They gon' shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
This is hustler music
And this is hustler music2Embed
