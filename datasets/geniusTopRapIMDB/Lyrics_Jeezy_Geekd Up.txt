Geekd Up Lyrics[Intro: Young Jezzy]
Fabo I gotch nigga!!! (yeah!)
REMIX!!! (yeah)
Yeah, I see you chico (let's go)
CTE nigga!! Grand Hype what up nigga!!??
West Side, what it do nigga
East Side huh (Slick Pulla what's happenin'?)
You already know... Let's get it nigga
A Fabo, you know I do this one for love nigga
I don't need nothin' nigga (let's get it!!)
[Verse 1: Young jeezy]
I said I'm higher than a muthafucka, right now
I'll shot a nigga dead in his shit, right now
They tought about a law, but I don't see how
Pull up in my car, and the bitches like WOW!!
And was me a Fa-Bezi, he on 3 pills
Renegotiation, need another 3 mil
Bitch you better chill, can't you see I'm floss
Fedarally's on me, so I pause for the boss
All these feds keep lookin' at me
Slowin' down the trap, make it hard for a G
Gotta bitch on Bankhead, nothin' but a Dankhead
Slide thru on tha late night, she give good head

It was me Slick P, you know we ran a train on her
I.O.U., you know we ran the game on her
Mac 11 cock, and the A R steady
Run up on me, muthafucka I'm ready

[Bridge: Fabo (of D4L)]
Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geeked Up
I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up

[Verse 2: Fabo (of D4L)]
Star Trek, Star Trek
Scotty don't wanna give a star back
I'm in tha zone, and I bought me a star gack
And I'm really geek'd up, that's a star fact
I'm startin' to see spaceships on Bankhead
I roll wit gangstas, pill poppas, and dank heads
I got partners like Worm, Lil' Boom, Buddy, and Famous
I got sistas like Yasmine, Chocolate, Porcha, they dangerous
I fly like blaze, when I'm burning purp
Real powder heads, we burning hurt
Geek music, I'm earning turf
While you football soft, like nerf
You might also like[Chorus: Fabo (of D4L)]
I'm in tha zone, I gotta see my doctor, Scotty's calling me (Scotty beam me up)
I'm in tha zone, I wanna fly morning, noon, and night
I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geeked Up
I'm Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up, Geek'd Up

[Outro:]
I'm Geek'd up, I can't make it on my own
I'm Geek'd up, I wish these haters leave me alone
Help me, help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me, help me, help me (I just wanna be, free)Embed
