Get Right Lyrics[Intro]
Wassup?
Turn the lights out
Yeah
Let me see what I see, nigga
What, look, look

[Chorus]
Heard it's poppin' at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawg, tell' em get right
Call up 'em broads, tell em get right
Poppin' bottles 'til we fall, let's get right
Heard it's poppin' at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawgs, tell 'em get right
Call up 'em broads, tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
[Verse 1]
Everybody switchin' up sides, who can you trust?
Believe what you wanna believe, what's to discuss?
Young the type a nigga that throw you the whip and ride the bus
And still give the nigga my last, enough is enough, huh?
Bad bitch with me and she's mixed breed
Let her ride the dick like a Ten Speed
They tell me turn up so I change gear
They know me in this motherfucker like Cheers
Hood nigga, yeah, and I'm livin' major
Whole fuckin' hood know I made ya
Whole fuckin' block know I saved ya
Your own fuckin' folks knows I raised ya
See I kept it one hunnid from the fuckin' start
Call me Mel Gibson, got a Braveheart
See they money get low and they get tight
Homie gone with the games, nigga, get right

[Chorus]
Heard it's poppin' at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawg, tell 'em get right
Call up 'em broads, tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these hoes
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Let's get right
Sparklers on the way, yeah, we blowin' these figures
Let's get right
Keep 'em comin', we gon' do it all night
Let's get right
Got the whole hood with me, we about to get right

So now you ain't fuckin' with me, that's how you feel?
Like I was ever fuckin' with you, get for real
And I ain't done what for who, nigga, for real?
Said you claimin' that you put niggas on, get you a deal, huh?
Actin' like Rico from Belly, that's what you doin'
Homie don't really know what it is, what you pursuin'?
But fuck around, nigga, with Young, he'll get you ruined
Thought we was going in tonight, fuck is we doin'?
Real talk, nigga, I ain't the bitch type
Don't make me fuck your bitch, bet I'm your bitch type
Have her lookin' broad day with a flashlight
Dull ass niggas stay tryin' to find light
Actin' ass niggas, give 'em three strikes
Heard he rapped to the judge, gave 'em three mics
Never in my life seen niggas actin' like dykes
Nigga, go'n with the games, homie, get right

[Chorus]
Heard it's poppin' at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawg, tell 'em get right
Call up 'em broads, tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these hoes
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Let's get right
Sparklers on the way, yeah, we blowin' these figures
Let's get right
Keep 'em comin', we gon' do it all night
Let's get right
Got the whole hood with me, we about to get right
[Break]
Get right...
Get right...

Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right
Let's get right

[Chorus]
Heard it's poppin' at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawg, tell 'em get right
Call up 'em broads, tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these hoes
Let's get right
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Let's get right
Sparklers on the way, yeah, we blowin' these figures
Let's get right
Keep 'em comin', we gon' do it all night
Let's get right
Got the whole hood with me, we about to get right1Embed
