Get Ya Mind Right Lyrics[Intro]
I'm the realest nigga in it—you already know
Got trapper of the year four times in a row
I'm the realest nigga in it—you already know
Got trapper of the year four times in a row
I'm the realest nigga in it—you already know
Got trapper of the year four times in a row (What they give you?)
A lifetime supply of baking soda clientele
A Rolley watch, two pots and three scales (Let's get it)

[Verse 1]
Can get bout fifty in the Hummer
The birds fly down south to Georgia for the summer (Yeah)
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Coke prices up and down like '64s (Chea)
Just 'cause I'm fly like a helicopter
The federales on my tail, call 'em bird watchers (Ayy)
Minus the bullshit, life's great
Just got a camera on the peach in my license plate (Yeah)
[Chorus]
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em

[Verse 2]
It's not a trick question, yeah I'm strapped bitch
Also ripped, nigga, miss me wit that rap shit (Yeah)
Rappin' ass nigga, better do numbers
I ain't gotta rap, I'ma do numbers (Chea)
A big shoot out on the highway
Jeezy hangin' out the coupe, lettin' it ride sideways (That's right)
A straight G, nigga, don't tempt me
I'll lend you the whole clip 'til the shit empty (chea)
Big stacks, yeah I got that
That's why I cop that Cris' by the six pack (Yeah)
Got the fed lines ringin' like a telethon (What)
Snitches want me locked up like Akon (Ayy)

[Chorus]
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em

Jeezy a rider, Jeezy a motherfuckin' fool
Don't approach him like that, you and Jeezy ain't cool (Chea)
Jeezy a gangsta, he roll with the real G's
And if he's smokin', best believe it's real trees (Yeah)
From L.A., Straight kush
Presidential shit, call it George Bush (That's right)
Everyday is like a game, call it Fear Factor
Got a trunk full of bricks like a contractor
Seen niggas leave here and they ain't comin' back
Left 'em slumped on the grain in his Cadillac (Damn)
Jimmy crack corn andJeezy flip O's
I just stick to the script, y'all niggas hoes (Ayy)

[Chorus]
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
What it do? What the business is?
Word on the street, Jeezy known to handle his
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em
Bitch, get ya mind right, let me talk to 'em3Embed
