Holy Ghost (Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Tell to myself, still on fire
I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire
I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire
I got some threat, but I'm still on fire
I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire
If it's not amazing that I'm on fire
I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game
[Chorus: Jeezy]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I ain't mad at ya
You might also like[Chorus]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear the Lord is my shepherd, I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus
I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis,  take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin'
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two T's and Top Dawg impress with
TV's that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
[Chorus]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost79Embed
