I Luv It Lyrics[Intro]
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it (Yeah, yeah)
And I love it (Hey, let's go!)

[Chorus]
We count hundreds on the table (Table), twenty's on the floor (Floor)
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it (Yeah), and I love it (Love it)
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show (Show)
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it (Yeah), and love it (Love it)
[Verse 1]
Once again it's on, I'm back in the motherfucking booth (Booth)
These niggas still lying, I'm the motherfucking truth (Yeah)
I don't believe I need some more fucking proof
I ain't want the four door, I copped the motherfucking coupe (Haha)
They tryin be me, I'm just tryin be G (G)
And everything comes to the light you'll see
These niggas in the dark baby I'll just shine (Shine)
I do it from the heart homie they just rhyme (Yeah)
Check your watch nigga it's my time (Ayy)
Mind made up I was on my grind (That's right)
So pay attention, yeah, you on my time
In that case time waits for no man (Nah)

Or maybe you niggas ain't listening
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise
