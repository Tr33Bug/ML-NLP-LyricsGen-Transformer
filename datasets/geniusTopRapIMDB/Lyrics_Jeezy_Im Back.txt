Iâ€™m Back LyricsI'm sorry for cussing
Fuck you, fuck you

I'm back, Mr. Magic City
Blowin' color purple, I make it rain on your forehead
You woulda thought I had a fan the way I blow that money
You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money

The Feds outside and they checkin' his tag
But still the boy move with a hell of a swag
It's like the soundtrack to my life
Everyday I'm under investigation
But I will not stop so you can stop the hating
What more can I say? It's like my gift and my curse
To fail or succeed, I don't know whats worse
I don't know what's worse
Agents tryna find a glitch in my matrix
One slip and I'm back to the basics
Red or blue pill, what would you do?
When the same niggas you love got hate in their blood

I know god's watching over me, so is the Fed's
When love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
All the bad I've done, will you still protect my life?

Maybe, maybe not
Until then, I keep an extra clip for that Glock
You wanna see my bank statement
I got no problems with that
Three hundred thousand, you know I'm smarter than that

I been dodging the alphabet boys all my life
So, you gonna need more than a child support lawyer
I got some child support for you
Get off your ass bitch and get you a job

Tell your other three baby daddy's to sell dope or rob
My son got everything in the world that I never had
One thing you can't call me is a deadbeat dad
When you're the one that shoulda been exposed
Unfit mother still playin' witcha nose
You might also likeAnd I don't wanna tell my child
That his moms ain't shit
And this ain't about him
She just a money hungry bitch

I been here before
They boxed me in a corner and I came out fighting
They locked me in a cell and I came out writing
I said I came out writin'
Lock my body, you can't trap my mind

I only talk in the bedroom, we whisper in the kitchen
Call me paranoid, I think the walls is listening
But if them walls could talk
I'd prolly never get to see the daylight

I gave it to 'em raw, mixtape after mixtape
I had niggas waiting on the album
I shoulda got five mic's in the Source
Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche
They say I ain't lyrical

I wasn't tryna impress y'all niggas
If hating was a crime, they'd arrest ya niggas
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
The streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
I said, the streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
I said, the streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
Yeah, I know you ain't done 'em
I'm back, better than before, matter fact, I'm better than ever
They can't box me in, that boy too clever

So CNN worried 'bout little ol' me
Fuck the bitch ass reporter who wrote the story
You motherfuckers don't know shit about me
What I been through or where I came from
When shit got hard, I stayed, I ain't run

So you can blame the government, they made me this way
See the pain in my eyes, you don't see me cry
Two tears in a bucket, who got that work?

Real talk, I'll make us a way
Get rich, or I'mma go to jail tryin'
Uncle Sam ain't never gave me shit
But my partner out west, yeah he front me them bricks

How the hell you expect me to be drug free?
When George Bush ain't never done shit for me
Follow me home and tap my phone
What happened to my freedom of speech?

Love don't love nobody
Got me feelin' like I shouldn't love myself
I practice what I preach, I preach what I practice
A hundred thou under my mattress

I'm only human, just a man
God gave me a gift to do the best that I can
Critics say I can't make an album better than my first one
The way I feel, that'll prolly be my worst one

Another one after that will be better than my last
So real talk, y'all can kiss my ass
This is the beginning of the beginning
I am the future

You niggas are a thing of the past
I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've become
So all you ridicule lookin' I'm not the one
It's called self respect, I bow down to no man
I say all that to say that you can't ban the snowman1Embed
