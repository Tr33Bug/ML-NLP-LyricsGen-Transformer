Jeezy The Snowman Lyrics[Intro]
Bitch

[Chorus]
Jeezy the snowman, I make it winter time
Heard the streets hungry, well, its dinner time
Watching the state patrol, they patrol the state
Jeezy the snowman, I patrol the weight

[Verse]
Thirty-six O's for the nineteen-five
Front door service, you ain't even gotta drive (Nah)
Stacks on deck, fuck what a hater think
Lot of dead white boys equal money in the bank (Yeah)
CTE is the clique that I claim (Claim)
Know some real niggas that claim the same thing (Yep)
They don't want war, these niggas want peace
Seventy-two karats on my snowman piece
I'm dope boy fresh, 4X black tee
And it's a million motherfuckers feeling just like me (Yeah)
We roll them fat like that Oprah bitch (What?)
Color purple, all we smoke is that purple shit (Yeah)
See the red dogs, run like black cats (Yoom)
Toss the work, but I'm holding on to my strap (That's right)
Hustler music, we call it trap-hop (Yeah)
A whole lot of baking soda in the glass pot (Ayy)
[Outro: Gangster Grillz]
