Leave You Alone Lyrics[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Jeezy)]
Yeah, she said (she said)
"You ain't no good (no good) but you feel so good" (hey)
She said (she said) "I would if I could
But I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone
I, I, I, I, she said (she said)
"I know you bad (you bad) but I want you bad" (hey)
She said (she said) "Makes me so sad
That I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone, oh
I, I, I, I
[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I got my mind on my money, all I need's a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning, get my smash on
I don't want much baby, egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focused, getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf, we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Jeezy)]
Yeah, she said (she said)
"You ain't no good (no good) but you feel so good" (hey)
She said (she said) "I would if I could
But I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone
I, I, I, I, she said (she said)
"I know you bad (you bad) but I want you bad" (hey)
She said (she said) "Makes me so sad
That I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone, oh
I, I, I, I

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love and loyalty, never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on, you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on a G, show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone, every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
That's the hustler in me, I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it, shit man, you’re probably right
The more I think about it, shit, you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Jeezy)]
Yeah, she said (she said)
"You ain't no good (no good) but you feel so good" (hey)
She said (she said) "I would if I could
But I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone
I, I, I, I, she said (she said)
"I know you bad (you bad) but I want you bad" (hey)
She said (she said) "Makes me so sad
That I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone, oh
I, I, I, I
[Verse 3: Ne-Yo & (Jeezy)]
She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
(Do what the hell I want, nigga)
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she don’t
(She never do though, haha)
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit
That I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Jeezy)]
Yeah, she said (she said)
"You ain't no good (no good) but you feel so good" (hey)
She said (she said) "I would if I could
But I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone
I, I, I, I, she said (she said)
"I know you bad (you bad) but I want you bad" (hey)
She said (she said) "Makes me so sad
That I, gotta leave you alone"
(She said I) Gotta leave you alone, oh
I, I, I, I
