Let Em Know Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' feelin' like Rocky
Back to myself, yeah I'm motherfuckin' cocky
If I take off all the chains we can play a little hockey
You know we playin' with the chop sticks, shit will have you leakin' sake
Let me tell you bout the story from Huaraches  to Versaces
My partner pulled up, I had to chef it up, hibachi
A few bowls on the side, yeah you know a little broccoli
Choppers in the car, got my own paparazzi
Stars on the ceilin', confidence is on a trillion
Where them bad bitches at? Let me know you in the buildin'
Last time I hit the county, shit my bail was a million
Last time I hit the club, shit I could have bought the buildin'
I'm bout to hit 'em with the sauce, sauce they ass for a minute
Like my Philly nigga said get in my bag for a minute
They like "where you been Young? Shit was bad for a minute"
All them clown niggas winnin', shit was sad for a minute but
[Hook]
I'ma make these niggas get on they shit dog
If nothin' else I can write a hit though
I'ma need five bricks for the show dog
Plus another 20k just to throw dog
I've done had about all I can take dog
I'ma show you how to kill 'em when they hate dog
Sometime ya gotta let a nigga know dog
Sometime ya gotta fuck a nigga hoe dog

[Verse 2]
You nigga  gonna learn who to fuck with
Y'all hoes gon miss me with the fuck shit
Took it out the bag, mixed it with the yellow box
Went to sleep woke up in a yellow watch
Do better, and these niggas gon' hate more
You keep it solid, and these niggas gon' flake more
Super nigga music, need a cape hoe
Nine piece in the stove, dinner date ho
And I don't fuck around with too many rap niggas
Reason bein' I don't fuck around with cap niggas
See the problem is there way too many plug niggas
Which in turn means there ain't enough drug dealers
This for my niggas in the trenches with the four way
Still sleepin' with the toolie by the doorway
They like "where you been Young? Shit was bad for a minute"
All them clown niggas winnin', shit was sad for a minute but

I'ma make these niggas get on they shit dog
If nothin' else I can write a hit though
I'ma need five bricks for the show dog
Plus another 20k just to throw dog
I've done had about all I can take dog
I'ma show you how to kill 'em when they hate dog
Sometime ya gotta let a nigga know dog
Sometime ya gotta fuck a nigga hoe dog

[Verse 3]
Niggas envy, I can see it in they eye dog
Type of nigga to sit and wait on your demise dog
Couldn't walk a mile, they ain't your size dog
I'ma show up with ya bitch like surprise dog
You ho ass niggas can't stop shit
You ho ass niggas ain't bout shit
You know we brought out all the chains for the gold diggers
And we brought out all things for the ho niggas
You gettin' money in this motherfucker, what it do?
Got a pocket full of hundreds and I bet they blue
Hard dick and bubble gum, no pillow talk
And I ain't gotta say much, I let the skrilla talk
Valet out front for a tank nigga
And I'm actin' like my shit don't stank nigga
The general, P Miller on the tank nigga
Y'all bout to make me start pullin' rank nigga
[Hook]
I'ma make these niggas get on they shit dog
If nothin' else I can write a hit though
I'ma need five bricks for the show dog
Plus another 20k just to throw dog
I've done had about all I can take dog
I'ma show you how to kill 'em when they hate dog
Sometime ya gotta let a nigga know dog
Sometime ya gotta fuck a nigga hoe dog4Embed
