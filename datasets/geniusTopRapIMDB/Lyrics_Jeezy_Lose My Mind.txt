Lose My Mind Lyrics[Intro: Jeezy]
Let's get it, shawty!
Oh, this that shit right here, nigga
What's up? Yeah! What's up?
103, a-yo! (Yo)
Nigga, 103 (A-yo!)
When this shit drop in the club, nigga
A-yo! Yo
It go, it go...

[Refrain: Jeezy]
Why y'all trip? (Tripping) I'm just fine (Fine)
12:45 (Five), bout that time (Yeah)
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind ('Wind)
Drink like a tank (Tank), lose my mind (Yeah)
This shit crazy (Crazy), way too bad (Bad)
Rosé, babe, waste two stacks (Yeah)
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I'm hearing voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic (Schizophrenic)
I swear they saying, "Let's get it," from another planet (Let's get it)
Thirty-six a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults (Somersaults)
Do it right, and you can live your whole summer raw (Yeah)
I'm out my mind, yeah, a nigga seeing double, y'all (Double, y'all)
Tell me, what's the chance of Jizzle fucking both of y'all? (Both of y'all)
She said, "Long as we can do it with your ice on" (Ice on)
If that's the case, we might as well leave the lights on (Yeah)
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisher Sweets (Sweets)
In my black-and-orange Charger: call it Trick or Treat (Yeah)
It ain't nothing to a boss: my goons got goons (Goons)
House stupid-dumb-big: my rooms got rooms (Yeah)

[Refrain: Jeezy & Plies]
Why y'all trip? (Tripping) I'm just fine (Fine)
12:45 (Five), bout that time (Yeah)
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind ('Wind)
Drink like a tank (Tank), lose my mind (Yeah)
This shit crazy (Crazy), way too bad (Bad)
Rosé, babe (Babe), waste two stacks (Yeah)
Ayy, Young! This be rough, right?
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Goon Affiliated, baby!
Can't spell sober, lost my mind (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy

Guess what my mama told me? (What?) She hate my partners (What?)
Guess why she hate em though (Why?) 'Cause all of em robbing
Fuck the police (Fuck 'em), cause all of them problems (Problems)
White girls fun (Why?), 'cause all of them swallow (Swallow)
Why I ain't fuck her at the house? 'Cause the bitch hollered (Bitch)
And where the pill man at? She need a blue dolphin (Dolphin)
Old broke-ass nigga (Broke): stop cock-blocking (Blocking)
Security, I need help cause the bitch stalking
A half fuckin' mil' (Half), that's what the whip cost me (Cost me)
100 dollars (What?), that's what the pussy cost me (Ha)
And when the niggas start hating, that's when the nigga lost me (Lost me)
"Fantástico," that's what the hoes call me

Drop the top, no bra, got the titties out (Titties out)
Mention my name and bring the whole city out (Yeah)
Doing what I do best: d-boy stuntin' (Stuntin')
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin' (Yeah)
Step in cleaner than a new Glock-40 (Forty)
My nickname in the A: "Strapped-Up Shawty" (Yeah)
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick (Toothpick)
Line wrapped around the corner, boy, too big (Yeah)
G-Code, black shades and my black chains (Black chains)
Look, you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing (Black thing)
You know we drink that Rosé til we black out (Black out)
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out (Yeah)
