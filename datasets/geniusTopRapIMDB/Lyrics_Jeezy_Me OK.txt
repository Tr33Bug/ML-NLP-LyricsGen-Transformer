Me OK Lyrics[Chorus]
First to tell you motherfucker "Trap or die", that's me OK?
Mister Whip-a-knot-and-get-a-half-a-pie, that's me, OK?
Mister If-I'm-talkin'-you-should-listen, game is free, OK?
Mister Got-two-whole-ones-and-two-half-ones, yeah, that's three, OK?
Leave up out of here with two bad ones, yeah, that's me, OK?
Mister Rein'-up-with-'bout-two-phantoms, yeah, that's me, OK?
On that Avion to the head, hey but me, OK?
Never put a bitch before my bread, hey that me, OK?

[Verse 1]
I'm a fool on that Avion, Snow be on that liquor
Approach me if you want to, I will smoke you like a Swisha
You know my game tizight, you know that's off tizzop
Presidential Day-Date, looking like two blocks
Chain on 2Pac when he was on Death Row
All black glizzock, that 40 say leggo
All my niggas is 'bout it, all my bitches is wit' it
One call, that's all, choppers pay him a visit
Real nigga fo' sho', got a fetish for dough
34 a unit, nine hundred a O
I break 'em down into zips, that's a hell of a flip
Had 'em, now they gone, guess who takin' a trip
[Chorus]
First to tell you motherfucker "Trap or die", that's me OK?
Mister Whip-a-knot-and-get-a-half-a-pie, that's me, OK?
Mister If-I'm-talkin'-you-should-listen, game is free, OK?
Mister Got-two-whole-ones-and-two-half-ones, yeah, that's three, OK?
Leave up out of here with two bad ones, yeah, that's me, OK?
Mister Rein'-up-with-'bout-two-phantoms, yeah, that's me, OK?
On that Avion to the head, hey but me, OK?
Never put a bitch before my bread, hey that me, OK?

[Verse 2]
When L.A. Reid was in office, made some history up in Def Jam
If Jizzle ain't droppin', nigga, what the fuck is Def Jam?
I know you heard how your boy bossed up at Atlantic
Boss shit, might just drop my next album on Atlantic
I really hope you bitches ready, vice prezzy and this presi
Got some shit off in my bezzy (so what ya sayin'?), my wrist is heavy
All white, penthouse, yeah, like the one on Belly
With a brown skin thang, swear to God, she look like Kelly
Two door Rolls is how I'm rollin', plus you know a nigga totin'
Keep that street nigga paper, rubber band it, it ain't foldin'
First the XXL, read about me in the Forbes
That's a long way from trappin' in that 4-door Accord, wassup?

[Chorus]
First to tell you motherfucker "Trap or die", that's me OK?
Mister Whip-a-knot-and-get-a-half-a-pie, that's me, OK?
Mister If-I'm-talkin'-you-should-listen, game is free, OK?
Mister Got-two-whole-ones-and-two-half-ones, yeah, that's three, OK?
Leave up out of here with two bad ones, yeah, that's me, OK?
Mister Rein'-up-with-'bout-two-phantoms, yeah, that's me, OK?
On that Avion to the head, hey but me, OK?
Never put a bitch before my bread, hey that me, OK?

Snow can eyeball a seven, yeah, you best believe without the scale
I just want the mansions and the riches, yeah, without the jail
You can call me postman, don't go nowhere without some mail
In and out in twenty minutes, you best believe I'm makin' bail
Who put you on designer watches, put you on designer frames
Had you cashin' out, payin' for, you can't pronounce the name
Had that Murcielago, it was green like margaritas
I sold yayo, I sold albums, might as well sell some tequila
Dropped so many Lambos, thought I was a Lam ambassador
Dropped so many Rollies, niggas thought I owned a Rollie store
Snow, it's been a while, yeah, you know them streets missed you
I don't eat, sleep, or shit without my mothafuckin' pistol

[Chorus]
