Put On (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Rest in peace, homie
Lil Mike, let's go
I put on (ay Cliff)
I put on (yeah, "The Recession" on the way)
I put on (ay Young)

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
The Recession on the way, hey, but on another note
A lot of sounding like Young, tell 'em register to quote
See I rolled them back-to-back like I'm registered to smoke
Yeah I got it on me now but I ain't registered to tote
I put on for my city and I bought a blue -ghini
Goddamn you just missed me, should've saw me, should've seen me
Do me a favor: see them haters tell 'em picture me rolling
Same time watch them Feds take a pic of me rolling
Got a phone call from 'Ye, put my -libs on his song
Sold 3 million records, goddamn I put 'em on
I put on for my city yeah billboards everywhere
See me before your flight land, see me before your bag claim
Re-up in my city, man you better check your bags, man
Shouts out to the Eastside, yeah they play them bag games
Southside boys will fly to your home, yeah they play them tag games
Can't forget that Westside, yeah they play them mask games
How you forget the Northside? Don't know I stay high as hell
87 stickers too, y'all know I stay fly as hell
I put on for my city, yeah way before the contracts
Trapstar, step back, might get you a contact
Rap star, no strap, might just get your chain snatched
Call Young brain stacks, might just get your chains back
Call my name in the courtroom, put me on blast
Still shining on they ass, yeah its Mr. Birthday Bash
[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go

[Interlude: Jay-Z] + (Young Jeezy)
'Ey Guru, put a lil' T-Pain on my shit too
Clear my throat, know what I mean? Uh
I put on...  G-Mix
I don't need no T-Pain, I got this one
(Oh you bout to put on Hov?) Yes

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
I put Marcy on the map, I put Brooklyn on my back
I put Fab back on the charts, I put Biggie in my raps
I put Nas with Def Jam, I let Diddy do my tracks
I put on for my city, that's a motherfucking fact
I put Mike Jack' on stage at Summer Jam, "Billie Jean"
I put Prodigy in his place on that Summer Jam screen
I put Preme in my truck told him leave them streets alone
I predicted jail would happen, shit, I tried to put him on
All these niggas taking credit for the work that I put in
If you really put me on, put yourself on then
I put miles on that hooptie, I put hours in that kitchen
Put that on my "Dear Mama" this is fact not fiction
Feds were trying to build a case, I was headed for conviction
Til the greatest flow in the world put me on television
I put on for my city so when I'm dead and gone
I got one last wish: put my Yankee hat on

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go6Embed
