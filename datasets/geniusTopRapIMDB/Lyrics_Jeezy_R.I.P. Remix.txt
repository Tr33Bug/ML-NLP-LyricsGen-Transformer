R.I.P. (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Jeezy]
Yeah, what
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
R.I.P., it's the remix killer
Mike Jack was alive, I'd remix "Thriller" (Yeahhhhhh)
Trapstar, bitch, spell it with a big T (T)
Give a damn if I never be a hot MC (Haha!)
'Cause I'm a hood nigga, first on everybody's list (Yeah!)
Buy the whole club P, don't fuck with no Cris (Damn)
That average ass watch can't fuck with my wrist (Nope)
Them average ass hoes can't fuck with my bitch (Nah)
To the window, to the motherfuckin' wall (Wall)
Enough money in my jeans to buy a motherfuckin' mall
Got the choppas in the back, bulletproof, that's my Hummer (boom)
R.I.P. to the competition, this is my summer
[Verse 2: YG & Jeezy]
YG, 4 hunnid! R.I.P. I wanna kill the judge (judge)
Tryna lock the homie up, they don't feel the thug (they don't feel the thug)
I'm thirsty, but I don't give a fuck (I don't give, remix!)
Fuckin' with my ex 'cause I'm still in love
Uh, I can teach you how to fuck and how to stack money
It's tha world!
I ain't went Hollywood, you just act funny
Girl, I know you want this pipe like a crack bummy
Stop playin', I'm tryna hit like a crash dummy (yeah)
Let's go!
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I can't take yo bitch if I don't see yo bitch (nah)
We done seen that snow, Nat Geo bitch
Cancel her and get another like I'm Nino bitch, wassup

[Chorus: Jeezy]
R.I.P., R.I.P (yeah, yeah)
R.I.P., R.I.P (yeah, wassup, what)

Bumpin' Suga Free in the automatic dually

[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
Look, R.I.P. to the V.I.P
I got my lil' niggas in the club, fuck I.D
My niggas kill at will, give you black eyed peas
A-a-a-and the molly make the white girl look Chinese
Okay, OHB, my niggas out here ballin'
And all these fake ass artists, y'all niggas out here drawin'
O-o-o-okay now dearly departed, I bought a plane, I departed
And if you started from the bottom
Gon' and come out the closet, hah
You problematic, I bought them ratchets and automatics
Clip hold 32, I make you feel the Magic
You gon' see the flashes, like you in a pageant
A-a-a-all black suits, and them long Caddys

[Chorus: Jeezy]
R.I.P., R.I.P (yeah, yeah)
