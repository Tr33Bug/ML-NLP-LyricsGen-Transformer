Soul Survivor Lyrics[Intro: Akon & Young Jeezy]
Konvict, Konvict (Chea)
Akon and Young Jeezy (Ay)
Tryna take it easy (Ay, chea)
Only way to go
You already know what it is, you already know what it is, nigga
And so (Ay, let's get it!)

[Hook: Akon & Young Jeezy]
But if you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (Yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (Yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (Yeah)
Or just a soul survivor (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Tonight I can't sleep, we livin' in Hell (Chea)
First they give us the work, then they throw us in jail (Ay)
Road trip, yeah, I'm traffickin' the white
Please Lord, don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who me? I'm a soul survivor
Ask about him in the street, the boy Jeez a rider (Jeez a rider)
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah, life sucks (Haha)
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ay)

[Hook: Akon & Young Jeezy]
If you lookin' for me, I'll be on the block
With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (Yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (Yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (Yeah)
Or just a soul survivor (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Another day, another dollar (Dollar) same block, same nigga (Chea)
Same part, same green, I guess we got the same dreams (Ay)
Or is it the same nightmares? (Nightmares)
We let the doves do it for us, we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggas don't budge
When Mel Man got his time, he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)
I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the caine (Damn)
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne (Tellin' you, mayne)
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name (Nah)
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appetites (Ay)
And this is e'ryday, it never gets old
Thought I was a juvenile, stuck to the G-code (Chea)
This ain't a rap song, nigga, this is my life (This is my life)
And if the hood was a battlefield, then I'd earn stripes (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Gotta watch ya every move 'cause them eyes be on you
Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous
Them alphabet boys got us under surveillance (Ay)
Like animals, they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put him on stages
I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself (Let's get it)
No nuts, no glory (No glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay)

[Bridge: Akon]
Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block disobeyin' the law
A real G, thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my drawers
Just keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now, ay
[Hook: Akon & Young Jeezy]

Tryna make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (Yeah)
Or just a soul survivor (Yeah)12Embed
