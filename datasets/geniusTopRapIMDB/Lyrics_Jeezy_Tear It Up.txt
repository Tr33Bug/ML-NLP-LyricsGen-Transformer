Tear It Up Lyrics[Intro: Jeezy and Unknown Woman]
Jeezy?..
What up
Where you at?
Shit I'm in the hood where you think I'm at man you know, shit...
Still commin' over?
Ay man, what I tell you earlier man, I'll be through there man
MMmm, I've been watin for you since you left me...
Sss, that's how you feel?
(giggles), Yeah...
[Chorus: Lloyd]
Red Dogs at my trap got me 4 a half a stone
See I'm trappin' all day, can't wait to get home (I'ma tear dat pussy up)
She layed up in the bed she ain't got no panties on
So as I hit the do' she already know it's on (I'ma tear dat pussy up)
Two logs two shots of Patron
Grey Goose got me loose tripple stack in my lungs (I'ma tear dat pussy up)
Stand up at the trunk gettin' my grown man own
Get up in them guts, you know it's on till the morning (I'ma tear dat pussy up)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Got one baby mama, no bitch, no wife
Like Pac, ya need a thug in your life (yea...)
A young nigga to straight come through and beat it up
Let yo man be the freak, he can eat it up (ha haa)
Shorty got that fire she ain't let me down yet (nope)
Got a Aquafina flow, call it wet wet (damnn)
Baby good with her mouth, says the right things
Got a head on her shoulders, she does the right things (ha haa)
She a bad bitch, y'all ready know
Face like Trina, and an ass like Jacki-o (ohh)
Got a gangsta on a mission (mission)
Best believe I know all the right positions (that's right..)
She like it slow from the front, fast from the back (back)
Put the pound game on her, hit her from the back (Yeahh)
I'm young and thuggin, I don't give a fuck
He can make love to you, I'mma beat it up...

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Me & shawty in the coupe, Lord knows she's a star (Star)
For some strange reason she likes to do it in the car (Damn)
She ain't the type that be runnin' her mouth (Nope)
So I keep it gangsta with her, let her come to the house (Hey)
Let her play Madden with Slick
When we in the bedroom she like to play with the stick (Yeah)
I know just how to handle her (How)
No amateur baby, I got stamina (Yeah)
Jeezy in the deck, now she grindin' to the beat (Beat)
Legs vibratin', now she messin' up my sheets (Haha)
Got a fistful of hair, and a fistful of ass (Ass)
She came first, I came last, roll the grass (Hey)

[Verse 3: Slick Pulla]
We pull bad hoes, rip them, push them to the side
'Cause real players, keep reserves when it's clutch time
Matter fact, my bottom bitch love to ride pine
She know when daddy leave the block, that it's cut time
I'm in the trenches, gettin' riches wit my comrades
We fold hoes up, like slacks in the player path
Pretty skin, silky hair, plus that ass fat (Uh-huh)
Fresh kicks on your feet, ya I'm diggin' that
Slick consako, yo boys slingin' wood bitch
You want that straight drop dick
Come to the hood bitch
I like scout them ghetto hoes up in 20 grand
'Cause them the ones be with that freaky shit man
Two drinks, three beans, now she rollin' man
The tool in her throat, I'm just tonsil patrollin' man
True pro's with this shit, we ain't new jacks
We drill hoes and switch 'em up like fitted caps

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Red Dogs at my trap got me 4 a half a stone
See I'm trappin' all day, can't wait to get home (I'ma tear that pussy up)
She layed up in the bed she ain't got no panties on
So as I hit the do' she already know it's on (I'ma tear that pussy up)
Two logs two shots of Patron
Grey Goose got me loose tripple stack in my lungs (I'ma tear that pussy up)
Stand up at the trunk gettin' my grown man own
Get up in them guts, you know it's on till the morning (I'ma tear that pussy up)2Embed
