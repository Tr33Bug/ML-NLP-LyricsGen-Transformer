This Oneâ€™s For You Lyrics[Intro: Trick Daddy & Jeezy]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen (yeah)
We'd like to thank y'all for coming out tonight
This one's for you, you, you, you, you
This one's for you, this one's for you, for you, for you

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm blowing good, yeah I smoke it by the zone
And when these niggas call, I don't pick up my phone
Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
This one's for you
[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I'm high as Southwest, "Jizzle, when your flight land?"
I don't know bitch, I might fly to England
Hit the highway with the change, yeah the change man
I done it my way with them thangs, changed the game plan
Half these niggas tellin lies, they just sound true
Nigga if you had it like that, I would've found you
I'm tryin to cash out a hunnid, lemme get a buck
Must've been just like you nigga, fake as fuck
Get 'em home and they probably all sheet rock
They sellin bullshit, fuckin' up the street stock
You livin' mine and yours, that's a double dip
That synthetic ass shit, we call it double whip
And nigga nothin' beat the cross but the double cross
I ran the streets and rap, bitch I'm a double boss
The nigga cashed out once I sent the double off
They knocked em off half way, I took a double loss

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm blowing good, yeah I smoke it by the zone
And when these niggas call, I don't pick up my phone
Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
This one's for you

Let's put these niggas on the stand, now stand up and be a man
Raise your hand and swear you were my number one fan
And I'm still that same nigga, you still that same nigga
But at the same time, I'm startin' to get bad vibes
What I owe you something nigga? That's what you act like
Ain't like them other niggas boy, you better act right
The first two years of your deal, ride ya trainin' wheels
And then you graduated and lived how real niggas lived
And I ain't dissin, naw, I ain't dissin
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game is missin
I'm used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with
Too much liquor, too many drugs in em
Too many cliques, too much swag now
Too many niggas wearin' tight shirts and skinnies
Walking around with they ass out
Y'all better cash out, gon' put yo cash up
Cause I'm all in, if I don't win, nigga, I'mma mask up

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm blowing good, yeah I smoke it by the zone
And when these niggas call, I don't pick up my phone
Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
This one's for you
[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Hardest part of life, niggas can't play they role
Err'body wanna ride the train but don't wanna pay tha toll
Keep it goin, young boy, you on a roll
Hoe nigga magazine, you the centerfold
You can check the resume nigga, I'm good as gold
Lawn chair ass niggas, all they do is fold
Nigga you talkin with emotion, you emotional
You might can get a lil light feelin promotional
Tell me what you see when you lookin in the mirror
Look at this hoe ass nigga, I couldn't've said it clearer
And you the same nigga that started up his jewelry game
And when you see him nowadays, that nigga jewelry lame
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it
"And why you talkin like that?" Cause bitch you ain't bout it
And nigga how you doin now? Worst than before
And bitch we winning over here, I be keeping score

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I'm blowing good, yeah I smoke it by the zone
And when these niggas call, I don't pick up my phone
Niggas actin like broads make me pick up my tone
I had a lil time so I wrote a lil song
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas
This one's for youEmbed
