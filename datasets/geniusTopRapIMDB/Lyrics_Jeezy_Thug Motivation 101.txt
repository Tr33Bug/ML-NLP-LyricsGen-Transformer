Thug Motivation 101 Lyrics[Intro]
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Let's get it!

[Verse 1]
I used to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches everywhere
Hit the kitchen lights: now it's marble floors, everywhere! (haha)
Call the carpenter, the roof on the coupe's gone (chea)
Give a fuck what he sold - I'm the truth, homes (that's riiight)
Kitchen's fumed up, niggas jamming 2Pac (chea)
Get my Benihanas on, working two pots (dayumm)
Baby need shoes, partner need bail money
Bloodhound for the bread, I just smell money
You niggas just write, I recollect (recollect)
Hands on, Jeezy really counted them checks (yeahhh)
I'm Donald Trump in a white tee and white 1's (chea)
The conversation is money: nigga, you want some? (aye)
[Hook]
Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
Let's get it!

[Verse 2]
I'm what the streets made me, a product of my environment (yeah)
Took what the streets gave me: product in my environment (ayy)
Now it's 28 inches on the brand new Hummer
Telling you right now - It's gon' be a cold summer (chea)
Blew the brains out the Chevy, call it suicide
It's a way of life, that's how us young niggas ridin' (that's right)
Trap Or Die gave 'em hope, they waiting for the sequel (yeah)
It's clear to see: the boy Jeezy do it for the people (aye)

[Hook]
Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
Let's get it!

I'm the author of the book, yeah a genius wrote it (chea)
There's a message in my words, you gotta decode it (ayy)
I seen it all, every gram, every bird (what)
I spit the truth, every noun, every verb (that's right)
I never exaggerated one line, one dime (dime)
Never lied to the people, not one time (never)
A hard head make a soft ass (ayy)
And hard white will get ya straight cash (haha)

[Hook]
