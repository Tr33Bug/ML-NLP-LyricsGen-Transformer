Trap Star Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy (Ayy), yeah
Ayy (Ayy), yeah
Ayy (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I'm a T-R-A-P-S-T-ar (USDA in the building, ayy)
Got the city on lock, big shoes on the car
And she likes it (She likes it nigga), ayy
And she likes it (Yeah), let's get it
[Verse 1]
Got the city on smash, the streets on click-clock
Eighty grand just to see the Jacob go tick-tock (Haha)
I'm so materialistic, so well-connected
Just ask about me, so well-respected (Ayy)
Run the streets all day, I don't get no sleep (Nope)
Eat at Spondivits four times a week
Bucket of crab legs, Slick had the lobster (Yeah)
I'm the real deal, these other niggas imposters
Popping gold bottles, yeah I took those sips (Sips)
Fifty in the trunk, yeah, I took those trips (Trips)
Keep the white girl, yeah, forever my lady (Yeah)
Two grand flat get you four and a baby, c'mon

[Chorus]
I'm a T-R-A-P-S-T-ar
Got the streets on lock, big shoes on the car
And she likes it (She likes it, she likes it), ayy
And she likes it (She likes it, she likes it)
I'm a T-R-A-P-S-T-ar
Keep Barney in the Sweets, cop Goose from the bar
And she likes it (She likes it, yeah), ayy, ayy
And she likes it (She likes it, she likes it)

[Verse 2]
Slide through the hood to just to check my dough (Dough)
Trap star fresh from head to toe (Toe)
From toe to head the kicks match the cap (Yeah)
Black t-shirt, yeah, it match the strap (Ayy)
The stones in the watch, yeah, they match the chain
New Jordans on his feet, Snowman's the name (Haha)
Fresh out the paint shop, threw the fours on it (Fours on it)
Now the Chevy got Lamborghini doors on it (Yeah)
Mix the Grey Goose with the cranberry juices (What?)
Nigga, can't you tell? I really sold those deuces (Yup)
The squares are white, the tape is black (What else?)
The wait is over, the real is back (Ayy)

Slices stacked up, I got colonial bread (Yeah)

Can't complain, the Porsche came with the rag
And the chopper came with extra clips
So when you niggas out of line we can extra flip (Ayy)
