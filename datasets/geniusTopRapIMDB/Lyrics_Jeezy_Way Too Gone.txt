Way Too Gone Lyrics[Intro: Jeezy]
The fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper, one time for the haters (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Money over bitches, two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life (EarDrummers)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Look, yeah, I said, "G-g-g-go DJ"
See you got the Jizzle on replay
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat
It's about the time everybody screams "free Meech!"
Let's take your bitch ass back to '05
Close your eyes, take a breath, nigga look, Atlanta lights
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I’m on the couch
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks, it's time to ball
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel makin' Kamals
Posted up, all black in the back, 100 deep
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, 200 seats
Man somebody call the IRS, too many Lambos
Yeah I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle
Them other niggas fake and flaunting, that's where it's at
Real niggas do real things, let's drink to that
[Chorus: Jeezy]
Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper, one time for the haters
Money over bitches, two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Yeah, I said I'm gone, I'm going going gone
Way this night is going, I won't make it home
I'mma wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover
What I spent last night, I could bought a Range Rover
Got my Ray Bans on, yeah I see you haters
Keep doing what you doing cause I need you haters
She said, "What's your cologne?" Said, "You can call it strong"
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long
I said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party
It feel like I'm on fire, oh I'm just that high
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gon' die
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another zip
Yeah I know he just left, he gotta make another trip
It's so hot in here, I feel like I'm gon' faint
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gon' drink

Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper, one time for the haters
Money over bitches, two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

[Verse 3: Future]
Astronaut nigga!
I woke up early this morning, three white girls from the Pink Pony
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment
One time for the bar, two times for my homies
I'm a rockstar in real life, I'm an astronaut outta sight
Put codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice
I don’t even know her name, she so caught in the hype
It's okay baby, cause I'm a millionaire for life
I got bitches on my payroll, they coming back like white
I'm with Ethiopian, we in Vegas shootin' dice
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong, it feels so right
On the first roll, Young, I hope I roll a seven
We in the club, for thugs, this must be heaven

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper, one time for the haters
Money over bitches, two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life5Embed
