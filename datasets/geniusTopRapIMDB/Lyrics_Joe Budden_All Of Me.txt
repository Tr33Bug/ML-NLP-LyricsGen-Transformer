All Of Me Lyrics[Chorus: Emanny]
I give you my all, but it seems like that's not enough
Now you can get all of me
A lot of things have changed from what I see
Is this the way its supossed to be

[Verse: Joe Budden]
Are you in that mood yet, one mo' 'gain
ARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET
Look, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open
Wouldn't get souped, them shit's was made to be broken
'Member comin' up dudes talkin' 'bout hoes, boastin'
I was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion
I dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
Once I got it shit wasn't even cool to me
I dreamt of condos and video vixens
Until I learned most girls in videos is pigeons
I just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it
Wanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal with it
I want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket
Let the beat play, I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey
Wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
Middle child, wish me and my brother was closer
I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to
And then remember it takes two people to argue
All she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her
All I did was shake her, she say that I hit her
She just takin' everythin' I say out of context
I'm tryin' not to black, I'm like a nigga with a complex
Was mad as a fuck, didn't even show it
Yesterday was better off, didn't even know it
Complete role reversal so it's useless these days
TV got real, music went fake, please help her for God's sake
When I proposed to the game I figured life was merry
Five years later I'm feelin' like Tyler Perry
Maybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it
Maybe I should pick up a pen and try n' force it
Same old story, guts and no glory
They tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre
I reintroduced myself to the world: I'm Jerz
I'm an artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words
More than a rapper, I pay attention to detail
But how I do in retail tells me if I prevail
Leonardo ain't seen these trials and tribulations
Foul situations with some mild stipulations
I feel like being an addict is a curse
It's somethin' 'bout dude that makes bad shit worse
There's three types of niggas in this world, you know?
So you either gon' make shit happen (or)
Watch shit happen or (or,) not know what happened
So I couldn't just sit there like, fuck rappin'
It's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin'
If I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin', like
I used to bump into Tammy in the club
Few of them, she even helped a nigga get in
See a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit 'em
Care for 'em, be more than "hi" and "bye" with 'em
Its been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased
She was my reality check, 'cause we the same age
I mean she put on a show that you can't stage
She made the shit sound effortless
I was damn near in tears checkin' my messages
I got goosebumps all over my skin
She said, "Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again"
Hope everything is well, kid
You see I'm just findin' out I have a brain tumor, but I never felt it
The doctor's giving me three weeks to live
Not three weeks 'til I die, that's three weeks to give
I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care
I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career"
And then she broke into tears
I pressed seven, took the phone from my ears
Sometimes the simplest of things people need it
But I ain't call back in fear of being speechless
What was I to put her at ease with
I picked a real bad time to be strategic
I think my life's bad, picking up the pieces
Some folk already got they appointment to see Jesus
In this world full of diseases
I've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures
Depression tells me I suck
So I reply, I ain't here 'cause I fell down, I'm here 'cause I got up
And then I'm goin' back and forth with Ransom
Shit came outta nowhere, was real random
According to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too
I never helped niggas, how the fuck you think they heard you
Motherfucka's got a lot of nerve, dude
I was the nigga believed in you spittin'
Had to con the industry just so they would listen
But go 'head, you just gon' rep yourself
How was you protecting me, you can't protect yourself
Keep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview
I can't help but ask what's gotten into dude
Media trainin' but he don't know how that go
It'd help you come across not soundin' like an asshole
In my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it
So why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it
I ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually
They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically
I thought I had a great job
Back when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod
Even when I'm spitting 'bout current events
Its a sublime sayin', who's more current than him?
So I'm wonderin', if a higher power tryna under-man
When you shoot for the stars, sometimes your gun'll jam
I ain't been to Summer Jam
I learned from Lupe: when you dumb it down its just harder to understand
2008, foes is still near me
So you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary
The Geto Boys say its all in the mind
Certain wounds only heal over time
No shame in my game, no pain, no gain
And since I ain't see a prophet I figured God would stop it
Waitin' on a alley, niggas just won't lob it
Still a risk taker let me put it in words
Can't steal second base and keep your foot on first
Been about ten years since I was high off the angel
Now I'm walkin' side by side with an angel
In front of my eyes that prize keep gettin' dangled
But can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled
Workin' shorty's nerves like a personal trainer
But its me, its personal, it ain't her
Friends keep tellin me leave her, I won't
Cause she sees somethin' in me that I don't
And I see somethin' in her that ya'll won't
If you never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong
See I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude
Argue long enough and that shit becomes laughable
My norm now since for her it's so natural
Wish I could tell her that all them niggas after you
So not compatible, that we compatible
Its nothin' else in this world that we would rather do
Anybody out there relate to my pain
Turn the music up let me know that I'm sane
We broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain
Dude was fuckin' you but starin' at my name
But we ain't gotta entertain all that
Back like we never left, we overcame all that
Fuck who made better tacos or who's ass fatter
Let's live for now, right now, none of that matters
Keep bringin' it up its goin' backlash us
Why am I meeting so many back-stabbers?
Why when I'm about to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster
When your house is see through, learn to close your eyes
In case the Glass shatters
Just sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
Thinkin' I'm on the last chapter
No tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that
Back in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack
As I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap
Wanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that...You might also like6Embed
