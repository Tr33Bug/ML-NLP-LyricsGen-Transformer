Broke Lyrics[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
[Ad-libs over hook: Joe Budden]
It's been a while, we ain't talk
We ain't seen each other
I guess that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is fake, maybe we'll never know
[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I mean, we started with love, the beginning was magical
Then it ended abrupt, how's it us that this happened to?
Was it all just a lie? How was none of it factual?
Even in our demise, it seems I'm always attached to you
They said: "If you let it go, if it's real it comes back to you."
She just called me a thief; I took it, never gave back to you
After all that I've done, figured you'd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off, we can't even be casual
Guess we both had times we were being irrational
We both out of our minds, how are we not compatible?
Say I pushed you out the door, and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wasn't impacted too
Should be a movie star, ma, you so good at acting new
You like us as strangers, me, I think it's impractical

[Refrain: Joe Budden]
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…

I mean, we started with love, then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business, clearly nothing was sacred
I know you down to your core, unless for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws, see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad, all them bitches is basic
And even if they ain't, it ain't hard to mistake it
I think you running from love with me, you gotta face it
Are you guarding your heart
From a nigga that always breaks it?
Now you live in the club, maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me every birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who I'm with, "Did anybody come after?"
But still talk like you the one, you say that none of them matter
I guess it is what it is, what about what it could be?
Do we try this again, just to confirm what it should be?

[Refrain: Joe Budden]
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…
[Bridge: Katelyn Tarver]
I'm the one you hide
The one you can't forget
And you're the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
'Til there was nothing left
Under my skin, gave what I had to give
We hit the end...

[Chorus: Katelyn Tarver]
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…10Embed
