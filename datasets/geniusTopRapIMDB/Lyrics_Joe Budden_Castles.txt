Castles Lyrics[Verse 1]
My castle started shrinking, something's gotta give
Ended up being the smallest place that I had ever lived
One of the reasons I would do away with fame, to say the least
Don't know who these people are, their names ain't on the lease
It's a different type of monster, entertainment is a beast
Was supposed to eat together, then I became the main feast
If you preying on my kindness, taking advantage of Joe's cool
I'd have to ask, what's your definition of soul food?
I bust my ass for my whole life, and I worked hard for my profit
And envy I know cuts like a knife, so you probably work hard to stop it
If you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic?
You know I cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket
A pretty good judge of character, maybe I mistaked a few
Cut some people off, but had no choice, it's what they made me do
Why would you take advantage when it's something I'd have gave to you?
And in the long run, it doesn't take from me, it takes from you
You'll probably tell me I'm a fucked up nigga
You got it wrong, I just won't be fucked up with you
Which forces me get distant, and I never want to act a way with you
But passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
No longer enable you, that's no longer favorable
But pride is on your sleeve so you'll just act like nothing phases you
Which can never equal good, in fact
So love can't be lost, I know exactly where I put it at
[Interlude]
Word. Got no problem with nobody though
So have no problem with me. Figured
No beef, no malice. I got no vendetta with y'all
So I only want better for myself
Might even want better for y'all

[Verse 2]
My castle started shrinking, I tried my best to fight it
Don't know how it happened, don't know how they got invited
Was good with cabin fever, and maybe that helped create the space
Fuck your good intentions, more concerned with what's taking place
But everyone feels entitled, made up their mind they got a right to
My peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals
Y'all can have the cars, yall can have the clothes, take all that shit that I don't love
I'm learning fast that recognition is its own drug
And what's worse than some of your actions being feminine
Is I got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine
You there when it's bright, better be there when it's dark
You wasn't there for the ride, don't be there when I park
Figure I love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me
And I'll stay trapped in this room to keep ya'll away from me
What's supposed to happen when I'm not hot anymore?
Your job rely on me being crazy, but what if I'm not anymore?
The funny shit, them molly's were cool when we all were doing em
But nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruining
I learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
So no love lost, but not much is there
Deja vu, this happened rapidly before
Every day's a constant struggle and you're a casualty of war
Which could only equal good, in fact
So love isn't lost, I know exactly where I put it atYou might also like7Embed
