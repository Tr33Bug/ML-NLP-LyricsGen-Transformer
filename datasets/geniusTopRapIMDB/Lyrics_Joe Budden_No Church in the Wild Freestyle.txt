No Church in the Wild (Freestyle) LyricsUgh, ugh, ugh
Uh-oh
That NJ bullshit, I'm on it
Joey
Can I talk my shit again?
Just wanna know
Just wanna know if I can talk my shit again
Ayy, couldn't blame me
I had to

Y’all can threaten me with ya thoughts, just never speak it
One gun accompanied by prayers I never need it
Burning flesh, skin peeling, slow inferno
Take away what we love, we’d all be Joe Paterno (Talk to 'em)
Reporting live from the city where they gun tote (Tote)
Sober in the sauna full of blunt smoke (Talk to 'em)
Y’all concerned with Drake and Common
(Me?) I’m concerned with niggas havin’ fake in common
Though I’m leading I don’t really know the path
But the future can’t be worse if you really know my past
Begged to be understood anytime I showed the wrath
But how could I expect third parties to know the half? (Ayy)
Like, when the temp rises, but you the candle wick
Sorta like Kyle Williams out in Candlestick
E'rybody shouldn’t grab the hammer by the grip, shit!
Billy Cundiff couldn’t handle the kick, shit
They say I changed since stardom
Can’t share the same success, we ain’t share the same problems
So, got big just to show ‘em what the gym does
Never mind shootin’: they ain’t show me where the gym was (Ayy)
That’s why I do a lot on spite
So if you look up to me, you got ‘em at the wrong height
I mean, I’m not a role model (Nah), I’m a piece of shit (Nah)
A product of never being given a piece of shit
Breaking day got the grind of a trucker
And my logic ain’t designed to intertwine with you suckers
Loaded nine is a buffer, but no time for you fuckers
There’ll be bodies in the sewers when my mind's in the gutter (Owww!)
Last night I had an epiphany
Then wrote it in my rhyme book in calligraphy (Ayy)
I see so many people looking for validity
That’s the wrong search if what’s lost is dignity
I certainly have grown since Mouse
Chrome under the couch (But I...)
But I’ll stomp his face to make it known what I’m about
If he on what he spout
Put my Nikes on his cheeks, now he foaming at the mouth (Get it?)
Ugh, reminded when I vent
Nigga, God designed it, it's in the print
Two memos for the spineless, one's repent
Second jewel: even my kindness is a strength, nigga!
No beef, no malice, not at all (Not at all)
I got no vendetta for y’all (I promise)
I mean I only want better for myself
Sometimes, I even want better for y’all, I swear
There’s no love in hip-hop
Irony, not even on Love and Hip-Hop (Nope)
Spacious closets, Persian rugs
Make sure I’m dressed at my best for the jerks that judge
Had a talk with my ex and knew for certain I was bugged
So I let the door slam feelin’ worse then I was
She said all I ever made her feel was hurt and disgust
Which in turn hurt cause that was my version of love, I cared
Clear, yeah, that you need better resolution
It seems the chances, we agree, are forever ruined (Ugh)
You talking 'bout how, I’m talkin’ about execution
You talking 'bout now, I’m talkin’ about evolution
Ugh, but better days gotta come
I’m a good amount of bad, right amount of so wrong
And Heidi Klum left Seal, which only prove my point
Shit can only be ugly for so long
Slaughterhouse founder, can't derail the captain
Ain’t enough niggas praying I fail for it to happen
'Cause on both sides of the coin you’ll get fed shells (Bow!)
In unison, hollow heads from redtails
I don’t wanna see your weapon
To keep me from what I’m destined
Some’ll see that as a blessin’ (Ugh)
And my dudes swear they’ll keep me happily from harm (So)
So I do the leg work, they carry the arms (Brrrat)
Check it, shorty I had over Saturday
Never act away, and squirt ‘til she oversaturate
She go hard in the dark, no chains
But see I’m gettin' it, even when the car is in park, nigga!
The hood is on some bullshit
So it ain't weird to see ‘em aiming at the pulpit
Fates are empty, collection plate, spirit in ruins
We used to a different type of communion
When guns take the place of the choir, tie up the pastor
If he scared, can't believe what he say ‘bout the life after (Oh)
The stained glass is bulletproof
Sometimes, a liar's mouth can be full of truth
I done heard gospel from a sinner
Told me to season my pride if that’s dinner
Said there’s no human that walks without sin
So we should probably call the gates, make sure we allowed in (Joey!)You might also like4Embed
