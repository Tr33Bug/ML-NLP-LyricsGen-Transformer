Off 2 The Races Lyrics[Hook]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
[Verse 1]
Let her know I’m here if she ever need me to be with her
As long as she know I can never be with her
She asks you why, I just need you to keep it G with her
Tell her I found a happiness that I could never see with her
Three years after that break up, should’ve had closure by now
We’d be best friends, you’da let this end, we’d be closer by now
But you want us upset, hostile, angry, evil, jealous, bitter, shit
Fuck makin' your bed and lyin' in it
You bought the house, live with it
I came to you for a second chance, you gave me your ass to kiss
Found another salad to toss, how the fuck is you mad at this?
Oh, I forgot, you not in love anymore
And I’d believe it, but see, I’m not on drugs anymore
That’s based on action; words I stopped believin', still I hear it though
Would you save them if you knew they became meaningless to me years ago?
But if happiness is the finish line, I beat you there
So Karma must be real 'cause since we broke up he ain’t treat you fair
[Hook]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Remember our bad break-up? I rapped about it on "Downfall"
But you know I don’t stay down for long
Remember you met that other dude
Who's smarter and more mature, with more bread
That you thought would be around for long?
Remember you pulled the rug from under me, left me to be alone?
I threatened suicide, begged, was crazy about you
But that stalker dude was deranged
To the point you wished death on his name
And when we speak now, you still say I’m crazy without you
My, my how the tables have turned
Or are they bendin' just a little? You resent it just a little?
'Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours
It’s the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours
Check it, in perspective I can’t even call it hatin'
You mad at the situation, really it ain’t even Kaylin
We both sympathized, that pain is felt and shared
To watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere
Watch a man you spent years with, grew with
Come across as someone that you want nothin' to do with
To sleep in a bed with "what ifs?" instead of somethin' special
How can you get over us? The public won’t even let you
I know to wake up with that fear is gross
Love me from far 'cause you scared to get close
But what are you fearin' the most?
If happiness is the finish line, I beat you there
I always thought that when you’d put the baggage down I’d meet you there
[Hook]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Uh, let’s bring it up to speed a lil' bit

[Verse 3]
Now a nigga ballin', you still tell me to grow some
Entertainin' threesomes, you don’t think that it’s wholesome
Say that you can’t trust me, think I’m out here trashin' you
Got a lot of answers to questions I don’t be askin' you
I tried to be friends so I don’t see a problem passin' through
You welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin' you
You must be misconstruin' my love and it’s gassin' you
Causin' you to wear our shit out and think it's fashionable
I'm thinkin' you should put our history in back of you
That would call for you steppin' outside of yourself and bein' rational
Come to friendship, you question me in that capacity
How would you ever know?
It’s not somethin' you ever asked of me
And VH1 just gave us another episode
So maybe it’s smart that you can’t let this go
'Cause love changes, a thug changes
And soulmates become strangers, word up
[Hook]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love6Embed
