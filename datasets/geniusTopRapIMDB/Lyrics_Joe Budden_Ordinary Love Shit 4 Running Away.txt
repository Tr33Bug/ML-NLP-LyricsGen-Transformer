Ordinary Love Shit 4 (Running Away) Lyrics[Verse]
Tell me how long are we suppose to act like this?
We won't never get on track like this
How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this?
You call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this
It's funny
Got your track shoes on but what you running from
Shit I know where you going and where you coming from
That’s immaturity showing, its just the baby in you
One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you
Tired of hearing how you’ll never trust me again
How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again
One minute I’m your soul-mate then it’s fuck me again
Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it
I just wan' treat you good and do better
You think I’m running round tryna be the hood's Hugh Heffner
Say I’m all about hoes, when I’m all about you
Even when I’m with my hoes, I tell them all about you
Say that’s just one reason I keep losing you
I don’t understand it, that shit is confusing too
You left me, I’m doing me, you doing you
So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu?
How dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don’t hear about them niggas you fucking with too?
I'd never knew you thought like that (dammit)
Who knew you was into sports like that
More prayers because they all players
You out there having a ball, player, ball player after ball player
I mean you with the ball players more than ball players
Hope they ain't fucking you and making you they ball-player
Come to me, I just get a hard time
Why they give one to you, is this what you wan' do?
With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up
Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up
Yeah, but the part I don’t respect is
You so cool with every other one of your exes
It's history between us, all ain't right either
Back and forth domestic, all ain't flights either
Be wanting you close to me, supposedly
You say you over me, that just comes across as a joke to me
'Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires
Worst case, you’ll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar
Tried therapy when we felt it going sour
That’s four-hundred dollars every hour
For him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter
Tell me I need to lower my voice, don’t curse at her
Says she’s only frustrated 'cause I keep hurtin' her
Tell me despite all that, he can tell that I worship her
Soon as you let your guard down, I get it up again
Fixing it is too much work, so I give up again
But I wan' spend the rest of my life with you
Make a wife with you, make it alright with you
But how are you ever suppose to think that I’m right for you
When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable
Disgraceful and you want me to chase you
But it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like
If you can't deal with what we go through
I got bitches lined up, I got a ego too
And to them I’m everything, funny, I'm great and I’m charming
But to you I’m alarming, all I do is bring harm in
To you, I’m the cause of all your misery
Of course I disagree, you going off our history
All that arguing just ain't my style
'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now
You tell me I should get help and I’m sick in the head
You found makeup on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed
But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though
I could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe
You just think I'll get another and another hoe
Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes
But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear
You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there
We discussing chicks after they through
They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you
We keep having the same threesome
But not the kind that come as a blessing, nah
You keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl
Like you ain't the reason she present, check it
You ain't gotta worry about me and her
If I wanted to be with her I would be with her
Yeah, we hung together, strip clubs, had fun together
But that’s done, don't sweat her, uh
You the only one I wanna do a bid with
Live with, share my last name, have kids with
Can't be understated, anytime we ever dated
You compare me in your head to some nigga you created
I’m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me
Still I want you to love me unconditionally
Nine-years in, I don’t deserve what you giving me
Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me
Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery
Lesson learned though, you my missing piece
Give another chance to your ex
You don’t pick up the phone, you don’t answer my texts
Bitch, we ain't give it all that we got
Still ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot
Or we can go ahead on our own
I need you I can’t do this alone
[Outro: Brandon Hall & Emanny]
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running awayYou might also like24Embed
