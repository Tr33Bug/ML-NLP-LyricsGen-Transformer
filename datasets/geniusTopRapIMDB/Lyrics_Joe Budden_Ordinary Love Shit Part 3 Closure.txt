Ordinary Love Shit Part 3 (Closure) Lyrics[Intro: Joe Budden & Esther Baxter]
So what do you think is happening (I don't know) with this escort girl? (I have no idea. I just know that, number one—) No, you have a bunch of ideas (no), and that part is apparent, so— (I don't know, I don't know exactly, I don't know exactly what's happening...) what do you think? (But I know that whatever it is is completely inappropriate for you to do being while you're in a relationship.) So you don't know what's happening? (Of course I don't know. I'm not physically there—) But whatever is happening... (—to see whatever it is. Something is). Something definetly is happening, right? (Something is).

[Intro]
New Joe Budden
One and two was for y'all
This one's for me
Check this (talk to 'em)

[Verse]
I finally found a passion I lacked before
Can't believe I didn’t catch ya under the act before
I mean I voiced my complaints, that went ignored
A few things you felt that you was too attractive for
'Cause e'erything out your mouth said that you ain't wanna hurt
Love the lifestyle we lived, but you ain't wanna work
So I’d sit you down and say it's getting outta hand
While you shoot down e'ery idea, busy worried about a brand
When ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife
How you was married, requesting dick pics from Lyfe
Though it all seemed shady, maybe I was crazy
I ignored my gut feelin', nah, not my baby
Accusing me, but pretending yourself
I couldn’t catch it, too busy defending myself
Or was I wrong not seeing a life without you
Or taking e'erything that you said at face value
You packed up and left, dude, I was so glad
Should've questioned how you easily became a nomad
If I could do it all again, it wouldn’t’ve happened so fast
And it burns with every line jotted in this notepad
'Cause at first you resembled my twin
Fast forward, you gave me identical twins
But then you lost it, honestly that murked my soul
'Cause though we wadn't tryna have one, we got off the birth control
And we was right back at it, fucking like addicts
While you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage
You never got embarrassed, interrogating me but that was just Yaris
Yeah, we beef and I dragged you off the bed
I swear to this day I re-enact it in my head
So I hemmed you up, wasn’t what I aimed to do
I ain't attack you, bitch, I was restraining you
But you was wifey, though I understand that it's not a game
Can you imagine my surprise when the cops came
Handcuffed me, you pressed charges
But I made bail, it's just heartless
You can't smash my laptop on the wall
And then think I wasn’t gonna react, scratch that
I mean you can't call my mom like can I crash at your spot, whattup
When I’m her son and you just locked me up
But wait, this is when it really gets deep
Judge says she get control of the house for a week
Filed a restraining order so she couldn’t come near me
The fuck else I do but go right back to Tahiry
I’m sleeping on her couch, not discussing shit
Staring at the fattest ass, not fuckin' it
I guess despite everything that she showed me
It felt good to be around a broad that really knows me
I missed all our arguin' and yappin'
Percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin
Can't believe that it happened (why?)
I lost my unborn daughter when we fought
I’m thinking I killed Aspen
And that’s when I thought that we’d be dead awhile
But we decided to reconcile
So hungover from love and what not
How could you not expect us to take another shot
But during all this time we don't live together
Stupid me thought you'd go get your shit together
You know, get a job or if acting’s your career
Seems you’ve pursued the shit for a year from right here
And it appears, along with all the yelling and the screaming
We both at the table, but my side is leaning
But rather than end it, we tried to mend it
Fuck bein' a couple, let's work on a friendship
But then it got weird, I was stunned from that
You took it to a place where there was no coming back
Off my last break up, I was able to stomach that
Two weeks removed and you fuckin' with a running back
Life is in shambles, disguised as a damsel
Lies are a handful
Bouncing off of, different guys lookin' scrambled
Despised how it was handled
But when you ain't got a dime, why not decide to gamble
Said you’d be in L.A. doing business
I’m thinking that’s great, I can't fault her
Said you'd be with Jennifer the whole time
But you prob'ly didn’t think that I would call her
She said she ain’t seen you since you landed
And for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker
And all I could do is laugh at myself
As I thought, why is old girl sucking off Derrick Ward for?
Said we was makin' it right, but you couldn’t
Was on the phone, I said Skype, but you wouldn’t
The puzzle starts coming together and it's brutal
Won’t Skype, Gmail chat, won't Oovoo
The whole time I’m noticing you actin' unusual
And I can't figure out who the fuck you being true to (nah)
Said the Wi-Fi was down in the tele
But you ain't say you was at hotel his house
Lookin' like a groupie
Or maybe I misunderstood when you said y'all two was makin' a movie
Looking at the shit pile I stepped in again
And to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again? Not again
I been through the world so I suck it up
It's less about the lie more about the cover-up
So you busted, but you addin' to the friction
'Cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction
So you talkin' to me real disparaging
So what attitude, coming off arrogant
If I wanted a trophy wife, then you could be
But all it look like is that you renting out pussy
Less about you, nah, you ain't the one
You grown, you got choices, I’m worried 'bout your son
That’s what got me up being an insomniac
Little nigga can't control how his mommy act
As for me, I’m tryin' flush you out my system
So I counter by filming all my sexual encounters
Mentally not there while I’m screwing
And I only keep going 'cause that's what your doing
I’m tryna see how's it done, how's it possible
Enough to put a weak nigga in a hospital
Starin' at one ex, talking about another
But this one would kill if it meant I wouldn't suffer
But she taking little shots, I'm getting ridiculed
'Cause all she complained about, I went and did with you
Said she knew it wouldn’t last when I lived with you
"She’s not your type, she ain't got the right hips for you"
So you try and take some'in' for pain, it don't work
You still feel it all, the Novocaine don't work
Nope, so we good, I don't let it get me down
Not a pussy that good nor a titty that round
For anything to work, y'all trust is a must
And I learned, gotta let a mutt be with a mutt
So I dead that bitch and though the shit’s been over
Some situations don't end without closureYou might also like11Embed
