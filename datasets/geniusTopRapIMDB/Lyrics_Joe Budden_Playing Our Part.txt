Playing Our Part Lyrics[Intro]
Mic, mic, mic
Yeah we good now
Turn the vocals down a little bit, just a little bit
I want it loud

[Verse 1]
Here's my moment of clarity
I've been misleadin' you all, givin' you half of me
I've been blazin' a trail and leavin' casualties
I've diagnosed myself, I think it's apathy
So lettin' go became easy, grabbin' ahold that's the hardest
I know our expiration date soon as we start it
You come around and you feel safe while you're a target
You feelin' like I let you inside, while I'm guarded
It's genius when arrogance seems like it's modest
Look past the insanity, glance at the logic
Appears optional, all of it is stipulated
Watch and learn how emotions get manipulated
Now you in dire need of help
You the victim, made to think you did it to yourself
Speakin' of, rest in peace Sandra Bland
Me I'm believin' everything that wasn't on that cam
But back to you, beauty, let me address our lil' movement
You in therapy but I don't see the improvement
Oh whatever's been made now days is ruined
So every few months I ponder what the fuck are we doin'
Let me watch my words again
You easily got one of the best pussies that I've ever been inserted in
You real kind, real sweet, real nurturin'
Yet every time we link back up, you just get hurt again
You put all men in a box, I ain't one of 'em
Funny how you got all the answers and none of 'em
You only dated three men so I'm scared of you
Cause with no point of reference, what the fuck are you comparin' to?
You good one minute, psycho the next
No longer lettin' it ride, too much Jekyll and Hyde
Then you subtweet for weeks, busy settin' your pride
I'm grown, don't really need that sort of mess in my life
But wait, you of age, you old too
I control my emotions, yours control you
You bright enough to know when you get impulsive
For me, that's repulsive, how do you not know this?
And then we go our separate ways
Just to link back on better days
Though I know it's short term and you never stay
You always a sucker for that text that say
[Pre-Hook]
"Yo what up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood"
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
Then you wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch

[Hook]
Cause we just playin' our parts
You're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart
You home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start
You realize this whole script you've been playin' a mark
That ain't stop you from takin' a part
I guess we're both just playin' our parts

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and so the pussy ain't enough now
They keep thinkin' it should be enough, how?
Fuck sex, baby, later for that
This mind game I'm playin' is a greater climax
Not a franchise player, I can't pay you the max
I can't say it to you so I just say it in raps
I got a rep that I made all by myself
One I hate all by myself
That comes from decisions created all by myself
I can't shake it all by myself
See I grew up in the spotlight
Where your every move is eyed
The truth becomes lies when you're that scrutinized
No mentorship, I was unsupervised
Had to learn on my own every rule to survive
Still I manned up in caught those wrongs
Go ahead and judge Joe, I got my court clothes on
Y'all see the front, behind the scenes more goes on
Check my back catalog, it's in all those songs, forreal
So I can be at peace forever
I left the puzzle right there, nigga, piece it together
But back to you, beauty, small waist, fat booty
It's cool for the moment but don't permanently move me
They come through tossin' me ass like it's their duty
But who I was ain't who I am, I say it truly
Here I am shootin' 'em down without the Uzi
Unlike them niggas you know, don't try and group me
Watched myself on TV, was unruly
How the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie
They say you are what you attract
Here I am, screamin', "fuck all that"
Then I'm forced to believe I attract and adore
Bunch of unstable broads with character flaws
With plenty luggage, I greet 'em with their bags at the door
If that's true then it's some shit I'd rather ignore
Cause check it, whatever helps you get by
So when they hit me, I always reply
You might also like[Pre-Hook]
They always be like, "what's up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood"
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
Then you wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch

[Hook]
Cause we just playin' our parts
You're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart
You home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start
Realize this whole script you've been playin' a mark
But that ain't stop you from takin' a part
I guess we're both just playin' our parts

[Verse 3]
Just where I'm at lately
Look at the monster this industry done made me
Shit I loved the most, I let it jade me
Cryin' out for help, somebody save me
But I can't let 'em know all that
They take it as weakness when you show all that
So I just live in my mind 'til this hoe call back
Every time I'm knocked down you see Joe crawl back, forreal
Nowadays they all the same
Enhanced body parts, smaller brains
They don't get a hi in fact
Mums the word, baby girl, it's now quiet for that, forreal
If you got nothin' to offer
Sorry Mrs. Jackson, gotta off ya
But as soon as you leave 'em alone
It's when they send that same text to the phone
[Outro]
They always be like, "what's up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood"
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
You wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch
Cause we just playin' our parts
I guess we're both just playin' our parts
I play mine well
Better than you
And it go... baby, baby!Embed
