Pump It Up (Remix) Lyrics[Jay-Z]
Gimme that beat fool, it’s a full time jack move
Don’t worry skano ill give it back soon
Just having a little fun, was sup my nigga?
S dot collection
Black album coming soon
Just gonna vent a little bit
Have a little fun with it
Yes

Ain't nobody dumpin' on Hov
You ain’t in sanitation or sanitarium
What are you crazy Jay-Z’ll bury em
I'll get you drug out the club they have to carry em
Go head, bug out, I'll raid, niggas scurry
Worry I'm not the Mike Jordan of the mic recording
It's Hovi baby you Kobe, maybe Tracy McGrady
Matter fact you a Harold Miner, J.R. Rider
Washed up on marijuana
Even worse, you a Pervis Ellis
You worthless fella
You ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley
And I ain’t talkin' to nobody in particular
My flow's just vehicular homicide when I’m kickin' up DUST!
Anybody in my path Is a car crash waiting to happen, nigga what?
I got my foot on the throat
On the pulse of this rap game and I ain’t letting up, YUP!
Yeah, who’s the nicest life or lifeless on these mic devices?
And I don't write this I just mic this
I will it to happen
One take Hov I’m real at this rapping
My new name is just the facts
While the rest of y'all just adjust the facts
Put words together, just to match
I say what I feel y’all adjust to that
I do the opposite of y’all so I just attract
The realer audience usually unjustly black
Know my flow and the shit they go through just match
Like the sound of my voice and a choice Just track
I just tackle the subject the flack of the public
Nothing, I know real niggas happen to love it
If you don’t like it then look in the mirror
Most likely you ain’t live it so you don’t get it
You ain’t did it so you can't vision it
The picture I’m painting ain't vivid
The language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya
See what starving'll do to ya
Growin up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya
I’m just talkin’ to ya
[Joe Budden]
Gimme that beat fool
It’s a full time jack move
Sorry Jay, Webb said take it back dude
Ha
Nitti too, he played a part in that
Listen I’m just having some fun
No

Part in the future
Sing the track now
It's been a good week Hova
You can give it back now
All these rappers is cooking crack and
Took the realness out the game it’s time to put it back in
The fans finally got it understood they just yappin
While Joey’s in the hood like Madden
Whoa
Success is wrapped up
Checks just rack up
Everybody’s a killer but the deaths don’t add up
Everybody’s a hustler but the money ain’t coming in
Y’all is it just my math sucks? Nah
In time I'ma super-succeed their wealth
Like everybody’s so scared to just be they self
Add the bass in your voice get found like the cool
So we could sound like loon or pound like boom
Don’t end up a dead man for the cheddar
Only way to play Joey's Def Jam Vendetta for real
On your Pro Tools lose, and don’t be shocked
Open the booth door we be like old school move it
I ain't Kobe or Tracy, Jay-Z, JB merk
Joey the future I’m more like Dirk
Anybody buyin respect me
Try and wet me
Y’all dudes will never make it
Y'all a Tyus Edney
I’m a standout like Yao Ming, I’m what's sparking now
Like fall back Shaq, I’m starting now
Boys poppin it toys poppin spit
I’m not from round these parts I’m Stojakovic
Never hear your man say I’m the Jordan of rappin
He’s gettin fatigued early and his scoring is lackin
Legacy is gettin' ruined and you don’t want that
So pretty much learn from him, don’t come back
And rap is gettin’ wack, time for Gs to step in
Cause’ you are not that hot, don’t believe the yes men
Ain’t about who’s better than uh, it’s so evident
They hard to be real with no evidence
And I ain’t comin' at Jay, 'cause he’s the greatest breathing
But he already paved the way, I’m just layin' my cement
Not the same way I was dude I’m done drivin' now
I’m in your 745 plus 2
Don’t have your label call mine for no extracurricular
Rappers is all girls, extra particular
Seen many men with the jake
Next time y'all listen to "Many Men" I'll make sure you relate
Only Jay coulda came Just Blazed it like me
Everybody else chills, Just Blaze can agree
Packin a MAC in the back of the Acura, no
Clappin' the gat you be wrapped in the caddy but naw
What you want punk double clip pump
Ride by slump forth cocked playa on top
Hater warm rock with his teeth toes wrapped
With the brand new savior of east coast rap
Don’t worry y'all  I’ll bring the east coast back
Nah par, this ain’t a movie but meet Joe Black
Try to relate to it I just speak those facts
If you was in the front now your seat goes back
What the deallin'
Like New York been soft since Bin Laden came thru and crushed the buildings
Trying to restore the feeling, just speaking to ya
I’m just speaking through yaYou might also like1Embed
