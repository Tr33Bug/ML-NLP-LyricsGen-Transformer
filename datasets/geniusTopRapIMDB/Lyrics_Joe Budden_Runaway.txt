Runaway Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I said all that I'll say, so I stand with no apologies
I've popped all that I popped, wasn't too recently that it got to me
Those of yall that love Joe, gotta admit the shit was a lot to see
Today I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty
I lost weight, lost faith, I got caught up in that vacuum
My stomach turned and my eyes burned, and I became best friends with the bathroom
Today it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush
Face pokered over the toilet, all you hear is a royal flush
Was under the control, though they warned me about addiction
Mine manifested again in the form of a prescription
And it's funny what the effects of that little pill'll do
Funny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you
But it's my life, guess I'm stuck in it
Sometimes I wanna just be normal like them other kids
The demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
But I'll runaway from it all if God deems that I've had enough of it
[Hook]
They say don't get lost, follow the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Uh, it go, look
How come they can roll? God tell me how come they can smoke, they can drink?
They get to do whatever they want and it don't interrupt the way they think
They all get to be regular, why is it only me this odd?
Me who can't even stand up straight, me who can't even keep a job
Maybe I'm asking for too much, a tiny piece of normalcy
Or an answer to any one of my fucking prayers that's asking what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm tired of being unique, tired of being that outcast
I'm tired of me being the only one, so tired of you all not knowing about that
I'm tired of it all, want me to fall a spectacle, for the crowd to see
Or being the only one with faith, I'm tired of everybody doubting me
I'm tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly
Aches, wish I could take my parents' genes the fuck up out of me
Tired of wanting to run somewhere, tired of having to bare it all
Tired of you fucks constantly taking from me and I'm willing to share it all
Tired of being objective, I'm tired of having to hear it all
But being alone is the only way I know to never be near it all

They say don't get lost, follow the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah1Embed
