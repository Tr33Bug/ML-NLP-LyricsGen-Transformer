She Don’t Put It Down Lyrics[Intro: Joe Budden]
She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, since mine's hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why? It ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare? They can’t
[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you, like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test
You be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga! He can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass, like a Prozac
Girl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know you still for me
That’s why we still fuckin'
‘Cause she don’t put it down like you
You might also like[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Love being around mine, no downtime
Still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one I’d rather cum on
[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you9Embed
