Skeletons Lyrics[Chorus: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's comin' from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin' from something that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
'Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin'
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin'
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin'
I love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and "I don't give a fuck" is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on, let shorty sing
'Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything
[Chorus: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Fuck all that rappin', I'ma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot?
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'ma take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yo, thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That's when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I's youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Bridge: Kaydence]
I thought I had it all locked away 'til forever
But no memories fade away, they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me?

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Uh
See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there's no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Inter city blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me, tell my Pop, I ain't bothered
When he don't speak to me, I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there's no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I'm kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, know I'm undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent
[Chorus: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it6Embed
