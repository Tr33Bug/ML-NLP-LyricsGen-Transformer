So Good Lyrics[Intro: Joe Budden]
Niggas be like
Niggas be like
They like, "Why you cuffin' so hard?"
And I be like, "Why you not?"
Grown man shit though
It's a cold winter, niggas they gon' keep you warm at night
Make you breakfast in the morning
And I ain't in love, love is in me, you hear?

[Hook: Emanny]
I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good
[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Look, let's talk a different type of lavish now
Not sure actually, a different type of baggage now
Your home girls quick to paint me as a savage now
You quick to know them bitter hoes, wish they had this now
Back to you, this song of mine, no it's unsung
Not a trophy, that'd imply I only won once
I'm off the pass miss if every guy before me once practiced
Then I don't need no real game to know
We should be more than just so on and done
And my baby like girls too
So every night we get in bed with another bitch
She start screamin', gettin' head from another bitch
And no, it's just a porno, in our heads it's another bitch
Yeah, but it's more than just the sex to me
Panic when I wake up and she ain't next to me
So I go out of my way to give her the best of me
Love me so much shorty even want the rest of me

[Hook: Emanny]
I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good

We hit the strip club, I respect a different taste
That's how stacks and ones end up in a disarray
These other broads used to transform my livin' space
Into solitary confinement prison space
They think we actin' though, I tell 'em we're not frontin'
Give her somethin' of everything 'cause she used to a lot of nothin'
We take our clothes off, get the spot, jump in it
She come multiple times like she forgot somethin'
Yeah, unlike any other guy she dated
She my world and I'm cool with bein' isolated
I swear to God all I need is you
If love hurts all I bleed is you
Tell me if you wanna see that through
We could coop it when I'm with you
Get back all I put in to recuperate an issue
Let me sum it up for those of y'all that ask why
I cherish the ground she walk on but she that fly

[Hook: Emanny]
I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good
[Outro: Joe Budden]
It's really as simple as this
The woman that they would fuck I wouldn't
The woman I wouldn't fuck they would
What that means is the niggas y'all think is fly don't
So I move in my own pace
(So good… so good…)
Fortunately for me I done been all around the world and met
Met so many different types of women
I picked mine, I got the one I like
Even better than that, I got the one I love
Y'all get these other hoes
Been there, done that, wasn't that fun
(So good… so good…)
(So good… so good…)
You gotta be on some
You gotta be on some grown shit
To understand this shit that I'm talkin' 'bout though
You gotta be on some grown shit
To have the type of sex that I'm talkin' 'bout
(So good… so good…)
(So good… so good…)
Y'all bedsex niggas, I'm rooftop
Five star suite and I don't mean considerate and kind
Ya mean?
Love you, baby
I love you too, babe
Take 'em to church, uh
Here's a jewel, I'ma give it to y'all
Same way it was given to me
Real niggas don't fall in love, we stand up in it
Thank God for you2Embed
