Tell Him Somethinâ€™ Lyrics[Hook 1: Emanny]
Tell him something
Say whatever you think he'd wanna hear girl
If it don't come between me, you and this mirror girl
I don't care girl
Just tell him something
Tell him something
Tell him something
Let him know a real nigga is fuckin you
But that'll probably make you feel uncomfortable
Whatchu gonna do?
Tell him something
Tell him something
[Hook 2: Emanny]
It's crazy, it's crazy
How he got your brain
But his body don't do a damn thing for you
Now oh baby, oh baby
Been trying to get away
Cause you know I do the things he won't do

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
You can tell him that we best of friends, or we just met
Tell him that you hate my guts, that was just sex
Can say we never kissed, those were just pecks
Tell him put your phone down, that was just a text
Or, tell him you cherish our bond on the weekly
Or how you jump in my arms when you see me
Tell him I threw on the charm it was easy
It's to the point now where your mom wanna meet me
Tell him I think you're beautiful
Tell him all the wild shit that I do to you
Would he approve of that? Or would his world be shattered?
And if you didn't care would it really matter?
Wait, could say it ain't the ride or the whips
But tell him the size of the ship
Or, just tell him you were tired of his shit
And I reminded you of how live it gets

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Tell him you don't feel appreciated
Tell him with me it's alleviated
Incomparable
How I do things that he wouldn't dare to do
Or act like I ain't affraid to take it there with you
Wait, as a matter a fact
Tell him he could be mad at the fact
You finally met a nigga that ain't mad at your past
Or tell him he can be mad at the past

[Hook 2]

[Bridge]
You get his call and he asks what you doing just say, "With your friends"
And while you on that phone waiting for him to hang up, girl, I'll be here
Ready to take over
Your body's yearning for what he can't give
And I know just how y'all's story gon' end
Once I give it to you, babe

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3]
Tell him you mourn him, tell him you're on it, tell him you can't see, your life without me
Tell him he's deaded now, all because I'm alive
Tell him it's wetter now and you love it when I'm inside
Tell him you like your hair pulled, tell him you like my tongue there
Tell him in detail, make sure you not unclear cause he gotta know, cause he gotta know
[Hook 1]Embed
