The Way You Love Me Lyrics[Intro: Joe Budden]
Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden) Look (Uh)

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
First off, let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chillin' in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Gettin' to the money, countin' these old faces
Like I found the smokin' gun in cold cases, nah
Them dark thoughts never got to him still
Unlike the legendary Robin Will' (Rest in peace)
Even though I understand, I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope but I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups, gotta respect Cuzz and
I'll hit the reset button, you try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments, already show 'em
How I deal with the consequence and you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like "What up with the guy?"
Which is weird, it's been a year since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscin', thinkin' hella back, you had to watch me
With her but to hell with that 'cause I think that
Me carryin' that thought kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool 'cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet, my mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private?
Were we victims to the game? Tryna do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange, this time not for the public
These niggas won't know a thing, so we keep each other blocked
On Twitter, it's not a game, like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers, and a stank, yeah
[Chorus: Felicia Temple, Joe Budden]
Every time I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me, is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me, is this the way (It go)
The way that you care (It go, uh)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surroundin' me
'Cause that'll lead to you on this couch poundin' me
That'll bring them feelings back, that's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Said my tone of voice sound like you speakin' down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said, all of this time I've been screamin' "Fuck you!"
Which implies I can't move on, I'm stuck too
Blood flowin', there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I try to leave, I swear you in a rush too, she said
"Lookin' back, I can see how you was gamin' me"
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game, tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Prob'ly got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night, it's still callin'
E'ry time you see me, a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that, if you did
It would look like it's a con to that, I'm so far beyond and that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes, I don't say that
'Cause I'm vain or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fuckin' (Nah), sometimes it's better knowin' you can't
She come runnin' back every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand, it's art
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hideout
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
Gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah, that love wouldn't've been real if it died out

Every time I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me, is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me, is this the way
The way that you care9Embed
