You and I Lyrics[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you
[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you

You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you
[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love8Embed
