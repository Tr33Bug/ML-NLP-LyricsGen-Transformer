2 Sides Lyrics[Intro - Killer Mike (Shawty Lo)]
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
(Well goddamn!
There must be 2 sides)

[Verse 1 - Killer Mike]
Too many niggas running 'round here lying
Claiming my city and they ain't from mine
A-town niggas so real, so raw
My bloodline is down by law
My pedigree is so Zone Three
So Zone One, so Zone Four
In other words fuckboy I ain't no ho
Nigga, I'm known at the AAMCO
Where the dope gets sold and the hammers blow
Still at the store where you grandma go
You know the same store where you can't go
Cause you ain't go, stop lying ho
Niggas see dumb niggas eyein' yo'
Piece and chain, 'bout to blow your brain
You wanna G up but you can't
Real niggas do what a fuckboy can't
Come through 'hood in wet-ass paint
Leave the car running with a filled up tank
Let a motherfucker try and touch my Chevy
Guarantee that I'ma put four in his belly
Two in his chest and a few in his neck
Then I dip back out to the flat
West-side OG that be me
Martin Luther King on my ID
Shawty L-O and T.I.P
Both know me from the goddamn streets
Now ask your favorite rapper 'bout me
No, ask your favorite d-boy about me
Ask Lil' Lean, ask Fat Steez
Ask Sleepy and Young Pill
All they gonna tell you is I keep it real
I put that shit on Adamsville
[Hook - Killer Mike (Shawty Lo)]
You say you from the west-side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the east-Side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the south-side?
(Well goddamn! There must be 2 sides)
You say you from the north-side?
(Well goddam! There must be 2 sides)

[Verse 2 - Killer Mike]
West-side bound but I'm east-side found
Ask them Glenwood boys I'm 'round
Who is these east-side niggas you 'round?
Ain't never, ever seen none of 'em clowns
I don't never see 'em on Candler Road
In Eastwyck or Old Flat Shoals
Nigga steady saying he from Decatur
Pussy, you's a fucking faker
I'ma ask them niggas on Marve Road
I'ma ask them niggas on Memorial
I'ma ask them niggas on Panola Road
If the niggas don't know, I'ma ask some hoes
Why? Cause you pussy, nigga
I ain't no pussy nigga
Think I am then push me, nigga
Wet me up and douche me, nigga
Up shopping in south DeKalb
South DeKalb with a fine young stallion
Or Candler Road, Red Lobster cracking
With my east-side mobster faction
Might see me with on a Kirkwood block
With a east-side Chevy rider named Big Block
Or Moreland Ave. with my top on drop
Radio on Pac just gripping my cock
Gripping my Glock and gripping my grain
On Covington Highway getting some brain
Rainbow Drive, I made my name
Slinging that pure Bolivian 'cane
Making some change two years before
The Olympics came, two years after
Met Gucci Mane through DJ Funk and Daryl James
I'm real with it mayne
You might also like[Hook]

[Outro - Killer Mike]
Saying that you from here
You don't never come here
