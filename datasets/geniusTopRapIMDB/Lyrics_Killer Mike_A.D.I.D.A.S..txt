A.D.I.D.A.S. Lyrics[Intro: Big Boi]
Pussy nigga, what you doing?
No, that's what it is, I had to go to the pad

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
It's the way you move your sexy groove (Sex)
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire (Sex)
I'm tired of jacking off 'cause you ain't there
[Verse 1: Big Boi]
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Oozing down the street like toothpaste 'cause the ivory is clean
Talking 'bout meeting at the inseam on the inside of the ship
Got a honey dip to hunt on, testes more blue than a Crip
Or the Blue Man Group, caught that on the Vegas Strip
Tell them a good game, JuJu pimping, cane like my nigga Don Magic
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hips, head, more to test
It's a camel toe and that's for sure, my brain is on one track
Like Marion Barry calls for crack or like a rock star does for smack
None of that, but the female genitalia where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a woman for that act
Personal preference, plus I use the law of nature as a reference
No, I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me, feminine female fantasies frolic freely in my cock pit
Every thirty something seconds, I can't stop it

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
It's the way you move your sexy groove (Sex)
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire (Sex)
I'm tired of jacking off 'cause you ain't there

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heifers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes, I drill
I've been cuttin' Cuban coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreaming 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood, we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morning when I roll over
All men, young or old, in the end, it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

[Interlude: Killer Mike]
Grandaddy, grandaddy
What's up? What's up? It's me
Ayy, let me get 'bout three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you back tomorrow

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
It's the way you move your sexy groove (Sex)
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire (Sex)
I'm tired of jacking off 'cause you ain't there
[Verse 3: Killer Mike & Big Boi]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
'Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S.Â 
A D and an A missin' out my Adidas
Plus, we don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush-hush
On the down low like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only 'cause, baby, I'm no perv'
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones, but there's no jumping brooms
Buffoon, you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
It's the way you move your sexy groove (Sex)
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about, all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire (Sex)
I'm tired of jacking off 'cause you ain't thereEmbed
