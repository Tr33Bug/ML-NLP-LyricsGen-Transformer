Anywhere But Here Lyrics[Intro: Killer Mike]
I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere
Anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman movin' through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it and Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)
[Chorus: Emily Panic]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me (Out to me, out to me)
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me (Out to me, out to me)
I can hear them calling out

[Bridge: Killer Mike]
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabotage theyselves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)

Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me (Out to me, out to me)
I can hear them calling out (I can hear them calling out)
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me (Out to me, out to me)
I can hear them calling out (I can hear them calling out)

[Post-Chorus: Emily Panic & Killer Mike]
Anywhere but here
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
(I can hear them calling out)3Embed
