Aye O Lyrics[Hook 1]
You're gettin' to your money holla
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
You ain't broke, pop a bottle go
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)
When Killer hit the stage they say
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
And after the show they goin'
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)

[Verse One]
Another Sunday
Another show in the country
Girl pussy poppin', shake that monkey
Fire up the [?] put the 'dro in the air
Niggas throw up your set, put your hood in the air
Half the club on the pill, the other half on drank
The parking lot full of old schools with wet candy paint
Shit, just last week a young nigga got shot
Playing Superman, racing bullets in the parking lot
Everybody know left him leaking in the street
But we'll hand it our self
We ain't talkin' to police
You already know the next day the hood put in work
And came back to the club in R.I.P. T-shirts
[Hook 2]
You're gettin to your money holla
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
You ain't broke, pop a bottle go
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)
If you're riding candy paint say
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
If you're burning good dank go
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)
If I gotta pull the K they sayin'
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
And if I let it go they like
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)
When Killer hit the stage they say
(Aye Aye Aye Aye)
And after the show they goin'
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)

[Verse Two]
I'm looking for the girl with Mike rolls in her hair
Take a picture with me mama, put your ass in the air
One [?] in her mouth and her outfit tight
She ain't lookin' for a man she just wanna fuck tonight
She got titties like (Aye Aye)
And ass like (Ooh Ooh)
I'm firing up the 'dro while she pop a pill and roll
I love a girl from the hood, fuck a video hoe
But y'all niggas know, I'll fuck a video hoe
Killer been around the world, did sold out shows
And came back to the hood and bought a Vert on vogues
You can call me Santa Clause cause I keep three hoes
And even in the summer I'm knee deep in snow
Jeah!

[Verse Three]
Deep in the south what do DJ's play?
Scarface, Eightball, UGK
And G's don't dance, we bounce and step
Throw bows to the right and stomp to the left
What's up to all the young G's with a head full of locks
Getting money on the block with a pocket full of rocks
We headed to the club, swerving and reckless
Creased jeans, white tees, Bob Marley necklace
You know about the south
You know what we about
Girl with short shorts and they asses hanging out
Dope boys on the grind with a grill in his mouth
We getting money down here, what the fuck is y'all about?

[Hook 2]
