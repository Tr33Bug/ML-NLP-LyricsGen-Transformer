Boonies (The Boondocks) Lyrics[Verse 1]

I'm waking up, new shoes, new socks
Two Glocks, TV locked on Boondocks
I bought a brand new trey 8
With my old A.K, Today Was A Good Day
Okay, okay, front door, outdoor, drive slow, headed to the liquor store
Mama say we need bread, need butter
What I'm seeing outside make me shudder (it's the gutter)
It looks like I gotta move in with granddad
Schemin' like Freeman, grandad got a big pad
In Decatur, home of the players
Where the rich niggas went when shit got crazy
Granddad say my generation lazy
I know we love the nigga so it don't faze me
Granddad got goddamn brother
And he act like Uncle Ruckus cause his attitude is "fuck it"
Y'all niggas ain't shit and never will be
Cornrows, afros, baggy clothes, guilty
That's how I vote for your ass in the trial
Even if you was innocent and didn't turn to smile
And as he dipped and he smashed on gas
Called me and gramps "niggers", said he hated our ass
[Verse 2]

Lost my whole last summer to a warrant
Got caught in a fishnet in Gwinnet County
60 days to the county, no bounty
That cracker judge wipe a nigga like Bounty
That's what I get for getting caught in the suburbs
[?] [?] like cuss words
Cop touch me I'mma do something to him
You got a revolutionary mind, Huey
You know a nigga straight wilding like Riley
I got a young wild nigga inside me
County jail, county gates incite me
Cause everyday I said "fuck you" to the white man
Y'all crackers never get another summer
Miss my car, miss the crib, miss the kids, miss my mamaYou might also like1Embed
