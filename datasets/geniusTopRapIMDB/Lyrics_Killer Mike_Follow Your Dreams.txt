Follow Your Dreams Lyrics[Intro, spoken]
The world fears a person with a dream
Because to have a dream gives you the ambition to wanna fulfill wanna that dream
And if you live your life fulling that dream, you're gonna glow man. Because thereâ€™s a magnificence and a moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you can't achieve being a part of someone else's

[Hook]
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes

All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now
[Verse 1]
You got famous, fell off, came back up, damn that's insane
The same as you must be to be in this game
In this game you suffer, hit strangers
Like Usain you bolt towards your dream
But haters speak disdain
Know my name and your name
But one thing's for sure man
Success is a sickness and there ain't no cure, man
Cure all is work hard and don't take no tours off
And even on off days you can't act like you're off
The payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros
Pitfalls of vanity, pride, and your ego
Just let go and live up to your full potential
What they say is hearsay, it's inconsequential
But naysayers say no, but they are so simple
That they judge appearance and can't touch the mental
They are sheep, they follow shepherds and man
I'm Malcolm, I'm Martin; I follow my plan

[Hook]
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes

All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now

Do it for family, but they don't believe
That dreams that you have can even be achieved
Get ready young sailor, here's rough on these seas
Can't let no doubt or self-pity drown me
It's design when you sign and the vultures appear
And if you should succeed, then it's worse by the year
But the worse curse is failure, it kills by the day
Watch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away
See, my curse is I'll verse in these verses I verse
Will still be overlooked like a body in hearse
But this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth
This is no pen, no paper, just my dream on verse
The boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed
Told her, if you can't tell I returned to Earth
Returned to the dirt, returned to the essence
Cause no weapon formed that gives me a succession

[Hook]
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes

All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now
[Outro, spoken]

I hope you've learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there
I hope you're chasing your dreams 'till you're exhausted, 'till your feet hurt, 'till your bones ache, and 'till you get it, you're hoping that you won't let it go
I want this to be more than good music to you, I hope it's inspiration for you
Chad Butler told me a few years back, "fight for your dream, Michael, like a drowning man fightin' for air."

[Hook x2]
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes

All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right nowEmbed
