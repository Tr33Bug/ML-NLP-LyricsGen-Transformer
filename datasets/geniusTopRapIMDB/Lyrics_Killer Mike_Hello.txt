Hello Lyrics[Chorus]
Well hello, well hello, well hello
What it is to my kin and my so-called friends
'Cause I know, cause I know, cause I know, cause I know
Yeah I know that you thought you'd never see me again
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go
Yeah I'm back in the flesh where them people haven't been
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
'Cause here they all come running back, long time you'll see

[Verse]
First they love you then they hate you
Then they crucify your character
Build you to destroy you
That's the way of this America
Smokin' on this bomb sack, I'm plotting my come back
They say success is war so I'm preparing for my combat
All I try to do is rise high above my enemies
Shit on 'em from high above and pray that they remember me
I'm the shit bitch, yeah
Can you guess? Remember me?
I might be gone forever if my hater's prayers succeed
If they succeed just let the world know that Michael kept it G
And if you see my haters please tell them this here from me
[Chorus]
Well hello, well hello, well hello
What it is to my kin and my so-called friends
'Cause I know, cause I know, cause I know, cause I know
Yeah I know that you thought you'd never see me again
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go
Yeah I'm back in the flesh where them people haven't been
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
'Cause here they all come running back, long time you'll seeYou might also likeEmbed
