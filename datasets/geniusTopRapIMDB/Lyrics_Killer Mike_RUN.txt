RUN Lyrics[Intro: Killer Mike]
God don't like ugly, I ain't one to judge (Judge)
Whole, whole lot of gold cubans weigh a ton (Ton)
Say I kept it solid when it's all said and done (Said and done)

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
All I know is keep goin', run, nigga, run (Run)
Mama told me, "Never fold, run, nigga, run" (Run)
Like Jenny told Forrest Gump, "Run, nigga, run" (Run)
The race for freedom ain't won, run, nigga, run
[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Had to make it out the red clay, run, nigga, run
The west side of Atlanta, yeah, that where I'm from (Flatland)
Outside, I was hands on like a glove (Like Batman)
Movin' like my nigga N.O.R.E., eatin' on the run (Run)
Still an underground king and that's word to Bun (Bun)
Locked in like Rice Street without a bond (Bond)
I was playin' with the powder way beforе LeBron (LeBron)
My wife was born a rеdhead, but now she a blonde
Politicians lie and your favorite rapper is a con (Con)
Don't check for me without a check for me, that's a hund' (Bluest)
Only Ls I wear is followed by Vuitton (Louis)
Get money and the power, teach 'em while they're young
Hmm, blessed to make it out the slums, run, nigga, run (Run)

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
All I know is keep goin', run, nigga, run (Run)
Mama told me, "Never fold, run, nigga, run" (Run)
Like Jenny told Forrest Gump, "Run, nigga, run" (Run)
The race to freedom ain't won, run, nigga, run

[Refrain: Killer Mike with Young Thug & Young Thug]
This for the ones that never won (Won)
Hurt feelin' goin' numb (Numb)
Beat the odds like a drum (Drum)
Run, run, nigga, run (Run, take off)
Run, run, nigga, run (Run, take off)
Run, run, nigga, run

I put some brand new Margiela on my bitch
Thinkin' the same, but ain't bankin' the same
I put some brand new Margiela on my bitch
Thinkin' the same, but ain't bankin' the same
I put a brand new fluoresce on her wrist
I bought that bitch a new Patek, plain Jane
This a bigger boat, we ain't sinkin' the same
This a PJ, we are not on the same plane
Yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, goddamn)
Yellow diamonds like the sun (Yeah)
And I keep it one-oh-one (Yeah)
Run (Take off)
Trappin' out, I'm mama's son
Now a nigga all night run
Now a nigga shootin' fun
Ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)
I keep this shit on a tightrope
On a PJ with no night clothes (Night clothes)
We just had fucked, why it's tight though? (Why?)
Why is you tight?
I signed the check like a typo (Yeah)
Rescue the trenches, all of the kiddies
We gon' and escape on a yacht boat
We gainin' weight like Big Pun, run, nigga, run
Installin' this shit in my son, run, nigga, run
Green interior, lawn, run, nigga, run
Dr. Martin boots when I come, run, nigga, run
[Chorus: Killer Mike with Young Thug & Young Thug]
All I know is keep goin', run, nigga, run (Run, run)
Mama told me, "Never fold, run, nigga, run" (Run, run)
Like Jenny told Forrest Gump, run, nigga, run (Run, run)
The race to freedom ain't won, run, nigga, run

[Refrain: Killer Mike & Young Thug]
This for the ones that never won (Won)
Hurt feelin' goin' numb (Numb)
Beat the odds like a drum (Drum)
Run, run, nigga, run (Run, take off)
Run, run, nigga, run (Run, take off)
Run, run, nigga, run1Embed
