A Thugâ€™s Love Story (Chapter I, II, III) Lyrics[Chapter I: Kool G Rap]
I know this chick, yo mami is rich, she push a six
Livin' some bloodshed, her man pushin' bricks
Crib way out in the sticks, they house lookin' slick
It's like some shit, straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique, met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick, I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick, silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit, tryna peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm schemin' on her back, peeping her hips, fiendin' to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
We chattered a bit, slipped me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressin' love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat likely
To be dealin' with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealin'
Body revealin' and big wheelin'
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I'm reachin' for the cordless to call Miss
I insist, to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, "Hello, who's this?" (chick)
"It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady?"
"Fine and how you doin' boo?" (chick)
"Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through?
"We could sip on some champagne from Spain boo"
About an hour or two she came thru, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink, open windows, a spot for our shots
Would wanna spend those, five digit o's, on busty bimbos
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed, her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see-through holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speakin' to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhattan street, body petite, fat in the cheeks
I was gettin' open, started, laughin' and jokin'
We weed smokin', strokin', the shorty spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of killers
Me no worry, I gots the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter I
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story
[Chapter II Intro: "G. Luciano"]
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressin' me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twistin' mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smellin' like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures

[Chapter II: Kool G. Rap]
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeak on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and, shorty was frozen
I'm waitin' for a head to poke in, and start smokin'
The home invasion, right through the door, they started blazin'
Bullets was grazin', shit was crazy kid
I had to think fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, bustin' they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, tryna make a thug's blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, felt somethin' hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clappin', niggas rolled up in blue and black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our ass in
Mash the gas, make the fuckin' wheel spin
The safety again, and still doin' a hundred and ten
Shorty shiverin', lip quiverin', ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep, get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We livin', made it the fuck out, mad slugs deliverin'
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo, tendin' my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dickin' her womb
Hittin' full behind her, grindin' her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridget Fonda
She back spasmed, givin' the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit 'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas comin' and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a nigga whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spray out, and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out

["Mami"] Alright, ven paca papi, dame un besito
[G. Luciano] Alright, alright grab that bag money
[Mami] Let's do this, baby

[Chapter III: Kool G. Rap]
After three whole days of lampin', we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We plannin', up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm countin' the dough
She packin' her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sittin' on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick; "Yo you movin' too slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and, hit the Caymans
With the payment", somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aimin'
I drew the Mac 10 and started flamin', they did the same and
Slugs sprayin' and blood rainin', I left about seven thugs layin'
But this one cat was gainin', he grabbed the dame and
Put the heater to the chick's brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the Glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yellin' that money in spanish
Thinkin' he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fuckin' Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, "Amor, you won't be pretty no more"
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holdin' the Tec
Ready to wet, I started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it, S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him "Hold your breath"
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug, lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, bustin' slugs at the skies above
