Blowin’ Up in the World Lyrics[Production by Buckwild]

[Verse 1]
Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid, I started out with nothin'
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin'
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the po' house
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin' to feed fo' mouths
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snow
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV I see that's about to retire
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin' in my cabinet but cans of Raid
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door to borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped
I'm trippin' cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner, the brother was straight fat, cat
Not even a Big Mac, black, I had Kit-Kat's on top of Cracker Jack's
Walkin' the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The one you like says "take a hike" if you can’t pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world
[Hook]
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm blowin' up in the world
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, yeah

[Verse 2]
It seems like only yesterday, my moms is on my back
"Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road, Jack"
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Roma's
In order to get straight, I gots to to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin' down on the corner slangin' fat rocks, to bottles with the black tops
For cops got my shorty watchin' my back, hops
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & Gucci
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin' and splittin' melons
Some started jellin' and tellin' police just 'cause I was swellin'
Hangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo
Yo, you'll never see G low, or goin' below
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin' it
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin' too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch tramps, diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm blowin' up in the world
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, yeah

[Verse 3]
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, "It's a Demo"
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin', no time for pains, sportin' gold chains and rings
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed; I'm still the same
Just spendin' twenties and tens at women pullin' on my linen
Then grinnin' 'cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginnin'
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
And turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low, now I puff on cigars and blow O's
So catch a flashback, of a G Rap track, attacked like a head crack
Get smacked, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut for poo-butt, rappers hangin' from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's with ya girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world
[Hook]
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm blowin' up in the world
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
(Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world)
I'm blowin' up in the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines, yeah5Embed
