Canâ€™t Stop the Shine Lyrics[Production by Kool G. Rap]

[Miss Jones]
Don't you know that G Rap's straight thuggin
And you know you can't stop the shine

[Kool G Rap]
Uhh, uhh
Kool G Rap, Underworld, Illville

(Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?)
Whattup, whattup, whattup
Uhh, uhh
Daddy Bigbucks, got the forty-five cal' tucked
Giovanni style tux, see the Cristal erupt
Be up at the bar what? Diamonds, carved and cut
The sluts get starstruck wonder if the car's what
The new BM, rimmed up, the Navigator truck
Feet be like skinned up in only gator stuff
For fly mami get hemmed up, she got the Jada cuts
These cats pushin they lens up, they can't hate enough
They countin what I spend up, already made enough
To live plush, you must eat out a fat plate of mush
Got what you lust, the Bulgari smothered with slush
Yours covered with rust, diamonds studded with dust
Mine flooded with crush, rides big as a bus
Thirty-two plus, what can you and your crew do to us
But look in disgust, plot to seize the shinin sea
From coppin the V-T-W-E-L-V-E
Pissed off at G's but we don't believe in knockin knees
We cock and squeeze, and leave some shit shot and breeze
Attractin these chicks mixed, black and japanese
And slappin these nitwits, with fat stacks of G's
Bag your rat, she should lack, grabbin the back of threes
On her knees, see more semen than all the seven seas
She goldminin, lookin for new fashion designin
Rings with rocks blindin cause my world started shinin, uhh

[MJ] Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?
[GR] When you see mines and can't stop the shine
Sippin wine from up a little grapevine
Too much ice up on the wrist to tell the time
[MJ] Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?
[GR] When you see me up in the 6 with a dime
Yeah, chicks of all kinds, mad concubines
Will you cock the nine and sneak me from behind?

[Kool G Rap]
My jet leaves, down to the beaches in the West Keys
With jet skis, only sex G's, with S-E's
And Lex G-S-3's, cheese to bless G
Baguettes be the ice makin my neck and chest freeze
Vietnamese, Tibetan G's with wet beads
In sets of three, breasts in 3-D that slept with me
The sexy, beauty of the week of the Jet G's
Bangladesh G's, on the other side of the Red Sea
The lefty, sippin Remi inside the Pepsi
Jew-els shinin, holdin down what you fell behind in
Mink shit with silk linin, penetrate right through
Your hymen, handle a nine like I'm Lex Diamond
Organized crimin, bank rolls yeah we get those
Fly clothes, slip those, spot foes then we hit those
The whole click glow, click the sickoes
With the chick-o's, hit the ones with the six-oh's
Hollow tops spit those, let the dough pile
Leave no profile, drama wild leave you layin Castellano style
With fifth llama cows, whole click be kinda wild
On a mission, get the death kiss end up missin
Chorus w/ variations to end3Embed
