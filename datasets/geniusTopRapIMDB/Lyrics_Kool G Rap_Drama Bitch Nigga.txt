Drama (Bitch Nigga) LyricsEh-body always wanna know what know what the G
In Kool G Rap stand for, Giancana nigga, gangsta
Quick to gank ya ass with a gigantic ass gat
You heard

[Kool G Rap]
Yo, here come the one that's known to keep it thoro
Queens the borough (straight up)
Live nigga; rep that (no doubt)
Cock the techs back and move on 'em weak cliques (move on 'em)
We deep bitch
And none of my Gorillas are scared to leak shit
All y'all niggas wanna speak slick -what you say- (what)
And couldn't beat dick
And quick to flee to them dicks
As soon as the heat spit
Cement your fucking feet to a brick
And draw them big
Heats on ya chick
We creep when we flip
Giancana baby, thug for life: I love this life
Guns, hoes, drugs and ice...aight
How your heart pump kool-aid when there's blood in mice?
Why you tryna fight slugs with a knife? (don't do it)
Bitch nigga
Had too much of that stiff liquor (don't do it)
Plenty gun talk; front for New York
And wouldn't draw stick figure (ha, ha)
Bounty your head for 'bout six figures, cook a bitch liver
End of the war, who lift the fifth quicker nigga? (you know me)
My whole approach sicker
To all you rappers with names hot as flames
I'll be there when the shit flicker (get'em)
This one go out to all gunslingers (hit'em) and brick flippers
Big dick don: G rap; nigga piss rivers
[Hook]
Drama, is the life I live
Bossing, is the things I did
Problems, is the things I finish
I been known from hood to hood to handle business
Money, is them things I take
Ladies, come on and bounce with me
G Rap, I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you' bout your cake

[Kool G Rap]
Ayo my whole life is under 'non-fiction'
Drama friction
Beef blood in the street bullets with bombs ticking
Just to become a don from sinning
Harmful living Giancana the street boss; people's loss
Left a dog reapin the cost
Had to go in deep in the forest
The whole police force peeping the floss
Conduct family biz; have my Yosemite Sam kids
That park vans where you live (o-ow)
Run up in a house and put a hands on the wiz
Give me fifty grand to live (Bitch)
G Rap America's Most see the name embedded it and toast
I'm here til all y'all niggas perish and quote
We lust money but cherish the dope
Meat cleaver sever your throat
The smoke, for the big bread and the a boat
So all you guys with gimmicks, die timid (die, die, die)
The sky's the limit
Better believe that I'mma ride every minute
In this game it's all about the pies and the spinach
And the liver this shit get, the liver the menace
Never violate the lines of scrimmage
G Rap Giancana kid, I vow to keep it live to the finish (uh-hu) yeah

Throw your steel in the air if you' bout your cake
