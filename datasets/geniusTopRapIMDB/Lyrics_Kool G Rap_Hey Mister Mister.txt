Hey Mister Mister Lyrics[Kool G. Rap]
Last week I beat my bitch up in the street for lyin to me
She thought she caught a cutie but didn't know the nigga knew me
He said he had but one or two affairs with the booga bear
All a nigga could do was try to act like he don't fuckin care
I was about to drop the hammer on this nigga
Till grip pulled out his wallet and he had my bitch's pictures
That undercover lover bullshit was now discovered
Can't wait to see this bitch cause I'mma beat her ass in public
I went to her sister's house, drove by her momma's
I even stepped to poppa duke's house to bring the drama
Lookin up the block, yeah hold up, yeah there goes that bitch
From a mile away yo I could tell my bitch is switched
So I ran up on her, hey wassup bitch I got a question
If you lie, this Smith and Wesson gonna teach ya ass a lesson
You ever fucked around on me before? "Hell no!" *smack*
"Yo what you hit me with that gun for?"
Bitch why you lyin, bitch you've been cheatin
Now I gotsa to give your motherfuckin ass a beatin
I punched her in the ribcage and kicked her in the stomach
Take off all my motherfuckin jewellery, bitch runnin
I stomped her and I kicked her and I punched her in the face
Some people crowded around but nobody got out of place
Don't want heroics, "Hey buddy" - aiyyo money don't get in this
"Hey miss you alright?" - motherfucker mind your business!
I'm bashin her with the nine, inches away from pullin the trigger
But a nigga got to hit her till I see her face get bigger
I'm sick of all the bullshit, tired of all the nonsense
So I pistol whipped the bitch till her ass fell out of conscious
Now she's all bloodied up, layin in that red shit
Bitch press charges, I guarantee you she's a dead bitch
The first time you play me is your last
So yo don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass
[Chorus]
"Hey mister mister, what the fuck you doin?"
"Hey mister mister" - keep walking past!
"Hey mister mister, what the fuck you doin?"
Don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass!

[Kool G. Rap]
I'm baggin up mad shit, puttin it on the street
I never snorted but I find myself shorted every weekend
Shit is disappearin and I'm lookin for the logic
Of why my shit gets lower every time I count the profit
It never fails again, these bitches drawers they go back up
One hundred here, two hundred here, but all that shit adds up
So I'm layin for the traitor
So I can put foot in they ass cause I'm a motherfucking bitch hater!
So I'm peepin out the spot for a week
If I catch one of these bitches stashin bread she'll be dead meat
I took one to the bath and tried to knock it
Feelin on her ass, hey yo bitch what's this in your pocket?
Aha finally caught your ass!
The bitch had my cash, I rolled up inside her stash
She started coppin a plea but I ain't really tryin to hear her
I snatched her by her hand, bashed her face up in the mirror
I threw her right on the ground and then her skirt revealed her panties
Now a nigga's ready to shove his dick up in her fanny
I hit the bitch like one more time and then I just said fuck it
Pulled my zipper down, whipped out my dick and made her suck it
I'm rammin my dick inside of her mouth and tryin to make her choke
Then I grabbed the back of her head and shot cum down her throat
I beat her and I dissed the bitch for tryin to steal my cash
So yo don't interrupt me when I'm whoopin on my bitch ass
