It’s a Shame (Da Butcher’s Mix) Lyrics[Production by Dr Butcher]

[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
And once again it's big G, runnin' the number racket's
Wearin' Pelle jackets
Fast loot tactics, I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin' steak at Benihana's
Bentley's limousine, the front yard stream is full of piranhas
I'm set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck's
Get a lot of sex, condo and duplex, diamond-infested Rolex
Deliver a crown at the world units with silver china
Sippin' on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when, I have to bring the terror in
Handle business in each and every borough and
Town or city, I'm rollin' like Frank Nitti, I'm rich and pretty
Back up kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin' most of my money, from all the dope-fiends and junkies
I learned from the best; the ones that's livin'
And the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
I got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thang
And if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sable's
Drinkin' Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin' her ground hoe
And if you clown yo, she'll turn into a bust-a-round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel, got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hang and dangle, gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York City bright lights
And real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up, break down
Packin' a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough, bro
Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and this honey, nothin's funny
It's a damn shame what I gotta do to get the money
