It’s a Shame Lyrics[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
And once again, it's big G
Runnin' the number rackets, wearin' Pelle jackets
Fast loot tactics, I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with Olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas, and eatin' steak at Benihana's
Bentley's, limousine, the front yard stream is full of piranhas
I'm set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck's, get a lot of sex
Condo and duplex, diamond-infested Rolex
The leather recliner, the wall units with silver china
Sippin' on finer wine-r, you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when I have to bring the terror and
Handle business in each and every borough and
Town or city, I'm rollin' like Frank Nitti, I'm rich and pretty
Back up, kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin' most of my money from all the dope fiends and junkies
I learned from the best
The ones that's livin' and the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is — Be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap
[Hook: Shawn Brown]
Now, it's a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin' in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holla
It's a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin' in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holla

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
I got a fly hoe up under the wing
A swinger that does her thing, and if you step inside my ring
She'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin' Charentes brand label, she'll rock a sucka's cradle
And yeah, honey gets more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin' her ground hoe
And if you clown, yo, she'll turn into a bust-a-round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel, got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hang and dangle, gettin' money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York City bright lights
And real late, way after midnight, I hit it 'cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break a brick down
Packin' a silver four pound, some clowns be tryin' to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick-up kids don't get no free dough, bro
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and his honey, nothing's funny
It's a damn shame what I gotta do to get the money

Now, it's a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin' in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holla
It's a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin' in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holla

[Outro: Shawn Brown]
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover
No, it ain't no sweet hangover3Embed
