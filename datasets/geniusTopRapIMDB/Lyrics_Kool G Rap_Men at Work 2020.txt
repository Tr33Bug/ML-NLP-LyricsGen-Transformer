Men at Work 2020 Lyrics[Verse 1 : Kool G Rap]
Deadly rhymes, here's the solution
Smoke you so bad, I'm a shoot till your kuf' spin
Scoops more loops than nooses in a looney bin
[.... in a talk .... groupin']
Send the men with white suits in with [???] in 'em
Stab and stab the limbs with a blue pen
Rages [have it??] straitjacket taser the bastard
Basket-case with hazardous [???]
You grab the mace to spray out a pathway
You pass the [cake??], nurse hurt in a black wig
Jack Nicholson crackpot, listen to crackpots
Whip with a fifth on the back block
You got rocked but didn't know how to act, doc
Nothin' but dimes bendin' over for the back shot
Some tight white chicks lick on my black cock
Main squeeze got dead up in the padlock
[Verse 2 : Nutso]
Stand clear, the real assassin's here
I'm the man upstairs that drank too many beers
Cheers from the sideline, hookers on the hotline
I'm on that corner, slingin' rocks and tryin' to stop mine
Red and blue lights, bitch addict for the night
I gotta take flight or else they're gonna find that white
Substance that lights crack pipes at night
Fiends in the PJs fightin' for three nights
Plus I'm tight
Source gave me three mics
That's one magazine bitch in the whole clip, riiight?
Pop-off master, lyrical ambassador
Point-blank comma, gimme space like NASA
Ghetto bastard with a rapture, what happened?
Make you play the wall like plaster, die faster
Yo G, I gave you sixteen, put it on a triple-beam
Break the pound up, bring the money back to Queens

[Verse 3 : Rugged Intellect]
It's a demo, my road to the riches is truly marvelous
Like KGR, bad to the bone, now who's the pharmacist?
But dominance, common, autonomous, droppin' the novelist
'Nuff said: take 'em to war, crews be robbin' this
It's nothin' to me, the edge of sanity's a damn shame
Time to represent for the brothers, we on a campaign
Trilogy of terror, number one with a bullet
I'm blowin' up in the world, you motherfuckers couldn't
Put money in the bank if I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm losin' weight like an elephant died
On the road to riches
Listen, the mission is that I'm still rappin'
Hot tracks, deliver the plaques
Shit is real platinum
I brings it back, it's the cat with the hard-right checks
The ladies love me cause I talk like sex
I be the innovator with the greater data
Skip defibrillators send the bill to haters to pay it
So Iâ€™m a see ya later

Fuck waitin', I'm God, not Satan
Stop hatin', shots sprayin', I'm not playin'
Start prayin', my heart's racin' like Scarface's
In car chases, I'm Skywalkin' and Darth Vadin'
Ghost ridin', toast hidin' with cold iron
You're two-two'in', I'm three-poundin' and four-fivin'
Bad bitches, I'm mad, bitches, you had riches
I clap bitches, [???], this is the rap Hitler
Crack giver to fiends, that's why I stack figures
That nigga is me, Hennessey black liquor
Drunk drivin' and blunt rollin', the gun's stolen
Put a hole in your chest until your lung's swollen
The young legend, son's reppin' with one weapon
To kill you with no answers and no questions
No videos, no dances and no sessions
I be makin' shit happen, I'm so destined

[Verse 5 : Ras Kass]
Underground superhero, Emperor Nero
Roman graffiti, tag my name on Colosseum murals
Slick lines, puro, peso, a few Euros
Y'all bitch niggas got cleavage like two zeros
Wankstas talkin' Bobby DeNiro, but sweet like churros
I be comin' in Latinas
Like donkey show burros
Blurro
Keep them bottles poppin'
Hip hop Mickey Thompson
B-boy exclusive
The reptilian side of my brain contains the venom of Medusa's
I'm out here grindin', Bobby Brown's jaw
Two state bids, I'm down by law
Tell them crackers in the blue suits everything Biggie said
Prove it's bulletproof: milli to the head
My occupation: live like a billionaire
Fuck like a porn star and drink like a sports bar
[Verse 6 : Action Bronson]
Yo G, fold 'em
Copy the suits outta Goldman's
Shooters on the roof, suede on the shoe
Queens, that's where death do us
Same place, fiend face'll get left blue-ish
Countin' money on the deck
Recoupin' the sex, shoop on the set
Fuck around put the [noose] to your neck
Duck on the table, spin it like the barrel
Share it with the family, born to be a pharaoh
Straight sick wit' it, need quarantine
Young prime time, pull corner schemes
Snap fingers for the waiter, time for ordering
Small flowers in the garden need a watering
Writin' rhymes with my daughter and my son present
Ginger ale, marijuana lung resin
Flushing, Queens, Dominican, a diner
Posse goin' in, treat it like vagina

[Verse 7 : Necro]
Mutilate the beat like a bear mutilating meat
Shoot you with a .38 in the face, to lick the bleed
Lacerate, never procrastinate with beef
Decapitate any rapper that hate on the thieves
Please, I'm more street than your whole fleet
Police lock you up, you're fucked till your asshole bleeds
Plus some chubby Clubber Lang-lookin' motherfucker named Bubba
Gang-bangin' you with no rubber
You bleed like hemo', chop you like Premo
Pop your mop-top off, emo like you got chemo
Blast a burner like Dillinger, brown Derringer
Vern Schillinger, brain hemorrage'll
Turn to gelatin, bird skeleton
Charcoal black, melanin
Spermin' in Helen Keller women
Schizophrenic with the most elegant etiquette
Till I flip like a predicate felon
Somebody get a medic1Embed
