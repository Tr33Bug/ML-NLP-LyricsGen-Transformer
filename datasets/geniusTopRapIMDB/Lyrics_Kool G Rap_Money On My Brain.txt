Money On My Brain Lyrics[Production by Dr. Butcher]

[Intro]
'95, keep it live
Here to make papers, knahmsayin'?
Motherfuckin' Kool G. Rap and B1
And my motherfuckin' man Grimm
Just comin' up with somethin' to keep the brain stimmed

[Verse 1: B1]
It's Big 1, son, Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'mma exploit heaven and earth for what it's worth
It's the MC extraordinaire, the jewels glare
The God is rare, I'm takin' bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin' niggas to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In '84, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin' Harveys Bristol Cream with the Glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin' to get dough like Pablo — today, fuck tomorrow
Seats RECARO, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science
It's the clients that turn small-time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin' for my appetizer
Blowin' like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphernalia, and material makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you, sippin' beer with two
Handlin' business properly, form a monopoly
Storefront property, if not, another robbery
I'm puttin' forth the effort, murder's the method
The steak is peppered
Son, when I let off, you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggas deaded and wetted
Don't forget it — money's the metal and my hand is magnetic
[Hook: B1 (MF Grimm)]
I gotta flip these bricks 'cause bein' broke drivin' me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
From O-z's to Ki's the triple-beam bring fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
Niggas be schemin' they team and, but still I maintain
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
'Cause money and murder go hand-in-hand
And it ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain, son

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Cryin', hopin' God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still, I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonald's, makin' mills servin'
Fuck a Landcruiser now, 'cause I got two Suburbans
Stressed out, sittin' thinkin' past bedtime
Scared, can't sleep, nightmares about Fed time
Diamonds, linens, ostrich and all that
Phat shit, I'll talk in code 'cause my phone's tapped
Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me 'cause I'm fuckin' all his nieces
Cuties every color, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini truck next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck TECs
A large ratio in this game dies
But that I'm flippin' pies, 'til the Senate legalize
You might also like[Hook: B1 (MF Grimm)]
I gotta flip these bricks 'cause bein' broke drivin' me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
From O-z's to Ki's the triple-beam bring fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
Niggas be schemin' they team and, but still I maintain
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
'Cause money and murder go hand-in-hand
And it ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain, son

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
I'm sportin' flavors in Timbs, a '95 Benz with the chrome rims
Presidential Rolex, two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with lucci, leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in restaurants, eatin' shrimp, scampi and sushi
Fly minks, with icicles that blink inside Cuban links
Lookin' spanked, brothers think, got loot like I'm doin' banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy, condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammy's
The broke niggas can't stand me
Hold the flame blow, hotel suites inside the Flamingo
It's owned by the dagos, I step up in 'em rockin' Kangols
Straight up fakin' no jacks
'Cause all my crack shacks are jam-packed
My mad stacks show that I'm on the right track like Amtrak
So stand back, 'cause I'mma make whatever it takes
To shake Jakes and shoot snakes
And bake more snowflake cakes than Drake's
Cut up your grill like I'm the Barber of the bill
Steal like Gotti, bodies are found inside the harbor, 'cause I'm ill
It's war, but no more kids are bein' kidnapped
Matter of fact, ain't with the shit, black
I was young when I did that
There's dope in the Copacabanas
Cock back the hammers 'til niggas in pajamas
Get they wigs split like bananas
Stable of hotties, niggas with shotties catchin' bodies
Neighborhood John Gotti with more notes than Pavarotti
Yeah! Paid as a motherfuckin' bank teller
The Goodfella, I stay a motherfuckin' drug seller
[Hook: B1 (MF Grimm)]
I gotta flip these bricks 'cause being broke drivin' me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
From O-z's to Ki's the triple beam bring fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
Niggas be scheming their team and but still I maintain
Money's on my fuckin' brain (Get the cream!)
'Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
