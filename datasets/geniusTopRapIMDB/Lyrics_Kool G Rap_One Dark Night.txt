One Dark Night Lyrics[Intro]
La la la, la la la la
La la la la LA
La la la, la la la la
La la la la LA

[Verse 1]
Last night, got caught in a gunfight
I think it was like four niggas clutchin' they burners and bustin' but only could see one in sight
The one on my right, yo, son he like "We both got gripe"
He wanted my life, committed nigga wit' a gun an a knife
He tryin' a make me the wiped out nigga, layin' up under the white
But I ain't tryin' a go up in no dark tunnel and brung to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight and tryna breathe with one in my pipe
But I'm not one of the type and I'd rather lose or hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receiving CPR at one in the night
Now, I can run and take flight but I'm like, Yo, son I'll be hype
When I play mother nature before she O' and clap her thunder tonight
I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ and let my shit slice In front of him twice
Let one splice, cause fuckin' with price, ain't tryin' a be nice
I want him on ice, no back home to a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life shiest, but none of it's nice
I peeped shit, and seen his whole clique, was runnin' in fright
Instead of comin' to fight "get some of the fight you son of a dykes"
With one in the pipe, I'm aimin' to light the one on the right
They all deceased, so yo my asspiece get hunted for life
Four niggas cut down and I could receive one hundred to life
Up in a jail cell, that's crawlin' with lice and runnin' with mice
Live trife, fillin' appetites with nothin' but rice
Slow biz and no kid's nigs stay runnin' my wife
Only got one life, yo get this fuckin, gun outta my sight
Back at the house after midnight, I'm done for the nightYou might also like1Embed
