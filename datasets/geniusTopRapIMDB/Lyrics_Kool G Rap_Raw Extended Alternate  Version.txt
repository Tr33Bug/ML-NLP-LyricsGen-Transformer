Raw (Extended Alternate  Version) LyricsOne, two, doin' a few for you

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Intro, I start to go, my rhymes'll flow so
Get up and dance 'cause Kane said so
If you are loungin' around, it's time to get up
Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
I do declare: Gettin' busy is where it's at
But with what you're sayin', you wouldn't get a point for that
'Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes, you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat?
You say you're rockin'? How many shows you get?
All your vocals go local on the M-I-C
Mine's go a great distance like AT&T
I'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothin' you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So, yo, go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse
Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct, I get respect
I'm out to collect cash money, but that's another subject
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceein', for those who wanna be in
My field and court, but then again, on second thought
To have MC's comin' out, soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator, and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
I'm A, number one, second to none
A sufficient title for me would be champion
Of any event in which I present
Fresh lyrics, you hear it and mark them excellent
Very exquisite and explicit
Extraordinaire, so what is it?
Nothin' but the finest, your supreme Highness
Out to diminish, delete and minus
All rappers that's inferior, playin' my area
Rhymes I recite will make them deteriorate away
And just get this straight
To compete, I will defeat and totally humiliate
All imitation with the combination
Of rhymes more deadlier than Freddy or Jason
I'll be on ya like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know, you'd step the hell off
On a peaceful eve, give me space to breathe
The way I be rockin', you wouldn't believe
I'm athletic, energetic, my rhymes are poetic
And while others are pathetic, my style is copacetic
Innovator, dominator, rhyme creator
My rhymes are food for your party, now allow me to cater
'Cause I'm the rappers' idol and my title is so vital
MC's tryna take it? Results are homicidal
All MC's try to handle me, are led to misfortune and calamity
So to whom it may concern, please try and learn
That in a battle with the Kane, you just get burned
'Cause I'm a slayer, rhyme-sayer that's out to kill
Progress, manifest, drop science and build
And any rapper tryna stop me from comin' through
Like Chaka Khan, I Feel For You
Destruction and corruption is what will occur
Much damage bein' done as I injure
And when I get through rockin' the mic like this
You'll have to thank the God Almighty if you still exist
Like that, y'all, it's like that, y'all
And when my Ballys run down, I get taps, y'all
So Kool G Rap, my mellow, my man
Get on the mic with the gangsta plan
[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
This little note is like a formula, the antidote
For copy-catters, I quote, they wanna deep-throat
Lyrics that I wrote, placed upon a beat so neat
Orchestras and bands can't compete or compare
Or even come near to this here
This is a mere affair, you just stare and cheer
Crystal clear to your ear, perhaps some rappers are up there
To me, they're just Hollywood Squares
Music I create rotates on a plate
And I know some people hate me because I'm great
Got a lot of females 'cause my records make sales
While the others on the shelf is goin' slower than snails
And this shows the pros are so composed
Also, enemies and foes, to G Rap, they're only zeros
Not heroes, they're fractions minus the action of satisfaction
Also, the brain of the main attraction
I'm not mixed with any studio tricks
No special effects like you see in the flicks
I'm dramatic, so there you have it, I'm fantastic
Competitors are plastic, stretch 'em like elastic
Then grab the microphone
And create a relaxin' tone like a saxophone
If you don't like it, then use the exit, to hell with it
I'm Kool G Rap and I made it, I did it
Mission completed, suckers are defeated
I sweated and bleeded, but yet I succeeded
So please be aware that this is a war
If the shoe fits, wear it 'cause that's what it's made for
My metaphors are excellent, yours are poor
My literature will score more, for sure
The creature, feature, searcher, preacher, teacher
Torture, rupture, capture, rapture, reach ya
Musical master, rhyme reacts as a
Brain that has the knowledge of NASA
You're just a KitKat, small as a Tic-Tac
But I'm a Big Mac, 'cause I'm G Rap
Well equipped with a hip-hop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bass'll give a shake of an earthquake
It'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake
'Cause I'm murder, homi-cide, comma
Crush, kill, destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker, sound seeker, you become weaker
My art is a smoker, your material is mediocre
The rap Olympia, devastate the area
I'm gettin' brainier, lyrical mania
Power source, energy enforced
Your headboards, will need Red Cross
So come one or two, step through a few
Doubles and couples, and I'll cripple all triples, huh!
You can't handle it;
None or any, one or many, some or plenty
'Cause I'm not a stranger, just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive, keep out, danger!
Packin' Gs while you try to be me
But for these MC's, I call 'em the wannabe Gs
What I write is in the smokin' section
Here's an injection of rap perfection
So what the heck? You select my dialect
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject
'Cause I could use a technique, modern or antique
Beats never repeat, show you that I can speak
Totally, properly, but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy just like Monopoly
Figure it out:
Kool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
'Cause when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'
Suckers that be yappin' don't think that this can happen...You might also like3Embed
