Return of the Don Lyrics[Chanting]
Kool G. Rap!

[Talking]
I spit a lot of gangsta shit, but, you know, I like to refer to it more as just reality rap, you know what I'm sayin'? And if you ask me how long is that gonna stay around, that's always gonna be around

[Intro]
Y'all gon' feel me on this one
Aight, real, real rap
Fuck is the deal, man?
[Verse]
It's game over, raw coke on the mirror by the [?]
Two dames on my shoulders, they hanging over, they training yoga
Sexin' them crazy, I'm sinking colas, I'm yanking molars
Like I'm supposed to, my main soldier swinging his toasters
Nigga hard, cold as a polar bear's, bake from the rover
Three-leaf clovers if you ever thought my reign was over
The pipe game, I have him flying with his stinking odor
[We light the things when the Viking reigns with baking soda???]
I push a button on your life like it's a game controller
Mahogany bed with a mommy on the spread
I'm a monster nigga, turned into a zombie for this bread
Don't think I'm claiming I'm banging cause their Mazi's bloody red
The sawed-off double-barrel filled up with double lead
Fuck blowing your head off, I'll blow your body from your head

[Hook]
It's the return of a don
Got nothing but dick for the world
A kiss for mixing me wrong
It's the return of a don
Homie, a rink is nothing
If [he pink his something??], thanks for nothing
It's the return of a don
Go in and tell every slinger [?] that holds pimps
Tricks are charms
It's the return of a don
And he about to get dirty
The hand goes as pearly, I'm going in early, I mean itYou might also likeEmbed
