Clappinâ€™ A Hoe LyricsSample of Eazy-E's "Boys-N-The-Hood (Remix)"
Cruisin down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes

[Verse 1: Big Sche Eastwood]
If you a faker, stop hallucinating
Stop procrastinating, we don't run with traitors
We so real, we're so 'bout it, 'bout it, pimping
Ain't no cash flowing, unless it's strictly stricken
Ain't no weed blowing, unless you're going half
Ain't no liquor pouring until you pay your tab
Ain't no bitches bending over backwards [?]
Steady pouring something that I (lack)
And stack up with money (we're loaded to death)
These niggas that's bummy (they hate me to death)
But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go one-on-one, they value their health
They know I'll slap a ho straight to the moon
Like I was an animal, sadistic goon
Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money (that's doom)
Power to people that hustle like me
24/7 they grind these streets
Shine like gemstones when I creep
(Ooh) blind mine enemies
I don't know the definition of sleep
If I couldn't starve (I wouldn't eat)
So my main focus is my cheese
And slap any ho that don't heed, ugh
[Hook: Kool Keith]
If she a prob, if she cool
If she a dog, if she rude
If she a prob, if she cool
If she a dog, if she rude (Yeah!)
Slap a ho x8

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Backing them up, pushing them down
Blocks up, I'm knocking them down
Coked up, fucking around
Pee on the nose, my writing gross
Microphone, sipping Patron
Breaking the center, slap the dungs
Make them sung, like Simone
Drawers made by Louis Vuitton
What we design, [?] slimes
Block clop, fizzy activity
Diggity-wiggity, dickity-nickity
Wickedy-wickedy, ball out
The girls with titties slang dope
You make it rain, [?] more
Come fly to Ukraine, spazz up
Hop in the truck, pop your dog
Get tummy tucked, run and duck
A Uncle Buck, move with us
You cool with us, I do'd them up
Like groupie dust, how it sound
Coke puffs, who roll the blunt
Now, what you want, tonk-tonk
My car horn go bomp-bomp
You beep-beep, I bonk-bonk
Excursion rider, hand glider
Put my finger right inside her
She was wet, wet-wet wet-wet-wet, wet-wet
