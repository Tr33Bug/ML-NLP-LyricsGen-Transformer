Donâ€™t Crush It LyricsYeah girl
I've been checkin out Big Willie Keith
He been trickin a lot of bills on me
Mmm-hmm!
I think I'mma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah, that's what I'mma do
Yeahhhh..

[Kool Keith]
I'm like a freak from Hunt's Point, the Bronx and the Goat
Wear my drawers in tight mode, naked with no coat
Walkin around, I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots, and hair like Medusa
Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty
I got no time to trick, on the average girl
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world
And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot, everybody's butt naked
Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer, viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman, pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed, them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up
Yea yeah yeahhhh
Chorus: Kool Keith + girl (repeat 2X)

Yo baby (whassup?)
Don't crush it when you sit upon it
(Yo baby) whassup?
(Don't rush it when I sit upon it)

[Kool Keith]
I see you scopin me, the fourth time you cut your eye
Let the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye
I'm next on the menu, runnin up and in you
With seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly
Delicious kickin, no leather like I'm Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink
I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex
I'm shootin gizm, then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in, and bone a sweetie look like Yo-Yo
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair
She said, "Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair"
I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle, she's scoped by an ass pro
I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches, and watch she make it lowride
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt

It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance, that grey hiney ain't no slum
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle
She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill
I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side
Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'mma let her ride
Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms
Go on girl!
