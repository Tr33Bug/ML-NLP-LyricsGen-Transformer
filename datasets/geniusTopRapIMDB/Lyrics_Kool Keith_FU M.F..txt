F-U M.F. LyricsSo what you got your first deal?
Who you signed with, nigga?
Epic?
Def Jam?
I don't give a fuck if you're with Warner Bros
Who you signed with, nigga?
Muthafuckin Loud?
Interscope, Columbia, Sony, 550
Fuck it if you're with Dreamworks
And a few of you in-house commercial-ass producers
Can suck out the interior out of my dick
Y'all still 75, that ain't no new shit
Fake-ass wanna-be hip-hop shit
Don't worry about who the fuck I hang with
Jealous muthafuckas
I'm tired of niggas fooling muthafuckas
Actin like they drug dealers
All you rappers fantasizin that jewelry and car shit
You can pull the Speedos and suck my dick
Tell your corny fans who believe that shit
Lick the back of my ass quick
I'mma shut faggots down
Especially muthafuckas with that gay-ass production
New millenium homo sound
Smack the shit out of you for doin that wack-ass shit you do
50 bodyguards surround you
Keepin men that fuck you in the ass around you
Standin like you runnin shit, you ain't the fuckin President
Posin with ugly bitches in your video who take AIDS medicine
You don't wanna fuck with me or rock with me
Or rhyme on any block with me
Fuck the rap museum
I should be on the wall next to Run-D.M.C
Between Public Enemy
Some asshole was jealous of me
I don't care no more about your lyrics
The average MC is bullshit, I don't hear it
Fuck you talkin about you rap with a good spirit
I make rappers intimidated
Over wack-ass beats they get motivated, some have ministrated
Even suburban kids copy your shit and duplicate it
My balls you now cherish
By some new-ass MC about to perish
Type of muthafucka to eat a lotta celery
Your CD was butter-soft - what you tellin me?
A bunch of 'N Sync type of fans hyped you up like Bill Bellamy
A bitch like you would rhyme with a curfew
Niggas with real shit will hurt you
The girl scout club I refer you
Bastard you
Your man rap, new nigga, he's wack, fuck you
Stay low, I'm above you
Erase your shit, I don't dub you
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU

FUCK YOU

Muthafucka
FUCK YOU

Yeah
You been rappin for 20'000 years
And you ain't got your fuckin deal yet?
What the fuck
Don't take your problems out on me
And the rest of you muthafuckas
Walkin around lookin like some old alien niggas

Muthafucka, I pull your face off
'bout to show you what the fuck you look like
Cause you keep it real
Too real muthafuckin broke
2001
Nobody was sayin that shit when I was payin for them fuckin hot wings
Hope you burn your fuckin lips

FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU

FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
