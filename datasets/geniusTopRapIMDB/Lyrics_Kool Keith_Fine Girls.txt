Fine Girls Lyrics[Keith] Hey baby.. my name is Keith
[Girl] Hi Keith
[Keith] I always see you comin home from school, work
Or college, wherever you comin from
[Girl] Mmm-hmm
[Keith] I'm a big secret admirer of you
I see you all the time
Sometimes you don't even look very happy
[Girl] No I'm not happy at all
[Keith] I wonder, what's really goin on in your life
Would you tell me?
[Girl] A lot of problems
[Keith] But I got things to tell you
[Kool Keith]
I like your pretty eyes
Tell me where you get your hair done, your face so clear
With fourteen carats diamonds in your ear
He beat you up, I'll eat you up, reheat you up
Come fix your life, make you my wife, improve in time
No wine and dine, don't waste my time, mature your mind
I redesign, you changin faces
Stop playin games girl, you two of clubs, I'm pluckin aces
Your girlfriends don't matter
Jealousy's another info, she thinks I'm mental
I love you keep it confidential

Chorus: Kool Keith

You're that fine girl from high school, college graduate
Lady always on my mind, girl can you imagine it?

{repeat Chorus 3X}

[Kool Keith]
I seen you cryin
Relyin on some old backbone prone
I give you stuffed animals, sprinkles on a chocolate cone
You turn your face up
Your body shaved legs to the waist up
You feelin sad, face down, always lookin mad
I counteract, eye contact
Spot you out where the maps at
I caught you starin, why you actin baby?
There's no slackin, the second time I work this
This ain't no clown and circus
You takin Advil, for headaches
I met you girl on purpose
Stressed out with girlfriends
That zero hero leasin his Benz
You under peer pressure
(You think about it girl, think what you really doin)
You might also like{repeat Chorus 4X}

[Kool Keith]
I dial your home phone
Know your code and area zone
You trapped in mom's house, restrictions feel like Minnie Mouse
I know you turnin yearnin learnin
Plus your heart is burnin, I'm still concerned while you blinkin
My mind is thinkin, outside your area
You got that space for occupation, big motivation
Let me drop my fierce information

Come here girl, I wanna talk to you
I wanna tell you a lot of things
Different things that you never talked about
Different things you had to go through
What I've been through, before you've even been with
I'm tellin you

{repeat Chorus 4X}1Embed
