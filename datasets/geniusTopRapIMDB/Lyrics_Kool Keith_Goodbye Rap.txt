Goodbye Rap LyricsGoodbye rap
This song is about everybody involved in hip-hop
People that just came into this business so late
All the DJs that don’t know what they are doing, that don’t know real records
And everybody that think they can rap, wasting time
This song is called ‘Goodbye Rap.’

This song is the last song
I quit rap, couldn’t find competition
I threw hip-hop in the garbage
The rap hall of fame had to pay homage
While everyone was fat cookin’ sausage
I was wearin’ ostrich
Rap ain’t been the same since I had it hostage
The last song I guess was written wrong
First class flight I’m leavin’ MCs to fight over who’s the best, I’m gone
To a secret shelter in space
An astronaut ready to take off
Go home to the Bat Cave and take my cape off
A rock star, still I will shock tomorrow
Rap went out the door, all MCs cry with tears
Miss my metaphor
Inspiration gone now they gotta see artificial tissue on tour
From the Bronx, true story
Ask Bambaataa and Kool Herc
I don’t rap no more, I don’t rap no more
That’s it
And the downloaders you get no credit
You destroyed your own thing all over
Remember that. You ain’t really fly
The ciphers… WHACK
Everybody samplin’ old man records… WHACK
Everybody tryin’ to collect records… WHACK
Everybody trying to get up on open mics… WHACK
All the DJs playing trendy music… WHACK
Commercial artists trying to collaborate with pop artists… WHACK
Everybody trying to think they can grow dreads to become hip-hop… WHACK
Finalists and panelists talking on TV shows trying to judge rap… WHACK
People that just got into rap yesterday… WHACK
