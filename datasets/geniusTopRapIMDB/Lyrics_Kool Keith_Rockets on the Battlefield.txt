Rockets on the Battlefield Lyrics[Intro]
Raising levels, Jim
Flight seven oh four three two one, red four
Green expanding to one
Moving levers up at seven decimal eight
Moving two point liters down
All systems go, red lights are off
Greens are showing
Coming through

[Verse 1]
Levels shifting, get swift on analog sounds, pounds of rock guitars
Microchips incredible antibiotic medicine, better than Octo
Although created by the master genius
You seen this when I take your mind out to Venus
With the formats on DAT tape you can't remake or duplicate
Hesitate for a minute on deck like Rennie Stennett
Pittsburgh Pirate, admire it, you can't hire it
Job applications for rappers with weak shows
Weak flows, by most inherited weakness
You can't stop my uniqueness
Complication altitudes built in compartments
Digital gizmo made by Continental Lincoln keeping you thinking
Better made than European's robot John H. Thomas
Model seven decimal put out by Jaguar
Without the automatic chemical release
Emergency vomit regurgitates any system
Regular or even more antique products put out by top companies
MCA, Warner Brothers, Loud the Polygram enterprise
Virgin masters get melted, you felt it
Through my radiation, foes move on buses
Planes leave the train station, evacuate quick!
(Mechanical legs, mechanical legs)
[Hook]
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven"
(Now, meow, blah!)
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven"
(Goin' wild with our sound now!)
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven"
Rockets on the battlefield
"Tango three left turn ahead, taxi to parking cross seven"

[Verse 2]
Release date M6, photographs on Columbia/Ruffhouse description green
With blue ears sky blue shirt that work by remote controls
Burn up Billboard charts, deactivating 1975 music, old soul
Will never go gold, while records warp
Insulting your duplicating of a sample
You will become an example, uncreative peasants
By the lessons of the untalented ones
Signed by your most stupidest A&R
We'll see how far representation information documents
While I stand like monuments
Stun your area like a airborne carrier
United Parcel deliver parts for a start
Cold blooded with a mechanical heart, standing like the Tin Man
Aluminum kneecaps release raps like rayguns, destroying territories
Toys, pterodactyl dinosaurs get bombed in space wars
Laying on galactic floors, amputated, disconnected collections
In more than fifty sections, warehouse with skulls
Land amphibians, welfare recipients
With beautiful women from the Carribean
The ships need repair

[Verse 3]
Not compared to no rapping high flight, member of the A.S.S.R
Immigrants stand in factories, endorsements, six MCs
You seen what The Source meant
Cover stories from the government left you standing
Holding the mic with one hand and
Handicapped with damage, you can't manage style nine-nine
2000 B.C. the sneakers in spacious me in 3-D
Wireless radius, MCs outdated, completion deleted
Japan newspapers in Australia, did you read it?
Over and out, moving with swift Celsius, I melted him down
Jet moving up, level seven seven six oh
With Darth Vader and 3P0
R2-D2, me too, coming to see you
