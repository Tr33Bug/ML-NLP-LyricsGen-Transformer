[Kool Keith]
Bumpin systems, rollin down the street in Detroit, Michigan
I switch again, bucket seats with my girlfriend
Wearin Paco in a Bronco, cologne is Pronto
Movin quickly like the Lone Ranger, X is Tonto
Back up the turnpike, Oldsmobile's roll with two pipes
440 engine blowin wind, through her hair extension
Two bags of six packs, with .38's, wrapped in gift packs
Big attitude she's on the two train, I roll like Mad Max
Keep it simple baby young girl, now squeeze yo' pimple
How dare you walk around ignore the First National Bank
My name is unknown, don't dial my family call me Hank
I go way back, like you still shop at Alexando's
Buy your sandals for your little son, named Romandos
Watch your step Theresa, chew up on your slice at Easter
You might also like[Sadat X]
Can you surround me in the black tan
My living room, trips to Cancun, with these - eighty ladies
The Jefferson's to the Brady, Sanford and the Son
I want the whole world and my old girl back
She left me for the postman, now she send me letters
I got a bottle of Grand Marnier, drinkin in the stairway
With the wizard Kool Keith, and I'm SPORTIN my rhymes
Funeral chimes signal the beginnin of the end
Cowboy with more in, with my private dancin chicks
They live way out in the sticks, but I put em in the mix (uh-huh)
Took em to Reno in an old Camino, gamblin in a casino
The movie's Al Pacino

Chorus

[Kool Keith]
Got my check cashed, you posin new, stop actin girl, like a fool
Got the Benz on loan, Sadat rollin by your school
You brought your frontin friend Gwen, beggin for the Benjamin
I'll see you a ten, with a haircut, like Scottie Pippen
My man Mark rippin'in the backseat, my cousin Clifton
You get me pissed and wearin big gloves like Sonny Liston
Leon Spinks with afro on, ready to rob the Brinks
I see you got your thongs out, Daisy Dukes and buns out
You call me when you broken hearted, when your money runs out
Back from the Conway, you did it girl the blind way
Hold your horses, and evil forces
Don't press star for Pathmark, I'll be home after dark
I'm tired of Pop Tart
[Sadat X]
Yeah
I'm touchin Gwen with the butt love, the rubber glove
I'm touchin that ass she swingin her hair, claimin she's an actress
But wasn't she that same chick I seen with the black dress?
Traded the ninety-eight for the sixty-eight Mustang
Me and Keith at the bar, do they know who we are?
Apparently, because all the drinks are free
It's "Our house, in the middle of our street"
And when you come in here you better wipe your feet
I'm from Alburqueque, New Mex' to the great state of Texas
I rode across on a gray horse, ??
Get to the sauce and add spaghetti, non-pork (what?)
I'mma own New York, with a big spots of the BX
And German outposts, with the communists close (no doubt)
I'm verbose, I host, the most, y'all should roast me
People watch closely and rewind me on the tape
Study this here, then look and listen
Take a step back and watch the black pearl glisten
