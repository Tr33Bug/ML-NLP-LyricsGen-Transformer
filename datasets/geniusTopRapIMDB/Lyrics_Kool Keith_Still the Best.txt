Still the Best Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
American and European, national champion
Kool Keith, you know who I am
The master man, Willie Biggs, (big status)
Droppin nine-six and seven, (big status)
Skill.. Lotto winners

[Verse 1]
I taught New York City, the five boroughs how to rap
You can take that back, and pull them thongs our your rectum crack
I'm Poppa Large, big daddy, big penis in a Caddy
Retro petrol, I run that whole metro-politan area
Burnin ya, the style is scarin ya
You don't know, and half of y'all brothers can't flow
I'm Texas Swift, down South, they call me Frankie Joe
Keep pushin rigs, Mack trucks, drop off your girl's wigs
I'm strictly business, no gimmicks, a rhymin expert
No common style, or wack logo, cheap hip-hop shirt
You best to be prepared, paperclips, on your mouth
I rock Virginia, tag Atlanta, 95 South
Then hit Miami, let the girls feel my stiff jammy
I'm national kid, girls like the way I dress
[Hook]
I'm still the best, I'm still the best, East to West
Joe Kingpin, big stack, money Willie Biggs
I'm still the best, I'm still the best, East to West
Joe Kingpin, big stack, money Willie Biggs

[Verse 2]
Superfly get back, your whole group is Freddie's Dead
Rap style pee stain, like yellow spots on your bed
I'm Jay Gloom, on the streets, still walkin doo-doo
You can't stop me, step off, now let your girl jock me
I ride a bus and tail just like a Kawasaki
Motorcycle, swift with gloves, I'm here to damage ya
Political style flop, your child play is amateur
Yo take that word, I rip your anus, youse a herb
I get in rectum, zoom focus on your whole room
Wear green capes and walk in clubs like I'm Dr. Dooom
Handblock double switch monkey style, flying horsemen
Crab leg, walk on top of rappers, then I cross men
I be the Silver Surfer, glidin with a fly leather
With gold chains, my glasses fog in the rainy weather
We do this like Brutus, I make you say, "Who dis?"
The man on the mic's right, cover your styles tonight
I do my duty destruct, take skin off your booty
Masquerade man is ill, Keith spinnin reel to reel
(Who played the number tonight? I put six on a five
Shoulda combinated, go 'head baby)

I'm still the best, I'm still the best, East to West
Joe Kingpin, big stack, money Willie Biggs

Big Willie, Big Willie
Big Willie-heyyyeah-heyyy
Big Willie, Big Willie
Big Willie heiyyyyyy

[Verse 3]
You're not competition, no joke, I know your kinfolks
That sloppy Gotti style just a bowl of Wheat Oats
No matter how mean or point blank hard you look
I cover my eye, retarded bugged like I'm Captain Hook
Like Vincent Price, I'm nice, I bake and coke you twice
Your crew is rat turd, your parakeet flow is bird
At my night show lick my pubic hair, tell me word
I'm basic nasty, with tight moves, smart like Lassie
Classical winner bass, pumpin while your sound is thinner
I kick back, with drawers off, invite your girl to dinner
Get sexy raw, the champagne pours even more
No forcefield, I rhyme erotic, feel myself on tour
I'm so delicate, countin cash, too intelligent
(Yeah, I bought the dream book
Gon' play what I got to play tomorrow
Do this right, yeah)

[Hook]
I'm still the best, I'm still the best, East to West

Joe Kingpin, big stack, money Willie Biggs
