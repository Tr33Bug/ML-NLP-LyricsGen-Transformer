[Verse 1]
I'm a leopard with leper skin, (factual?) that's steppin' in
I guess they went from mulberry to strawberry
That will show 'em how to use the (?) cock the pen
Pronounce syllables with oxygen
Put laundry on Marie Osmond, watch me bring profits in
Accountant act will come out your esophagus
I can see your wordplay close up like binoculars
Show 'em (?) red wine, go with fish eggs and octopus
I'm a mafia boss, twin brother of Rick Ross
'Til Maybach pull up, I'm givin' out jobs off the books
The see through Bugatti make Danny Green wanna look
You rollin' windows up manual, let me show 'em buttons I push like polygram and Def Jam
The iron fist I bought from Iron Man on my left hand
Tuxedo made by Vince Camuto
I'm ready to ballroom dance, put Janet somewhere where she won't panic
Virgins come up first class on Atlantic
Many hopped on Wingo, the Bentley Coupe got me writin' romantic
I'm hyped with nannies, Vanessa Williams in panties
All B-U-S to try an extreme from Sammy's
Steroid taker with the leather mask... With Maxine

[Verse 2: Godfather Don]
Yeah
The bushmaster, we shush disaster like kush and shastas
Unlimited rounds, demented with imminent sounds
The master's pound is senator-bound
Pretended the crown of a clown with a pen is profound
Walk in the room; Boom! Turn the ish to a tomb
Poisonous fumes consume a toy's voice 'n' his tunes
We sicknesses fake Adidas spitter we slick it in wigs
Ridiculous, he split, it's a mystery hit
Ominous looks, terrorize a con and his crooks
The dominant don, prominent for (?) with his (jukes?)
Nothin' common; it's anonymous
Designin' this nine 'n' it hit ya monitors with timin' that'll ponder your mind
Remindin' ya spine we tapped it, smacked it around
Like Monica with kanaka shots definin' the crime
I'm the incredible gamma man, roll in the AM van
Eternally fresh, leave ya soul for the ambulance
The day to smash a black-as-Madagascar
As a matter for rappers; the rash is a graphic disaster
The path of the blast is nasty when slackers are splattered
And they silly chatter shattered, like a stratocaster
