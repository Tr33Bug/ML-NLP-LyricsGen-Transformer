Super Hero Lyrics[Chorus]
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero—

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
JVC is nice
I've been around Japan
It's electronic, calls me Viktor
High on the scales, off the Richter
The media say I'm mature, check me out on Wikipedia
Coach them off their walkers
Let them walk again and run and speed up
I come from a place where superheroes meet up
The X Men drinkin' tea watchin' chicks with D cups
Spiderman saw Doctor Oct spittin' off the top of a New York City bus
City Island eatin' shrimps
Throwin' fries in water to swans and ducks
It'd be wrong to the universe if I drive with a monster green Lamborghini up
All the 5s come out to reunite, throw their beanies up
I molest cholesterol, you's a fine tune abuser
The Yankees lost but the blue and orange team amuse us
I could make a million rappers whisper and hush
Cold Stone ice cream, you don't have to lick that much
They hold my balls, easy soft touch
Throw your ladies some bucks
The reindeers jump out, you need that antler juice
Ski hat with the mommy goose
[Chorus]
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero vision; sonic—listen
It's superhero—

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Vik' in the sick captain's pilot suit
Designed by Travolta out his mind
Is in the mind of another culture vulture
Threw him from Tulsa to this dimension
Right on time for the heroes-hustlers convention
It's no admission, you gotta be on the list
Play your position, peon, against the metal fist
He's on a purely secular mission
Stroll through wearin' the DOOM Clarks, second edition
Web slinger need a beat, well black him out
Flank him out, test his spidey senses on his bank account
For illest mention he hermaphrodite whose pants was tight
Who dance aight
Gave it to Puck from Alpha Flight
The mask was bright as lightnin'
Same type of shinin' got them Teen Titans fightin'
Sippin' on that She-Hulk milk, at least she said it was milk
In a Hello Kitty catsuit, I bet it was silk
Grabbed the award for bein' hella raw
Of course he scored the relic for
Until next rhyme, y'all—Excelsior!
