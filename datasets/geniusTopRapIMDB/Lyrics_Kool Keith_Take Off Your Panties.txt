Take Off Your Panties Lyrics[Kool Keith]
Coming Thursday, at the New Orleans Superdome
With special attraction, Kool Keith
Straight from the Bronx, New York City
Tickets, go on sale now

[singing]
Take off your panties
Let me see your G-string, let me see, what you got
Take off your panties, let me see your G-string
Let me see, let me see
[Kool Keith]
Girl it's been a long time, since I saw you
Don't you know I adore you
Lick your earlobes like candy
I love the turquoise and the silver silk panties
Take you on a trip, not the Bahamas, a room in the Marriott
A elegant martini with Calvin Klein pajamas
The camera ready to film and take pictures
Act like a exotic dancer tonight, I'ma get wit'cha
Take you out of the boring mode to high scoring mode
Explore your private sensation, put you on a new road
Get you in the new life, leave the old ideas down
Go 'head work the pole (work the pole girl)

[singing]
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got

[Kool Keith]
With the love I have for the baby lotion
The tub water runnin your lingerie is stunnin
Exceptionally gorgeous, the princess bedroom set
I purchased for you, you thought I couldn't afford this
The best massager, you need the best kiss
Dreams come true, you make your best wish
By the time the morning light shines
The teardrop cheeks begin peeking through the window blinds
Last night I was delighted hearing your moans and sighs
Erotic adventure with the mint green mascara around your eyes
Work that pole, pole, pole (girl work that pole baby)

Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got

[Kool Keith]
A four week vacation in Mexico
I taught you everything, you can't let me go
You cry when I eat it though
Scream out your orgasms when I'm heated though
Run my fingers through your hair extremely so
You can dance for me and act like you in a go-go
Together in Manhattan we walk through SoHo
You dial my phone and tell me I'm home solo
Relax by the bed, I see you in fire engine red
The mask over your eyes, latex police had on top of your head
Submissive and kinky, you can't resist everything I said
(Work that pole girl)

[singing]
So baby take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you got
Take off those panties; let me see, what you gotEmbed
