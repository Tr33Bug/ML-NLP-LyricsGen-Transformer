Tired Lyrics[Produced by Futurewave and Ol' Man 80zz]

[Intro - Kool Keith]
Yeah
I'm so tired
I'm tired of everybody
Those who are envious
Those who can't stand it
Those that it hurt
Their little hearts, their soul
[Verse 1 - Kool Keith]
Tired of everybody knowing where I'm at, my whereabouts
Rappers who ain't recording, just sitting home chewing bean sprouts
Lazy boys who sink in the couch, that's why I'm tired
They deny it in private, some sleep so tired
They won't open their eyelids
They get surprised when I come up and shine like the sun
I just look at them, I'm tired of what they haven't done
Many chasing their own tail like a play puppy
I'm tired of people, adults who wear huggies
Who love to talk about me bad and bug me
Knowing I'm up there with Kanye and Kid Cudi
Jay-Z is my buddy
The masons say I'm not fake
I can't believe I'm so good, I'm in the studio with carrot cake
Other rappers bake

[Hook - Kool Keith]
I'm tired
I'm so tired of
I'm really tired
I'm tired
I'm tired of the laziness
Fugaziness
I'm tired
I'm really tired
I'm tired
You might also like[Verse 2 - Edo G.]
I'm tired of no relief
Turned over a new leaf
New leash, you chumps never knew grief
Getting stole like a true thief
Edo and Kool Keith, tired of getting played like a motif
You punks don't know beef
Y'all just living with no peace
I got beliefs but ain't wishing to it
Ain't tired of radio 'cause I don't listen to it
I'm tired of cops that don't love us
But I'm more tired of my brothers killing brothers
Weather going take the planet from us
I'm tired of promoters, trying to take advantage of us
I'm tired of complaining, people sitting next to me
Looking at my hands, control my own destiny
I'm tired
I'm so tired

[Hook - Kool Keith]
I'm tired
I'm so tired of
I'm really tired
I'm tired
I'm tired of the laziness
Fugaziness
I'm tired
I'm really tired
I'm tiredEmbed
