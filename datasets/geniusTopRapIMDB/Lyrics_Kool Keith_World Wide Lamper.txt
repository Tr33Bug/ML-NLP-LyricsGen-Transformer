World Wide Lamper Lyrics[Produced by Number One Producer]

[Hook: Kool Keith]
World wide lamper, world wide lamper, world wide lamper

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Between my legs the ladies like the way I ball handle
Especially when I'm going to the basket making examples
Reverse dunking a punk and tap your girl on the butt
When she shoot at the foul line
Coach many from the top like Phil Jackson
The matte perrriwinkle, Rolls Royce Wraith is accurate
Job application rappers you can scratch when I itch
The nut-sack once a month on the fifth
Your mommy twerking while I smoke a spliff
She a mother of 19 kids, pass her a brick
When she wear a wig, export the imports
My jockstrap sniffed by T.S.A. at the airport
I see a lot of Mickey Mouses on the wrist, fossils don't count
Show you the Rolex, out of bounds
Prada leather trench
Your lady show pretty pink, to be Hershey dog brown
Take her off the campus with Dion and Colonel Sanders
The hawks looking for a good dude to cook food in Atlanta
Serve me frozen sodas from Fanta
More leg room, show me where they expand us
I heard of Kurt Rambis by the lot playing Krampus
[Hook: Kool Keith]
World wide lamper, world wide lamper

[Verse 2: B.A.R.S. Murre]
How gully do I keep it?
I can make you richest in the world so stop sleeping
In the rap game I'm the best kept secret
Never made a penny from it, you know how I'm eating
(Why they mad though?)
They mad 'cause I'm Fonzie
Walk up in the bar leaving with your aunt Ronnie
Plotting up a scheme like my last name's Ponzi
Push a button on you suckers so don't ever get cocky
(What you do for fun?)
I get a kick out of winning
My main man Roddie gets a kick out of sinning
Doesn't know gymnastics, but he always starts flipping
While I'm at the waterfalls on the rocks, I'm sipping
(They must like you)
Word being treated
From the roof of my castle looking down, I see you scheming
Stickup kids jotting in my motor, now they pleading
Every human being that ever tried to challenge been defeated
(You life life)
I live life like a coozhound
With a quarter ki of coke and my goose down
Hit the dance floor, ladies get loose now
Every time I leave I knock boots down
B.A.R.S. Murre gives fucks, none
I got that hot shit spitting out my tongue, tongue

World wide lamp, world wide lamp

[Verse 3: Dirt Nasty]
(Dirt Nasty, baby, faded now)
'Cause I socked your mom in front of Papa John's
Bumpin Dr. Octagon with your Walkman on
Don't make me switch my pitch up
I smack my bitch up in a Cadillac pickup truck
(Those don't exist)
I'm world wide lamping now
Skinny dip with your bitch, I-I I am the captain now
(I am the captain)
I sail the seven seas in a gold scuba kit that cost 87 G's
(That's expensive)
The ice cold freeze in the thaw on my dick when it's 88 degrees
Say cheese, ladies hit their knees
Cause my whip so sick that it got a disease
(Rest in peace)
Fuckboy wearing a turtleneck and corduroy
I'm eating dead Bok Choy with Soulja Boy
Yep, the palette exquisite
My gynecologist make a sushi fried chicken
(That's racist)
She be on some cop shit
Talk shit, I'mma sock you with a chopstick
Nah, bitch, I'mma knock you on the cockpit
Drop and kick your mom dick in a mosh pit
My suit is extinct
It's made of of ref panda, bear, beef ring
I meant to say it's made out left panda paw and lion mink
All red leather, bikini Sandusky made forever
And ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[Hook: Kool Keith]
World wide lamper, world wide lamper, world wide lamperEmbed
