Diggin’ the scene with the gangsta lean
Always clean and my rap is mean
The biggest fiend you’ve ever seen
Can you relate? Do you know what I mean?
I got money to flaunt, and I always get what I want
I got 50 ways to get ya
The erogenous zone of the female species
Attracts on to me, and if not, at least she’s
Stimulated to a point where she sees something intriguing
But to me she’s just suppressing her inner thoughts
Your physical jive can’t be bought
I got 50 ways to get ya

I’ll ask you for a play today, and if you say no, it’s okay
‘Cause I’ll just sit back and lay, ‘cause it’s a matter of time
‘Cause if I wanna be wit’cha, I’ll take my money and bet ya
If I really really want ya I can get ya by the end of this rhyme

I’ll take your mind on a mental trip, to a place you’ve never been
Make you see things in a way you never thought possible and then
I’ll change the gameplan, reverse the role
Sit back and let you take control
I got 50 ways to get ya

I’m making my gameplan soon as I spot ya
I’ll come over and speak, and if you like it or not-a
You’re gonna speak because you feel you got ta
At least say ‘hi,’ but then why not-a
Get to know me, but you better watch your step
Because before you know it, I gotcha
I got 50 ways to get ya

Some girls like to play the game
Make you wait a year like it ain’t the same
You don’t want a name and it’s a shame
We can’t have fun, you’re just prolonging the pain
You don’t wanna be hurt, that excuse is lame
I’m like a lion that can’t be tamed
I got 50 ways to get ya

Waiting around for the perfect guy
Nobody’s perfect and it’s not a lie
Why waste your time? Why even try?
Put the thought to rest, let it die, ‘cause
You know it’s true—it’s on you, now what you gonna do?
I got (50 ways) to get ya (50 ways)
(50 ways)

I’ll ask you for a play today, and if you say no, it’s okay
‘Cause I’ll just sit back and lay, ‘cause it’s a matter of time
‘Cause if I wanna be wit’ ya, I’ll take my money and bet ya
If I really really want ya I can get ya by the end of this rhyme
