All Night Long Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's about time for some action
I'm hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than physical attraction
'Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good head on her shoulders
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that I'll go to the butcher store
'Cause I'm choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The sweet magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
I'm up so get ready to work
All night long
[Verse 2]
How many ladies are deep enough
To handle a man like me
I mean mentally, emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like 'em hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like 'em old-fashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women that's a slave to passion
But knows when to resist
I like a woman that's not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever we're good to go
All night long

[Verse 3]
Scintillating, sultry, stimulating, sexy
Super, subtle, smart, and seductive
Sensitive, serious, succulent, sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of mental stimulation
That's causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I can't stand a groupie
But I'll always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause it's cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long

I never like to make the first move
I'mma rapper but I don't rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
I'm much too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
I mean someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if you're for real
And right is how I'll do ya
I'll give you something you can feel
It's like a romance from a storybook
Without the wine and candles
An encounter you'll never forget
But don't try it if you can't handle
All night long1Embed
