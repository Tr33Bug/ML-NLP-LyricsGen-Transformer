Art Of Rap Freestyle LyricsBraggadocious, rhythmic vernacular
Designed to back you up
I back it up with the spectacular
You're just a fraction of my perpendicular
With no particular linear structures
I'm giving you ruptures
As I erupt into your cerebellum
I tried to tell 'em, I open a vortex
Your cerebral cortex sends a reaction
That has 'em like a spasm
Upon further review, you see it was lyrical orgasm
How did it happen? You can't even describe the vibe
What was the essence of god's presence felt inside
Bestowed upon you from the moment I dropped it on you
I strike like a thief in the night and can't nobody warn you
I'm on you, I got that truly godlike
Metaphysical, Neolithical
Ask what you see in me, lyrical deity
Hip hop's pantheon, one step beyond so I stand beyond
Whatever Shaitan's fans be on
I lights 'em up like neon, locks 'em down like Dion
Reclaim my title three times like Ali when he beat Leon
And, that's what I be on for the peon (we gone)You might also likeEmbed
