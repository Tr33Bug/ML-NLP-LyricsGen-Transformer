Bad Mutha Lyrics[Intro]
Other MCs, I want you to know
If you ever wanna battle me, don't move slow
Come and get it 'cause I'm waitin' and I got nowhere to go
Head to head, toe to toe, rhyme for rhyme, blow for blow
We can go
(Bad self)
(Bad self)

[Verse 1]
Huh! When I get busy, the crowd gets dizzy
And when I'm on the stage, the party people say, "Is he
Really human or is he a robot?"
Because when I'm on the microphone nobod-
-y does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it, it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex, but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
'Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news (bad self)
Like Paul Revere: "A real rapper is here!"
Yeah, "Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming"
And teeth will chatter, plagiarists will scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin' me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
-ate 'cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin' my success but envious and cursin'
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound 'cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
[Hook]
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(Bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)

[Verse 2]
I put a hurtin' on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin' barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I wanna get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin', my talents start showin'
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin'
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MCs really startin' to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask 'em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin'
Like they don't know, they must be buggin'
But I like the controversy, it makes me bloodthirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you wanna act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad 'cause I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)
Scratch it!

[Verse 3]
I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do and here's an example
I won't make a "La-Di-Da-Di", an "Oh! Veronica"
A "Dear Yvette" or a "La-Latoya"
I'm not tryin' to diss the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly-rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this:
My voice is auriferous, coming out an orifice
Expressing hyperbole, verbally or if it's
Mental or symmetric that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion, an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a English dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin' suckers gather 'round, bow down and fellate me
'Cause what I do orally is something so morally
Stimulating, emulating heat that's callin' me
My mind is both flexible and resilient
Pugnacious, tenacious, vivacious, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MCs are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MCs, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad-
[Hook]
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(Bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(With your bad self)

[Verse 4]
Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughing and you'll be the stock
'Cause that's what's good about havin' you MCs on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But every time I speak I get unwanted protégés
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
'Cause you don't really want none 'cause I'm a bad, bad, bad-

[Hook]
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

[Outro]
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
(Bad self)Embed
