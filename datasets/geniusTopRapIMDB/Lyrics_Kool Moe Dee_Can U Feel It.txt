Can U Feel It Lyrics[Produced by Hula & K Fingers]

[Hook]
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the corner trying to elevate my mind
I try to rise to seven levels just to drop the nine
Tick-tock-tick as the clock clicks, I'm
Tryna figure out how to move you with a rhyme
The hip-hop scene is flipping so I'm flipping with the scene
I try to write the rhymes so you see it on the screen
And get the verbal picture so I can hit you like a flick
Booming in the jeeps on the wreck-shop tip
Hard as any force yet smooth-n-butter song
Don’t ever try to battle ‘cause you’re guaranteed a loss
I’m like a hurricane, tenacious, mundane
A devastating force, a threat to the game
I balance the imbalanced and I challenge the un-challenged
I’ve never been defeated but the efforts have been gallant
So open up your chakra, so I can really rock ya
So when I say I feel it, then you got to ‘cause I got ya
[Hook]
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

[Verse 2]
Sitting on the park watching brothers play ball
I was in the nothing but the yes-yes-y’all
Never made no money but I had to pay dues
I rock around the block and rock the neighborhood crews
No ganging and no banging and no hanging, I refuse
I never sold paper but I spread the news
I never carried guns ‘cause I refuse to lose
I had to choose a weapon so I chose to chew
The microphone, the hyper tone is like I own the park
And I can throw a show and flow like Noah's flowing Ark
For forty days and forty nights, partied in the dark
While stepping till the A.M. total mayhem, ripped apart
Rumors liven fallacies and rap was just a fad
Unless a form of music use ‘cause that was all we had
But out of the oppression rises yet another leader
And this is just the vehicle to feel it when I feed ya
You might also like[Hook]
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?

[Verse 3]
On the journey, the excellent trying to put it in a rhyme
I try to drop the funky lyrics in my travel time
Drop esoteric knowledge with an esoteric sign
I’m the Son of Man, but who was Mankind?
The highest form of nature's Afro-Asiatic base
So when it comes to music then I got to drop bass
So check the vibe as I rectify
I’ll connect advantage and the rhyme that amplifies
Radiates and animates and activates on
Manifesting unquestioned powerful force
Energy is tapered when the vapors are caught
But I’ll do battle with myself like a sport
In tune with the universe, wicked with the pen
Lyrics got the elements and this is how I win
I flow like water, blow like wind
Grow like earth, so feel the fire within
[Hook]
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?
When you feel it
You know you need it
Can you feel it?Embed
