Death Blow Lyrics[Intro]
"To the break of dawn, to the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the..."
Time's up punk
Yeah, yeah, time to settle the score
"To da break of dawn," another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go

[Verse 1]
Here we go, beat down round two
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
(To the break of dawn) Beats, nitro
Lyrics, weak, say goodnight yo
"Star Trek shades," man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off, you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E you're riding me
T-O-D-D, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing?
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it? (Yeah) finished? (Burp)
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sic ya like a dog, dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause you're nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets in with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb?
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you with a death blow
[Hook]
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)

[Verse 2]
My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man, brother let go
No apologies, tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, your mama won't know ya
Cause I'ma rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read, "He had no win"
So R-I-P, Rest in peace, ripped 'em
D-I-D, dead indeed, did 'em
An H-I-T, hitman (so whatcha hit him with?)
A rhyme silencer, I hit him with a death blow
You might also like[Hook]
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)
(Kill 'em, kill 'em)

[Verse 3]
If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (scratch) knew it
I'ma send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marley Marl can't save you from fallin'
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do?
(To the break of dawn) Another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
(I'm that type of guy) Oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lackadaisical, listless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larcenist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish, language, local logo
Light, laboring, limited, loco
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
Your records ain't hot and your shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, (Hard as hell)
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, who's your daddy?
[Interlude]
Kill 'em, kill 'em
(Make you say "Daddy I don't want none)
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

[Kool Moe Dee Talks]

Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on, head-to-head, Kool Moe Dee versus LL
Put a little pressure on him 'cause the boy ain't got no heart
'Cause he knows what time it is
And anybody out there that don't know what time it is, remember
I never said the brother couldn't make a good record
But when it comes to a battle, we gotta go head-to-head on them lyric tip
And when it come to lyrics, he can't hangEmbed
