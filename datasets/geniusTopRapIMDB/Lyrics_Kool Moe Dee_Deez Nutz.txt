[Verse 1]
Once again it's the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame, watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Ain't it a shame? (rap is goin crazy)
The lyrical skills (are gettin kinda lazy)
The gift they're shootin (couldn't even graze me)
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play, G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind, only a handful
Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness, flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet, I'm tired of hearin this
'Bang bang, shoot em up, ba-boo, you get buck-bucked'
If you ain't down with what's up
Then you can get with these...

You might also like[Verse 2]
Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows
It's up and down and out you go
So back up, re-group, slow down and check the cut
And if you still ain't down, get up on these...

[Verse 3]
I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge
This is a hostile take-over, I'm takin over, searg
Give me your stripes and your mics, enough is enough
You can roll with us, or you can roll with these...

[Chorus]
Nutz (rap is goin crazy)
Deez nutz (rap is goin crazy)
Deez nutz (rap is goin crazy)
Deez nutz (crazy)
