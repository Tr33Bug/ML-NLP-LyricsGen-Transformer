Gangsta Boogie Lyrics(So you wanna be a gangster
So you wanna be a gangster)

[Hook]

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
(So you wanna be a gangster)
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
[Verse 1]

Fast women, fast cars
Fast money, movie stars
Lights, cameras, glitz and glamor
Action role and broken grammar
Gangster lean, threads are clean
Talking red, black and green
Gold and diamonds, ride shinin'
Tape playing, Moe Dee rhymin'
Living large, big mirage
Cops scheming, pay the sarge
Girls want him, Feds taunt him
Streets haunt him, spirits mourn him
Chasing ladies, making babies
Living shady, wild and crazy
Doing crime, doing time
Favorite line: This world is mine
City slicker, big nigga
More bodies than Adolf Hitler
Cold-blooded killer man
Executing a killer's plan

[Hook x2]

Ha-ha-ha-hardcore, encore
Drug war, blood pours
Watch your back, got a pack
Keep a gun, on the run
Think quick, move slick
Ladies' trick, take your pick
Money rollin', pockets swollen
Rep growin', know you're goin'
Work a show when fear is showin'
Money stolen, and who's holdin'
Paranoid, self-employed
Can't avoid homeboys
Work wit'cha, mic hit ya
Somebody's gonna get ya
Cops bust 'em, can't trust 'im
Didn't talk, got to dust 'im
You get him or he'll get you
Some police in on it too
Stand tall, take a fall
Last call, take 'em all

[Verse 3]

B-Bum rap, death trap
Backtrack, think back
Bad decision, blurry vision
Money missin', on a mission
Want position, steady wishin'
Never listen in hell's kitchen
When you're livin', do or die
The strong survive, sell or buy
Crackheads, living dead
Their problem, they'll solve 'em
No tears, who cares
Getting yours, taking theirs
Meanwhile, on trial
Evidence on file
Next stop, state pen
Bigshot kingpin
Scarface wannabe
Now you're gonna see
The light clear, too late
Sold your soul, shows your fate
Bad karma, time to pay
Got to go, judgment day
Sold out, now you're cursed
Life in jail, if they don't kill you first
[Hook x2]Embed
