Get Paid LyricsMoney (Get paid) x4

I know I'm rockin'
So stop your sockin'
Baby maybe if you play your cards right
I'll be knockin' those boots in the future
You're kindda cute
You got a man I understand
See I won't dispute you
I'm here to have fun
That's my only purpose
Nothing more than good friends
Cause that will only hurt us
And I'm very jealous
I know cause all the fellows
And I get from the school of cool
Where they tell us to get paid
I'm making money
And now it's kindda funny
All of a sudden the girls
They want to give me honey
They're always scheming
Their eyes are gleaming
Dollar signs written all over them, stop dreaming
Cause I'm upon it and I know you want it
I got the money and I know you want it
You try to play me
And you'll get played
Cause I come from the school of cool
And all we do is get paid

Trying to get money (Get paid)

At a party, girls they like to throw me body
They figure it's easy cause they know that I'm a hottie
I give them rhythm
I hang out with them
Then they always wanna know what else can I give them
Nothing but a hard time and a hard way to go
Don't tell you what you want to hear only what you need to know
Don't let no wedding bells ring
Don't pay no choir to sing
Ain't no diamond ring in this thing
I just want to get paid

Whenever I'm dating girls they always heavy weighting
Of course they treat me [?]
I wear the [?] cause they know what I'm about
Spending money having fun and eating out
So they take me around to the best restaurants
Hand me a menu and say you can have what you want
Pizza Lobster Sushi Chicken Steak
I say forget it, lets go to the bank
I just wanna get paid
