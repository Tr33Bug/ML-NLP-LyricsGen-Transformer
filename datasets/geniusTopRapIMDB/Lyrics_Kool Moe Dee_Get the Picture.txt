Get the Picture Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to go for mine
From the bottom to the top is a hard climb
But hard rhymes beat hard times
Gimme a spotlight and I'll shine
Brighter than the brightest star
No matter who you are
You're outdone, I won and for the coup de gr√¢ce
Competition turns into fans
Like a politician, my competition spans
From country to country it's never too far
'Cause I'll take 'em all from the Shah to the Czar
The Fu Man Chu, the Prime Minister too
The King and the Queen, my rhymes are so mean I'll do
A number on the country like never before
Is it a contest, or the threat of world war
Choose your weapon, no half-steppin' and let's go
But if ya steppin', watch ya step and step slow
Take your time, change your mind
Cause steppin' to my rhyme is like steppin' on a land mine
Blowing you to kingdom come, this ain't Vietnam
A brother thinks he's ready for war, bring him on
A perilous journey, you catch a hernia
Trying to burn me 'cause like an attorney
I'll cross-examine
Your rhymes of my design
And I'm still standing tall
As the competition falls, in actuality ain't no competition y'all
Cause I'm rollin' over rappers like a U.S. tank
Meanwhile I'm laughin' all the way to the bank

Suckers
Tried to put me down
Said rap was crap and wouldn't be around
Any longer than two years
But eight years later I'm still here
Fully paid because the rhymes I made
Made dollars and cents, I wasn't dense, I stayed
Away from drugs, I never touched a pipe
When I wanna get high, I smoke the mic
I never did white lines, 'cause I only write lines
And I ain't sniffin' nothing but the vapors from hype rhymes
As I start to float on the rhymes I wrote
Ascending to a level with the gods and I tote
Loads and mounds of people as they reach new heights
A half-a-mile from heaven is the party site
And I'm the attraction, the Gods will be packed in
Coming out of their pockets for me to rock it and acting
Like they've never ever ever been entertained
They try to act godly but they can't maintain
Aphrodite would freak, as her knees get weak
And Venus would peak off every word I speak
And Zeus would get loose, fully induced
And I'll make Apollo's ryhmes sound like Mother Goose
By night's end, Mercury is so hyped
He'd spread the word that there's a god on the mic
Captivating all the other gods by the masses
Described as a dark-skinned brother in glasses
But unlike the other gods, I ain't a myth
You wanna riff, I suggest you take the fifth

[Verse 3]
Knowledge
Is the source of my success
History is the course and life's the test
For those who don't know history's repetitive
The lack of knowledge serves as a sedative
Makes you relax and max the lack of facts
Holds you back and then the odds are stacked
Against a weak mind, it makes a meek mind
But mine ain't weak, I got a piece and I'ma speak mine
Telling you the truth as I raise the roof
With rhymes so hard I'm bulletproof
One slip of the lip and I can sink your ship
You wanna get hip, let's take a trip
All aboard, this is the last call
It ain't a mandate cause I'll only ask y'all
Once and only once yo purchase a ticket
Get on the rap train, watch me kick it
From state to state and every little hick town
They'll all be down with the new hip sound
Treating me like more than just a star of the sport
But more like the judge in a court
They all rise and throw their hands in the air
Pump their fists and solemnly swear
To rock the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
Not only the youth
Cause the young and the old are all alike
It makes no difference when I'm on the mic
For those who can't visualize what their eyes can't see
You wanna get the picture, focus on me
