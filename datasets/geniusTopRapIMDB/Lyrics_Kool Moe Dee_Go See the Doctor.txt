Go See the Doctor Lyrics[Intro]
But three days later, go see the doctor...

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neat and petite
She was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
And so I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said "Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it"
They said "Did you get it?" I said "Yeah," they said "How was it?"
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
[Verse 2]
I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said "Goodnight"
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said "Mama mia!"
I'ma kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got the more I reminisce
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said "Hey good looking, what you got cooking?"
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
'Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way, stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

[Verse 3]
I went to the doctor's office, I said "What have I got?"
He said "Turn around boy and take this shot"
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said "What?
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt"
He turned and said in a real deep voice
"Have it your way if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Would just kick her, so go take karate"
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said "Next time I'll use some protection"
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctorYou might also like3Embed
