How Kool Can One Blackman Be Lyrics[Produced by Teddy Riley]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ice water, watch your daughter
Your mother and your sisters, aunts
Nieces and your wife's ought to
Know, ain't nobody safe when I'm in the place
I'm dropping more bass when face-to-face
Erase haste with the taste of a steady pace
Ain't no time to waste and it ain't no race
You state your case and work your weights
Without a trace... and just wait
For double-black to double back and make that move
Break it to ya, I'ma do ya, and I ain't that cool
Enough to take you plus I ain't just
Here to bust, so you know what: it ain't just
Another brother or another joke with money
Cause I'm giving you something to work with honey
You can feel the heat but it ain't no pressure
When I turn the heat on, the cool breeze'll refresh ya
[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

[Verse 2]
Put it in flow-motion, ice cool with a nice cool breeze
Native-sung native tongue for the young ladies
Dropping rhymes, rocking minds and concubines
Treat it like a king of this hip hop thing that rhymes
Manifest as a vehicle, and see a full
Picture I'm wit'cha, I'll hit'cha with mixtures
And become a fixture inside your heart
Make you feel the pulse of my beat even miles apart
Ain't no mountain high enough, or a valley low
To stop Kool Moe, I got a cosmic flow
I glow like a moon, it dictates your mood
But cool ain't a mood, it's an attitude dude
It's a tone, it's a tempo, a mindset, a rhythm
A lifestyle, religion, it's just how you're livin'
I'm righteously cool while here and hereafter
I'm so cool that I have to ask ya

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

Easy does it, not because it's easy
Turn the heat on and it still won't freeze me
Internal climate control controls the climate
That's why I rhyme at the temperatures I'm at
Usually freeze competitive emcees
And breaks them down in threes, and lights them up like Christmas trees
Fortified with tranquility, to deal with the trilogy
I got the ability for upward mobility
Break calm, genetically athletically mental
Exercising thoughts cause I went through
Party like a trooper, complete mind fighter
And now I'm known, a super elite rhyme writer
Now there's women and millions in dollars and loads
Fly gear to wear as the stage explodes
Role model for the people cause I keep a level head
When I look into the mirror the reflection said

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

[Verse 4]
I never lose my composure cause I ain't supposed to
I rose for the occasion, thoughts never froze, I chose
A pattering pattern that patterned to the battle zone
You can get rattled home, so don't even travel, roam
Or drift or wander into my vicinity
I'll respond and conk with no affinity
Identity scrape, broken down on tape
And it ain't no escape, and you gets no breaks
I make few mistakes cause I strive for perfection
Head for the hills if I shoot in your direction
Protection's limited, heroic images
Are broken down, hell-bound from the minute its
Image is amplified, I'll be damned if I
Believe the hype of stereotypes, I plan to die
Like a warrior, fight until I'm free
How cool Can One Black man Be?
[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?1Embed
