I Go to Work Lyrics[Verse 1]
I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate, I make miracles happen
Just from rappin', I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin' and explodin'
On the scene mean, I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills, then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill as I build a guild
For all the rappers of skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
'Cause my right-hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keepin' at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy "Yo man, you heard what he said?"
Another funky rhythm, look at your man and give him
A high five 'cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it, I go to work
[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation
Of rappers and after I came off vacation
I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
So open the door, playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse, I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
And after I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with endless rhymes, don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous, and when this
Rhyme is done, your mind will become
So trapped in the rap, you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait, it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch, my rhyme rocks ya
Sometimes it knocks ya so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch, but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil's
Writing a rhyme in its highest form
And I'ma drop it on ya like a bomb
And when it explodes, I'll blow up
A few casualties, but so what?
If you're slow, you blow; you know you go
I flow I throw all-pro, I go to work
[Break]

[Verse 4]
To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work
