I’m A Player Lyrics[Sampled Intro]
(“1, 2, 3, 4”)
(“Ain’t no trick”)

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, you think that maybe
We could hang out? But not today because
I got another date, and I’m already late
But here’s my number, call me, don’t procrastinate
When you get home, pick up the phone
Leave me with a message, don’t leave me with a dial tone
And when I finish hanging out with this girl tonight
I’m calling you, and you better act right
She said, “Hold it, you got a lot of nerve
What makes you think you deserve
A call from me,” and I said “Save it
If you didn’t want my number, you woulda gave it back to me
Right away, and as I walked away, under her breath, I heard her say
“You’ve got it, I’ll call you later”
You like the way I played her? I’m nothin’ but a player
I’m a player (“Ain’t no trick”)
Nothin’ but a player
I’m a player (“Ain’t no trick”)

[Verse 2]
So what, I’m a player, playing the field
If you want me, you better yield
Proceed with caution, without a doubt
I’m the guy your mother warned you about
But I won’t deceive you, love you or leave you
Don’t tell me that you love me ‘cause I won’t believe you
I’m straight up with you so be straight up with me
You could do what you wanna do and let me be what I wanna be
And that’s a player, girl-layer, rhyme sayer
I’m on a mission to prove that today a
Man doesn’t have to lie, unless he’s just an average guy
Lying to girls just to get ‘em in bed
If anybody’s confused, I’ll repeat what I said
I’m a full-fledged player, you better believe it
Now you know what time it is, you can take it or leave it
I’m a player

(“Ain’t no trick”) (“Ain’t no trick”) I’m a player
(“Ain’t no trick”) (“Ain’t no trick”)

[Verse 3]
You said that I dissed you from the way I speak
Well, I call ‘em as I see ‘em—freak
Wanna play miss prissy innocent with me
When I know what you were doing last week
Riding around all over town, in and out of cars
Now how that sound?
You got a hundred beeper numbers in one phone book
And been with every other guy in town
If a guy has a hundred girls, he’s a hero
A girl with a hundred guys is a zero
Don’t blame me that society made the rule
But I think they made it for me
Varieties are right for me, but ladies in the place
Don’t you even try to be
A player, that’s my J-O-B, and I’m playing it to the T
I’m nothin’ but a player
You might also like(“Ain’t no trick”) I’m nothin’ but a player

[Outro]
What’s up, baby, we hanging out tonight or what?
No, you’ve got too many women
Yo, wait, wait, wait, whatever you wanna do
Whatever I wanna do? Alright, bust it
We goin’ out to the movies, take a little something to eat or whatever
And we go back to my zone and get busy
Oh, you ain’t wit’ it?
What you mean you don’t know me that well?
I met you an hour ago
Nah, nah, nah, I got it, I’ll tell you what
You ain’t wit’ it, forget about it
What’s your friend name?
Excuse me, excuse me, come here a second…1Embed
