I’m Blowin’ Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm T-N-T and I just can't lose
An E-M-C-E-E with a fuse
When it's lit I'm hit with the lyrical wit
Of a scientist, that's tryin' this
Sugar coated, rhyme loaded with gunpowder
Now see how the crowd will yell louder
Now the rhyme is dropped and you hear a pop
Think it's a shot but you just can't stop
Your heartbeat vibrates at my rate
So why wait, I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado the winds start gustin'
Rhymes unload, reload, and explode
Ride the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast, outlast, F the press
When I hit, it's like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
When I go I go for broke, I'm blowing up
[Versed 2]
I'm on the hype tip, I'm on the mic with
Tunnel vision, 'cause I'm mic whipped
Strung, from lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes that come from
A zone that's hidden and forbidden
If any man enters, good riddance
A mortal mind is just no contest
The rhyme zone is my conquest
The Twilight Zone will seem like child's play
Am I a genius? Heheh, I'll say
I'm so cool and yet so hyped
When I'm on the mic it's something like
Hiroshima, remember Pearl Harbor
Feel the fire but don't bother
To run for cover you don't escape
On record, compact disc or tape
Once you play it the fuse is lit
An explosion, you getting hit
With rhythmic prophecies, visions I foresee
Me blowing up in your face now stop to see
Smoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room because I went boom
I'll light the sky like a comet
When it comes to rap, I'm it, I'm blowing up

[Verse 3]
I'm blowin' up for the fans that crave
Hip hop with relevance I'm here to save
Rap from an early grave like god I gave
Life to the mic as I watch it enslave
All the sellouts who yell out, obscenities and spell out
M-O-N-E-Y to propel out of the ghetto, but like Othello
You kill the mic, a cappella, you're in the cellar
You rap like rap is a dash for cash, you'll run out of gas
It's a marathon, how long can you last
With repetitious nothing, renditions of something
You can't create, so you imitate the pumping
Only the strongest can last as long as
I last, my reign is the longest
In hip-hop history, check the book
Victory after victory, man look
Rapping is a science, the mic is an appliance
So I applied it to an alliance
Of words, put them in a rhyme song
Blew them up, like a time bomb
Other emcees caught the debris
Little bits and pieces of me
Put my ideas on a track you laid
Is like pulling my pin and I'm a grenade, I'm blowing up
[Verse 4]
Clap, your hands to that
Old track that brought back the man that raps
Much better than the next man, I'll take an ex-fan
And make them rock harder than any other brother can
Whoever didn't understand my game plan
Should feel ashamed like a lame cause I'm the same man
That ran the rap yard for years, worked hard for years
But never got paid and slaved and starved for years
Then other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft
I went with the flow and you said I fell off, hah
Don't be bogus, where's your focus?
I did what I had to, now notice
The dollars are rolling, no more holding
Back the rap attack I'm back on top controlling
The whole rap game again, like I did way back when
Def Jam was a dream, I was slaying men
Whoever thinks he wants some, he don't want none
He's got to be insane or just plain dumb
But if you think you got something to prove
Jump, make your move
But come in a tank and ten suits of armor
I won't whip ya, I'll bomb ya
And when you're on fire it still ain't enough
Cause I don't just burn you boy, I blow ya upEmbed
