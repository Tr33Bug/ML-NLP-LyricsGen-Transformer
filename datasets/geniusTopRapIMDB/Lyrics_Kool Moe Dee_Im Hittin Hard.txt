I’m Hittin’ Hard Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No if's and's but's or maybe's
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into a catalyst
That'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhyme's contents beyond nonsense
If you're not convinced get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic look epileptic
Shake and break like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul, I control
His mind is mine cause my rhyme holds
Minds in limbo, as you resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief, no chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger, spinning like a top
Weak at the knees and you're about to drop
You can't find your heart, you need a warrant to search
Get off your knees boy, this ain't church
You can say what you wanna say, pray if you wanna pray
Did you forget you was ambiguous, you're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme, you better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds if you got caught
I taught lessons for second-guessing, reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic known as rhyme
Addicted to rap and you're a fiend for mine
For my rap info, you're a nympho
I'll raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
That I'mma leave you scarred
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
[Verse 2]
I weave and bob to do the job
Set you up with the left as the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move behind the groove
As the beat gets better the rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more than just a fight or a bout
You ain't goin' down boy, you're goin' out
No count necessary 'cause you ain't gettin' up
Bad mouthin' ends very, very, very abrupt
Thought patterns converted through overt overtures
Prepared your mind much better for metaphors
More rap classics, believe me there's no man
Not Bach, Brahms, Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I, get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut and rings a bell too
I come out smoking, hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee and the bell is the worst sound
Cause I don't wanna let up, if you can get up
I'm fed up, the rhymes are sped up, to mess your head up
When the rhyme is over, they tally the scorecard
I get more points 'cause you hit the floor hard
The very last thing that you remember
Is a rhyme in your face and the crowd yell "timber"
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
You might also like[Verse 3]
When I rain, it's more like a hurricane
You wanna dis then think of another name
Cause I go to work and my rhymes slam
Put me to the test, you'll fail the exam
Cause that's the kind of test you just can't study for
You're guaranteed to end up bloody or
Broken, twisted, fractured, blistered
Decapitated, mutilated, violated, it's the
Kind of defeat that you just can't live with
Try to compete but you just can't get with
The Mental Master, hard-ryhme supremist
My words have ya, mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like H2O
Cleaned with chlorine to make green so
The rhyme is purified, you can't drink it
So biters and suckers, don't even think it
The green I made is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates, I get paid
Then it's time to rain, with the rhyme I know
And like plants, watch my people grow
I heal sick minds like Christ himself
Touch the soul like no one else
There's only one President, Pope and one God
There's only one rapper in that class
And I'm hardEmbed
