Iâ€™m Kool Moe Dee Lyrics[Intro]
Huh!

[Verse 1]
What are you crazy? You know who I am
(Moe Dee!) Yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, "Don't you know?"
Really, really, really don't you know?'
'Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
'Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't wanna hear about how many records you sold
'Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
'Cause I'm the greatest, but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
[Verse 2]
What are you senile? Have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein' that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin' and yellin' with hot records sellin'
But your rhymes are smellin', that's why I'm tellin'
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
'Cause I'm better, but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, 'cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
'Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown 'cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, 'cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
'Cause I'm the greatest, but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam 'em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set 'em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a birth
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair, and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite 'em as a poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement, lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh, Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
-imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's 'cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course 'cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-psychotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm the greatest, but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
[Outro]
