Monster Crack Lyrics[Intro]
Monster Crack
Monster Crack
Monster Crack
Monster Crack, the crack monster

[Verse 1]
1986: return of the horror flicks
More deadly than "The Omen", a killer and a showman
Like the devil in "The Exorcist"
But this flick can cause a heart attack
'Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killing and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster
[Hook]
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
M-m-m-m-Monster Crack, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The crack monster, m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-

[Verse 2]
He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come running, the older and the youngin
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is inanimate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away 'cause all he's about
Is just making you broke and stringing you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life 'cause it's the kiss of death

[Verse 3]
Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby 'cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothing but poison
The biggest hit since Michael Jackson, he's making noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp 'cause he turns 'em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
'Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, 'cause he'll take the rest

[Verse 4]
The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
Their mind like Toucan Sam, instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killing your brain now, so later on it'll haunt you
You become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losing weight and disappearing but still persevering
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearing
Is the crack talk

[Hook]

M-m-m-Monster Crack
M-m-m-Monster Crack
Monster Crack, the crack monster

[Verse 5]
In South Africa many a brother died
Trying to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near the end, this is only the beginning
Until this point the crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone-cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
'Cause he's nothing but a little piece of matter for sale
Using people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

[Hook]
