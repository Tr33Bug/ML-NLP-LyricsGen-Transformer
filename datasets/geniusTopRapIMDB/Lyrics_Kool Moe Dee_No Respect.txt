No Respect LyricsWhat you want, you ain't gon' get it
What you need, you won't admit it
It really don't matter how hard you try
Cause money can't buy respect

The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight, and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think they'll get respect

Bought a big Mercedes, and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies, and you're a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak, so when you speak
You're obsolete, your mental peak
Is in the street, your mouth's a beak
Big like a bird, and your future's bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
You're sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brand-new ride to go beep-beep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know, unless you're slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the river's where you'll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold, no fancy car
And the brothers inside don't care who you are
A 7-foot brother doin life
300 pounds, says you're his wife
Walks in your cell and says: "Fix it up"
Then you look up and say: "Not the butt"
He says: "Shut up" "But... but" No 'but'
Now what you gonna do, freaky-deaky or what?

The money was good, the money was fast
No business mind and the money won't last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause you're here today, gone the next
And you'll find out the hard way: you get no respect

	Man, you must be crazy and bugged
	Whatcha mean I don't get no respect?
	You crazy?
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets, boy
	Ain't nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In '72, I was killin em, boy
[Young hustler:]
	Man, go 'head, go 'head
[Old hustler:]
I'm tellin ya, I was shittin on it
	Word up, I was the man
	And a car - these niggas ain't got no cars today, man

Caddy, boy, Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony, boy
[Young hustler:]
	Aw man, go 'head, shut yo broke ass up, man

Word, I spell it out, I'll yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all you're about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every day's like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
I'd like to know what you're thinkin about
It sure ain't dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before it's too late
Or they'll be doing your make-up down at the coroner's place
And you will have lived just to die
And you'll die with no respect
[Young hustler:]
	Yo man, what about hoes, what about hoes?
[Old hustler:]

Wait, before you go - can I get a dollar, man?
