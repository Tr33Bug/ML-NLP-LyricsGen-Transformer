Poetic Justice Lyrics(Ladies and gentlemen
There are seven acknowledged Wonders of the World
You are about to witness the eighth)

Karma
Poetic justice
What goes around, comes around
Ebb and flow

[Verse 1]
Stop, look, listen, learn
Play with fire and you'll get burned
You think you want some but you don't want none
A fight on the mic, you don't want one
I turn the heat on, proceed to beat on
Any soft sap who think he's gone
Na come in my realm when I'm at the helm
Nightmare's a joke when I'm on
Elm Street, sleep but you don't dream
Awake and achin', takin' Codeine
Now you're tryin to O.D
'Cause you don't want none of Moe Dee
Pain relievers won't relieve ya
Suicide won't do it either
Even after I cremate you
I'm a reincarnate you
Bring you back for another round
Just to put you back in the ground
Over and over again
When is it over? It ends
When I die but I won't die, don't try
Rhyme forever, huh, why won't I
Crush whoever tries to crush this
Hurt you like the truth, poetic justice
[Hook]
Poetic justice
Poetical...
(What goes around, comes around
Goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
Goes around)
Doing justice to poetry
(What goes around, comes around
Goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
Goes around)
Doing justice to poetry

[Verse 2]
This is a flurry, a fist of fury
A rhyme so fast that it has to blurry
Your vision, don't wink, blink or stop to think
Or you might miss the next rhyme
Ink flows from the brain to the pen
And comes alive when the thought transcends
From the pen to the paper and paper to tape, and
A tape to the wax and back to the tape
Another hit which you can't get with
A brainiac'll react, but a nitwit
Can't relate, he can't hold the weight
The rhyme's too deep and he sleeps awake
The comatose need a double dose
'Cause Kool Moe Dee don't rhyme like most
Simplified rhymes or out of the norm
But I simplify if I'm to perform
Records for the pop/rock playlists
The pop jocks don't play this
In an intent to hold rap back
They stop the hard (hard) and play the wack (wack)
They play the weak 'cause the weak won't speak
But that just makes a fan go seek
A station that they know will bust this
(Losing ratings) Poetic justice

[Verse 3]
Poetic, phonetic, genetic, frenetic
You connect it
Those who chose to oppose are foes
And usually can't grow afros
As the rhyme flows the spirit grows
But only those with a pure soul knows
The relevance of the beat of the drum
And where it's coming from
For those of you who just don't listen
Here's the second boat you're missin'
Just like Noah had you swimming
Rap's a warning of an ending
Of an era, a reign of terror
Over like a nova, never ever
Try to amplify the lie
The truth won't die, and that's why I
A versatile child of the Nile
Speak with a ghetto style, and meanwhile
The reason I relate to the youth
Is pure souls can feel the truth
The poisoned souls have tried to stop it
But just stop it, 'cause hip-hop is
From our roots, and you can't touch this
This is our ancestors' poetic justice
[Hook]
