Pump Your Fist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, tension in the air
Racism and violence everywhere
Davis, Howard Beach, Bumpers and Brawley
It appalls me now it's there really racial justice
It's time that we discussed this, I'm disgusted
And I don't trust it, what's this about
New evidence brings doubt on who took King out
Must have had clout, he took the Kennedy route
Witness, stories contradict and
Confliction make Black men say it had to end
It won't happen again
Pump your fist (3x)

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me, hittin' home
Knowledge is the danger zone
Liars and bigots and hypocrites start to panic
They get frantic
Power generated by the truth
Time to educate the youth
The lust for money is out of control
Here's proof
Drugs, always a tragic ending
And at the risk of spending
Time in jail
Caught on a bum sale
They persist knowin' death's a risk, ignorance is bliss
They kill their race and chump their face
They deserve to get dissed

Pump your fist (3x)

[Verse 3]
We feel the wrath
From what happened in the past
Has made us walk a path
Made by slavery
Though bravery, we lost
Our unity our source
Of power and we lost all race pride
In our Holocaust, now it's my creed
I'm from a stronger breed
My ancestors indeed had to bleed
Whipped 'till they were freed
And now I look back and say wow
How did we allow
Physical slavery
Never again I vow

[Verse 4]
But are we free, in actuality
Let's talk reality, can't you see
The slave mentality
It's a sickness, that eats you up like cancer
And money's not the answer, won't advance ya
Don't take a chance, you're just a lame
Selling drugs for fame
That's the weak man's game, it's a shame
You got chains on your brain
You're givin' drugs to kids and livin'
Half your life in prison
God's forgivin' but you got to work with him

Pump your fist (3x)
