Stupid!

Look at what you've got with ya
A painted picture
A Mona Lisa in disguise with bedroom eyes
The kind that always gets you...
Young dumb, hot rookies
Hot for the nookie
Young and dumb, quick of the tongue
And don't know how to boogie
'Cause once you get in the groove
You can't stick and move
A little slip of the lip and the young'n is whipped
I want to let you know you
Got a lot to learn in this world
Actin' like the Duke of Earl
Sportin' your new stuff as everybody's old stuff
And you callin' that your girl?
Don't be stupid
Stupid!

Stupid!

Stupid!

Stupid!

Remember when you were broke
And your pockets were no joke
When you asked her to hang out with you back then she laughed so hard she choked
But soon as you got your ride
She's under your arm at your side
She said remember what I said, I didn't like you before
I lied
She already done chucked your face
Now here's a typical case
Of a man whose world evolves around a girl
His brain below his waist
Now you remember how the homeboys did her
She's out for the highest bidder
She didn't want you when you had no money, you dummy
Now you're a [?]
Don't be stupid

Stupid!

Then on the other hand
You got the greedy man
The one that makes the women say a man will be a man
'Cause he's got a girl that's loyal
And treats him like he's royal
Simply put, the hand in foot, treatment have got him spoiled
'Cause he still has to mess around
With every other girl in town
And when your girl finds out what you're really about
She's heartbroke and let down
'Cause the love you had you ruined it
She's cryin' and boo-hooin' it
She's too sweet to cheat but she knows you cheat
What's to stop her from doin' it?
Don't be stupid

Stupid!

Stupid!
Stupid!

Stupid!

Then ya got those saps
With the weak, weak raps
Nothin' to say, they'd rather pay
They just can't crack
You know how much they spend?
On one girlfriend?
So many dollars on so many girls they call him George Washington
You know what you've been given
Your girl and how she's livin'
Sweet though with a dollar bill
Now she can't stop sniffin'
You know how the story goes
And she's your girl who knows
She don't know her damn self
She just follows her nose
Don't be stupid

Stupid!
