The Avenue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bought a brand new car
Driving down the boulevard
Turn the corner like I wanna be chilin' hard
The scene is set for me to get wet
Cause it wouldn't be right if the ladies didn't sweat
Pull the seat back to make contact
Eye to eye you know, I ain't living like that
I wear shades and I get paid
And when it comes to girls I can't get played
Fly girls used to ignore me
Now I pull up and let the car rap for me
(beep beep)
Enough said
Better hop in while the light's still red
Homeboys scatter
What's the matter?
("Here come the cops")
Oh yeah that again, rather than
Beating them down, I just talk to the men
They don't understand how I've got my cash
Then I get mad and tell them to ask
Their daughter, I bet she bought a
Kool Moe Dee tape for her recorder
We're not always thieves and thugs
And what law says we gotta sell drugs?
I get paid and I'm making a killin'
But when I come home
I just like chillin' on the
Avenue, a-avenue (4x)

[Verse 2]
(Action)
That's where the stars go
On the weekend it's like a car show
Ladies flock to jock, cars go by them
If I'm walking and talking, they ask what ya driving
When I peep that same old weak rap
Ask her her language, tell her I don't speak that
Pull out a "G", a car key and a Visa
Walk her to the car, leave her there "see ya"
She didn't want nothin' else but a payday
Now she's sinking, hollering Mayday
I knew her con 'cause two days ago
I saw that same slick girl in a broken-down Yugo
Riding with a hustler, layin' low
Couldn't drive his Benz 'cause the cops said so
His homeboy got shot, in front of his crack spot
He moved cause it got too hot, but not on that block
The cops are watching, baiting and plotting
Setting you up for the raid in the block and
When they come, everybody's got to go
But not Kool Moe 'cause they all know
The knot I got is way over their knot
But I'm working, so that's why they're not
After me, they're after you
Cause I'm just chillin' on the avenue

[Verse 3]
Homeboys on the block all wanna get paid
Well, we can do this, the right way
You get money and respect
Live large and correct
Then come back driving through the neighborhood
When you look good, we all look good
Cause it's all for one and one for all
It's got to be a better way
To get the money y'allEmbed
