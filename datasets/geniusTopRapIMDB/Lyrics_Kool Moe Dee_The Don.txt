The Don Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm The Don, armed and dangerous
With a mic I like, ordain I just
Make a wish, it becomes a command
The rhyme family is my fans
My territory spans from New York to Hollywood
The whole country's my neighborhood
I extort, fans support
With rhymes that taught, lessons and caught
The ears of listeners, they enlist in the
Hip hop mob on the job, stop dissin' us
No drugs at all, we don't steal or rob
We just get paid in the Moe Dee mob
I demand fans family loyalty
Tour support and record royalties
Whenever a band tries to take my fans
I put out a hit, understand?
[Verse 2]
I'm The Don
Started out in parks
As a hit man killin' with the rhymes that sparks a mic
Sparks of light, turns dark to light
Freeze emcees and they drop the mic
Hit the deck, you know what this is
Don't nobody move and I mean biz
One dumb hero tried to step
So I pulled out my mic and rhymed him to death
Other emcees wouldn't put me on
So I took over, now they're gone
I made the connections, got paid protection
Fees from emcees and no late collections
I take no shorts, up front on the double
You ain't got it, you got trouble
I'll put out my mic and a rhyme to bust
Huh, another one bites the dust

[Verse 3]
With the ladies I'm not just a Don
In fact I'm more like a Don Juan
Pull ladies in bunches
Break my heart, I roll with the punches
Write 'em off like a tax, no respect
You ain't down, next
Cause I'm like a hard-core Casanova
Cross me once, girlfriend you're over
Outta here quick as a jet no sweat
There's no limit to the girls I get
No time for games, make no mistakes
Dis me you're done, that's the breaks
One conversation gets my point across
You don't like me, it's your loss
Spread the news, I get rave reviews
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse
You might also like[Verse 4]
The Don takes control of the action
Without question and who's askin'
A takeover is now in effect
A world tour to make my connect
The R&B radio family supports me
Put a hit on Top 40
The video families, B.E.T
Put a hit on MTV
Store reports and the Billboard charts
Work hand in hand with the local jocks
As hit men for hire, personal hit men
Makin' the hits from the very first shipment
Red and Chuck and the fans that love me
Mr. Magic and my man Buggsy
The hottest D.J.'s in every town is down with the Don

[Verse 5]
A sucker emcee in a second I'll dis
With a flick of the wrist he'll kiss my fist
Tip his hat and bend and bow
How ya like me now
The O.K. Corral and the Wild Wild West
Is recreated and put to the test
Sparks will fly like the 4th of July
My name in flames will light the sky
Other rappers go down tryin' to confront me
You know where to find me whenever you want me
But think real hard before you step
And remember, I'm a vet
Runnin' the yard ever since grade school
Never played the fool, but always stayed cool
Before you think about steppin', I already saw ya
Step off boy, I got somethin' for yaEmbed
