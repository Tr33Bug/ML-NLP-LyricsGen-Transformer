They Want Money Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm drivin' Benz 190
2.5 and you know where to find me
Driving down the highway, girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly, no need to remind me
Who I am? I know you know me
Stop screamin' and pointin' and yellin', I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number and I'll get with ya
You want a ride? You shouldn't have said that
You played yourself and I know where your head's at
Drive my car? Don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek, maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word
[Hook]
No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies
A lot of ladies? Nah, they want money

[Verse 2]
And I can see 'em a mile away
And when they push up, I just smile and say
Back up off me, smell the coffee
You're schemin' and plottin' and I'm killing you softly
Watchin' you melt from the second I kissed ya
Heard dollar signs in your careless whisper
I know the game it's old and lame
You're holdin' a flame for my name and my fame
Livin' like Givens schemin' on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I ain't nice and I don't play that
If it ain't tax I don't pay that
You think you're in cause you turn me on
Here one minute and the next you're gone
I made the rhymes, I made the cash
Why get married and you take half?

[Hook]
No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies
A lot of ladies? Nah, they want money

The police, I'm givin' them fits
A young brother in a Benz legit
I don't sell no drugs and take no shhh
Park my ride and the ladies hit it
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all wanna get with
The man with the money so they wanna sit with
The microphone master and ride shotgun
So people can see ya and think I got one
No, sorry, nothin's happenin'
Moe Dee's single while he's rappin'
If girls keep lyin' and crashin' my party
Ya'll gonna make me hurt somebody

[Hook]
No, I ain't got no girlfriend
No, I didn't buy no car
No, I don't have no babies
A lot of ladies? Nah, they want moneyEmbed
