Way Way Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dip dip dive, so-socialize
Clean out your ears and open your eyes
We gonna rock with the bass, roll with the high's
Gonna say a funky rhyme and make you all come alive
Hip hop, the hippie - the hippie
To the hip hip-hop, and you don't stop the rock
First you rock the hip and then you rock the hop
Then you hippie the hop and don't stop
Going on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
Gonna rock the beat to the break of dawn
Gonna party, party, party 'til you're all going home
[Hook]
This is the way we used to rhyme
These are the rhymes that we used to say
This is the way we used to sound
Way, way back in the day

[Verse 2]
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
And rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
Cause I am the man with the master plan
Going back and forth and forth and back
Three words for the wack: stay the hell back
If the wack may attack keep the wack back
This drum machine is guaranteed to cause a heart attack
Going up to the ceiling, down to the floor
Bounce around the balls and back out the door
Tried to come back in cause you want more
Those funky rhymes galore

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pepper to the salt, salt to the pepper
Don't come to the party if you're a half-stepper
Salt to the pepper, pepper to the salt
If you can't rock to this it ain't my fault
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I rock the rhyme in half the time
From a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
You know Moe Dee gets all the women
Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rhythm, put your feet on the rock
Put your feet on the rock

[Verse 4]
Al Capone on the microphone
The Clark Gable on the turntable
I'm the Jesse and James of the hip hop game
Put all the suckers, suckers, suckers, suckers to shame
I'm twice as nice skating on ice
I'm giving you a taste of the disco slice
Like 4-5-6 on Cee-lo Dice
And I get more sex than a cat chase mice
Rock and roll, and roll and rock
Let's rock to the rhythm of the rock, rock, rock
And roll and rhyme, and rock and roll
Come on, party people, let's get out of control
Now the people in the back and not the wack
To the people on the side, let's ride
To the people in the middle let me see you wiggle
And people on the top, don't stop
Jump up, jump up
Just like a disco duck
Go down, go down
Just like a disco clown
Go on, go on
To, to the break of dawn
Jump back, jump back
And I can rock it like this cause I got it like that
Now do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do, do, do it
Do, do it, do it
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if y'all wanna rock the house tonight
Somebody say "oh yeah" (oh yeah)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Now I hear ya
Now I hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya, hear ya
Now I hear ya, hear ya
Now before we go I want you to know who you been listening to
It's devastating sound of Kool Moe Dee dedicated to all the old crew
