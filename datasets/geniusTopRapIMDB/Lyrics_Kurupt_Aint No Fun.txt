Ainâ€™t No Fun LyricsYou're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ, Eazy Dick

On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new
By Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies
From all the guys

A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little mystery here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had a respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back

Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call

Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth

Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't do me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?

I have no love for hoes that's somethin' that I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe
Just to lay this hoe I know the pussy's mines
I'ma fuck a couple more times
You might also likeAnd then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me

I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who is back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo

What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well, once you're caught up with my grip

Now as the sun rotates
And my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love 'em

Whoa, hey, now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow

One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back

So back up bitch cause I'm strugglin'
So get off your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
OhhhEmbed
