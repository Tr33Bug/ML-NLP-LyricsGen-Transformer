Bounce (Remix) LyricsNow make it clap, clap, clap, clap
Now make it clap, clap, clap, clap
Now make that ass give a round of applause
Clap, clap, clap, on rhyme barry bonds
Got a redbone here, a latina and a thong
Look, look

Now make that ass give a round of applause
Clap, clap, clap, on rhyme barry bonds
Got a redbone here, a latina and a thong
Penny in the t shirt, put in work, no job
On the mob, mobbing is mobby
Party at the hotel, bitches in the lobby
Ratchets on hoe, man this nigga gonn copy
Baby booty on swoll, bet a nigga got pour
We can do it on the bed, we can do it on the floor
Spanish mami give me compassy she straight from mexico
Try to find me, I'm prolly be finnin, but never see in it
One man with be feelings, never trickin for a hoe
Fin to know, caletti bly line hunned
Girl I really do it, tell the nigga quit frontin
She told daddy hit it from the back cause I love it
Love it all ...but fuck it, it's never nothing
Now hold up, shake that ass one round
Now drop it low, bring it back
...put that ass in my lap and brush it like you ballin
Now make it bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Now make it bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Now make it clap
Now make it clap
Now make it clap, get it
Now make it clap, get it

Stop playing girl, recess' over
Put me in, I'm a deep threat going
Bet I'ma catch it, bet I'ma stretch it
One stressed out, hit the backdoor exit
Now that's an entrance, fresher than an incense
Getting cash money, that's word to the imprint
Ferrrari 559 off the hood, right
Shout out to fire 59, what it look like
Good looking so I always pull a looker
She a nun but I'm pull it, once she fuck me got the hooker
Once I up clean it up, get to kitchen, get to cleaning
Chicago's off the motherfucking hook
Boy I beat it up, hit the ring just for fun
So in love with the head I put a ring on her tongue
Gold digger, city lights, jeans full of 1's
Once I get to throwin, I ain't leaving till I'm done
Big hit it baby!

So fly I should be in the leer now
Smoking on kush in the air now
Sippin on patron and stare down
Like even if I yelled, they couldn't hear a sound

Looking like a million dollar, smellin like a billionaire
Sittin like a quarter of a billion clear
