Give It Here (The Camel Toe Song) Lyrics[Hook]
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
(I’m talking to you, you, you, you, you)
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
[Verse]
Walked in, get pursuit and some b2
Walk in, I’ma do what I do do
Bring the freak out of you when you to you
I don’t like that, I don’t like that
All that attitude, argument and fighting back
I turn a lioness to a pussy cat, hit it once, guaranteed to bring the pussy back
With a pussy on swole, 20 years old, Filipino, let her leather show
Let her show me, everything she know
See it from the back, that fat camel toe
See it from the back, that fat camel toe
See it from the back, that fat camel toe
See it from the back, that fat camel toe
Let her see it drop off patron

[Hook)]
Grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here

You, you, you, you, fly kid too smooth
Yo girl I see ya, there I be, in VIP, if you latina sipping gina
Beat, beat it on the lean and say, she make that ass give a round of applause
Clap, clap, clap home run, Derek Jeter
Knock it out the park, got her thinking I’ma cheat her
But it sound like what it is, it’s that onomatopoeia, aye
Man these bitches be fly, but they come by the flock
Stripping down for some rock, true definition of bops
I’m from the nike to let it block 900
If you back it up on me I’ma beat it like I’m drummin aye
Grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
The big homie Kurupt say give it here
Look, so I pass it like Robert Griffin and grab on her friend’s ass
She sexy and Puerto Rican, uh

[Hook]
Grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m grabbing on that ass like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party like give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, you, you, you, you
Grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it here
I’m in the party, grabbing on that ass like give it here, give it hereEmbed
