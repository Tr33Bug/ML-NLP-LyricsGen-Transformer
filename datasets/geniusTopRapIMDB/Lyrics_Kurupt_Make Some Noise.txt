Make Some Noise Lyrics(Intro: Kurupt & Daz Dillinger)

(Verse 1: Kurupt)
Come to Pelican Bay
Where the pelicans play
And fly, pelican, fly
Fly away
Take this bird to the homie on 19th Street
It's in the back in the trunk, under the seat is the heat
Hollow tip melodic
Soopafly, psychotic
Super Sonic
With a little bit of chronic
Gin and tonic
Can't have a phone, nigga
Without the hydrolics
Can't purchase no powder
Without the cauliflower
Holly Colly, high power
Bangin' with the homies
Bustin' on bustas
Dumpin' on cowards
The homies said move to left, home boy
Hit your chest
Knock out, hold your breath, home boy
W's for the West, home boy
E is for the East, home boy
D-A-Z and Soopafly
Motherfucker, Priest, home boy
My niggas
Blaze a ounce
Hit the stage
Bitches strip
Niggas bounce
(Chorus: Daz Dillinger)
All my Dogg Pound niggas better...
Make some noise!
All my niggas in the back better...
Make some noise!
All the bitches in the front better...
Make some noise!
All my homies all over the world...
Make some noise!
All my niggas all over...
Make some noise!
All my niggas in the back better...
Make some noise!
All my niggas down with us...
Make some noise!
Everybody around the world...
Make some noise!

(Verse 2: Kurupt)
Process of elimination
Total devastation
Total world domination
Struck determination
Capitations
Determination
To injure the nation
And leave a whole half of the world...
With a million decapitations
With no hesitation
Fast!
Blast with the homies
It's all set to blast
To bust a nigga, touch him
Bustin' ain't nothin' but bustin'
It ain't shit
See, you ain't quick enough to draw and spit
So you fall cause you're hit
(Aww shit!!)
And your homies get to runnin'
Another nigga still gunnin'
Got a pistol, fool?
You know the rules of the hood
Refuse, that's on you
You know the rules of the hood
I'm a G fa sho
D.P. fa sho
From the back to the middle
To the front of the door
You got a Cadillac Seville?
I got a license to cock back, aim and shoot to kill
Now, nigga, how you feel?
You might also like(Chorus: Daz Dillinger)
All my niggas clockin' paper...
Make some noise!
All my Dogg Pound niggas...
Make some noise!
All my gang bang niggas...
Make some noise!
All my niggas from South Central...
Make some noise!
All my niggas from Philadelphia...
Make some noise!
All my niggas from Jersey...
Make some noise!
All my niggas in Atlanta...
Make some noise!
If you down with Kurupt, would you...
Make some noise!

(Verse 3: Kurupt)
Nigga, what?
You're just a space invader
Takin' up all the space, motherfucker!
And I'mma tell y'all to y'all faces
When it takes place
Y'all never know it takes place
Little busta in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
I ain't hatin'
Fool... What's crackulatin'?
Is it sex or Glocks
Money for rhymes or rocks?
All my home boys with 9's in they hands
Put them in the air
Bust like you just don't care
This the Terror Dome
Home, sweet, home
For the chrome
Pack your homies
With the foes
And all gold in the bones
Hit the strip club
Get a little sip, get my dick rubbed
What the fuck?!
They love Kurupt!
But I don't give 'em a sip
It ain't because they don't deserve it
It's cause they love Kurupt and love how Kurupt be swervin'
And if Kurupt make 'em bounce
Indeed, I make 'em bounce
And blaze the weed
And rock the party with an ounce, now bounce
(Chorus: Daz Dillinger)
If you down with Kurupt, would you...
Make some noise!
All my niggas in the back, won't you...
Make some noise!
If you down with this shit, won't you...
Make some noise!
Put your hands on the side and...
All my niggas in the back, would you...
Make some noise!
Everybody all around, won't you...
Make some noise!
And all my real, live niggas, won't you...
Make some noise!
Everybody down with ???, would you...
Make some noise!

(Interlude: Daz Dillinger & Kurupt)

(Verse 4: Kurupt)
Raw Dogg, I'm a hog indeed
Me and the home boy D-A-Z smokin' some weed
On a one-to-one one day
In ???'s car
Like, "What up, Dogg?"
"Oh, nothin', just chillin', smokin' raw"
Nigga, ey... You know exactly what it is
Me and my homies... We make the loot in this biz
So what the fuck you wanna do?
Slump me and bump me
Pull out a pump and pump me
Cause I own my own company?Embed
