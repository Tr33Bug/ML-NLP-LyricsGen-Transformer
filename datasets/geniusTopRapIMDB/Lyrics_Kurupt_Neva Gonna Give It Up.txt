Neva Gonna Give It Up Lyrics[Snoop Dogg]
D.P.G., G.C. - (X 4)

[Kurupt]
Smash, just before you talk spaz out
Hittin' the switch then hittin' the stash
Before the year 2000 all the computers crash
I'm gone homeboy, this the hood where it's on homeboy
I'mma live long homeboy
Too deep, too strong homeboy
We rollin' too deep with two zones homeboy, it's on homeboy
Zones with two candy's painted bronze homeboy
D-A-Z, I can't believe this nigga gon' trip
He's nothin' but a busta, bitch ass motherfucker
With Snoop in a coupe, Warren, Nate, and Big Tray Deee
Big C-Style and Meech, made to be
Shine Dogg gettin' super-high, lit, lifeline high
Soopa-doopa high with Soopa-doopa-fly
I'll put ya in the mix
I ain't with that Kibbles-N-Bits shit
Bitch, where's the grip?
[Hook: Nate Dogg] - X 2
I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga
I'm never gon' give it Up (D.P.G., G.C.)
Never gonna give it Up
C'mon homies give it up (D.P.G., G.C.)

[Warren G]
What I'mma do? - I'mma bang on the beat
What I'mma do? - concoct and serve heat
You lookin' at me, I'm scopin' on you
But you don't know my shit is right nigga, so fuck you
Everybody talkin' 'bout "Money Ain't A Thang"
Everybody talkin' 'bout how they gangbang
If you was hard as me, I'm as hard as you
Cut throats and bud smoke, I'm a Eastside loc
So don't let the crossover fool ya
I've been down since '81, L.B. Top Gun beotch

[Nate Dogg]
Platinum ass records that be payin' bills
Dogg Pound niggas, they be bangin' still
Money makin' niggas and they bonafide
Them money makin' niggas still down to ride
All them other niggas, they be claimin' thangs
Scary ass niggas wasn't born to bang
Hang with D.P.G. and I can give ya game
Comin' from the hood, you can't be changin' gangs
You might also like(D.P.G., G.C.)

[Kurupt talking]
Yeah, bitch ass niggas
Dogg Pound Gangstas
Fuck y'all

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga
I'm never gon' give it Up
Never gonna give it Up
C'mon homies give it up

[Tray Deee]
Yeah, I'm from that click that slap clips with hollow-point tips
And serve bitch niggas quick with this gangsta shit
Tray Deee, ya heard of me, murder be my hobby
Bangin' and slangin' and dangerous robberies
Fuck a mask, you bustas duck when I blast
I'll take the cash, and put a cap up in that ass
Saggin' with my rag, 'bout to drag the street
Triple-X sweatshirt with blue Chuck's on feet
Killa instincts keep me ahead of my foes
Never doze when I rose, let the chrome explode

[Snoop Dogg]
Man, I wish a bitch would try to get me for some child support
I'll stuff my foot up her ass, like a super sport
Down shit, Pound shit, gangsta
Forever, whenever, however, down for whatever
Recognize game when it hits ya, nigga
If ya slip up Doggy Dogg's gonna get ya
Been doin' that thang-thang, long tryin' to slang 'caine
Just before I was taught - how to gangbang
All my peers through the years know
That Snoop Dogg ain't nothin' but a fool though
And if ya run up on that man tryin' to do-low
That's when he - pull out his homie
Who? - you know
Man I been through so much and I'm still goin' through it
But fuck all that, I got to stay into it
I knew the job was dangerous when I took it
Shit, a nigga didn't even overlook it
I was so eager, just tryin' to get involved
But now I gots to represent for me and my doggs
[Soopafly]
Yeah, '94 - became a D-O, double-G P-O, U-N-D Gangsta
Now you can see me smokin' dank, your neighborhood pranksta'
Play a trick quick, intimate then out no doubt
Paperboy with a new route
When I'm in front, they watch behind me
Mission: Crush, ready to bust, grab the tommy - gun
Keep one, I role with the heat seeka
Stash the gauge, pass the nine to my neega
Roll, keep slow, peep, po-po
Creep slow, ready to smash with the fo'-fo'
I go for broke with loc niggas who tote guns
Never understood niggas high-up with low funds
Smoke one, represent my seaside ocean
Eastside motion, we slide coastin' through
Motherfuckers!, ha ha ha

[Snoop Dogg talking]
Dogg Pound motherfuckin' Gangstas
1999, back up in this BI-YA-ITCH!
Eastside up Eastsidaz
And niggas thought we fell off...

[Hook: Nate Dogg] - X 3
I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga
I'm never gon' give it Up (D.P.G., G.C.)
Never gonna give it Up
C'mon homies give it up (D.P.G., G.C.)Embed
