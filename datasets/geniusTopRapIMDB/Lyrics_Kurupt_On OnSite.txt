On, OnSite Lyrics[Intro: Kurupt]
Dat Nigga Daz Dillinger
Kurupt, Young Gotti, nigga
West Coast California livin', nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Milli monotone, cyclone Stallone
Marone chaperone shiny chrome Capone
Smashin' in a '82 brand new Brougham
Home sweet home, nigga, where the hoodstas roam
In gangstaville where we shoot to kill
Pop the pill, pop then drop the three-wheels
The tale of tales, fly high as a gazelle
The hell-hound came through to drown the whale
Pronounce, denounce, strip then set sail
Soak in a cloud of smoke then inhale
Hold it in, never exhale
Smoke whoever nigga's zone I'm in, oh well
Fuck you and ya mama
Drama, holocaust through anaconda
[Hook: Kurupt + Lil 1/2 Dead]
Nigga, I'm blastin on you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck ya'll niggas
Niggas act like they gon' get wit me when they see me on site
But I don't give a shit you bitch 'cause I'm a gangsta for life

[Verse 2]
It's time to prepare, lil' nigga, listen here
Get pierced like ten spears, shit is fierce
Fist, five and five, in multitudes
Comin' through bangin the five
Shit hit ligaments construct when we ride
I'm tired of all y'all rap is sawed off
Let off a pellet, the Desert Eagle start yellin'
Screamin', the path of a demon bailin
With my all blue Chucks on goin' out right
Dippin' through the back 'cause it's on onsite
The first nigga saw is the first nigga gone
Smashed on, banked and shanked and blast on
I make the bitches strip, we out 6-4's
Like e'erday, Californ-I-A
I can't explain it, the immaculate candy painted
Double-four dumper on my lap for comfort
You might also like[Hook: Kurupt + Lil 1/2 Dead]
For you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight, fuck y'all niggas
Niggas act like they gon' get wit me when they see me onsite
But I don't give a shit you bitch 'cause I'm a gangsta for life

[Verse 3]
Prepare to storm, when the storm rain fire and brimstone
Spread throughout the plains like a plague
Back to the G's and fool
With the heater cocked, drownin niggas in they own pool
Hit 'em hard like weights
Make a nigga feel it like pains and aches
Pump ya temple and make ya spray and shake
I'mma get ya, hit ya, nigga, makes no mistakes
I'mma crack the plates
I ride like dirt bikes, poetical ninja
I end your five mics, forty-fifth precise
The system's assistance to get up in this
Dogg Pound, California, you can't fuck with this
Kurupt Young Gotti, Fred, Daz Dillinger
Two shots of tequilla to the head
[Hook: Kurupt]
Fuck you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Takin' off on the first thang in sight

Fuck ya'll-you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Takin' off on the first thang in sight

Fuck all you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Takin' off on the first thang in sight

Fuck ya'll-you, you
Your homeboy, your whole hood
Fuck y'all punk bitch made niggas
On, onsite, let off on sight
Takin' off on the first thang in sight, fuck y'all niggas

[Lil 1/2 Dead]
Niggas act like they gon' get wit me when they see me onsite
But I don't give a shit you bitch 'cause I'm a gangsta for life...2Embed
