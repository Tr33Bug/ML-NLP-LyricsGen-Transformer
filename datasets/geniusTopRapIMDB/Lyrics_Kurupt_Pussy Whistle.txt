Pussy Whistle Lyrics[Intro: Kurupt]
Yeah
(Frequency Pusher Productions)
You know
It's some gorilla shit, nigga
You hear me?

[Verse: Kurupt]
Walk in the club, doin it big
Everything she do, shit, on some bullshit
Champagne on 'er body, on some new shit
I’ma exclude her and include her
Pussy wet on the set, nigga, pussy purr
On some jah rastafari ru girl
Pink pussy, pink panties, pink nouveau
Duvo, groove slow, got it, Carusso
Cruise slow, crook raw, just me and my uso
This is how the club crack, after hour that
[Chorus]
Ass on shake, make the club quake
Everything she got, everything
She make her pussy whistle, her pussy whistle
On the dizzle, (I’m out) man her pussy whistle
Her pussy whistle, pussy whistle
I make her pussy whistle
Rally up, tally up, the whole valley up
They have a party in the sky, stay high
Gettin' blown while we high, slow motion in the sky
I make her pussy whistle

[Verse: Masta Killa]
Sip the mimosa, I’m in the club flow
It’s just noodles with my boss, so lean yo' hat low
Watch 'er how she work the pole, breast coco mango
Penny with the pussy hole, silky with the lace trim
Slim goody, make her booty clap, I wanna tap that
Make her kitty cat whistle back, yall know she got that
Red snapper, dog catcher, son, I had to ask 'er
Will you get that B sippin' on me miss blondie?
When your friends call me, Palm Sweet beach
After party, let us all see, your pussy smoke a Lucy
Freak, let yo' body speak if it's in heat
Knee deep, in between the sheets, do it to the beat
Come whistle at the hot chief, me and Gotti gettin' money
Poppin' Don, smokin' lovely, G’s up, hoes down
Wu-Tang and Dog Pound comin' through your town
Come party with the best, get it east or in the west
I make yo pussy whistle

[Chorus]
Ass on shake, make the club quake
Everything she got, everything
She make her pussy whistle, her pussy whistle
On the dizzle, (I’m out) man her pussy whistle
Her pussy whistle, pussy whistle
I make her pussy whistle
Rally up, tally up, the whole valley up
They have a party in the sky, stay high
Gettin' blown while we high, slow motion in the sky

[Outro]
Smokin' on the bong, and watch her get it on
Smokin' on that shit
