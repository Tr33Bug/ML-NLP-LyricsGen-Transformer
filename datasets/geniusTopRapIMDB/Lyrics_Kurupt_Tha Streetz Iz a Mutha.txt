Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha Lyrics[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Daz and Kurupt, Kurupt and Daz
Nickels and pennies, and pounds of hash
Double up the dough, double my money
Let it can boil and bubble, get a grip ain't nothin funny
You can't survive, off no conversation wit words
Betta get up off yo ass nigga, go flip some birds
Hand me my cash, nobody moves and nobody get blast
My first words are my last
I got a platoon, mask, and armor suits
First infantry of riders on a global pursuit
Parachute and jump, held high on a stump
Wit a pump, bout to dump, put a end to the hunt
[Hook: Kurupt]
Tha streetz iz a muthafucka
Dope game, rock game, cocaine, package was sold, Figuero'
Ride and roll, pistols up as high as they go
Gotta let 'em know, the gang, muthafucka, fa sho
In and out do's, chrome, rollin in '64
I ain't got time for none of you bitches, so fuck off ho
Ever heard of a gangsta? Well, you must have heard of us
The gangsta gang, full of jack artists and murderers

[Verse 2: Daz]
Automatics rang out, you left dead nigga wit yo brains out
Walk back to the porch, wit some salt to wash the stains out
Murders my hobby, kidnapping, jacking, and robbery
Wild as a safari, in a paid-for Ferrari
Pay the cops off as I peel out and jet
It ain't no thing when we connect, we posted up with Tecs
Nigga we bury you alive in cement, that's what we meant
Now when the nine goes click, yo ass wasn't shit
Get out your war tactics, get at you get the job done
One gun you hung, seven bullets in your lungs
Struggle with heron and I'll tear you apart
Through my veins and through my heart
That's when the drama will start
Nigga gimme what you got, let off some more shots
Run through what you got, destroy yo block
Gotti, Dillinger forever runs your spot
When the nine goes pop, that's when your homeboys drop

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I seen it befo', .44's explode
Niggas fall on the flo', the hardest nigga on the flo'
The hoes late, do what the fuck ever a nigga say
It's like this every day on the streets of L.A
Gotta a lumberjack, the size of a tank
I'm a hammerhead with a hammer the size of a tank
Ever heard of a gangsta? Well, you must have heard of us
The gangsta gang, muthafucka, its on dawn to dusk

(Well nigga wonder why we do this, it ain't really nothin' to us
Plus you ain't nothin' to us, you can't do nothin' to us, noooo)

[Verse 4: Daz]
I represented and presented the bloodbath
Feel the wrath, we get what you had, you get stabbed
We grab for the opportunities that'll soon to be a chance
At the eulogy, I knew you'd be dead, while in prison
Making critical decisions
To the brain to his neck
Goes 27 inches for tellin' the snitches

[Hook]
