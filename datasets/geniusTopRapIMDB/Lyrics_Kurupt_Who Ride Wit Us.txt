Who Ride Wit Us Lyrics[Hook] 4x
Awww yeah! Do you wanna ride wit us?
Who ride wit us

[Verse 1: Daz]
When the six-tray bounce, the street scrapin' the bumper
Wit the sound for the summer that be thumpin' and hummin'
Hoppin' up the 'Shaw on a Sunday, what a fun day
Dip skip trippin' and whippin' down the one-way
Diggy Daz, a busta ain't had enough against
Rough and tough but it's never too much
Daz and Kurupt, Kurupt and Daz on that ass
We clash blast suckers just like a head on crash
This ain't back in the day, you get taught and sprayed
AK front to the back cause we hard to fade
We enormous, we attackin' it plus we swarmin'
To Rumble in the Jungle like Ali and Foreman
We rippin' it up, we be givin' it up
On the daily homeboy we be givin' it up
We be cuttin' it up, scufflin' to muffle it up
Homeboy Diggy Daz fuckin' 'em up
[Hook] 4x

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Livin' it up -- shakin', makin' the hood turn
Boil and burn, two buckets of yearn
Flippin' stickin' fools for chicken, scrapin' the curbs
Scrappin' for the domes straight to the head Thunderbird
I'm on it homey, me and my homegirl Diamond
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhymin'
Daz, my closest homeboy
California lickin' switches a couple toys
I'm tired retirin' a couple jerseys
Went from the sunny state to Jersey, puffin hershey
Let off, get off, or get spin off
Spit off, set off, spun off the chest
Off the roof, a hundred and seventy-eight proof of boost
Gangster Daz and Kurupt let loose
This is it, short change dip wit us
Sip wit it us, cock your heat or spit wit us

[Hook] 4x

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I'm tired of this (this) I'm tired of that (that)
I'm bout to bust, fool where's the strap
G fo' flow for sho', bounce galo'
Up and down stairs beats everywhere I go
Calico excursions, different diversions
Homicidal resurgence, swerve and see my homey
On the corner chippin' the curb and any busta
Get close enough we servin'
You might also like[Verse 4: Daz]
Homey don't get nervous
Beware, that's Kurupt, fool beware
Rippin' it up fool so you better beware
Of my crew, gray and blue'd up get chewed up
You and your all red crew get bruised up
I'm the one you love to hate so give me mine
And pay dues and now I'm livin' the life of crime
Switched up, hit em up, blast or get em up
Forty-five, TEC-9s blast to hit 'em up
Aww yeah
