Wonder Why They Call You Bitch (G-Mixx) Lyrics[Intro]
Kurupt, AV
Oh, that’s how you wanna act?
You trippin’

[Bridge]
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
You trippin’
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
No, bitch
[Hook]
Aye, you doin’ shit that a bitch do
And aye, tell that nigga he a bitch too
You too loud, nigga, turn it down some
You said you ain’t a bitch but you actin’ like one
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch

[Verse 1]
Verse 1 for these bitch niggas
Why you actin’ like a bitch nigga?
Check it out, turn it down before I kill somethin’
You actin’ like you’re thugging, I’m a real one
Crack gritty gang, bitch I’m in this thing
Looking like money, you looking like a lame
And baby want a boss, I ain’t with the talk
So if she ain’t fucking, tell her get lost
Little ho you gotta know, you ain’t with it you gotta go
I need a bitch that’s with the business
That’ll suck and fuckin for sure

You steady playin’ like you not but I’m knowin’ that you a ho
You steady playin’ like you not but I’m knowin’ that you a ho

Aye, you doin’ shit that a bitch do
And aye, tell that nigga he a bitch too
You too loud, nigga, turn it down some
You said you ain’t a bitch but you actin’ like one
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch

[Verse 2]
Old funky ass, rat trap, scud bucket
Ratchet ass, nasty ass bitch
Yeah I’m talkin’ ‘bout you bitch
And your funky friend too, bitch
Money make the world go ‘round
With my gift I can put my dick in any bitch’s mouth
These to the honey, the honey is the money
Which enables me to turn a bitch
Outdoors, get it poppin’ like popcorn
But I ain’t mad at you, what the fuck you stop for?
I know why you came in and out for
Why you actin’ like you’re something that you not for, bitch?

[Hook]
Aye, you doin’ shit that a bitch do
And aye, tell that nigga he a bitch too
You too loud, nigga, turn it down some
You said you ain’t a bitch but you actin’ like one
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch
[Verse 3]
Real game, I ain’t here to ball you
I’mma call you what you mama call you
Ya act like ya never heard it
Yea bitch you deserve it
Pop a molly, now you’re feelin purvey
Bitch think and curvy and now she wanna serve me
Seabisquit, Kentucky dervy
Purse first, now tell me are you really worthy?
Line em up
Givin these bitches they vitamins
Yes, I’m known to be the best guy
Represent the west side, grab my dick and test drive
Up and down the avenue
Magic like manigo, that bitch was in Navajo
Scratch, match it, pretend shit
You talk bitch? Ya mama was a ratchet

[Hook]
Aye, you doin’ shit that a bitch do
And aye, tell that nigga he a bitch too
You too loud, nigga, turn it down some
You said you ain’t a bitch but you actin’ like one
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch
Call you a bitch ‘cause you a bitch, bitch1Embed
