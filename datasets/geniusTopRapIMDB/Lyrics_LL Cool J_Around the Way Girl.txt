Around the Way Girl Lyrics[Intro]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
On your loving

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way
[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay (On your loving)
Come around my way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me, to the bridge)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You might also like[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin' shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee (On your loving)
I love you, you're from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only— You got me sh—)
I need an around the way girl (An around the way girl)
Fine as can be (On your loving), she's all I ask
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl (An around the way—)
Fine as can be (Way)
[Outro]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—7Embed
