Control Myself Lyrics[Jennifer Lopez]
No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Se√±or LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes
Uno, dos, tres, muevete!

[Jermaine Dupri]
Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited
She said
You might also like[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you
[Jermaine Dupri]
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna
