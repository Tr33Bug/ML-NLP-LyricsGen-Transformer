Going Back to Cali Lyrics[Hook]
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Going back to Cali, stylin', profilin'
Growlin', and smilin', while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, 'cause it's sittin' on Daytons
Nardi steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
VRRRROOM engine's blowin', the chrome, is shinin'
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play
[Hook]
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hey y'all, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

[Verse 2]
I'm going back to Cali, shakin' 'em, bakin' 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
I know a place, off Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, but the girls still strip
The record skipped, but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin,' romancin'
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus, but I don't wanna pay

[Hook]
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... man, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

[Verse 3]
I'm going back to Cali, risin', surprisin'
Advisin' realizin', she's sizin' me up
Her bikini - small; heels - tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, "Close your eyes, I got a surprise"
And I ran away with the bottle of wine
You might also like[Hook]
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so
