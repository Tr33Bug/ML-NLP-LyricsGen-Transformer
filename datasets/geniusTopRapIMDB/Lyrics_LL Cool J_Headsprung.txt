Headsprung Lyrics[Verse 1: L.L. Cool J]
They call me Big Elly, a bit silly
But big money, big really
When I'm sliding in the Martin ya hear me
I be slicing with these bars so ya fear me
Let me rip it up for cuz in the back
Let me flip I put a buzz in ya hat
I'ma tell ya how to cause an attack
Timbaland, Ladies Love on the track
Lovely get the ice, pop champagne
Don't forget I used to ride on the train
When I bump it right, call my name
Go crazy in the mall wit James
Dump cat, not ill like me
Bring the women in to chill for free
Let me tell ya girl, don't try me
You better have I.D. 'cause we be
[Hook: Timbaland]
When we be up in the club, we be posting the back
When we be in the club, girl always come to the back
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
When we be up in the club, we be posting the back
When we be in the club, girl always come to the back
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung
And we 'bout to get our head sprung

[Verse 2: L.L. Cool J]
Lord have mercy! If the broad is thirsty
I'll have her man reimburse me
The part that hurts me, is when they try to work me
But I could never let ya jerk me
Steady sticking to the wall, give it up
Sneaking through the back door, live it up
Got the champagne, pour me a cup
Got the girls looking raw in the front
Got a call, your man's in town
Tell the bar a-nother round
Got all my mans holding me down
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it
I'm saying what time wanna dip wit it?
Got playas on the grind, wanna skip wit it
Backstage you mine, I'm a spit wit it, hey!

Hey ladies! (Yeah!) no need to get your hair done
