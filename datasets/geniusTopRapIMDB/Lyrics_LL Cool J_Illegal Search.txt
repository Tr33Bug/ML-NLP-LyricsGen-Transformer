Illegal Search Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, baby, put your seatbelt on, I got my paperwork, don't worry
It's cool
Illegal search, do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
Illegal— Illegal search, do you wanna see it?
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it

[Verse 1]
What the hell are you lookin' for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Wear my jewels and like freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure I'm poor?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne, to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life, I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
I'm not a dog, so damn it, put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case
You're just a joker perpetratin' the ace
You got time, you wanna give me a taste
I don't smoke cigarettes, so why you're lookin' for base?
You might plant a gun and hope I run a race
Eatin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace
You tried to frame me, but it won't work
Illegal search
[Chorus: The Flex & LL Cool J]
Keep on searchin' (I'm totally relaxed)
Keep on searchin' (Illegal searchin')
Keep on searchin'
Illegal— Illegal search (Illegal search)
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin' (Illegal searchin')
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta—

[Verse 2]
I call it nice, you call it a drug car
I say disco, you call it a drug bar
I say nice guy, you call me Mr. Goodbar
I made progress, you say, "Not that far"
I just started it, you're searchin' my car
But all my paperwork is up to par
It's in my uncle's name, so the frame won't work
Chump, illegal search

[Chorus: The Flex & LL Cool J]
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin' (Illegal searchin')
Keep on searchin'
Illegal— Illegal search (Illegal search)
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin' (Illegal searchin', you won't find nothin')
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta—

On the turnpike and everything's right
In the background is flashin' lights
Get out the car in the middle of the night
It's freezin' cold and you're doin' it for spite
Slam me on the hood, yo, that ain't right
You pull out your gun if I'm puttin' up a fight
My car, my clothes and my girl is hype
But you wanna replace my silk with stripes
You're real mad, your uniform is tight
Fingerprint me, take me name and height
Hopin' it will, but I know it won't work
Illegal search

[Bridge: LL Cool J]
Do you wanna see it?
Keep on searchin', baby (Illegal search)
Do you wanna see it?
Ayo, Marley, get funky

[Refrain: The Flex & LL Cool J]
Illegal— Illegal— Illegal search (Real funky)
Illegal— Illegal— Illegal search (Right there)
Illegal— Illegal— Illegal search (Funk it up)
Illegal— Illegal— Illegal—
[Verse 4]
I wore a suit to court, the case got thrown out
I'm that man that you all read about
Put me in jail, you're doin' it for clout
I only got one question, what's that all about?
Jail is somethin' that I can do without
Case dismissed and now you wanna pout
You feel like tryin' it again, but you know it won't work
Illegal search

[Chorus: The Flex & LL Cool J]
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin' (Illegal searchin', baby, illegal search)
Keep on searchin' (But I got all my ID and my car's registered)
Illegal search (Illegal searchin')

[Interlude: LL Cool J]
Illegal search
And them cops out there
That did the wrong thing to one of my brothers in Jersey
Keep on searching, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause that was foul
Peace

[Outro: The Flex]
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin', gotta, gotta, gotta keep on searchin'
Illegal— Illegal— Illegal search
