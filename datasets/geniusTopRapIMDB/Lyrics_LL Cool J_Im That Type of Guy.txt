Iâ€™m That Type of Guy Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're the type of guy that can't control your girl
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine
You're the type of guy that tells her, "Stay inside"
While you're steady frontin in your homeboy's ride
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave
I'm doin your girlfriend, that's somethin you can't believe
'Cause
[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
[Verse 2]
You're the type of guy that gets suspicious
I'm the type of guy that says, "The puddin' is delicious"
You're the type of guy that has no idea
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneakin' in from the rear
I'm the type of guy to eat it when he won't
And lick you in the places that your boyfriend don't
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Not knowin' that your main girl's bitin' my chunk
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady
Their boyfriends are boring, and I can drive 'em crazy
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop
She gave me a sweater. Thank you, sweetheart

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
You might also like[Verse 3]
I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast
You're the type of guy eatin' a TV dinner
Talkin 'bout... "Goddamn it, I'ma kill her"
I'm the type of guy to make her say, "Why you illin', B?"
You're the type of guy to say, "My lower back is killin' me"
Catch my drift?
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English
I'm the type of guy to cold pour 'n pamper
You're the type of guy to say, "What you talkin' 'bout?"
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
You know what I mean?
Check it out...

[Verse 4]
T-y-p-e g-u-y
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it
Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time
Swearin' up and down, "That girl's all mine"
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believin' it
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it
[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy, know what I mean
I'm that type of guy
"So ridiculous!"

[Outro]
So funny
I don't know
Come on now
Yeah
Like real cool, you know what I mean?
I like just going to your front door ringin' the bell
And just like
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!Embed
