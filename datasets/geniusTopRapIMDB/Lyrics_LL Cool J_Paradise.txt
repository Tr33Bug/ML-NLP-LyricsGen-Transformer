Paradise Lyrics[Intro: LL Cool J & Amerie]
10
Mm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Amerie]
If you need me, baby, I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
If you want it, baby, just be real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
We went through this before
Actin like the L's can't bag 'em no more
Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door; slide these on, baby
So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise; damn, I missed it
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely
I'm sayin', baby
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ohh)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ohh)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ayy)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Mmm)
Hey, girl—aw, girl!
Hey girl, I wanna rock your world

[Chorus: Amerie & LL Cool J]
If you need me, baby, I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise is very nice)
If you want it, baby, just be real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise (Uh, uh)
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

Next phase is this
Black sand, Tahiti, ten days to reminisce
God's my witness (Uh)
I paid the price for paradise, so I'm livin' this
I never limit myself, the L's fearless
Lay back while I illuminate the darkness
Like it smooth, don't cha?
Make it move, won't cha? Think I won't?
Take you to your peak, I know them other cats don't
And it won't stop, this is beyond paper
First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya
Never pimpin', raise my girls well
Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle L-L
C-double, L tattooed on the bubble
I lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle
True love is so rare
But don't you worry, I ain't goin' nowhere

[Chorus: Amerie & LL Cool J]
If you need me, baby, I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise is very nice)
If you want it, baby, just be real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise (Uh, uh)
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
[Interlude: Amerie]
Trust me, trust me, trust me, baby
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'll take you to paradise, oooohh
So won't you try me, try me, try, this, lady
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly
At the telly on the celly; get that money, Elle
Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it
Then the man can achieve it; you gotta breathe it
And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back, baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs
So much shade, baby, the waterbed fries
Walk around nude in the suite yellin', "Recognize!"
Do your dance, baby, pour me a class
It feels so good to have the world in a smash
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ohh)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ohh)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Ayy)
Touch it, why don't cha? (Mmm)
Hey, girl—aw, girl!
Hey girl, I wanna rock your world

[Chorus: Amerie & LL Cool J]
If you need me, baby, I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise is very nice)
If you want it, baby, just be real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise (Uh, uh)
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

[Interlude: Amerie]
Trust me, trust me, trust me, baby
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'll take you to paradise, oooohh
So won't you try me, try me, try, this, lady
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

[Outro: LL Cool J & Amerie]
Yeah, yeah, gotta keep your eyes on the prize, baby
Sky's the limit
If you can see it, you can be it
Ha ha, it's on you, word up
Everybody, put your hands in the air
It's high time, baby
One love, one God, recognize, uh
If you need me, just call me
Said if you want me, just be for real
And if you like me, come and talk to me
And if you want me, tell me how you feel
If you need me, baby, I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise is very nice)
If you want it, baby, just be real—Embed
