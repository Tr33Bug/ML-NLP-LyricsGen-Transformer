Phenomenon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke, all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up outta there, push eject
Taster's Choice, have her nice and moist
Or play paper games and floss the Rolls Royce
[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(Go 'head daddy, go 'head, daddy
Go 'head, daddy, ooh, Mr. Smith)

[Verse 2]
You was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she with a cat that worked construction
You wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind
Dis a new lover when you know it's alright
That's on top, lap dance has got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I did it too, Italian iced my whole crew
Piece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reachin', then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'?
Hell no, must be out ya go- (out yo mind)
Got you on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby
Work me out
You might also like[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(Go 'head daddy, go 'head, daddy
Go 'head, daddy, ooh, Mr. Smith)

[Verse 3]
You was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was airtight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, world premiere, yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Bonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami, I like that
Collect chips, cop his-and-her whips
To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed
[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(Go 'head daddy, go 'head, daddy
Go 'head, daddy, ooh, Mr. Smith)1Embed
