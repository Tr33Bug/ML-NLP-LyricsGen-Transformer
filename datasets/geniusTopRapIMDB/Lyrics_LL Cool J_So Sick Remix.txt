So Sick (Remix) Lyrics{*scratched: "To the beat y'all"*}

So, so sick... (TM)

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Oh me? ... My name is L
First of all you a banger, straight up and down
I'm seein minks on your hangers
I know your momma told you don't talk to strangers
That leads to dangerous situations, but I can't be patient
You need communication, appreciation
Respect for your style instead of talkin all wild
One smile, you're daydreamin of walkin the aisle
In the waterbed, rollin around in a money pile
Baby my format is not to be a doormat
But I still pull your chair out at the table and all that
Touch your back softly, whatever it cost me
Time money or energy, you will remember me
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we, can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense, cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice, anymore
(It's ridiculous) It's been months, and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us) And I'm stronger than this
(Enough is enough) No more walkin 'round with my head down
I'm so over bein blue, cryin over you; and

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Gotta fix that calender I have, that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you, and your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be; that's the reason

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
You might also like[Interlude: Ne-Yo]
(Leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm lettin go, turnin off the radio

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
I'mma keep you equipped in all of the best whips
Pay attention to detail, even your lipstick
Give compliments when your pedicure switch
When we on the mattress, you won't care if I'm rich
I'll love you deeply, whisper sweetly
Even when you critique me, you can still reach me
Beats me why you sweeter than a peach be
One bite's enough sugar for the whole night
You'll be aight, you rollin with the Elvis of rap
C'mon, move your pelvis and throw it back
I know it's forward and it sounds a little blunt
But love money respect, whatever, pick what you want

[Ne-Yo] That's the reason

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
[Ne-Yo] Said

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Ne-Yo] And

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Ne-Yo]
Why can't I turn off the radio?
