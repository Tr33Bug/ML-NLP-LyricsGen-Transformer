The Boomin’ System Lyrics[Intro]
Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Funky)
Cars ride by— (For all the cars out there and all the brothers)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (That like to front in they rides)
Cars ride by— (Check it out)
[Verse 1]
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from here, see
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
Twelve o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (All up at dawn)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Just frontin')
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems

[Verse 2]
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say, "What is this?
Mind your business"
Then pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin' my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin' and I don't care if you know
The back seat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's three o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin', I got the "Funky Drummer" drummin'
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin' so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond
You might also like[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Frontin', you know what I mean?)
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by—

[Verse 3]
Sunroof open so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say, I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said, I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops, "You gots to chill" with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Yeah, that's frontin')
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Cars ride by— (So next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Just remember)
Cars ride by— (It's cool)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by— (Peace)2Embed
