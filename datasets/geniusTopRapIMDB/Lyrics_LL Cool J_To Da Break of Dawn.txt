To Da Break of Dawn Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah (To the break of dawn)
All my effects involved (To the break of dawn)
As we get funky (To the break of dawn)
Problems will be solved (To the break of dawn)
Everybody knows (To the break of dawn)
When it come to a situation like this (To the break of dawn)
Little more effects (To the break of dawn)
And I can't resist (To the break of dawn)
So we get funky in the house, you know what I'm sayin'? (To the break of dawn)
LL Cool J style, but (To the break of dawn)
This ain't on a pop tip, check it out (To the break of dawn)
[Verse 1]
What is a panther? A animal that kills
I'm like a shark with blood comin' out the gills
You could never in your wildest dreams
Get a piece of this gangsta lean straight from Queens
Strong as liquor that be seen in a limousine
Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow
Made another million, so competitors bow
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong
Songs that ain't strong? Brother, you're dead wrong
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on
Huh, you can't handle the whole weight
Your skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate
Wise up, you little burnt up French fry
I'm that type of guy
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo
Put him in Pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper
When I'm through, he'll need a brand new identity
I was scoopin' girls before you lost your virginity
Your jam is just a dreamin' MC scheme
Gettin' crushed by a LL theme
Somethin' like Shaft, put you in a caskâ€”
Buck, you little bloodclaat boy, you must not know
The rep I keep, the MCs I peep, sweep
Play cheap and freak with a chic unique technique
Get rid of the yuck-mouth smile
'Cause brother, you ain't got no style
You might also like[Chorus]
Keep on (To the break of dawn)
Yeah (To the break of dawn)
Keep on (To the break of dawn, rock that shit)
Ayo, that's kinda funky, but check this out here (To the break of dawn), yeah

[Verse 2]
Immaculate styles I use to abuse MCs
So light the fuse and spread the news, you lose
To the damager, microphone manager
Cold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur
That amateur swingin' a hammer
From a body bag, so run and get your camera
Get a flick of the stiff, dead, shot to get swift
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with
'Cause I don't need a partner to swing
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring
Shootin' the gift, but you just don't shoot it right
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town
So don't try to play post, clown
You know that LL's back in town
And all the wanna-be sheriffs is gettin' shot down
Gimme that microphone
I'ma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
Stop dancin', get to walkin'
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin'
Huh, you little snake in the grass
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass
Gimme a lighter, woof
Now you're cut loose from that Jheri curl juice
Cool J is back on the map
And when I see ya, I'ma give you a slap
That's right, a little kick for that crap
'Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap
[Chorus]
Keep on (To the break of dawn)
Yeah (To the break of dawn), pump it up
I said keep on (To the break of dawn, rock that shit)
Check this out (To the break of dawn), yeah

[Verse 3]
How dare you stand beside me
I'm cool, I freeze I-C-E
On your trail and I'ma cut that ponytail
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients
But I'ma drink you down over the rocks
While the freak on your album cover jocks
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon
I took the cover right home to the bathroom
In the immortal words of LL, "Hard as hell"
Your broad wears it well
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies
But your rhymes are sloppy
Like Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped
And stopped, I ain't Murray the cop
Nor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix
So I can show you I'm immune to them romper room tunes
You little hip-hop raccoon
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef
Before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief
Workin' in a parking lot
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned
So tell me how you like your cold cream
On a cone, in a bowl or in a wet dream?
With your TV on channel fuzz
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does
Here's five dollars, catch a taxi cab
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab

[Chorus]
Keep on (To the break of dawn)
Yeah (To the break of dawn)
I said keep on (To the break of dawn)

[Outro]
Just wanted to funk it up a little bit
My man Pete Rock just walked up in the crib, you know what I'm sayin'?
Over here at Marley Marl house just coolin' out, my man Clash in the house
Sippin' on this Bartles & Jaymes premium peach-flavored wine cooler
Loungin' back, keep on
Peace
Yeah, that's funky3Embed
