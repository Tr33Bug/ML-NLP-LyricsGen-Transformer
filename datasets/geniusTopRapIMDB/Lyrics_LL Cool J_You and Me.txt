You and Me Lyrics[Intro: LL Cool J & (Kelly Price)]
Yeah, uhh, uhh
Word up
And you say New York City
A-ha-ha, word up (Take me away, baby)
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. uhh

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Damn, you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown, teary-eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma?  You wanna use my cell?
You runnin' solo?  This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beatin' on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheatin' on me
Mmm, I said miss, let me tell you somethin'
'Bout who's makin' major moves and who's frontin'
Huh, who's talkin' loud but ain't sayin' nothin'
And those who get the one they want but keep frontin
He don't appreciate the well 'til it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}
But smart birds choose to fly
'Cause we livin' in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the askin'
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you wanna ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
(I wanna ride, with you baby)
[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Now we dippin' on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talkin' and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You schemin', L want a one-night stand
I'm schemin', she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rollin', hopin' there's somethin' more
Dreamin' about tomorrow and what life got in store
Livin, no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't livin' like that, y'know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
'Cause I want you to think of me
When you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodgin' bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really wanna pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics
He said your fam be ridin' your nerves
And you hate him for never given you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whassup?
You might also like[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleedin', how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I wanna do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharin' you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparin' you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm takin' you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumpin' and it's settin' the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust there was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
'Cause you wanna be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you wanna do, however you wanna do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it
[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin love 'til ever after
Baby, you and me, yeah, you and me

[Outro: LL Cool J]
Knahmean?  Word up
Yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, I just want you to think about that, y'knahmsayin?
Late at night when you layin there
And you feel like the whole world is fallin' around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know, ahahah
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, knahmsayin'?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true
Word up, uhh
Knahmean? That's real
Queens represent, rock onEmbed
