Black Rage LyricsBLACK RAGE is founded on two-thirds a person
Rapings and beatings and suffering that worsens,
Black human packages tied up in strings.
BLACK RAGE can come from all these kinds of things
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial
Squeezing economics, subsistence survival,
Deafening silence and social control.
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul!

When the dogs bite
When the beatings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
and then I don't fear so bad!
Black rage is founded: who fed us self-hatred
Lies and abuse, while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason, This grid and its cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things

Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom, To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water, While they say it's raining
Then call you mad for complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth,
Murder and crime, Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion,
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things

So when the dog bites
And the beatings
When I’m feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don’t fear so bad

Free enterprise, is it myth or illusion?
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion?
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things.
Victims of violence both psyche and body
Life out of context IS living unGodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denial of self!
Black human packages tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must, but you can’t have my soul
Black rage is made by unGodly control
So when the dog bites
And when the beatings
And I’m feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don’t fear so bad15Embed
