Canâ€™t Take My Eyes Off Of You (Remix) Lyrics[Intro:]
Uh, uh, uh, we got the...
(Oh my God! Is it real?)
Oh, we got the...
(Oh my God! Is it real?)
A one-two, a one-two
(Oh my God!)

Yeah, uh...

[Verse 1:]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you (Baby)
You'd be like heaven to touch (Huh)
I wanna hold you so much (Yeah)
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive (I'm alive, yeah)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
[Verse 2:]
Pardon the way that I stare (the way that I stare)
There's nothing else to compare (What?)
The sight of you leaves me weak (So weak)
There are no words left to speak (words left to speak)
But if you feel like I feel (Yeah)
Please let me know that it's real (It's all real)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Chorus:]
I love you baby, if it's quite all right
I need you baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say okay (It's okay)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...
(It takes two to make a thing go right)

[Verse 3:]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive (Thank God, what?)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I need you baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say it's okay (Check the jewelers)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you (What?)
Oh baby let me love you, oh baby...

I need you baby (It's a conspiracy)
I love you baby (It's like... uhl...)
I need you baby (I want you)
Trust in me when I say it's okay
Oh, oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...

A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two
A one-two, a one-two...

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ya'll
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ya'll
It's a... it's a conspiracy
Read the papers!
Yo, 'cause it's all propagandaEmbed
