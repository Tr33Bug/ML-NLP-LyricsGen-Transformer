Consumerism Lyrics[Verse 1]
Consumerism running through them like a tumor in 'em
Ageism, sexism, racism, chauvinism
Capitalism running through them like the rumour business
Separatism, skepticism, modernism, atheism
Television running through them like an organism
Mechanism, despotism, poisoning the ecosystem
Satanism running through them like a politician
Hedonism, hypocrism, nihilism, narcissism
Egotism running through them, need an exorcism
Situation, heathenism, adversary demonism
To fix forms of religious spontaneity's a bad decision
Catholicism, Darwinism, barbarism, formalism
European fetishisms, terrorism running through them on their television
Introversion, extra prison tolerance for bad decisions
Exploitative be the saviour to correct the system/paranoia
Skepticism, schizophrenic, masochism
Escapism running through them need a sedative
Medication, complication, devastation negative
I say devastation negative
Modernism has created modern prisons
Neo-McCarthyisms, new colonialisms
Pessimism mess they is in
Hoodooism, hypnotism, egoism, realism, humanism, legalism
Mysticism makes decisions from a purer prism
Magnetism, pragmatism, altruism, pacifism/idealism
Actualism, rehabilitation-ism, ostracism, skepticism
Small fish ball for recognition oppressor and oppres condition
Sex, addiction, next suspicion, vexed, conflict and secularism
See, people need to villainize to offset disdain for their lives
Ugly human, ugly shame, corporate greed in Jesus' name
Anarchism, self-delusions
Victims leave with no solutions
Impositions, superstitions, violence and contradictions
False pretense and no convictions
Compromised commercialism
I said compromised commercialism
Worth and vision, work for wisdom
Full electromagnetism
Who comes first is first position
Rap's been missing you've been listening
Watch the empress bless the system
Paganism, false religion, plagiarism, broken system
Euphemism unforgiven
Inhibition, prohibition, disconnection
Broken wisdom, broken cistern can't hold wisdom
This town needs an exorcism
Egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism
Alcoholism, fascism, rationalism, national tension
Journalism gone gestapoism poporazzo-ism
As the world turns in isms
Trust eroticism, social drugs, narcotics in them
Cult existence, superstition
Ritual materialisms, serial isms
Habitual inferior vision
Consumerism
[Hook]
He is, he is
Set to, set to
Self-destruct, self-destruct
He is, he is
Too cool, too cool
To be true

[Verse 2]
Listen
Consumerism running through them like a tumor in 'em
Separatism, skepticism, desperation, nepotism
Capitalism running through the Montezuma in em
Ageism, sexism, racism, fascism
Television running through 'em like an organism
Hedonism, egoism, systematic narcissism
To empty religious spontaneity is anarchism
Social Darwinism, barbarism, modern paganism
Major schizism, division, ethnoplagiarism
Selfish business decision, greedy reductionism
Obstruction of the justice, occupation victimizationism
Brainwashing, mind control, synthetic stimulation in them
Time control mutilating the soul for a business decision
Help the people cope sell 'em dope from a new trope
Synthetic hope, life spent walking on a tightrope
Infantile masturbation, juvenile, no education
Mental castration, a generation forced to labor for a nation
Lock the means production down, price reduction down
Inflation and corruption need the medication now!
They need the medication now!
Corporate production in a state of mass combustion
Greed and lust and dangerous repercussions
To escape the rupture they speak of rapture
While still going after the things they spiritually capture
Distaster faster and faster and faster
Terrorism running through them on their television
Introversion, indecision, reactionism, hypocrism
Phony nationalism, dishpan Africanism
Material hypnotisms, monopoly, militarist devi-isms, sadomasochisms
Intellectual fetishisms sold on computers and televisions
Exploitative need a saviour to correct the system
Paranoia skepticism, schizophrenic mechanisms
Escapism running through them need a sedative
Medication, complication, situation negative
Modernism has created modern prisons
Neo-McCarthyisms, new colonialisms
Pessimism makes decisions, hoodooism, hypnotism
Egoism, realism, humanism, legalism
Small fish ball for recognition oppressor and oppressed condition
Sex, addiction, vexed conflict and anarchism
Self-delusions, victims leave with no solutions
Impositions, superstitions, brutism, contradictions
False pretense and no convictions
Compromised commercialism, recognition
Any decisions from a pure prism
Magnetism, pragmatism, altruism, actionism
Activism, pacifism, rehabilitation-ism
No false sensationalism, aped assimilation in 'em
Corporate cannibalism, psychological limitations in 'em
No imitations, competition, gross assumption
Parasitism, negative stimulation in 'em
Consumerism
