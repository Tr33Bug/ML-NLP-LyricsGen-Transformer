Everything is Everything Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring (Must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring (Must come)
Change, it comes eventually

[Verse 1]
I wrote these words (I wrote these words) for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception in, instead of what is truth (Gotta know the truth, y'all)
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that...
[Chorus 2]
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything (Everything)
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything

[Verse 2]
Our philosophy possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist (Word)
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning (Word)
My practice extending across the atlas, I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti (Ooh, uh)
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (El Shabazz!)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations (What?)
Then came down for a little conversation (Huh)
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum (What?)
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture (Uh)
Develop a negative into a positive picture

[Chorus 1]
Now everything is everything (Everything, y'all, everything, y'all)
What is meant to be will be (What is meant to be will be, yeah)
After winter must come spring (After winter, must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually (Change, it comes eventually)

Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream (Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream)
But things come slow or not at all (They come slow, know what I mean?)
And the ones on top won't make it stop (Ones on top, they won't make it stop)
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation (Better situation, uh-uh)
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow (Tomorrow, our seeds will grow)
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that

[Chorus 2]
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything (Everything is everything)
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything (Everything is everything)

[Chorus 1]
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter (After winter) must come spring (Must come)
Change, it comes eventually5Embed
