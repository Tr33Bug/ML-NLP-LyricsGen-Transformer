Final Hour Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-uh
Uh
And yo
Uhh, uhh (Like fungus among us)
Yo, yo (Haha), uh

[Verse 1]
Yo, I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce, words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it
Drop it, your whole crew microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles, and on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother (Nah)
Business, I been in this third LP you can't tell me
I witness first-handed, I'm candid, you can't stand it
Respect demanded, and get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad
[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

[Verse 2]
I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
'Cause with all thatâ€™s going on I got the world in my palm

[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour16Embed
