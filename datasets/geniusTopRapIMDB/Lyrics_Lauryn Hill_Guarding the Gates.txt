Guarding the Gates Lyrics[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, what you're runnin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you're gonna do, where you're goin' to
'Cause they wanna come, where I'm showin' you
Yes, they wanna come, where I'm showin' you

[Post-Chorus]
All that you can be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at all the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
You can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love
[Chorus]
Don't you wish you had real love?
Yes, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Tryna fix myself for society
Tryna mix myself for society
But can you tell me, where is love in anxiety?
Can you tell me, where is love in anxiety?
What you say to me, I don't mind at all
What you say to me, I don't really care at all
'Cause I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

[Verse 2]
Watch them speculate on the life you live
Watch them try to hate all the love you give
All the love you give

[Verse 3]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, 'cause they wanna come
Or so they think until they find the cost of it
'Til they find out, find out what you lost for it
And I'd do it all again
'Cause I found love
'Cause I found love
You might also like[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, what you're runnin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you're gonna do, where you're goin' to (Where you're goin' to)
'Cause they wanna come (Wanna come), where I'm showin' you (Showin' you)
Yes, they wanna come, where I'm showin' you (Showin' you)

[Post-Chorus]
All that you can be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle (Miracle)
Watch them marvel at (Marvel at) all the joy you have (Joy you have)
But they're too important to have all the joy you have (To have all)
What a tragedy (Tragedy), you can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
You can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love
[Verse 4]
So what you say to me, I don't even mind at all (What you say to me)
What you say to me, I don't even care at all (What you say to me, I don't even care)
'Cause I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Don't you wish you had real love?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Bridge]
These broken thoughts are in my mind
Can't let 'em get down in there
Can't let 'em get down in there
These broken thoughts are in my mind
Can't let 'em get down in there
Can't let 'em get down in there
'Cause I need real love (Guard)
(Guarding)
I need real love (Guarding)

[Outro]
I'm guarding, guarding the gates, ayy
(The gates)
(Guard, guarding)
Oh, I'm guarding my gates3Embed
