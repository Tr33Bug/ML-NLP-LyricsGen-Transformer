I Find it Hard to Say (Rebel) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Don't look at me that way
Like everything is alright
'Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
[Refrain]
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His life's so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your life's so incomplete
And nothing can replace it

[Verse 2]
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
'Cause like the Bible says:
His blood is on their hands

[Chorus]
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, is rebel
While today is still today, choose well
And what I gotta say, is rebel
It can't go down this way
Choose well, choose well, choose well
Choose well, choose well, choose well

[Refrain]
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing, and no one, can replace it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You might also like[Chorus]
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
Is rebel – rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Repent, the day is far too spent – rebel, rebel!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up and rebel
We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up, you might as well
Oh are you… oh are you satisfied?
Oh are you satisfied? Rebel, ohhh, rebel!

[Outro]
Why don't you rebel?
Why don't you rebel?
Why don't you rebel?
I'm fading myself down now9Embed
