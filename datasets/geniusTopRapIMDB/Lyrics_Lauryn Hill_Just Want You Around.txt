Just Want You Around Lyrics[Intro]
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around

[Verse 1]
Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound
[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

[Verse 2]
When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it
I was lost but now I'm found-found-found

[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

[Verse 3]
Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings underground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I have found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know-yeah
Who don't turn my upside-down
You might also like[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around4Embed
