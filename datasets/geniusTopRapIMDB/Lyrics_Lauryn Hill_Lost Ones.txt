Lost Ones Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one
[Refrain]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Verse 2]
Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one
You might also like[Refrain]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Chorus]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from (Gain from)
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
(You done, how come?)
You just lost one

[Verse 3]
Now don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one
[Refrain]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Chorus]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You just lost one

[Outro]
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
(How come, you lost one? It's so dumb)
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one
What a bam-bam!... hehehe
