Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your love is like the ocean, and I am like the sand
Responding to your power, a safe place for you to stand
But when the undercurrents come, and pull you out to sea
I'm left with shells and slippery rocks where you used to be
And when the sun comes beating down and burns my body dry
It's hard to wait until the tide to quench my thirst, so I cry, I cry
Cry, cry, and then at last, the sun goes down
And leads into your sea
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me, all over me
I dream of you, when I know I shouldn't, shouldn't
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldn't
You promised me you wouldn't you wouldn't
I said I'd be with you and I know I couldn't
And I knew I couldn't
Oh, I, oh I. Indeed, indeed, indeed
[Outro]
So moves like that
This is how we bust rhymes on a phat track
Me and Kahlee, female refugees, we get down like that
I don't know what to sing so my artistry brings
Things from off the top of my head
I bust freestyles instead
Of memories of the time when we were freeYou might also likeEmbed
