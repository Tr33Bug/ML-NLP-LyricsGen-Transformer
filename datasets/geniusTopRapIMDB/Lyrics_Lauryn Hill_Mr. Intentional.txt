Mr. Intentional LyricsYeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
See, the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out?
You're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 2]
All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 4]
Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, one-dimensional
Mr. Intentional
Oh oh, don't you do me any favors
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 5]
Wake up, you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh, it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional

See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional

So one-dimensional
Mr. Promotional
Mr. Emotional
