[Verse 1]
You know I'm only here 'til manana
Catch the plane so I can go to Punta Cana
Ripped up jeans and I'm Balenciaga mama
With dread dem who like to sing song, like satta massagana
I'm in the short natural like I'm Lola Folana
Birthed two lions codename Black Madonna
[?] head gear from Botswana
Backyard it's
[?] we no longer nana's
Watch that shit we go bananas
Watch that shit we go bananas

Who be the written * who be the mastermind
See how I sliced it up on this rhythm
So many wanna spice it up on this rhythm

So many, wanna
See how I sliced it up on this rhythm
So many wanna spice it up on this rhythm

[Verse 2]
So stop actin' like you didn't grow up singing my songs
I stoop down on this bitch like I had wings on my own
I transcended speak truth like I wrote the amendments
Sorry if you offended it's the truth that I mean
Birds, beans, and, *pie, we take it the same
Mention my name it's the same [?] they like [?] the brain
My shit still doin' the thing
My shit still raise the pain
Halabit* the world before we came
We conquered before we came
Emojis and all flames
And the game was never the same
And the game was never the same
