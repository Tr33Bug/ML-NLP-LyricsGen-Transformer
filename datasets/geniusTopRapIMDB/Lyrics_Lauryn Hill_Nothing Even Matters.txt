Nothing Even Matters Lyrics[Intro]
Whoa, ooh, umm, yeah, yeah
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ow yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world, it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
See, nothing even matters
See, nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love make me feel ten feet tall (Yeah)
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing matters at all

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still, there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
See, nothing even matters (Yeah)
See, nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me

[Verse 4: D'Angelo]
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously (Baby, baby)
'Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Said it don't matter, baby, baby
Don't matter

Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either-or
'Cause nothing even matters no more
See, nothing, it don't matter
See, nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more

[Verse 6: D'Angelo]
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
'Cause nothing even matters no more
(No more, no more, no more)
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
No, no more

[Outro: Lauryn Hill & D'Angelo]
To me, to me, to me, to me
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me
