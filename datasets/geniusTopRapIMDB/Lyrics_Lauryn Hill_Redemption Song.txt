Redemption Song Lyrics[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song
[Verse 2: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
But, we've got to fulfill the book

[Chorus: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Won't you help to sing
Another song of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption songs

[Bridge: Ziggy Marley]
Yeah, L. Boogie

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, if they can stop this fruit
They would pop this route
Chop this fruit
Treat us like a prostitute
Knock this youth
See me in my cocky suit
God's recruit
From fallin' even God's salute
Tribal truth
Ja people can't be mute
Share my youth to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[Outro: Ziggy Marley, Lauryn Hill & Both]
Won't you help to sing
Another song of freedom, yeah
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song (Haha)
Redemption song (Yeah)
Redemption song (Hey)
