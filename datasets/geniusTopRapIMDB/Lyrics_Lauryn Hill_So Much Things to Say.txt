So Much Things to Say Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yey
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, Why, heh

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
[Verse 1]
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So don't you forget no way...
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so very many things, to say right now
They've got so much things to say

[Verse 2]
And I don't come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places
And don't you fight me down
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men
Though the wicked find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency
'Cause when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top
Remember that
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much, so much things to say
They've got, heh, so much things to say right now
They've got so, so much things to say

But let them keep talking, oh let them keep talking
'Cause non of them walking, oh non of them walking, no
And while they still talking, see I'mma be walking
I'mma be walking, so let them keep talking

[Verse 1 Reprise]
Said I never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ
And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So non of you, non of you forget...
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle

[Verse 2 Reprise]
'Cause when this rain, 'cause when this rain, rain, rain, rain, rain falls
It don't fall on one man's house, I'm telling you the rain...
I'm telling you the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain don't fall
It don't fall... they...

[Hook + Outro]
They've got, they've got, so very many things to say about me
I'm telling you lie
They, and they, and they will have so many things
They'll have so many things to say about you...
To say about you
'Cause they don't know me, know me
They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me
Oh they don't know me well
They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father
'Cause if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey...
Heh..Embed
