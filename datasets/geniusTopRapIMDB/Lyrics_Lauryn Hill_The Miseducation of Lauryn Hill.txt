The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Lyrics[Verse 1]
My world, it moves so fast today
The past, it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

[Chorus]
But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
[Verse 2]
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

[Chorus]
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destinyYou might also like10Embed
