The Sweetest Thing Lyrics[Intro]
The unexpected
Multi-dimensional
Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars

[Verse 1]
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Oooh, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
[Hook]
See like the queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known

[Verse 2]
I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone

[Hook]
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the...

[Bridge]
Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it's in vain

[Verse 3]
Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armaretto
Intoxicating (Intoxicationg)
Oh, so intoxicating (Intoxicating)
How sad (so sad), how sad that all things come to an end
You might also like[Hook]
But then again (again), I'm, I'm not alone
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known

[Outro]
Ah
I sometimes watch you in your sleep
Ah
Excuse me if I get to deep (Ha)8Embed
