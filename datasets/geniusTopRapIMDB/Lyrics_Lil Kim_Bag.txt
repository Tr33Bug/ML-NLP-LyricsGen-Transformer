Bag Lyrics[Verse 1]
People looking at me different, people looking at me funny
Had to put some distance, had to keep these stank niggas from me
I've been gone for a minute 'cause I was getting to the money
Came from the gutter like a bum boy
Fuck niggas, get money, still, that's the protocol
Yes sir, I'm still hardcore
Numero uno, but you know a bitch'll still draw for her
My fans want an encore
Beach house overseas, that's the meaning of a north shore
I used to move that white boy, Justin Bieber
You a atheist, I’ll make you a believer
Mink dragging on the floor, I'm sayin' fuck PETA like Tara and Amina
I know people wanna see me fall
So I don't fuck with anyone at all
Money'll run from you if you chase it
Just sit back and have some patience
I be dodging them shots like the Matrix
Queen of diamonds, sippin' aces
Got the money in a chokehold, blue faces
And some more mills comin', I can taste it, yeah
[Chorus]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag, give me that bag
I'm only here for the bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me

[Verse 2]
I'm a bad gyal, so you know I move in silence
I'm a humble crook, I get your ass booked
And still scream "Stop the Violence!"
Most hated but I love that
Most underrated but I'm so above that
Cut you with the same knife you put in my back
Try me if you want, you'll be missing more than a hubcap
Now run and tell that to TMZ
It's the principle, don't try to lean on me
And what the fuck is twenty G's?
I get more than that to sip Rosé in VIP
I keep the bag on me like I'm Santa Claus
He feeling on my titties like Diana Ross
I'm so A1, don't really need the sauce
These yellow diamonds really piss a nigga off
Bezel so cold, I gotta thaw it out
Kim put that work and never call out
Dope girls, more than bass in these speakers
Shoebox money, ain't no space for the sneakers
I ain't stressing comments on the internet
I'm just adding commas to a bigger check
I'm just adding diamonds to a new Patek
I keep these haters sick, get them Mucinex
You might also like[Chorus]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag, give me that bag
I'm only here for the bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me

[Bridge]
You know I keep the bag on me
Every day I be getting to the money
All my life, I been getting to the money (Oh)
Bitches hating 'cause I'm getting to the money (Oh)
I be getting to the money (Oh)
All of these ones all over the floor, let 'em go (Oh)
All to the door, all to the door (Let 'em go)

[Chorus]
Give me that bag, give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag, give me that bag
I'm only here for the bag
Give me the bag, give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me1Embed
