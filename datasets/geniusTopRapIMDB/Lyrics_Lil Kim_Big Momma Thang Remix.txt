Big Momma Thang (Remix) LyricsI used to be scared of the dick
Now I throw lips to the shit, handle it like a real bitch
Heather Hunter, Janet Jacme
Take it in the butt - yes, yes, what?
I got land in the Switzerland, even got sand in the Marylands
Bahamas in the spring, baby, it's a big momma thing
Can't you tell by the diamonds in my rings
That's how many times I wanna cum, twenty-one
And another one, and another one, and another one
24 carats nigga, that's when I'm fuckin wit' the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me and oh
Don't ya like the way I roll, and play wit' my bushy
Tell me what's on your mind when your tongues in the pussy
Is it marriage? [Damn, this bitch is bad]
Baby carriage? [Damn, I love that ass]
Shit no, on a dime shit is mine, got to keep em comin all the time
Why? Lil Ceas
Chorus: repeat 2X

Killahs be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk tough walk that shit is tired
You wanna be this queen B but ya can't be
Thats why you're mad at me

Verse Two:

Hoes think I'm foul call me the bitch shitter
The lyrical gonna take a miracle
Like Deniece Williams bitches get ill, by the 6 shoota
Gunz we got a lotta, you can't see me not-a-lot
Want it raw dog well you best to see Poppa
Get your tit's licked, wouldn't it be glourous
If you you give head to Notorious, then say my crew
[Check it] you just a wanna be down wit my clique, bitch
Just a dick suckin ready for some ass fuckin'
Let me stress the tattoo on your breast
B.I.G., your rockin my property, P.Y.P. play your position
Know I got ya wishin you neva started dissin
Plus I give head better than you
Pussy get wetter than you, fuck better than you
I dedicate this song to ya ass
Like R. Kelly and that twin Pac up in your belly

Verse Three:

Saw a nigga whwh, pussy greases up
Stack da skeeza, keep em knees up
What da fuck stay chillin, pack a million
Geneva diva yeah, I throws it down
Lay around clown the clock steps for no one
Never 68 and owe 1, takes one to know one
Better of wit da Playboy magazines uh, fuckin wit da Don
Pussy tease, here's three for takes
Yeah I ride crate state to state
Lieutenant then it takes mad dimes, from New York to Anaheim
While you day dreamin wine, I just keep gettin mine
[And I'm] and I'm married to this
Y'all our strategy misses still planin wettins
Mafio also deadins all that bullshit
Any type of threatens to pull shit
Unh, ooh yeah who shot ya, huh
Who knows but they gotcha
Unh, fed up, uhh wet up uhh
Maybe next time keep your head up
