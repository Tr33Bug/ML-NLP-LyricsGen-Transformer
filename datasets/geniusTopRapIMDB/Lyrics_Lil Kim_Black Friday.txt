Black Friday Lyrics[Intro: Angie Martinez, Nicki Minaj, and Lil' Kim]
It’s funny 'cause, you know, we've been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you've been having this thing with Kim
And I don't know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you're a rapper
And I'm thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming
Even though you say it's not specifically about her, that "Roman's Revenge" is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know—
Shut the fuck up!

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck want war?
FedEx beef straight to your front door
It'll be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday to Friday the 13th
A'ight, you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, the shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name's what got you your job
You's a put together gimmick, somethin' like a collage
Since you puttin' on a show, you gon' get the applause
Clap, clap, lift your frame like a fucking garage, yeah
This hood shit, you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit the other bitch almost got killed for
I'm still countin' what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keep spinnin' like it's syndicated
Corny broad, I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight, I've been the greatest
See, the fact is what you doing, I did it
Lames tryna clone my style and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
You's a Lil' Kim wanna be, you just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, you ain't nothin' brand new
Check your posters and videos, you'll always be number two
I seen 'em come, I seen 'em go, still, I remain
Sweetie, you goin' on your fourteenth minute of fame
I'm over ten years strong still running the game
Cut the comparisons, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot, child, please, I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you're high or sippin' that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado, brainstorm
I drop bombs, Flex, napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppe's when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink, like my kitty sayin', "Hello"
If I whistle, they'll pistol whip you in all five boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn, I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You're the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin' off in your hood with no company
Come on, Queens ain't showin' you no love
I was there the other night, poppin' bottles with the thugs
You're like Washington, heffer, I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh, yeah, welcome to the fam, Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot, you're a burnin' match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh, I see, they really got you gassed like I'm a thing of the past
Better slow down, dummy, you 'bout to crash
Stank pussy ho, I'm givin' you a bath
Thermometer in hand and I'm comin' for your ass, ha
Who you think you gettin' past?
I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass
[Verse 2]
I draw back, I'm a Brooklyn thorough bitch, rep for my borough, bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out 'til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze 'til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team, all I see is a bunch of weirdos
You's an airhead bitch, scarecrow
Ha, ain't nothin old but my money, bitch
Ha, this is grown liquid assets
Benjamin's my daddy, you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy, sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes, I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh, taught by the great
So on my next move, I'm yellin', "Checkmate"
I smell a massacre
Charles Manson, you don't stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin' like lunch to me
'Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious, thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin' out the trash
You, shit on me? Come on, baby girl
Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me so chuck it up, deuces
All around the world, I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Mrs Rothstein
Tricks is for kids, silly rabbit, you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring

I mean, I know, I know you guys asked me if "Roman’s Revenge" was about Kim
And no I, it’s not about Kim
Actually, if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim
I don’t know, I just had temporary insanity, I lost my teeth and my mind...25Embed
