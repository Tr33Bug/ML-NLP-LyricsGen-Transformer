Came Back for You Lyrics[Interlude]
You say, "What is it that you want?
You've got everything that a woman could ever need in life"
I got a closet full of minks, chinchillas
I got a bureau full of diamonds, I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne, now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread baby
Now you know if anybody know, I know
But since you feel like that this evening, sit down and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none
But you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as Lil Kim, the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole Gotti family, stay up

[Verse 1]
This time around, I ain't takin no shit
This time around, I'll never get bit
This time around, I switched up my flow
Got rid of the Pits and put Rotts by the do'
This time around, it ain't like befo'
This time around, I'm gon' crack ya jaw
The feds is watchin' me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words, bitch, and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene, my favorite color is green
I'm buildin' a empire, got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood, fashion world adores me
Music's my first love, a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me, Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world, I came back for you
You might also like[Chorus]
I came back for you
All incarcerated Scarfaces, gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world, holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin' on me, all these hoes is hatin' on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin', Benz coppin', keep the bottles poppin'

[Verse 2]
It's the real hip-hop, mami, check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass, you out of your time
Tryna go against the queen, is you out of your mind?
Even bein' number two, your chances is slim
'Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes, but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick (Uh)
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin' money, don't think I just be lettin' shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion, ain't my fault y'all don't know how to
Rock this Hollyhood thang, y'all need to let me style you
Come back to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down
[Chorus]
I came back for you
All incarcerated Scarfaces, gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world, holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin' on me, all these hoes is hatin' on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin', Benz coppin', keep the bottles poppin'

[Verse 3]
This time around, either you in or your out
This time around, you better watch your mouth
This time around, you gon' hang or bang
This time around, you better do your thang
'Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success, goddamn it, I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin'
The blue Hpnotiq, martini, mimosa-sippin'
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army, y'all can't harm me
If the shoe was on the other foot, you'd probably try to stomp me
Don't get your life tooken (Tooken) I know I got you shooken (Shooken)
This Bed Stuy fly girl came back for Brooklyn (Brooklyn)

[Outro]
Didn't we almost make it?
Yeah, yeah, didn't we?
Didn't we, didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we, didn't we almost make it?
Yeah, yeah, didn't we?
Didn't we, didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we, didn't we almost make it?
Yeah, yeah, didn't we?
Didn't we, didn't we almost make it?3Embed
