Crush on You Lyrics[Intro: Lil' Cease]
UNDEAS
Little Ceasar
The bitch pleaser
Uh, uh, check it

[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Yo, I be buyin' 'em Vs, so all my girls be eyein' Cease (Uh-huh)
Comin backstage, dying to get pleased
You got me, I rock the Versace and linen (What, uh?)
While you stop your grinnin' with bunch of foxy women (Okay)
Why you speedball with cards? That's invalid (Uh-huh)
I get clothes custom made from a stylist (What?)
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage (Uh)
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot (Uh-huh)
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot (What?)
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish (Uh-huh)
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup (What?)
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uh
[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
I know you seen me on the video (True)
I know you heard me on the radio (True)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listening to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryna' put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin' to catch sea breeze I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass (What?), keep my lady laced (Uh-huh)
Don't be fooled by the baby face (Baby face)
I hope you're not (Uh), 'cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan (What?), that's to rise to the top (Oh)
I told you before when I first pursued
I want to interlude in the nude
Or we tastin' like food when we get in the mood
Listen ,girlfriend, we don't mean to be rude (Uh-huh)
But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take Jigga ass like the Playmate Of The Year
'Cause when I first met her, she had the Lex and the 'tegra
Game real good, sex was even better
I got it for the cheddar once I hit it in the sack
'Cause I'm Cease a.k.a. Long Dick from the back, uh

[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
Yo, shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal (Uh-huh)
I'll be right here just chillin' with your people (Cool)
You know Junior M.A.F.I.A. was just a preview
I know I had you hoping so why I'ma leave you? (What?)
Especially when I know yo' man is fee-ble
It's Cease Degenaro, you know how we do (What?)
My game is tight, we do the same every night
I'm smooth as the words that come from Frank White (Uh)
You messin' with city kings with glissy rings (What?)
That's gonna show you good time, pretty thing
'Cause you was spotted in the club lookin' exotic (Uh-huh)
By somebody short, dark and chocolate
You got it? Any plans to tape, yo, we stop it (What?)
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah we all about a profit (Uh)
I'm the right dude to get you in the nice mood (Mood)
Flossin' rocks the size of ice cubes, uh
[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
