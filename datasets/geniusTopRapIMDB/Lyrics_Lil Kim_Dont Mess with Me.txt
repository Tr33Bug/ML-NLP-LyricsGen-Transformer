Donâ€™t Mess with Me Lyrics[Intro]
See.. some niggas don't know how to act..
So I'm about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin' down niggas cribs

[Verse 1]
When we met, I can't front, I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me 'bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And "Heartbreaker" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)
[Chorus]
Heartbreaker, dream maker
Love taker don't you mess around with me, you're a
(Yeah, uh-huh uh-huh, you don't wanna mess with me)

[Verse 2]
Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin' on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you wanna dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin' one too?
You wrong! Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
"Don't know what you've got til it's gone"
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was "Waiting to Exhale"
(That's right)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm back to my old ways, like in the old days
Flirtin', not givin' a fuck, what?
Got you lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Damn!"
Sick thinkin bout the next man fuckin this tight pussy
Niggas want me, even though they got a honey
If I'ma be number two, they givin' me some hush money
Ask Whitney, I learned how to break a heart from you
Cause when a woman's fed up, it ain't nothin' you can do
I'm that Bitch, don't you ever forget
Witchu when you rich or when you ain't have shit
Now he cryin', he beggin', "Kim let me come back"
Like Mark Morrison, "Return of the Mack" baby!
