Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gimme all the rhythm and blues singers
Hen rock the shots of liquor, it makes me cum quicker
Rub between your belly like jelly
R. Kelly you think you ballin' but your body's callin'
Free fallin' and you roll in fuck the bumpin' and grindin'
Have you jumpin' and whinin' while I'm climbin'
I be doing groups like Troop
Body rockin' H-Town or Horace Brown
Watch out now
Babyface can pay the rent and cook me five meals
But momma got the whip appeal
What the deal on that Prince cat
He be lookin' fruity but you still can eat the booty
Brian McKnights tight Joe is kinda slow
Oh, what about D'Angelo
I want some of that brown sugar
Then watch this rap bitch bust all over ya nuts, like
[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)

[Verse 2]
I fuck Mista the flyway, fuck dem LaDae cats, they whack
And one on them resemble Craig Mack
I need a New Edition I need some Men of Vizion
Pussy eatin' position to go to shower pissin'
I made my Intro getting fucked in the Pinto
Now I'm skin deep in da Lexus Jeep
Peep da Queen sista if I would fuck wit Mista
They'd be suckin' blackberry molasses out my asses
Jason, who da fuck time ya wastin'?
I got no patience for little dick tastin'
I'd rather go dolo than solo so I can get some Heaven
And be the fuck out After 7
All for One and One for All
I swear to God I'd never fuck with none of y'all
And if you're immature then I'm out the door
I'm on fire gettin' head by the Harlem Boys Choir

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)

I couldn't find a mall with Kenny Lattimore
Montell Jordan ain't scorin'
Tevin Campbell niggas like to shamble
Make him an example
With this pussy sample here we go
You didn't know Joe was my ho
Tony Rich my bitch don't fuck with this
I got the 112 nuts to bust so just
Open wide when I'm done give me a high five
You can touch me and tease me as if my name was Case
We got to drink a pace for me to participate
Don't playa nigga it's cool with me
I'm icin' Bryson that dude down with Groove Theory

[Chorus]
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
(Dreams of fucking an R&B dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B dick2Embed
