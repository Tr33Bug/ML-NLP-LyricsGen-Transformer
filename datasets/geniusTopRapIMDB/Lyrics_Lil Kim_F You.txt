F*** You Lyrics[Verse 1: Trife]
Nine shots greet ya, greet ya; hang with Lil' Cease-ah
But don't sling pizza, pizza
The gat carryin', rap barbarian
Ninety-six Blake Carrington
I brings the most dangerous diseases
Trife please MC's of all types
Homosexuals, dykes, intellectuals like my flow, my charm
Wifey on the arm and stay fucking other bitches
Style never switches
Inhale, exhale, bail Nino Brown out
For shootin' up a townhouse in Hempstead, kids fled
Rumors was dead, no beef with no cliques
Niggas don't want shit, Trife impresses
Lexus GS's, chicks in iceberg dresses
Who the best is? M.A.F.I.A
But faggot niggas wanna spoil it
Stop me from having marble faucets and gold toilets
I force it down your throat like sodomy; mama proud of me
'Cause I stopped killing niggas for free
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Uhh, uhh
The Anne Klein sportin', coke snortin', niggas lovely
I keep my pussy Fresh like Doug E., watch the show
As my flow bubble over like Mo's and Cristal's
Ain't scared to bust my pist-al, sippin' hard on Cristal
Dream accounts, large amounts
'Cause Frank don't play with lye money, get high money
Ready to die Grady, no if's, and's, or maybe's
I'm not your average lady; put that on my 380
Me and my bitch catch flights to Texas
Niggas call us Crystal and Alexis
Bump into some hoes that be in Houston boostin'
Trunk full of Donna Karan in the rental LeBaron
Uh, who us?
We just swervin', in the dark blue Suburban
Drinking Bourbon, with Heinekens for the chaser
Police'll never chase us we too fly for that
Processed and fingerprinted we too dime for that
I be, flirtin' for certain, wearing short skirts and
But ain't no dicks insertin' see, that's the difference
Between me and other bitches, they fuck to get they riches
I fuck to bust a nut, Lil' Kim not a slut
I gotta reputation to look out for
Plus my boss is a outlaw

Uhhh, motherfuckers think they tough guys
Motherfuckers better hold hands stepping up
Faggot ass motherfuckers
They really ain't no true players

[Verse 3: Larceny]
Death comes to those that oppose the clique
Dick-riders get off the dick
'Cause, Larceny got guns for y'all
And if I get bagged my lawyers got tons of ones for y'all
Catching cases, niggas pull they macs out
Niggas getting mad 'cause I dug they backs out
Then I blacks out, start shooting kids
Cribs is vicious, making my escape jumping bridges
Malicious, sometimes the danger taste delicious
Rule number three; don't take love from no bitches
You know what makes me much stronger than you
I can take pain much longer than you
So what you gon' do when I run up in that ass-crease
How you wanna spit a grease?1Embed
