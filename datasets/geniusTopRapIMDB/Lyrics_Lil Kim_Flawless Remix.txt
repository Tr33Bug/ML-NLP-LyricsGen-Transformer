Flawless (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Beyoncé]
Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the groun')

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scorin' touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm redboned yo
I'm really rit like Donjae
I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy you know I look good as fuck
You wish I was your babymomma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalate, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
(Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn)
[Bridge 1: Beyoncé]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Hook: Beyoncé]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé]
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn’t change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want
I’m the shit (what you want I’m the shit)
I’m the shit, I’m the shit, I’m the shit
I want everyone to feel like this, tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & (Beyonce)]
(Onika...)
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
(Them bitches thirsty, I’m Hungarian
Nicki, B, be eatin’, diamond fangs, barbarian, ah)
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell ‘em winning is my motherfuckin’ protocol
‘Cause I score before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain’t no fuckin’ soap involved, uh
This every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and B
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday mayday, earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass like we birthing bitches, uh
The queen of rap, slayin' with Queen B

[Verse 3: Lil Kim]
Am I trippin' or did this ho just say my name?
Queen of rap? Fuck outta here
Queen is back, fuck outta here
Time to get this wack bitch outta here
I woke up like this, fuck outta here
I'm so awesome, I'm so fuckin' awesome
These hoes wanna be me cause they know Kimmy, she flawless
Yea, I'm flossin', bitches got 'em nauseous
Phantom got 'em carsick, Panamera Porsche's
I just had a baby 'bout a week ago
These bitches got me on my bully yo
Look at this shit, still got my dick on her lips
I ain't even stunt in the bitch
Damn it's a shame
I gave you the rope, bitch, I want you to hang
Dior lipstick with the mascara
Kissin' myself in the rearview mirror
Head game so presidential, spit on a dick like an instrumental38Embed
