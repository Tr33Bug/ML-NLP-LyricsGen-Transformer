Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere

[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]
Girl, I found you, Ms. New Booty
Super thick, pussy wet like jacuzzi
Grab her phone, finna put her in a movie
She just want a real hot boy like Juvie
Found you, Ms. New Booty
Super thick, pussy wet like jacuzzi
Grab her phone, finna put her in a movie
She just want a real hot boy like Juvie
[Verse 1: Lil Kim & Yung Miami]
I'm a cutie with a big booty (Booty)
Big bag, I like big dicks, big ice
I got that good pussy, make a nigga cum fast
Then I let him use my face as a cum rag
I'm in Miami with Miami, we just jet skiin'
And it's "Free JT" 'til the jet leavin' (Period)
If you bitches that fresh, we the best breathin'
Jet leavin', I just flew into the next season
See my booty, booty, booty, booty rock (Ayy)
Ain't dropped in a minute, still got it on lock (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
All you cappin' ass niggas need to stop
Can't sail in this pussy with a boat, you need a yacht (Yep-nope)
And I don't know niggas names so I call 'em "Boo"
And I don't save numbers 'til they send a mil or two
What's up there, lil' bitch, stay big mad
Ya nigga give me big bags, you can kiss my big ass

[Chorus: O.T. Genesis]
Found you, Ms. New Booty
Super thick, pussy wet like jacuzzi
Grab her phone, finna put her in a movie
She just want a real hot boy like Juvie
Found you, Ms. New Booty
Super thick, pussy wet like jacuzzi
Grab her phone, finna put her in a movie
She just want a real hot boy like Juvie

He want a bitch out the city, yeah
Who prettier? Nice ass and some titties, yeah, for really, yeah
Wanna kiss up and lick up the pussy for fun
Tryna switch up the liquor so you could get drunk
Hunnids on hunnids is what make me cum (Brrrt)
Fuck me for free? You must be drunk and dumb
You better ask 'round 'bout me, where the fuck I'm from (Yep)
These niggas gotta pay, fuck that, I'm young
All you retarded with it? You got the dumb head
Fuck my mind all night, don't cum yet (Nah)
Don't leave me daddy, where you goin'? (Where you goin'?)
Put your card on file, let's blow it (Let's blow it)
We can party all night 'til the sun out (Sun out)
After two is when the freak really come out
But soon as you run out, I'ma run out
Drop the Bentley and drive wit' my tongue out (Oww)

[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]

[Verse 3: O.T. Genasis]
Rich ass Crip wit' a whole lotta cash
Four fingers on her cheeks, got my thumb in her ass
She wanna quickie in the car, tryna fuck quick (Quick)
Before I touch that pussy, you gon' suck dick
And so I need the type of bitch (Bitch)
That make you cum quick, beat it like a drumstick
In town for the night so you know I gotta pack and leave
I love when the pussy like mac and cheese
Bend that over, go 'head, arch that (That)
All that bumper, I'm gon' park that (Baow)
I met a lil' bitch, she was super cool (Cool)
Still had to send her in the Uber Pool
Got a mirror on the wall, I can see when I fuck (Fuck)
Hands on her stomach, got my D in her guts (Hey)
Titty fuck, yeah that's my move
Blow this dick like some hot ass food
