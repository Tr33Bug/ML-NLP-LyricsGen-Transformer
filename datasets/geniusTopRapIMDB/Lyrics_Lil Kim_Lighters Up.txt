Lighters Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle
The strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
It's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after
[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-Town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Verse 2]
Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
'Cause people is talking
The streets is watching
The D's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We don't play that
Out in BK, not at all
Gor a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P. in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn
You might also like[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (L.A.)
Put your lighters up (V.A.)
Put your lighters up (Texas)
Keep putting your lighters up (New Orleans)
Put your lighters up (St. Louis)
Put your lighters up (ATL)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Bridge]
Damn homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it, bartender you can give me one more
(We in the club like)
Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Passing the bub like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
(Back at the bar like)
Fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

[Verse 3]
See, BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you don't understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la señorita más linda del barrios
Y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year-olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution
There's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn
[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (New Jersey)
Put your lighters up (Boston)
Put your lighters up (B'more)
Keep putting your lighters up (Miami)
Put your lighters up (Puerto Rico)
Put your lighters up (Kingston, Jamaica)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up
