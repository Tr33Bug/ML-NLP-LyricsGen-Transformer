M.A.F.I.A. Land Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, uhh
In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land, y'all
Where loyalty is everything
The M.A.F.I.A. forgives, but never forgets
Heh, let me tell you

[Verse 1]
In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land where there's one boss and one clan
Yes mans, they surround us like steaks in pans
All 'em wanna be the man, right hands wash the left hands
Loyalty's priority in this fam
Where life's initiated, ain't no givin' it back
Once you in it, like Bennett, you'll soon be lieutenant
Like me, the Don Juan, that's Yvonne
The sweat-a the money getter
Coppin' mad cheddar
Stevie was Wondering how I got in this position
One day Frank was fishin' for competition, expedition
Number one, his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano, '96 stick-shift 'cross the Verrazano
I lay gently in the Bentley, through binoculars he seemed popular
Givenchy socks, Cartier coolats
H-class rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like leukemians, receding hairlines
Watch how genuine this gold mine recline
When Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped they clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit
Tried to play Big Poppa, don't worry
Minutes before I drop her, the *blow! blow! blow!*
Like a parolee, the bitch violated
So how you like it: coffins or cremated?
[Chorus]
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas

[Verse 2]
Street murderers, thug parasites
We official, no fake gators
Coppin' firearms with dud missles
We leavin' scar tissues
That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga, what! threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles, just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle knuckles
Damn! How could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence
And throw our whole shit off balance?
But still, they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside the Devil's triangle
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One cross-eyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with Black
The third nigga had missin' teeth and tattoo teardrops
Long hair, chest felt like a bag of rocks
Before this chops
I grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box, et cetera, et cetera, and it don't stop
I got away with everything, the cash and the stash
You might also like[Chorus]
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas

[Verse 3]
So now I'm titled, mission accomplished
My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin! I know this nigga's thinkin'
"Damn! She too little, too pretty, too quiet
The bitch is hired," mob's wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life
We increase the price, uhh
So guess who the bitch is?
But for now I be the mistress

[Chorus]
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas3Embed
