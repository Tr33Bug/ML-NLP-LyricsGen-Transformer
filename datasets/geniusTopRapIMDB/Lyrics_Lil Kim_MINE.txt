#MINE Lyrics[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking at it
I don't mind people looking at it
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder
[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
You know how we be moving
Me and Kevin Gates
I'm a star and I'ma keep shining
Like the roof on the Wraith
Eat my pussy with his breakfast
'Cause he love the way it tastes
He said that I stay on his mind
How I be sitting on his face
I don't need nothing but bread
I don't need niggas for nothing but head
They all fantasize being with Kim
Every night, I'm laying right next to him
Fuck my ex, you make me wetter
Fabulous, you make me better
Chanel sneakers, Chanel leather
Chanel bag in Chanel weather
Hundred grand on that Piaget
I don't hear what no peon say
See me with him, just know that's bae
Ten carats scream fiance
See my pussy print all through my jeans
I know you watch all this ass behind me
Should be watchin' this nigga that's right beside me

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder

You know how we be moving, listening to Future, Pluto
People like us take over, I'm a shooter with a shooter
Says she down here from up north, college, she commuting
She my new professor, I'm learning, I'm a student
Her momma hate me, say I'm too advanced, ask her how she's doing
She never say it to my face, I'm turnt up I'm a movie, yeah
At night she hear her daughter scream, Cassius Clay, I boom bye yae
My hand around her throat she naked, I bent her over on the dresser
It's too gangsta how I'm dressin', beat the pussy up, no question
Pull her hair ho, you for Kevin, hair red or blonde, or whatever
I-I'm caressin' on her breastes, kissing on her, you a blessin'
Knew I loved her when I met her, she love me, you looking for her

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grind her

[Verse 3: Lil Kim &  Kevin Gates]
You pulled it out and now he's shookin' on it
Grabbed my neck and now I'm choking on it
Hold it down if you go to prison
Conversate, conjugal visits
Keep our love, I got the COD
I'mma hold it down like P.O.P
That dope pussy that chronic
That DRE, so don't OD
Hold up baby, come here, give it to me
I'm about to uh huh, lick the pussy
In the car, don't give a fuck who lookin'And stroking on it, hustle through this for you
Dick her full, don't know if you notice
Say it ain't come here on a muscle
Lot of spit when you humming on it
Legs shaking now you cumming on it
Quiet babe, power coming on it
Uber coming, now you going home
I know it's difficult dealing
With a nigga that's in my profession
Hold up babe, why you in your feelings?
Break it for me, gotta tell your nigga
"Fly a kite" Michael Jackson, thriller
You say, "Don't nobody keep it realer"
Real one, I homicide the vision
Say her name, they gon' get the business
Chris Brown, playing when I killed her
He could fuck you too cause that's my nigga
Hand cuffin' pussy, I ain't with it
She could be for you and treat her special
Yeah, she say she love me, you looking for her
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grind herEmbed
