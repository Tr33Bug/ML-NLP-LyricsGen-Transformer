Not Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and RÃ©my
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, "I'll be back," go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', "Gimme"
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, "rockin' the mic"
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy
[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
"I thought your ass was still sleepin'"
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
"I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone," screamin'
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

[Verse 3]
The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight8Embed
