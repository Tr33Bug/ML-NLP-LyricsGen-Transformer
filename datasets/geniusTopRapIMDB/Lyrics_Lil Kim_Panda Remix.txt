Panda (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Lil' Kim]
I know they see us coming
I know they see us coming
Ayo, Desiigner
We see you, baby
Welcome to the Royal Brooklyn Family
I ain't came to play, I came to slay

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I got killas in Belize
I got niggas in the league
NBA, NHL, MLB
Watch how I go off on the Hennessy
NFL, no sacks
I got the ball like a running back
My nigga OT with a hundred packs
I hit the mall with a hundred racks
Two straps like a backpack
Rolls Royce and a Maybach
Back to Back like a Drake rap
Drive the Rari like I'm on a race track
White kicks Buscemi
Black Whip Borghini
Back on top like a beanie
Eat the booty like zucchini
He pulled it out, it was teeny
Pour some ketchup on that weenie
My niggas pour lean in Bellinis
My pussy wet like a bikini
Getting cheese, fettuccine
Move and work out the deli
Move my body like a genie
Disappear, Makaveli
[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Maino]
White mink, panda
I got white, Hannah (Let's go)
I feel like Tony Montana
White diamonds, panda
White mink, panda
I got white, Hannah (Uh-huh, Maino, I gotta get it)
I feel like Tony Montana (Ohh)
White diamonds, panda (Let's get it, yeah)

[Verse 2: Maino]
I got broads in Atlanta (Yeah)
Couple broads that are scammers (Yeah)
They work hard to Atlanta (Whoo)
To hit the malls in Atlanta (Ha-ha)
YSL, fly as hell
Party like we just got out of jail (Ayy)
Couple my shooters fresh out on bail (Whoo)
I keep them bitches that's bad as hell (Yeah)
I blew my money in aces (Yah)
I’ve seen your woman crush naked (Let's go)
Fuck and forgot what her name is (Let's go)
She didn’t even know what a Wraith is (Ha-ha-ha)
Hop out the Rolly Royce
Diamonds all over my rolly, boy (Boy)
You fell in love with the bitch (Yah)
Did you think you was her only boy?
I am the king of the streets (Yah)
Niggas you look up to cater to me
Always been full with the K in the street (Whoo)
I told ‘em that I would be back with the queen (Yeah)
Ya done messed up, feel the pressure
Chain too big, can’t lift my neck up (Uh-huh)
Just one hand, I lift the tech up
At his head 'case he vest up, ayy
