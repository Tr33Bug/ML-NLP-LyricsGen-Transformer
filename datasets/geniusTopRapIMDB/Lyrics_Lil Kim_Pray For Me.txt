Pray For Me Lyrics[Intro]
Xtassy

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild, Lil' Kim, Musiq Soulchild & Lil' Kim]
Uh, started out hardcore (Hardcore)
Done it like never before (Done it like never before) (Never, never)
So many shows, so many tours (Woah)
And you the one that I do it for
Still goin' to this day (To this day)
Still got all my songs on replay
If you want me to stay (Want me to stay)
I'm gon' need you to just pray
[Chorus: Lil' Kim, Musiq Soulchild]
Pray for me (For me, yeah)
'Cause I be in these streets so much, I don't if I'ma make it (I don't know)
I don't if I'ma make it (Sometimes, I don't know)
Pray for me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause times get hard, then the money gets low
But don't give up, you got to stay down before the come up

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim, Musiq Soulchild, Lil' Kim & Musiq Soulchild]
We got it out the mud like football cleats
You put a ring on my finger but you married to the streets (Ooh)
I know you gettin' to the bag, baby
I just pray to God that you make it back baby, uh (Oh)
I ain't worried 'bout a bitch takin' you from me (No)
I'm more worried about the streets takin' you from me (Oh)
I'm more worried about police takin' you from me (Yeah, oh)
So before you leave the house, kiss me and tell me that you love me (Yeah, oh, yeah, oh)

[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Musiq Soulchild, Musiq Soulchild]
Pray for me (Pray for me, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I be in these streets so much, I don't if I'ma make it (I don't know)
I don't if I'ma make it (No)
Pray for me (So, just pray for me, yeah)
'Cause times get hard, then the money gets low (Oh don't give up)
Don't give up, got to stay down for the come up

See, I be prayin' for my trapped niggas
Every night on my knees (On my knees)
I be prayin' for you (Prayin', prayin')
Pray for me
You gotta hustle with your head (Hustle with your head)
And not with your heart (And not with you heart)
You gotta mean what you say (What you say)
And finish, finish, what you start

[Interlude: Rick Ross & Lil Kim]
Return of the Coogi sweaters and gold Jesus pieces
Light up the backwoods (What you start?)
Uh (What you start?)
What you start? (Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Wake up in Versace boxers at the Ritz
Fell asleep, gold Rolex on my wrist, uh
Who ever thought that I would grow and to be rich?
All these niggas tried to hit me, but these niggas missed (Huh)
My brothers with your bomb, please send 'em my salam (Lord)
That brand new SEL across my mother's lawn (Ah)
I swear I come in peace, but my lil homies aren't
Hear them gunshots that go from Brooklyn down here to Bronx (Bang)
Bulletproof the Bimmer, now I'm battle ready (Boss)
Me and Kimmy 'til I die, forever adversaries (Woo)
I'm talkin' money, pussy nigga, Tyler Perry (Woo)
Goin' back to Cali so I'm riding ready (Huh)
Coogi sweaters, Jesus pieces, gotta do it big (Uh)
Run up on you and I really let you live
It ain't trafficking unless its 20 mil'
I wack a nigga and I'm down to do the bid (Boss)
[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
Coogi sweaters, Jesus pieces, gotta do it big (Uh)
Fab said you need a Kim if you gon' do it big
Niggas want the smoke, I hop out with the cig
I'll wack a nigga, then buy a flight to Madrid
I did the bid, now I do the most
Whole team burnin' bread, let's make a toast
I ain't the type to brag, I let that paper boast
Then I wash the dirty money in that ivory coast
Rich milli', half a million
My shit slap silly, yeah
Quarter milli' this year on shoes
Give a broke bitch the blues
Ran off with a couple mil' in high heel, Jimmy Choos
I'm a bad bitch from every angle
Jesús hang around your neck like the noose
May the Bishop pray for you 'cause you know I got the juice
We bet it big at the crap table, seven eleven
Open like we 7/11, workin' all night, 24/7
Fuck the FBI, I only confess to the reverend
Put that on my bredrin
Let this be a lesson when you disrespect the legend
Ross the boss, Kim the Queen, is you stupid?
Ride the beat like a Wraith
But this is May-May-May-May-Maybach Music

[Outro: Musiq Soulchild]
Pray for me (Pray for me, oh)
'Cause I be in these streets so much, I don't know if I'ma make it (No, no)
I don't know if I'ma make it (No)
Pray for me (Just pray for me, pray for me)
'Cause, 'cause times get hard and the money gets low
But don't give up, got to stay down for the come up2Embed
