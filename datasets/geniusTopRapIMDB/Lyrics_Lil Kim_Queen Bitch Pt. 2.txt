Queen Bitch, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Everything you heard, yo, that's my word
You play the herb and repeat every word
It get on your nerves to see how we swerve
Watches that shine, dimes with his and her furs
Straight from the curb to the suburb
In the black suburb, plucking birds, getting served
Y'all ain't never learned how this world turn
Thought it was over, huh? Now we return!
To whom it may concern, when you hot you burn
Maybe it wasn't meant to be or it just ain't your turn
The rules are so stern, nigga get what you earn
And we still move in silence, nigga ya heard?!
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Y'all know who you are, wanna battle? Bet a car
Notes and all that shit, You legit? Spit a bar
What? See, I run the show, got the illest flow
Finding loads of bankrolls in my underclothes
It's the original and everybody knows
I rock diamonds that's red, white and indigo
I'm undroppable, untoppable
You can't hold me down, don't you know I'm unstoppable?
Niggas wanna run up in my pussy like a Pap smear
I'ma tell you now, just like I told you last year
Niggas ain't sticking unless they lick the kitten
Huh! Too many bitches just be lickin' the dick and
I'm a picky one, I like my dicks rock hard
Not the sticky ones that taste like slaw
Oh - something missing, the shower-pissing
All up in your mouth, what? You think I'm kidding?
Cause everything we do, we got a right to
You criticize me? We despise you
If what they say is true, we the baddest crew
I'm far from broke so why should I be mad at you?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like
Lyrics I call 'em like I see em G
Y'all niggas sound like me
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you're half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch!

You must be out your mind, or you must be high
Fucking with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Nowhere near shy, see I make you cry
The way I rock you to sleep like a lullaby
(Oh yeah, and by the way, you got one more day
Or you got to pay, boo, you got something to say?)
Yeah bring it on bitch, you ain't strong bitch
Thought you'd be around long? Wrong bitch!
Got nothing but love (but when push comes to shove)
We turn to thugs (and we put on them gloves)
Commence to lickin' slugs, you ain't gettin' up
More bags zippin' up, graves dug, nigga what?!

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like
Lyrics I call 'em like I see em G
Y'all niggas sound like me
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you're half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch!
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like
Lyrics I call 'em like I see em G
Y'all niggas sound like me
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you're half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch!2Embed
