Queen Bitch Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically, I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch! Uhh
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitchYou might also like8Embed
