Shut Up Bitch Lyrics[Chorus]
I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke (Shut up, bitch)
Ayo, Kim can spit, man, she don't write her shit
Nah, Biggie wrote her shit (Shut up, bitch)
I heard she goin' to jail, I heard she out on bail
She done fucked up now (Shut up, bitch)
Why she get her nose fixed? Why she got bigger tits?
Why is y'all on my shit? Damn (Shut up, bitch)

[Verse 1]
Everybody talkin', all these haters hawkin'
Paparazzi stalkin', takin' pictures while I'm walkin'
Damn, can a bitch breathe? Gimmie room, please
I'm in the paper every day if I piss or sneeze
Used to ride in a rental Lebaron
Now you can catch me in the SLR Mercedes McLaren (Hey Kim, what up?)
Ridin' with the doors up, haters pick ya jaws up
I'm in the Trump International, 30 floors up (So high)
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people, if you feel me, get this whole shit jumpin' (Get it jumpin' bitch)
Used to talk about the way I wore my clothes
Now every chick look like Lil' Kim in they videos
Don't come around here with that Wendy Williams shit
Get your facts straight or shut up, bitch
[Chorus]
I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke (Shut up, bitch)
Ayo, Kim can spit, man, she don't write her shit
Nah, Biggie wrote her shit (Shut up, bitch)
I heard she goin' to jail, I heard she out on bail
She done fucked up now (Shut up, bitch)
Why she get her nose fixed? Why she got bigger tits?
Why don't y'all get off her shit? (Shut up, bitch)

[Verse 2]
I keep the people starin' 'cause a chick stay appearin'
In somethin' made with German engineerin', with rack and pinion steerin'
Homes with French doors and heated marble floors
Whores heated 'cause mama back and hotter than before
Big bank, hold rank like the late Frank
I does what you can't, I'm everything that you ain't
I'm La Bella Don, the biggest bitch in the biz
So don't hate me, nigga, it is what it is
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin' (Stop frontin')
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'
So don't believe everything you hear
'Cause like a Q-Tip, niggas be all in ya ear
365 days of the year
Shit, I done heard it all throughout my career (What they say?)
You might also like[Chorus]
I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke (Shut up, bitch)
Ayo, Kim can spit, man, she don't write her shit
Nah, Biggie wrote her shit (Shut up, bitch)
I heard she goin' to jail, I heard she out on bail
She done fucked up now (Shut up, bitch)
Why she get her nose fixed? Why she got bigger tits?
Damn, y'all stay on her shit (Shut up, bitch)

[Verse 3]
I just keep climbin' up the ladder, y'all never stop my swagger
All this petty chitter-chatter only make my packets fatter
Some people jobs is to talk about Lil' Kim
Let's face it, I'm a way of life for all of them
Tabloid magazines rate worst and best dressed
They got some nerve when the ones who do the ratings look a mess
Star Jones don't like me, she cheap and I like the best
Damn, it must feel good to pay less
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin' (Yup)
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people, if you feel me, get this whole shit jumpin'
You know niggas hate to see another nigga eat
Quick to put another nigga's business in the street
I wish they'd shut the fuck up, damn, good grief
You know your mouth's a cage for your tongue if you just close your teeth
[Chorus]
I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke (Shut up, bitch)
Ayo, Kim can spit, man, she don't write her shit
Nah, Biggie wrote her shit (Shut up, bitch)
I heard she goin' to jail, I heard she out on bail
She done fucked up now (Shut up, bitch)
Why she get her nose fixed? Why she got bigger tits?
Man, get off my girl's shit (Shut up, bitch)

[Outro]
Haha, I know it's killin' you bitches, I know it's killin' you
She's back, oh my God
You had a voodoo doll and everything, worthless bitch
You just knew, "Don't let her come back Jesus, please don't let her come back"
Well, she's back, bitches, hahaha
Okay look, just, on the count of three
Stop focusing on her and think about you for a second
Now ain't that depressin', ain't it depressin'?
See, that's why don't nobody talk about you
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Get yourself a hobby, bitch, learn how to make a quilt or somethin'
Ha, is it really that you hate you?
That's what it is, ain't it?
Just punch yourself in the mouth then, bitch1Embed
