Spend a Little Doe Lyrics[Intro: Big Troy, Lil' Kim]
Mmm baby, I missed ya
I missed you, too
I waited a long time for this
So why you ain't come see me, no commissary or nothin'?
I ain't wanna see my bird in no cage
But I'm ready to take care of you now
Now, after three years?
Three motherfuckin' years, nigga? You know what?

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Hasta la vista, bye-bye, kiss your kids
It's the gangstresses
What you think this is, nigga?
Calm yourself, it's just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty, starvin' me
Call me Sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous, miraculous
I practice this for a livin', like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina, love ain't got shit to do, with me and you
Or the .44 under the pillow
Put in the dildo I like to play while I'm workin'
And that's for certain
Keep jerkin', I ain't done with you
Lights, cameras, curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh, they wouldn't believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis
[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink cucarachas, I bought his life for 3 G's
Then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad, they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin' goin' on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin' in they Moray's, sippin' Dom P's and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from po-lice we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya, I cried for ya
You know this down-ass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you, but now forget you
I'd rather dead you, and wet you like I never met you
You might also like[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
And I remember, how you said you loved me
With the passion
High fashion
Who you askin'?
To keep the tum numb, from index to thumb
Push the V's with the coke from the DT's
Dope take the titties from city to city
I ain't see a G off none of them ki's
At ease, when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didn't snitch, you'd make a shorty rich, bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin' on the Peter Pan to Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin'
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didn`t appeal no more
Gats I couldn't feel no more
And now I'm the shit
Go by the name of Lil' Kim, the Queen Bitch
And M.A.F.I.A.'s lieutenant
Instead of playin' Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It don't pay to be nice, but it's nice to pay
And if you die before you wake, may your soul God take
[Chorus: Fela]
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough3Embed
