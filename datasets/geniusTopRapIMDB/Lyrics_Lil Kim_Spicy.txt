Spicy Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
(Muah!) Muy caliente
Time to keep it cool, that's what the wrist say
Don't be a fool, that's what the fist say (woo)
I'm crushin' these bitches like it's a Wednesday
Skrt skrt, that what the Wraith do
Inside whited out, I just erased you
Outside all black, it's biracial
I'm married to the money and I'm so faithful
Man, this ring finger so icy (icy)
It's like my middle finger don't fuck with it (fuck y'all niggas)
These red bottoms so spicy (spicy)
It's like there's red pepper stuck to the bottom of 'em
[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Pull up in the dawn, spicy
250 on the arm, spicy
They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy
When Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Shit's real, he got ADD, Kim make him sit still
He wanna know how these billion dollar lips feel
I'm too classy, too bossy
You bitches ain't spicy, y'all just salty
Pull up with the draco in the trunk, call it Aubrey
Kimmy got the spice, hold the keys to ya life
And you bitches couldn't Xscape with T.I's wife
I'm so spicy

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Pull up in the dawn, spicy
250 on the arm, spicy
They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy
When Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy
You might also like[Bridge: Fabolous]
We steppin' in hotter this year
We steppin' in hotter this year
And they ain't gon' like it
They gon' be spicy

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Hold up, filet that pussy then let it saut√©
Then I sprinkle on it like I'm Salt Bae
Them jerks ain't gettin' chicken so they hot sauce
You drippin' wack juice, boy, it's not sauce
Stop hypin' up these goofies and wack rhymers
Your dick suckin' done got worse than Blac Chyna
Spice out the cabinet aka the closet
I'm makin' up some fly shit, I'm makin' a deposit
Remember we was playin' we gon' make it in the projects
To get that off white you gotta make it from the Pyrex
Now I'm into cayenne, drippin' sriracha
Tell a nigga stay cool 'fore we turn up in hot shit, nigga
Get some bangin' head, then amnesia on 'em
Should I plain jane or add the seasonin' on em'?
Kimmy

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Pull up in the dawn, spicy
250 on the arm, spicy
They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy (I-C-Y)
Why Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy
[Bridge: Fabolous]
We steppin' in hotter this year
We steppin' in hotter this year
And they ain't gon' like it
They gon' be spicy

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy
