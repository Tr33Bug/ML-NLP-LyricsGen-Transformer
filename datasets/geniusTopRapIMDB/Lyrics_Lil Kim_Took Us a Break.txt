Took Us a Break Lyrics[Hook]
We took us a break but we back now
Ain't nothin' gon' throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin' on us
And the bitter bitches, got 'em mad now

[Post-Hook]
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Countin' on, 20s, 50s and these 100s, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
[Verse 1]
Landin' jets at the border
Rolls Royce is my taxi to the hotels on the water
Quarter mill when I'm layin', nigga
Killin' 'em slow, that's torture
Rented out the whole top floor penthouse just for my daughter
You broke bitches outta order
I'm a bad bitch with some ol' money
Yeah, I'm ballin' but I want some mo' money
Pop the Lamborghini in the living room
Elevated to the master room
My rooftop got a rooftop
Bomb pussy, that's a boombox
Buscemi this, Givenchy that
Spent a rack on some Gucci tube socks
In Dubai I'm skiin' in the summer
Surfin' waves in the winter time
They callin' me the young gunner
The way I body these jeans is such a crime
They got a love-hate type-a thang for me
When it come to Kim there's no thinner line
Got bigger fish to fry
Eat you so called sharks at dinner time

[Hook]
We took us a break but we back now
Ain't nothin' gon' throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin' on us
And the bitter bitches, got 'em mad now

Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Countin' on, 20s, 50s and these 100s, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby

[Bridge]
One, zero, zero, zero, bitch, then a comma
Zero, zero, zero, zero, bitch

[Verse 2]
We took us a break but we back now
Bitter bitches, got 'em mad now
Sour niggas stay hatin' on me
'Cause I'm hangin' clothes from these racks now
I was raised in the school of hard knocks
These bitches is class clowns
Givin' y'all my old clothes
My old flows, like hand-me-downs
I see y'all watchin' my Snap
Tryna see what else you could jack
100 grand with the cheese in the trap
Better catch me a rat
All this weight, I need a lap band
Pussy nigga give a lap dance
Black and yellow Rari, that's a beehive
Eat up the Ghost like Pac Man
Man, I love them two-seaters
Killin' shit like the Reaper
Buyin' shit for no reason
It's always Lil' Kim season
[Hook]
We took us a break but we back now
Ain't nothin' gon' throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin' on us
And the bitter bitches, got 'em mad now

Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Countin' on, 20s, 50s and these 100s, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby3Embed
