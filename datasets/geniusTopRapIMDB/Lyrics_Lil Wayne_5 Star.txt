5 Star Lyrics
Tunechi
Barbie
Young Money

Yeah, I been smokin' gas, killin' bitches
Man, I feel just like a gang-star (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cover up my face like a ninja
In this Alexander Wang scarf (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'ma drop a bag, they gon' pull up
And then they gon' let them things off (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I ain't switchin' up my hairstyle
But my niggas let it bang off
Percocets and Addies, lookin' for a fuck I could give
All these hatin' bitches plottin', why they can't let me live?
Me and Weezy in LIV (Ayy, ayy)
When my album drop these bitches is gon' cry in the car
All your yes-men out here lyin', had you dyin' to spar
You was tryin' too hard (Mm)
I'm out here livin' though, I am out here livin' though
Me and Tunechi winnin' though
Slimes out here twinnin' though
I am on my pivot though, I am just so pivotal
Bands, I go get it though, Weezy on his pedestal
A lot of gang shit, a whole lot of gang shit
All these plaques is pilin' up, it's nowhere to hang shit
These bitches pussy though
Pushed them out my pussy though
Niggas want my cookie though
'Cause it taste like cookie dough
Smoke, I got a free pack; flow sick, get a Z-pak
Niggas don't mean my race when they say "She blacked"
I am the Queen (Facts), I'm everything she lacks
Bitch get on your kneecap, I don't mean C. Kaep'
I'll get you checked, pussy; I'll get you a free pap
You bitches don't ball out, you get your QB sacked
I'm OBJ, hoes; break records like ankles
I've been that bitch since ice cream with the sprinkles
You might also like
Tell 'em carry on, they gon' miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda

Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, itâ€™ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda

Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Uber
That's some sick shit19Embed
