Beamer, Benz, or Bentley Remix Lyrics[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - your scheming don't affect me

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley; Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beat it -- I bet she let me; she been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I'm throwing on my Gretzky
Got my S-S-Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti or Pirelli, make a movie out the ghettie
Wear my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while I'm stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl out a lezzie
Magazine, Mac, Desi, keep my windows like the Prezzie
Press a button and I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200-something and my trunk do wonders bumping
I am not the one for chumping, I will ratchet out and slump him
Dump him (dump him) he better off dead, your money red
[Interlude: Juelz Santana, Lloyd Banks]

[Juelz] I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high (always high)
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
[Banks] I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - your scheming don't affect me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley I be moving, I be moving
Making movies, Tom Cruising, if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, neck studded, boy my nickname should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we about to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar, I call her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting, got a white girl that be poofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she's stupid
And she always ready to give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, ordered bottles, see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch looking like the 4th of July
But if you pussies get to fronting and the pushing lead to shoving
We just busting and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louis then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - your scheming don't affect me

[Interlude: Fabolous]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
In that black-on-black thing whenever I ride by
[Banks] I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand-new
I don't handcuff, you can bring the whole damn crew

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Kima's friends with Wendy
And both of these bitches want my penis, evidently
My jeans are never empty -- it seems, coincidentally
They say that time is money, so my team be spending centuries
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- life's full of decisions
If hating was a crime, you would do life up in a prison
The spiteful competition knows that they wouldn't have a shot at eating
Even if they had a rifle in they kitchen
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- Banks, 'elz, or Loso
We be paper touching -- bank teller flows, ho
Yeah, we smoke a lot of kush, drink hella rose Mo'
Y'all got a disease called "Can't tell the ho's no"
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- we black all of 'em
And we hold heat like a motherfucking oven
My homies, I love em: it's family over everything
And fuck anything that ever try to get above em1Embed
