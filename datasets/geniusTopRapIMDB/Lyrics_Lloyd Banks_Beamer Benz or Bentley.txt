Beamer, Benz, or Bentley Lyrics[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & Juelz Santana]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My jeans are never empty, bitch (Whoa)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Ay)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Whoa)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
The scheming don't affect me (Ay)

[Refrain: Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than five hundred horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand-new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew (Get in my)
[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley (Ugh)
Beat it—I bet she let me; she been fiending since she met me (Yeah)
I'm the coolest; shit, especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my S-S-Smith and Wessy to protect me, so respect me
This is heavy, new Bentley color: vanilla and cherry
Andretti on Pirelli, make a movie out the ghetty (Ugh)
Where my ring and my confetti? I'm Kobe Bryant-ready
Pink Rosé and chronic smelly while I'm stumbling out the telly (Ugh)
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry, and the way I flow is very (Uh-huh)
Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move is deadly (Ugh)
Platinum band, platinum bezzy, make a straight girl out a lezzy (Uh-huh)
Magazine, Mac, Benzy, keep my windows like the prezzy (Woo)
Press a button and I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go two hundred-something, and my trunk the one that's bumping
I am not the one for jumping; I will ratchet out and slump him, dump him
Nigga, you're better off dead, your money red

[Refrain: Juelz Santana & Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand-new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew (Get in my)

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & Juelz Santana]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Whoa)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Ay)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Whoa)
My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Ay)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Whoa)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Dipset, Skull Gang)
The scheming don't affect me (Santana, ayy)

Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I be moving, I be moving
Making movies, Tom Cruise-ing; if it's action, then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, necks studded—boy, my nickname should be "Ruben"
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it, so we 'bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar—call her that because she Cuban
Got a Black chick that be boosting, got a white girl that be boofing
Gotta watch her 'cause she use it, but she fuck me like she stupid (Ayy)
And she always ready (Ready) to give me that Becky
Last time, it was so good, I almost crashed my Bentley (Ayy, ayy)
Hit the club, ordered bottles, seen them sparks in the sky
We'll have this whole bitch lookin like the Fourth of July (Ha, pow)
But if you pussies get to fronting and the pushing lead to shoving
We just busting and we leaving like it's nothing (It's nothing, whoa)
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie, then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me (Get in my)

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & Juelz Santana]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley (Whoa)

Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand-new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Bridge: Lloyd Banks]
I got a girl named Kima, and Kima like Christina
Baby, three don't make a crowd; it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her, turn her 'to a screamer
Then it's one, two, I'm through, see ya
I scoop her in my—
