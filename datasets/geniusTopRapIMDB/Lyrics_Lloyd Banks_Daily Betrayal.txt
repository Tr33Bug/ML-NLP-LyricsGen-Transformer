Daily Betrayal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, I never wanted to be center stage
That's out of character, bonuses of my inner rage
As I mix things up, me and my chemist ways
Caught in my prime, where I'm stuck, all while my demo plays
Inebriated off returning, my revenge is certain
Potent power, green purple, my expensive smoking
Waking your tired ass up, don't got a dream to sell
Don't put your hand out, you don't mean me well
A couple of other dreamers take my spot
Number one with a bullet, save my CD shell
Hard as a storm weather, I'm never worried
I'm a never be over, dead and buried
I got a date with destiny, my head is hurried
My maker made my recipe, can't take it from me
You making enemies, you making money
Haters looking for love, haters hate they love me
[Chorus]
I put my count before a dollar sign
It ain't about no money, I can count on mine
Mind your business, keep your shit in line
Anything it's going to take, ain't no quitting time
Leave the games out there, we don't play
Ain't nobody going to care out here, that's no days
Fronting on us ain't a good idea, go pray
Those that say, don't know and those that know, don't say
It's a betrayal every day

[Verse 2]
You fucking with the wrong MC looking for love
I'm connected to a line of Gs
Born with the look, book in the plug
Sun coming all night, dumb and whooping in the club
Miss me if you shady, couldn't' find a brighter bulb
They think I'm digging them, think about the studio
Dummies love the gossip, patience shrinking as the rumors grow
I'm popping penguins, that's the usual
Don't plot on him cause that's your funeral
Vultures waiting every hit you drop
I'm elevating, couldn't get the spot
I'm revving on them, smelling like Pirelli
War zone, never seen a viking worried
Tough skin, stepping out Italian made
What you describe as a fire at it's hottest grade
Still don't give a fuck and shit not trying to change
I look at you a sucker, you aligned with lames
You might also like[Chorus]
I put my count before a dollar sign
It ain't about no money, I can count on mine
Mind your business, keep your shit in line
Anything it's going to take, ain't no quitting time
Leave the games out there, we don't play
Ain't nobody going to care out here, that's no days
Fronting on us ain't a good idea, go pray
Those that say, don't know and those that know, don't say
It's a betrayal every day

[Verse 3]
Fools blind rhyming with no purpose
New lines out of my old verses
You ain't lay it, that ain't your Roll-Royces
Niggas out here acting until you close curtains
Sixteens is getting me licked clean
Whip dreams, big bodies split screens
Hot throne you couldn't sit beside it
This is what you get if I should simplify it
How many soldiers seen a man sell?
Understand hell, and the goal is to keep it real? Can't tell?
They stepping up as if the champ fell
Baby momma numbers and my tramp cell

[Chorus]
I put my count before a dollar sign
It ain't about no money, I can count on mine
Mind your business, keep your shit in line
Anything it's going to take, ain't no quitting time
Leave the games out there, we don't play
Ain't nobody going to care out here, that's no days
Fronting on us ain't a good idea, go pray
Those that say, don't know and those that know, don't say
It's a betrayal every day3Embed
