Help Lyrics[Intro: Lloyd Banks] (Keri Hilson)
(G-Unit) Uh! A one two, a one two
Uh! A one two, a one two
(Yeah) Uh! A one two, a one two
(Ooooohhh!!!) Uh!

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Excuse me miss, you must be some kind of a model
Enough to make a shopper run out of the column
Enough to make a weak nigga go mano y mano
Guess what you strong as rum out of the bottle
God bless you when he made me
I mean he blessed me when he made you I got a little game to
They know me everywhere I go that's what fame do
Where we can keep it on the low what's your name boo?
You stuck in your ways but I know how to change you
Arrange you tell you things like your my angel
There's no rules when it comes to this, write down your number miss
They call me Banks, my government is Chris
They feel me in the burbs, love me in the bricks
Four inch whips, on a buggy six
First class trips, and the bubbly's Cris
I work so hard to live like this
[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, I got her, she hop in the ride so I could holla
My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I ain't 'gon say you a dream I don't gotta
You could walk around in the street with no collar
I pick up all the G that he speaks so don't bother
The innocent role ain't workin work harder
I ain't tryin to lock you down I'm no father
But maybe we can go further if you just listen
It's hard as hell for a man in my position
To pick a good girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if it's even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance
And I'm have to look hard to find a better one
Cause yo sex is a 187 'hon
You get a nigga doin shit I ain't never done
So now even when I'm on tour I let her come

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do

Your not the ones like I'm used to, I see us happy in our future
I'm givin you all I have, my heart, my soul, my laugh
Cause you are the only thing I need
(I could give ya everything and more give you the feelin you can't ignore)
Whoa oooh oh!!!

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do
