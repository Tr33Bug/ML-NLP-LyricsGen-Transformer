Hot 97 Freestyle LyricsThree Sixty-Five, I'm four five sixing
To out pole Richmond, my sound so different
I'm Dow Jones dipping, round crown whipping
Dirty south system riding through your system
450 engine I'm here to bring them M's
Word to my emblem, the top dog and some
I got to have it in the worse ways
Seen through haters since the first grade, learn how to surf waves
Around here they coming like tsunamis
They all by me that's why I keep the thing by me
Green Maserati with the Hercules body
They want your boy locked like Gotti
Shawty don't want me she wants what I can give her
10 bedrooms, swimming pool, and a river
She'd have all three if I was a weak nigga
But unfortunately for you, I'm Blue
Call me what you want but don't call me for shit
I'm slinging, hard dick all you can get my phone ringing
Which you ain't the only chick, my stones blinging
I'm riding the chromey whip I don't string em'
Along that's when shit go wrong
Clap her all night long she'll be schizo gone
You know in the mind not the physical form
Yeah, I'm single but not the individual form
I got to mingle, fuck having handcuffs on
I ain't into banging I ain't marital sworn
I ain't stack up all this bread to have it withdrawn
Get the chick, get the uh, get the math, I'm gone
Makes no sense to commit with what I knew would past
I like my chicks like my cars, new and fast
You can't pawn fake jewelry review the cash
I spent more than what they get on you on gas
Airbags I could fuck around and crash
Totaled the V walk out without a scratch
I got a style that's like slick without his patch
Pops is loud, gator with the platinum latch
Black and wild, don't know how to act
They back you down so watch what all your violent rap
I leave the club with a 25 thousand stack
And make it rain where the public housing at
If you see me it was probably in and out the stores
In the F700 with the open doors
I ain't a come up, I come and go, bro
I ain't regular nigga, I run the show
Get back don't push don't crowd em'
They love to talk about it when you hit rock bottom
They want a problem, but I know how to solve em
Slip a rope around they throat watch em' choke like Saddam
Hussein, you lames better take it easy
Before I push the red button put you suckas on TV
Gotta feed mama she like to wear Prada, and she won't fly commercial so I'm paying for charter
You see a shotta if you touch one dollar
I love my nina so much I wrote a song about her
Rolling up that white widow marijuana
It looks I dropped it in a bag of baby powder
Censorship can't censor me it made me louder
Gun shots don't stop me they bring me power
Man they talking sour till you put 'em in the shower
Make it rain lead on 'em every other hour
Aye Flex, do I look scared (Scured)
I know the Alphabet that's just another word
Banks ain't biased everybody gets served
And my ears ain't broken everybody gets heard
Big trapper little trapper really don't matter
Grammy winning artist or a silly broke rapper
Gun packer I ain't worried 'bout a jacker
What you think I got a firecracker?
These little boys silly, bow to a woolly
Man they me in my city like Philly love Beanie
Bring the Mac-milly, cause they wanna grill me
And they still home, hanging off they mamma titty
Trend setter from my hat to my sweater
I switch whips according to the weather
Banks ain't a cuffer, I clap it then forget her
Let her find somebody that'll treat her better
