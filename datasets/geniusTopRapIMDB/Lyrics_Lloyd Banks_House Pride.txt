House Pride Lyrics[Verse]
Before my time goes they going to raise a nigga's jersey in the sky
Treat a nigga right, been dreaming on my life
Shorty want to get some air, I go and get her when I fly
Taking off on these niggas, I retire the minute I catch fire
I smoked them all before, just revisiting the high
I'ma get it until they gun me, ain't no giving up an eye
And we ain't never shared a level, dawg, it couldn't be a tie
See me when you talking 'cause they eyes don't lie
Rather leave this bitch early than watch time go by
Bitch, you better have the light, not I
I feel an Emmy when a rival's by
I know God feel me, give a fuck about who loves me
It's funny, everyone gathers when it's about some money
Money into making everything alright or ugly
I'm in line with the stars, boulevard scared hungry
This life ain't pretty, shit should be ugly how we're dying
You better know them girls don't really love you, they by lying
Probably fed my hunger, ever hunt me? I'm a lion
Cooler than my jewels, boy, touch 'em and you're frying
Spitter of the city, what the fuck are you providing?
My style is going everywhere, you ducking and you hiding
I'm going to reign again, put that on a couple of medallions
We don't care about nothing and we wilin'
You riding with your nigga, ain't your nigga
He don't get it when it rain
I came in to deliver, I'm going to come up with a name
I got the title to my city with key around my chain
I'm a keeper to the books, when I leave going to be the same
Twenty years later, I'm a king -
Course so, Hallelujah! See my cross show
Holding on a horror, Stephen King on a song though
Life's short, dawg, heaven's huge we can all go
The people that you shit on your way up
Shit right back on you on your way down
Not to mention, niggas dumb for no reason
Never cared then, fuck you think it matters what they say now?
I've been on my only shit, sorry you don't see me bruh
Shades all they show me so I bother with the media
I pray for the money to come, something told me it'd be easier
Voices lied to me, turned a humble nigga greedy uh
I don't need no back up, shit! My back against the wall
Keep your words small, never know who's tapping in your call
For the long haul better off you strapping when you ball
Jelly cause you jig, hacking with the saw, splatters on the floor
Scatter from the law, spill the pen out with the liquor
Get a diamond for you try me, from the gate I been that nigga
Bet you think it's fun and fame? Entertainment made me sicker
That chick just want a bubble, back then I had to Cris' her
Break through any weather, living right just makes you richer
My times make you tougher, my minds in the upper
Echelon, no respect for the comp, repetition stomp
Bitch, get out of line, check her prompt, in my S. Laurent
Pick a cloud, start a fire with the pilot
Don't matter how you built, you never did no one a solid
Everybody got to say they opinions getting crowded
This for any motherfucker that ever doubt it - Southside!
Put 'em by me I'm a outshine
One in a million, I'm the house pride
Came into the building with a cyclone
Making a killing off my bright poems
This drug has helped me spend my nights gone
Lights out, shocked eyes
Get my anger while I climb skies
'Came famous from my line drives
Give me big praise and high cries
Let the hate fall while I rise
The fuck these niggas talking about? Top 5!You might also like9Embed
