I Donâ€™t Deserve You Lyrics[Intro: Jeremih]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you
But don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles, yeah
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)
[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It ain't even the puss' I got your mind
It's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn and yeah you're finger-licking fine
In due time I'm sure that I can please you, squeeze you, weak knees you
Need you like you need me, and don't mislead you
Love's free but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee, that bitch gon' leave with half your life
Man believe me, I ain't gon' feed you bad advice
Look it's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight
Ride, I'd be selfish if I kept you so (So)
I love you enough to let you go (Go)
Cause on the other hand I couldn't take it if I
Put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but it's harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast, here's your heart before I break it; take it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

What type of nigga would I be to hold you up?
You need someone to hold you down
And recognize your life's fucked up
I got to shake you out my system
'Cause with the fucking and kissing
And all your emotions mixed in puts me in a tough position
Baby, what am I supposed to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long girl we're overdue
I guess the cake ain't enough you want to eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
I'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded toast
Automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most
I got a sex drive that won't allow me to lax
Bring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relaxed in back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind (Play with your mind)
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)
[Outro: Jeremih]
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it, no
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it5Embed
