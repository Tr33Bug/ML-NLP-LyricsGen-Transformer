Jackpot Lyrics[Produced By Jahlil Beats]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
We ain't playing no games, man
We just spend money, nigga
Hahaha
Just do what you do best and look
That 2012 shit
Jahlil Beats, holla at me
Banks
[Verse 1]
Man, I'm just fucking these hoes, like I'm crushing these shows
Hundred-dollar shoe-strings, nine bucks for these soles
Look in my eyes and see clouds, I'm puffing them Os
A three some ain't shit, I need a couple of those
Mister touch it when I want, pow, punch her with the rhymes
Tell ya girl we said "What's up?", we jump all the time
You got next? I got next after, no need to gas her
She geeking up cause I'm a rapper, skeet laughter
Catch me laughing at a bank today, laughing at a bank tomorrow
I do these niggas like my son, ya should thank my father
I make it rain harder
Hours later and her ass still shaking, like I hit it with a Taser (Yeah!)
Tryna get this money? Show me what ya momma gave ya (Yeah!)
Appetite is animal, so pardon my behavior
I split a crowd of bitches at the garden, I'm the savior
Hit after hit, knock the heart right outta hater

[Hook]
Spending is my hobby, I-I'm balling, sorry
Lately I've been having dreams of crushing everybody
Imma see you motherfuckers at the top
I'm coming and my mind's on nothing but the guap
They thought this shit was done, but the grind don't stop
I'm running through them one after one, 'cause I'm hot
I'mma hit ya hun, like the drum, make it drop
Then I'm looking for another one to taker her spot, jackpot

I'm the rawest in Queens, it's all for the green
Chicks ain't mine, they all for the team
I told her get in the six, cause they walking to me
I'm 'bout to murk me a bitch, white chalk on the scene
Money can't buy ya style, my style made to be fly (Mhm!)
I'm from the front so far, my glass facing the sky
She front she out the same minute, replace her in five
She ain't dope, she don't get digits, always my supply
I'm in the rocket chasing paper, my ego need an anchor
Ain't no way I'm gon' land this motherfucker 'less it's major (Ugh!)
Mami do me little favor, don't go catching feelings
Don't you go complaining, cause I'm not used to hearing (Ugh!)
By twenty one I made a million
Fast drops in my backdrop, chilling
Letting niggas see me, I don't pass blocks spilling (Mm!)
Roll up like a smoker with a bag-chopped ceiling

[Hook]
Spending is my hobby, I'm balling, sorry
Lately I've been having dreams of crushing everybody
I'ma see you motherfuckers at the top
I'm coming and my mind's on nothing but the guap
They thought this shit was done, but the grind don't stop
I'm running through them one after one, 'cause I'm hot
I'ma hit ya hun, like the drum, make it drop
Then I'm looking for another one to taker her spot, jackpot
[Bridge]
Spending is my hobby
Sorry
Crushing everybody
Spending is my hobby
Sorry
Crushing everybody

[Hook]
Spending is my hobby, I'm balling, sorry
Lately, I've been having dreams of crushing everybody
I'ma see you motherfuckers at the top
I'm coming and my mind's on nothing but the guap
They thought this shit was done, but the grind don't stop
I'm running through them one after one, 'cause I'm hot
I'ma hit ya hun, like the drum, make it drop
Then I'm looking for another one to taker her spot, jackpot4Embed
