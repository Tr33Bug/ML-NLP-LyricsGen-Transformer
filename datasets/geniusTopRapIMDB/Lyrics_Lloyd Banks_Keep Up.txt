Keep Up Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know the rules
Don't trust 'em, don't love 'em
And don't let 'em fool you
Knahmean?

[Verse: Lloyd Banks]
Aye! Know your role
Get anything out me? No, you won't
I hope my player stole your hope
Anymore game I'ma overdose
Jerry Tarkanian, I'm supposed to coach
Money train on my poster, ho
Way too cool, can't push a button
Banks around, you got no control
Relax and let it go
That girl want be bad, don't let her, yo!
You still want to keep that? Incredible!
That's negative feedback, forever bro
I'm chasing greenbacks and envelopes
You only care about status
Probably see zeroes in the bed with her
High maintenance with no standards, damn
It's a shame you're so regular
Don't hog the lane on my cellular
Don't be difficult, we ain't dating
Better stay in line with the editor
Hawaii, 5 trips ahead of ya
Oh? You're on cloud nine?
She say jump, you ask "how high?"
Weekend fuck to a nigga like me
P-I-M-P 'til the day that I die
You buying the boots and I'm taking them off
Keeping her hair then I'm fucking it up
Turning her out as she's spilling the guts
Won't lead her on, the feeling's too much
She thinks I'm the one but there can't be no us
I met you a stray, there can't be no trust
The lifestyle fills up your panties with lust
Spare me the amateur stuff
Look, you happy now?
Your homegirl found a way to track me down
Telling all your problems to grimy ears
Playing for the crowd is exactly how
She's 10 times more nasty now
Caught in a walk with her ass all out
Then you'll be here all alone
The nigga all the bad ones ask about
All black cruising, my casket route
In my throwback, full classic bout
Short on time, I smash then count
Them whores ain't mine, I pass them out
You ain't even got to ask me
My game catchy, no free rides here, better get a taxi
You don't think I know how this shit going to go?
Chasing a musician, end up with an athlete
Shit! I'm both
Got 'em on a track meet
Ran all day, made love on a bad knee
Fixing with her ass in the avi
Victims from the pad to the valley
Fiction, once if she ever had me
Listen, let my only speak once
I had teams since the nineties
Switch rosters every three months
I'm the one they can't figure out
You're the one that they chump, chump
You paying the bills and got another nigga in the house
She don't know what she want, yup
You fucked around and got tricked by a criminal
I gotta skip to the front
You don't turn your back
She probably looking a nigga now
Tell them hoes keep up
