Make It Stack Lyrics[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Too much thinking, on top of that, I'm getting high and drinking
I'm floating on cloud 9, watching these niggas sinking
No blinking, you blink too much, you lose your turn
Sleep is the cousin of death, you might as well pick your urn
I been talking my intentions, now it's time to go and do it
Take you were I come from, that influence on my music
Ain't no U-turns on this path, think before you choose it
Hold this autograph, come get your cash and try to use it
I came here unexpected, I'mma leave a legend
Brought up in this hell, how I'm breathing heaven
I swear I fear I hear my niggas laughing while I'm balling
Woke up this morning the weed and alcohol calling
Living that life of a Mac, kicking them hoes out often
Ask 'em when they coming back, knowing that they done lost 'em
Hit them bitches from the back, I ain't want all the talking
Don't be blowing up my jack, flat line on that cat
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Let's get this money, then let's make it stack
Then let's make history cause they can't take that back
Back to balling and spending, running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie, take a look how I'm living
And do you know what it took? I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work, no contract in my soul
I don't ball up and die, I bomb back on them hoes

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm tryna buy my soul from Satan, I can't keep up with payments
Strange writings on the wall got me feeling like a cavemen
Call that shit the "Days Inn," life is so degrading
But to my last statement, I keep praying 'til it's "Amen"
Top is where I'm aiming, left the way I came in
I'ma keep on raving 'til them islands is the Caymens
And my bitch from Mexico, she don't know she next to go
Suit yourself, then screw yourself! Shoot yourself, Plaxico!
Bang, bang! Thought you were a giant
Couldn't hear the mournings, but I bet you hear them sirens
First I close my eyelids, then everything is quiet
I could go out in silence, but I would prefer the riot
I catch the first star with my fist raised, Versace shades, my french braids
Had sick chains since 6th grade, safe to say we've been slaved
These niggas tryna shoot me! These crackers tryna sue me!
Wake up to your favourite actresses, my life is like a movie, boy!

Let's get this money, then let's make it stack
Then let's make history cause they can't take that back
Back to balling and spending, running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie, take a look how I'm living
And do you know what it took? I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work, no contract in my soul
I don't ball up and die, I bomb back on them hoes

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Heat up in the winter, so I'm cooler come the summer
We out here, gambling Aruba money, sucka
P.Y.T. all the way up to cougar, I'mma crush her
And I always been a rebel, never been a cuffer
You just talk it, you don't does it, so all those who suffer
You so humble out in public, computer make you tougher
I got Ros√© by the bottle, bitches by the car-load
6 or 7 new ones, I'm switching up the tomorrow
Bitch I sleep in the Apollo, I'm always on stage
I should take my show to broadway cause that hallway like a grave
Can't no bitch get in my mind, so I know it's physical
I kick out the dimes, I think I'm invincible
I climbed to the top, now I'm pissing off the pinnacle
I pray to God that I get rich, getting money spiritual
Diamond in my physicals, that's why I'mma stand out
You don't got your hand in, you just got you hand out, son
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Let's get this money, then let's make it stack
Then let's make history cause they can't take that back
Back to balling and spending, running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie, take a look how I'm living
And do you know what it took? I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work, no contract in my soul
I don't ball up and die, I bomb back on them hoes9Embed
