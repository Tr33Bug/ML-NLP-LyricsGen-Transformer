Mind Over Matter Lyrics[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Never mind what you told me homie
I never held you to it
[?] for disappointment
Feeling like I always knew it
I don't need no distractions
Save your opinions for amusement
I'm a musician trapped in this game of lames
Fuck all that cool shit
I was bred for this, sweat tears and bled for this
Rocked out necklace, washed out debts this
Illest living, my round, heads will twist
Bow down next to piss
See me barely, my mind's excellence
My bitext to kiss my technicals
Five times exorcist
One time specialist
Fast time slacking hard times catching up
[?], constant pressure fuck, fuck them all
Crack them with my platinum plaques
Sneaky dissing and fashion rap
Gonna have me fueled, relapse
And crack and now it's back to scratch
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Mind over matter
They already been sick of nigga
Now its time to make em madder
(it dont matter they dont matter)
All we know is shinnin' and climbing
Movin' round here with the ladder
Fuck it do it all, there wit it after
Anything that make the money grow faster
No reward, no laughter
Keep ya eyes up no avoiding the rapture
In a matter of time them boys will come at cha'

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
You said i would fall
Same hoes you lovin' got the V surrounded
Bitch keep on wishin'
Fuck all the hoppin' watch me be about it
Rock em to sleep
Won't take defeat rather repeat the groundwork back on my feet
Told my lil niggas they could be somebody
High and regard
Largest my attributes
Nights fruadin' for rapper juice
Machete rippin half [?]
Early, who let the bastards loose?
Timin' out here is critical
Backstabs and subliminals
Black mags in ya video
Back smacked through the city
Show ya horror i been harbored in
Traitor arms in the carpet, then im alter ego arguing
Burn em , urns in the car again
Wife squirming and gargling
You snuck through
Raising the bar again
Gave you the formula, how long you
Gone play wit the armored pen
Hoe in ya character, ya stories can't afford to get by
Sometimes ya pardoned stupidity
But this loyalty? Na
Move round' like royalty ma
That chair there oughta be mine
You tryna hold me up
Wasn't there before
You might also like[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Mind over matter
They already been sick of nigga
Now its time to make em madder
(it dont matter they dont matter)
All we know is shinnin' and climbing
Movin' round here with the ladder
Fuck it do it all, there wit it after
Anything that make the money grow faster
No reward, no laughter
Keep ya eyes up no avoiding the rapture
In a matter of time them boys will come at cha'2Embed
