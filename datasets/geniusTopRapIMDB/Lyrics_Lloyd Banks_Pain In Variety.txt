Pain In Variety Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm backtracking, gripping up again
Ain't no luck in these bitches, only trust my pen
I drop them off, don't tuck they gems
What's up with spin?
My tin cutting wind in a custom rim
I'm here now, took long, sue me, I'm all Louie
Wrecking shit, yeah! Yours truly, a bomb movie
I'm a trip, yeah! Tour smoothly, I'm bored usually
Y'all bars border mine, that's up, they going to choose me
I'm clapping, rapping like a drawn Uzi
I'm backing traffic, matching all jewelry
You dirty bastard, don't you go and screw me
Nothing but Gs down here, dawg, my floor is Gucci
Non-sucker, telly and a five star supper
Black diamond your skully, my mind suffer
Guess you a lucky muh'fucka
You survived to 21 and ain't at least one touched ya
[Chorus]
It's a struggle to stay alive
You don't think I'm going to make it
I can tell it all in your eyes
I'm going to make them drop their faces and tell 'em to pick 'em up
I'm a show up all these places with cases, getting drunk
I can't wait to see you hoes with the vapors
What you want?
I want every fucking thing in this world
Fast cars, diamond, and girls
You suitin' up to lose, don’t play
The green paper make the shit go away

[Verse 2]
Uh, pain variety in my society
Death to the government. I know they lie to me
No apology through this odyssey
King, gotta be, change ya sound, rap pottery
No one hot as me, all honesty
Through this design I provide I'm all kind of flee
You about free as your ancestors
How you going to get the answers?
You don't understand the questions
Can you hear me out there?  I'm alone
At times I feel like I'm trapped inside the zone
Mind lapse while I get home, side-track get ya the throne
Southside's on my back, this is the dome
We RIP pictures of shown
Fuck 'em out of show love, they showing hate
Real nigga in my way - no surrender, no mistake
You make it out this hell hole, it's nothing but luck
Same forces, hand newspaper, print the cover up
You might also like[Chorus]
It's a struggle to stay alive
You don't think I'm going to make it
I can tell it all in your eyes
I'm going to make them drop their faces and tell 'em to pick 'em up
I'm a show up all these places with cases, getting drunk
I can't wait to see you hoes with the vapors
What you want?
I want every fucking thing in this world
Fast cars, diamond, and girls
You suitin' up to lose, don’t play
The green paper make the shit go away1Embed
