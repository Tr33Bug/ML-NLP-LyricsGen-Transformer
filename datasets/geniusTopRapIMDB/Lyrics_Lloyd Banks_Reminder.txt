Reminder Lyrics[Hook]
Won't be giving up
In this world where everything ain't enough
And everything is a must, I remind you all
It's easy to get caught in the rush
You weak, shit'll blind you, dawg
Too many trying to fit in
Still I'd rather stand out
No better way of living

[Verse 1]
Rocky lucky link on my neck, can't let'em see you sweat
The illest shit ain't thinking to me, dawg, I ain't even slept
All non-believers check
King round for round, the crown ain't leave me yet
Been cropped the sound, look at my CD set
A set of Cubans on my leather spooning
"Settle down" - some shit I'm never doing
Drop and find eleven new ones
Compliments of better schooling
I'm skipping continents for better viewing
Came into prominence, forever ruling
You knew the life I live, you'd judge your own
Roaming like I left something, still the man when I'm home
I hope Heaven got a club
I done climbed into all kind of pussy, never fell in love
Success no better drug and the pressure just a plus
Moving on you, never take the life in us
Nigga, take a loss where every mistake will cost
Color stain the floors
Ain't not sympathy, this pain is yours
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let's toast to this paper - new toast for the haters
I'm bred to be what you want. Game dead, giving it hope
Realest nigga the more I think about it
My head high, I keep a mink around
Throw a nigga off even they even think you doubt it
All I got is fire.  Need an 8, alarm attire
Easy to admire, sixteen will take an overnighter
Take advantage, nothing is needed.  All is forgiven
Too long pretending then smoke what you call driven
I'm drunk to where you see double
Been around, hear the street crumble
Chain still swing like free couples
Fear, being fucked up, frustrated, trying to function
The ghetto took all my close friends
Somebody owes us something, for real
They can't catch the God, wrecking in my repertoire
Extra fog, ain't no body close, I'm ghost
My anxiety over flows.  Flow with a cold steal
Leaving a trail of road kill and still won't chill - ill!
