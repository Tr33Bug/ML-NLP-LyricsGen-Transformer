Vroom-vr-vroom! (Loso)
Vroom-vr-vroom!
Ladies and gentlemen!

You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick
You want a problem?

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Big blue, hot and sandy shoe, cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop, off the stoop, ugh!
Play with me, see what the swammy do, my canary shoe
High beams pointed right at you, peek-a-boo, ugh!
Benji paper made me hater-proof. al your family dues
'Nage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose, ugh!
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubblegoose
Thousand kicks, couple hundred boots, getting fucking loot
My top down, I’m flashing on 'em
I’m passing all 'em, pull over and hit the hazards on 'em (Yeah)
The ratchets on ‘em, pay my dues, now, it’s back to ballin'
Your raps are boring dead men, I dip the casket for 'em (Ugh!)
I’m back performing, I bag 'em
Break their back, don’t call em (Yeah)
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning (Yeah)
Cash is pourin’, stunts stormin, got these bitches soaked
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't (Right!)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Ryan Leslie, & Swizz Beatz & Ryan Leslie]
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich (Oh!)
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up!
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Wait a minute! (Start it up!)

We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoid case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’ma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh, bitch, I should be arrested
New Cody ChesnuTT with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said, “Hey ‘Ye,” I said “Yes, biiiitch”
"Damn, I’m only asking you a question"
I met this MILF at the All-Star, getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh! Start it up
Start it up, huh! Start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us; that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie, I’m pajama-rich
Banks told me, "Homie, go'n, switch the style up"
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her, I ain't paying tonight, I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said, “It’s free,” I said, "Wowzers!"
Wowzers! Yeah
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Ryan Leslie, & Swizz Beatz & Ryan Leslie]
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich (Oh!)
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up!
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Wait a minute! (Ooh!)

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz, Ryan Leslie, & Swizz Beatz & Ryan Leslie]

Start it up!
Let's get it started, get it started
Get it started, yeah, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen!

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait, where’s the dinner plates?
B-M-W, 10 to 8, Interstate
95, passenger, baddest bitch in the states
Half Spanish, half Trini-dae, complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late (Nice!)
It’s time to make a movie, let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel; that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater-tot, lil niggas, try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes, so who gives a shit?

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz, Ryan Leslie, & Swizz Beatz & Ryan Leslie]
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich (Oh!)
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up!
You know they mad 'cause, 'cause, 'cause I’m hoodrich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good, trick (Uh-uh!)
You want a problem?
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Start it up (Vroom vroom)
Wait a minute!10Embed
