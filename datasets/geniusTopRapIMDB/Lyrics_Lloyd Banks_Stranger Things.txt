Stranger Things Lyrics[Intro]
2wo4our (You crazy, man)

[Chorus]
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You ain't the same as when you came
We'll probably never be the same
Leave it to you, I get the blame
I guess that I'm the one that changed, quite strange
[Verse 1]
If I ain't there to have your back, I'm either dead or I'm sick
When you're fucked up, behavior turns irregular quick
Sometimеs the pressure ovеrwhelms when you're the head of the clique
But don't get ahead of yourself, I ain't bending for shit
Nobody sees your vision until you're successful
To become a success will validate that you are special
There ain't a pain reliever strong enough, life is stressful
Learn to put your faith in God, that's who gon' protect you
Don't ever bite the hand that feeds you, that's disrespectful
But if what's in the hand deceives you, now you're regretful
I brought integrity though every area the jet flew
It's like I see a stranger, nothing like when I met you
At this point I don't care to keep a friend again
When you get on they checking in, that ain't genuine
Changed my whole perception now that I'm rememberin'
Got a big safe of favors that I'll never lend, nothing's forever

[Chorus]
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You ain't the same as when you came
We'll probably never be the same
Leave it to you, I get the blame
I guess that I'm the one that changed, quite strange
You might also like[Verse 2]
Your favorite's nowhere near me when I'm dedicated
Always humble, usually disciplined and never hated
Call me quiet, call me lazy, talent never faded
It's frustrating when your grindin' ain't appreciated
Should have been dead in my twenties, shit, at least I made it
Guess I gotta prove myself again, increase your payment
Get shits together then the devil comes to rearrange it
The Lord blessed me with a shorty I could leave my name with
Fuck all the complainin' 'cause I'ma see the top again
Sunshine or rain, don't matter when you're 'bout to win
Question how I'm livin', lucky you get oxygen
Play around the crib, AK'll chop you in
Hoping for good, can't help but notice the stranger things
Fuck looking for love, what about the pain it brings?
Claiming you're a angel, they gon' have to take your wings
But where you wind up, while I accept the climb up and everything it brings

[Chorus]
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You ain't the same as when you came
We'll probably never be the same
Leave it to you, I get the blame
I guess that I'm the one that changed, quite strange
[Outro]
I hate the way you show me loveEmbed
