The Natural Lyrics[Verse]
No originality, take a ride with the natural
I ain't blow up yet
Fear the greatest bomb in the Apple
Tackles broke to pieces
The streets are scorching trying to over ease ya
A firm believer, I wore the crown on my Caesar
Freezer, count me up
This test an alley thump just made the tally jump
Wild around me, catch a smiley cut let out the alley up
Writer's block, can't get my mind to stop
Most days I island hop
Karma's a bitch, I found a spot
Wandering trips around the clock
Charming your chick from down the block
Flow got her, she found a shark
My fins showin' two tens throwing a pound a spark
Uh! So many washing up, I'm edged in stone though
You fool pit browse
My testers slam the lomo, exit solo
Big tests for so-so, need us extra promo
No runner ups can catch the pros
So slice the pie like Lexus logo
Bet my cadence alarms impostors
Problems just hanging strange fruit
Hs and orange boxes
Big faces in all the watches
Roses, Aces, and Knockers
Hoes embrace their show stoppers
Hundred papers, more options
With hunger pain there’s no nonsense
Rumble game I'm all offense
Launching confidence here
And I know these powers won't feel me
They'll be over your shit in no time
And no you ain't getting no co-sign
I'm fully equipped to go
I’m in solid gold at the goal line
Powder rope through my smoke, climb higher
Can't pick my code, ma
Over matter, fact who's badder?
Ain't no rapper here or after
Back in my zone at night
These new niggas is over hyped
Steep look into a soldier's life
Three or four minutes of poltergeist
Sweet beginnings,I'm ultra nice
Come kill a God, he multiples
Open eyes hit critics
Visits from broken wives
Through the impossible
The fuck is you doing with oxygen?
These bums done brung up my name in vein
Wondering when you hit your compliments
My conscience vents
Henny and mobster tints
Hell out the audience
Stand up guy, bet he won't hop a fence
If any a consequence
Stepped in good, been stomping since
Different kind, maybe common sense
Calm me down with the capital
Built the crown and no avenue
Boring niggas will challenge you
Slaughtering since 2002
Porno vids in my memory
Foreign trips out to Kennedy
Hoing tricks out for energy
Told a bitch I wouldn't let it be
Every week with another head
Ch-check out my symmetry
My maniac rhyme
More amazing than all your favorites combined
I'm killing ya, maaan!
Hit the fire on these bitches one time
I sunshine, I cook the area
Burn up your front line
Turn up my new shit, product of DJ Dram
Sour out the nose and bottle cliques
Urban model chicks
Life's a room, a dollar should
Slide in a Ferragamo slip
Top of the metropolis
Looking down on your confidence
Hooking up with your confidant
Cooling feels like the comp is gone
Uh, hoes in my sweaters
Hoes be over zealous
Hold it down, dirty as hell
When we roll to town
What's up with all these clowns?
I gave you years, how dare you doubt me?
Even when I ain't here you hear about meYou might also like1Embed
