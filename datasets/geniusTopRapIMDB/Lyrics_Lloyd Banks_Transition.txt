Transition Lyrics[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Keep claiming I'm changin', but you're trippin'
Kickin' that stupid shit so long, I start feelin' dumb when I listen
I had to get out of that position
I ain't got nothin' but real shit on my mind, and you're just fishin'
You're diluting your purpose the more you mix in
Guess we'll always be complaining, just work hard through the bitchin'
Lie right in your eye with a smirk, they support the vision
Collision and the system is designed to keep your mind in a prison
If you look a while, you'll find the wisdom
It's not in the media, infatuation with the television
Where's the love? You done left all your principles in the club
Life hittin' you several times, guess it's hard to feel the pinch through the drugs
Is there exception for a thug?
Caught in the trap, but in creation perfect, morning end up catchin' a slug
Most of them sinkin' tryin' to make it out the mud
Duckin' trouble 24/7 and their only vacation is dusk
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Fake love, gossip and hate, that's all they givin'
Gotta make it out this muh'fuckin' maze, 'cause that ain't livin'
Ain't no names out, anybody's for pickin'
Don't get caught up in the same route, runnin' ya mouth and out here slippin'
The ghetto talkin', you don’t listen
Get your act together or there'll be somebody's nigga' missin'
Here's to makin' the transition
Money over everything, you see the vision?

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Somewhere praying on your downfall like it works
Get in the core, convert the energy before I write the verse
Thinkin' of ways to shade a nigga, spite rehearse
What is you waiting for? You find it hard to cross me, ice it first
I've been gone so long, look back I see dust
Went took the trust, banned from the circle here forever last time you'll be discussed
In this paper chase you won't pass mine, dyin' to rush
Turned on the lineage you’re linked to, bet your family members lie in disgust
Should have been ballin' but your team jumpin'
Put in the category of niggas that check for you when you need somethin'
Lookin' out for your broke ego, you're greed drunk and
Don't nobody want you around really, relieved from it
Let it slide it gets worse, call him out on this shit he sorry
Usually his clique first, won't be joining your pitty party
Patience can't be found now, pushed it up to the limit probably
Waitin' in the wing still, shaky movin', forgivin' hardly
You might also like[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Fake love, gossip and hate, that's all they givin'
Gotta make it out this muh'fuckin' maze, 'cause that ain't livin'
Ain't no names out, anybody's for pickin'
Don't get caught up in the same route, runnin' ya mouth and out here slippin'
The ghetto talkin', you don’t listen, nah
Get your act together or there'll be somebody's nigga' missin'
Here's to makin' the transition
Money over everything, you see the vision?

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Used to have voices in my head, that's cool
'Cause the boy still here well fed, that's true
Mean that since truth's all that I had, gotta carry that
When nothin' you propose or alter it, gotta marry that
How we interpret that merge is all relative
I stand behind every word, like we all relatives
Less made men, over a decade in
I'm from the days when lil' niggas got they chest caved in (talk about it)
See I left home and sleepin' in parks was like a meltin' pot
Ain't DM an ex, it was dark baby and hell is hot
Black MPV was parked, used to yell it ock
Drive by, circle the block, check if he fell or not
Full of smokers in my Polo pull-over
The day a nigga' scared to be dolo and pulled over
'Cause they gats go ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Since I remember it all, I'm wantin' a flashback
Rest in peace Grandpa, I see him tilting his flask back
Our times kinda' the same, it's tough to grasp that
No code of honor and they conduct
Alarmin' because seein' grievin' mommas somber even Dalai Lama
Wish music was my escape
I was still naive, it was beautiful when this maze crucial to how we behaved
Just like concussion is brutal the way we slave
They don't tutor you to what it'll do to you at this stage, listen!
Fact sharing, I'm seein' no matter the scenes
'tween a rock and a heart places are bad pairin'
I'm paranoid, plenty buy a couple feet and shit
Gettin' money is easy, the struggle's keepin' it
To all the hustlers in the world, whatever your muse is
Hustlin' music, or hustlin' excuses, live!
Some think too small, they can't vision it
Don't even bother hittin' my line, I'm transitionin'
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Fake love, gossip and hate, that's all they givin'
Gotta make it out this muh'fuckin' maze, 'cause that ain't livin'
Ain't no names out, anybody's for pickin'
Don't get caught up in the same route, runnin' ya mouth and out here slippin'
The ghetto talkin', you don’t listen
Get your act together or there'll be somebody's nigga' missin'
Here's to makin' the transition
Money over everything, you see the vision?

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Knahmean?
Just some real nigga gossipin', Joey
Banks, WHAT UP?
Think too small, they can't vision it
Don't even bother hittin' my line, I'm transitionin'1Embed
