Where I’m At Lyrics[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you got me
I’m up now, it’s your loss
Must suck to be you

[Break: Eminem]
History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself, and what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
I never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?
[Verse 1: Eminem]
There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind every time it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfuckin'-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin' men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is goin' down
You must've just not been truthful from the start
See for me it’d be nothin' to say you never had my heart
But I’d be lyin'
Fuckin' see why they call this bullshit a relationship: ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it ‘cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fuckin' do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by and we only spoke twice
I’m sittin' in your driveway, callin' you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m callin' your cell phone
You answer but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know?
It should've been time to go a long time ago
I kept holdin' on, it's comical
When I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwin', I wasn't catchin' your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowin' over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin' all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're goin' to
I’m hauntin' you, bitch, everywhere you turn I'm followin' you
‘Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killin' you now, yeah, I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's ‘cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em!
Middle finger up, I’m gon' just keep grabbin' my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back knockin' on my door all dolled up
You might also like[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I’ve had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Your options are leave or put out, granted, your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feelin' smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinkin' about who's lovin' me, I’m thinkin' about who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splittin', you don’t think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you! Ain’t no secret
No apologies, you keep it
Now that I’m doin' my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It’s my fuckin' life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money-hungry hopeless ho
You fuckin' with my focus so
Go back to that chump that played the role befo'
Love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’ma blow fo' sho'
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinkin' us, hope you float
Lyin' through my teeth, I hope you don’t
(Drown, drown!) Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowdin' me go
If they got somethin' to show, let 'em show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughin', ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothin' is what we are
No beginnin', no tomorrow
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks, Eminem & Both]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be aight without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)35Embed
