Area Codes Lyrics[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I’ve got hoes, I’ve got hoes
In different area codes (Area), area codes (Codes)
Hoes! Hoes, hoes, in different area codes (Area)
Area codes (Codes)
Hoes!

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Nate Dogg]
Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch, act like y'all don't know
It's the abominable ho man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter of fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's (Oh)
2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's (Oh)
Read your horoscope and eat some hors d'oeuvres
10 on pump one; these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I’ve got hoes, I’ve got hoes
In different area codes (Area), area codes (Codes)
Hoes! Hoes, hoes, in different area codes (Area)
Area codes (Codes)
I’ve got hoes!

[Verse 2: Ludacris & Nate Dogg]
Now every day is a ho-ly day, so stop the violence and put the 4-4 away
Skeet, shoot a ho today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's
7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checking out the scene, I'm checking a ho tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular ho-micide
3-1-4, 2-0-1 (Hey)
Too much green, too much fun (Hey)
I bang cock in Bangkok
Can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot, think not
I'm the Thrilla in Manila, schlong in Hong Kong
Pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slanging this dick like a New Jack, biatch

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?
Is it cause they like my gangsta talk?
Is it cause they like my handsome face?
Is it cause they like my gangsta ways?
Whatever it is, they love it and they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me, just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call (I call), come running
2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball (I ball), stop fronting
Or I'll call my substitute freak (Hoes)

I’ve got hoes, I’ve got hoes
In different area codes (Area), area codes (Codes)
Hoes! Hoes, hoes, In different area codes (Area)
Area codes (Codes)
I’ve got hoes!

[Outro: Ludacris]
9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4
Shout out to the 2-0-6
Everybody in the 8-0-8
Ha-ah, 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4

Uh-uh, 3-1-8, 6-0-1's, 2-0-tree
8-0-4, 4-0-2, 3-0-1
9-0-4, 4-0-7, 8-5-0
7-0-8, 5-0-2
Hoes in different area codes, know that

Ha-ha, ho ridin' on the West coast
Ya understand what I'm saying?
Ho-cus pocus, you the dopest
Hoes to the right, hoes to the left, 5 hoes this time
Whoo! Ho no!
The Hip-hop ho-ller-coaster, that's what we on right now
Ha-ha, no need to get all ho-stile
