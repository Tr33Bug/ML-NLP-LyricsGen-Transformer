Blueberry Yum Yum Lyrics[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah, uhh
Think I'mma try somethin that I ain't
I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Got a little bit of blueberry yum yum
And I never woulda thought that it could taste this gooooooooood
Thank God for the man who put it in my hooooooood
It's got me singin melodies I never thought I woooooould
I'm feelin sorry for the homies who be smokin woooooood
Chop chop, break it down for a player like ye ye ye ye..
I'm 'bout to find me a woman and skeet skeet skeet skeet..
I'mma keep smokin 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak..
Or 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak weak weak..
Headed down to the Dungeon, wonderin, if they got some mooooore
And if they don't then I'mma haveta, settle fa, some 'droooooo
But it just ain't cool cause right on after, I'mma have-ta go
And continue on my mission fishin for the yum yum but I'm movin slowwww

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yes fire fire got me so tired, I'mma stop drop and rollllllll
Put a wet towel under the doooooooooooor
Don't pass it I can't take it no moooooooooooore
Somebody take a trip down to the stoooooooore
Hurry please, cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks..
And how long will it take it to get back back back back..?
Yes indeed, I'm a little off track track track track..
Off this weed, and I'm full of that 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac..
Get on in that stankin Lincoln, crank it up, and riiide
And it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks, insiiiide
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'mma eat eveyrthing, in siiight
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alriiiiight

Get the propane, roll dem thangs, and let's blow dis place uuuuuuuup
You already know what'suuuuuuuuuuuup
I mighta had to pay some extra buuuuuuuucks
But I really don't give a fuuuuuuuuuuck
Cause a brother feels great great great great..
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake..
All bent out of shape shape shape shape..
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake..
If you tokin good then all the smokers, let me see, your flame
Don't know what you got but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean, a thang
You can't compare it don't stare cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane
