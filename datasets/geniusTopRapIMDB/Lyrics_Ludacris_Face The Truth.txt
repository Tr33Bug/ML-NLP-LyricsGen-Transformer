Face The Truth Lyrics[Lucidious: Verse 1]

Yeah
Can I ever really find a way to let go of you
I been thinking about it every time that I'm in a booth
Try to put together everything that we do
Every step we take is away from the truth

What's the point of a relationship
If every other day we gotta save that shit
It’s gotta be love, thought we found it
Ship has been sinking we both have been drowning
All the hatred that we been allowing
All the alcohol that we been downing
Afraid to commit but afraid to let go I'm alone I can feel all the demons surrounding

Been a while since I recognized
Who I see when I look in my eyes
Trying to breathe but the more that I try
More that I suffocate dying inside

Tried to be different we both tried to listen I'm sorry that I had to leave you behind
All of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind

Locked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine
Made the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine (faith of divine, faith of divine)

[Pre-Hook]

All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive

Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me, but it wasn't our time
Still I’ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)

[Xavier Frye: HOOK]
You might also likeTook it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong

We can pretend that what we both know ain’t true
I don’t mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth

[Lucidious: Verse 2]

I wish I could stay here to be your protection
Loving myself is what I been neglecting
The most difficult part is the patience
While taking in all of these changes

I don't mean to be acting evasive
I'm pretending I don't wanna face this
I get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now I'm anxious

All I got left is a picture of us
All because we had broken the trust
Been working on gaining it back for a year, but the spark has been missing it turned into dust

Miss the high that I got from your touch
Both of us felt an adrenaline rush
Co-dependent treated you like a crutch
My heart was stolen & brutally crushed
Question is will I ever know
What we we could have been if I let you go
If I need to walk this path alone
All on my own cause I need to grow

Fuck, I'm sick of this
Feeling like a mother fucking hypocrite
Made a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it
Find a way to let it go and be indifferent
Quit talking (quit talking, quit talking)

[Pre-Hook]

All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive

Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me, but it wasn't our time
Still I’ll love you till the day that I die (day that I die, day that I die)

[Xavier Frye: HOOK]

Took it too fast but we were taking it slow

We can be stubborn because we are strong

We can pretend that what we both know ain’t true
I don’t mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth2Embed
