Freaky Thangs Lyrics[Intro: Faizon Love]
It's two a.m. in the morning and its uhh
Light showers and you're probably hookin up with that girl
That's been, two-wayin you all week
Her baby daddy's out of town so uhh, you can fuck around
It's okay to check in that Motel 6
$59.95, not a cent more for that dirty-ass ho, yeah
Stop by that convenience store and pick up them rubbers--Magnum, I hope
This is Faizon Love and uhh, I love hoes
I just don't pay 'em
[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Ludacris]
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C
So later on we'll be rollin'
Drop tops, I'm hittin' yo' hot spots, I'm top notch
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the A.U.C
Then later on we'd be bonin'
Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
No wonder why you wakin' up swollen

[Twista]
I'm feelin you Luda', smokin my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
On the back and leave it drippin down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty
Killa for money, still a thug get bump
From slow pokin, to locomotion, hittin bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy
When I'm feelin scummy I love to cut
You might also like[Ludacris]
Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin the buttons off yo' blouse
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos, holla while they in yo' mouth
So we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Twista]
Now I got the feelin' we can cut the hell out each other
And I hope we be the same thang - freaks
We can get the mattress goin 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang - skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes

[Ludacris]
Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today
Ludacris in the back of your Cheverolet
Ahh, ahh! What's my name?
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin and a look of disgust
Always a must, stay "Adrenaline Rush"
Wonderin why they don't be bustin' the same
[Twista]
I'm clutchin my thang
Stuffin in it, strokin it down, beat the stuff up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag before I tap it
I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Ludacris]
Bubble, bubble, bubbles is in the bathtub
Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin slapped up

[Twista]
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together
Because now you gots to ride out, bitch

[Ludacris]
Oh 'Cris, can you do it again, that's what they askin' me
Hit skins, causin' catastrophes
Get pinned, by me and my family
Sip gin, fulfillin' your fantasies
In your condition I'm wishin you'll take a lickin'
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
Finger lickin' never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes
And you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that c-c-c-c

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em

[Bridge: Jagged Edge]
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl

[Outro: 4-Ize]
I come from the eighth planet in the 19th galaxy
Where the royal penis is clean, yo' majesty
Can it be, Sheila E, Apollonia, Vanity, all mad at me?
I'm the Prince dick of insanity
I'm good lovin, body-rockin
Knockin boots all night long, we not stoppin
I don't care if the kids watchin
I stir it like motherfuckin coffee and brown sugar
Girls dem sugar
World class lover, Kama sutra
Porno music producer
Tallywhacker is a rock hard stormtrooper
With a purple helmet, made for crushin pink cookies
Goonie goo-goo, we cut bigfoots and wookies
And fat women, because they need love too
So go on big girl, whatchu gon' do?7Embed
