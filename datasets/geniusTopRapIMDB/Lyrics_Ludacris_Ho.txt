[Verse 1]
You doin' ho activities with ho tendencies
Hoes are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do what you do
Blew what you blew, screw what you screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pullin' on my coat tail
And why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Ho tell everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on playa once a ho always
And hoes never close they open like hallways
And here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
And everybody wants some 'cause hoes gotta eat too

You gotta run in your pantyhose, even your daddy knows
That you suckin' down chocolate like daddy-os
You hoes are horrible, horrendous
On taxes, y'all writin' off hoes as dependents
I see the ho risin', it ain't surprisin'
It's just a hoasis with ugly chicks faces
But hoes don't feel so sad and blue
'Cause most of us niggas is hoes too
