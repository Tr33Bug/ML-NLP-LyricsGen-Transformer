Number One Spot Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, baby! Hehe, yeah
(Woo!) Back again! (That's right)
Luda!
Hahahaha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feeling real good, too (Holla at 'em, man)
What up, Uncle 'Face? (Yeah!)
Haha, haha
I'm a bull in this industry, man (Tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (Nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout, right? (You know what's up, right?)
Look—
[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me (Surprise!)
It's a celebration, and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (Bow!)
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

Yes, indeed! Ludacris: I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail-out; po'-po'—I tell 'em, "Holla"
In court, I never show up, like Austin Powers' fa-zha
"Father, father," and hey, I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop, once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feeling so randy
I'm double-X-L, so I call 'em my "eye candy"
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot
[Verse 3]
Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Mes, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time, and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen, ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot4Embed
