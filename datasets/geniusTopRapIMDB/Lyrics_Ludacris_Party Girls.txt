Party Girls Lyrics[Bridge: Jeremih]
I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Yea, I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Let's party again

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's your world and I'ma touch wherever you want me to touch it
Pop that, pop that and you'll be bustin' them nuts when you want to bust it
Don't rush it mama I'ma take my time and do it slow
From the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the tub to the flo'
Oh! No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?
I lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?
Run, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump
Then it's more she gets, if it's more she wants
She's spoiled rotten like bad milk
Get her hot cause I make that ass melt
She whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip
And I'ma black belt
I beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes
And I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

Throw some ones on that
Get you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that
Make you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that
Like pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr
My bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?
So turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly
Doin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party
My lung's filled with Marley
My hands on your body
And I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow
You can't speak

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Yea, I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Let's party again
[Chorus: Jeremih]
I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked142Embed
