Representin Lyrics[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
I’ll be representing, representing
I’ll be representing, representing

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure
When you’re telling me I better come get it
But I’m the man for the job
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
I’ma stand right by you
While you saying
[Pre-chorus: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on
Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy?
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gonna learn today)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]
I’ll Be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang and represent
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang
Watch how I put it down

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Put it down like ay
Only know you can do it
Then I’ma hit every single one of your spots
And really you don’t need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What I’m asking if it’s mine
Cause I'mma be your motivation
Just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine
I’m so attracted, to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure
You a lady in the street
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier
A brother would never know
That’s how you like it ha
But that booty pack a mean punch
And I’ma spike it, huh, while you saying

(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang and represent
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang
Watch how I put it down

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
You’re incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, the rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to
I’ll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it’s not that many
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning
My mind and body are gone
That jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine
You make me wanna call the crib
And say I’m never coming home, Luda!
While you saying
[Pre-Hook: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby (Keep all your attention)
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on
Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy? (Yeah)
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gonna learn today)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang and represent
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang
Watch how I put it down

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
I’ll be representing (I'm representing), representing
I’ll be representing (I'm representing), representing
Watch how I put it down1Embed
