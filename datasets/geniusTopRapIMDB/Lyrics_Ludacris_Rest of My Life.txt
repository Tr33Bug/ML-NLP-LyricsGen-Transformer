Rest of My Life Lyrics[Intro: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules
[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

[Break: Usher]
Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey
For the rest of my life

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
If I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey

[Interlude: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup (fill up your cup)
Lift your lighters, a toast to life

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...

[Outro: Usher]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life8Embed
