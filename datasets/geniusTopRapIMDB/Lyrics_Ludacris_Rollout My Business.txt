Rollout (My Business) Lyrics[Intro]
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
[Verse 1]
Now, where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 2]
Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of raps, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose
You might also like[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 3]
Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

[Chorus]
(Rollout) I got my twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock forties (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
[Outro]
Get out my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business, ah
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, oh, mine
My business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, oh, mine
Ah, ah, Timbaland, Ludacris
Disturbing Tha Peace (Woo)

[Skit]
Yeah, uh, c'mon, what's up? What's up? Come here (Ugh)
Come here, go to sleep (Uh)
Go to sleep right now (Ahh), right now (Ugh)
Go to sleep, go to sleep
Go to sleep (Ah-uhh)
Go to sleep (Ahh)11Embed
