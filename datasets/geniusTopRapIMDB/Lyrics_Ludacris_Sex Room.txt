Sex Room Lyrics[Intro: Trey Songz]
Welcome to my sex room
Sex room, room, oh, oh, oh
Welcome to my sex room, room

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hah, welcome to my little sanctuary
You been lookin' so good all day
And you really got a nigga pretty anxious ba-by
Better call your boss, tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off and take it off
And leave nothin' but yo' T-shirt and your panties on
Feelin' high but I'm hung real low, lookin' sorta like a tri-pod
So power down your cell phone, and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions, and power up your inner freak
Yes, yeah fuck, is the only words that you finna speak
It's about to get real X-rated, can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
But enough about me, let me think should I be worryin' about if I can handle you?
Damn right I'ma get that thang and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thang, Allstate better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my firecracker, my tongue finna spark you up
Get ready for blast-off, waterfalls gon' splash off
You might lose around four or five pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Welcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it
In my sex room, candles and the pole
Sex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the floor
Sex room, mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord', baby, won't you dance
In my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl, I got it
In my sex room

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Let the candles burn, I'ma turn these lights down (Room, room, oh, oh, oh)
And when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up, and iced down (In my sex room, room, room)
Nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton (Oh, oh, oh)
You the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten
I'ma get my video camera, let's make a movie baby
You the star, so as soon as I press record, you gots to do me baby
You could stare all in the mirror, take a peak at how good you lookin'
I'ma have your body smokin', take a look at what Luda's cookin'
My arm underneath your leg, legs all behind your head is how I gots to getcha
Right hand, left hand on red in the bed like we been playin' Twister
Now I got you tangled up, and you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose? Nah, I think I'll get the blindfold instead
You better get a couple towels baby 'cause we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or a saddle, I'ma give you this dick to ride
I'ma grant your every wish, and fulfill your fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room, it's only you and me
You might also like[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Welcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it
In my sex room, candles and the pole
Sex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the floor
Sex room, mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord', baby, won't you dance
In my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl, I got it

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Listenin' to what your body say, we can do it every other kind of way
Hit it in the sun, up in the shade, tell me what it is, I got you babe
Baby, let's hop up in the shower, baby, let me snatch up off that towel
Let me get a vowel, I-O-U, so I-E-U mean I eat you
To my sex, to my sex, come into this room
To my sex, to my sex, you know what I'mma do
To my sex, to my sex, grab my body tight, don't let me go
How you wanna ride? Just let me know
In my sex room, oh room, room, oh, oh, oh
Know that I want it, baby yeah
To my sex, to my sex, with your toes pointed
So baby, welcome to my sex room

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Welcome to my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it
In my sex room, candles and the pole
Sex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the floor
Sex room, mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord', baby, won't you dance
In my sex room, where your body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl, I got it
In my sex room
[Outro: Trey Songz]
Sex room, room, oh, oh, oh
I got it right here
In my sex room
Sex room, room, oh, oh, oh4Embed
