The Potion Lyrics[Intro]
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
[Verse 1]
Man I'm like a needle in a haystack, so face that
Go back to the drawing board, connect dots, but can't trace that
Matter fact, erase that, 'cause on this great track
Get your face slapped, and I'm straight so don't take that
Try somethin' different and shit, so listen and shit
Speakin' about what hip-hop is missin and shit
I'm about to fill a void, Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta, tote hammer since I was a little boy
Ain't nobody like me, so they wanna bite me
Fight me, step to me now but it ain't likely
People swear they sight me, just cause he's light-skinned
With braids in his hair don't mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right, livin' in the limelight
So picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Bar, bar, hardy-har
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

Only standin' five eight but still a big shot, plus I got a big
Clean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc
Tell your man to kick rocks, when I make my pitstops
I'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not, no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
Bigger booty, small waist, put 'em in a small place
And if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place
Bail like a bondsman, but keep 'em dancin'
Got pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car?
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
[Breakdown]
And jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay

[Verse 3]
Still working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade
In a ghetto state of mind, say I'm rich and I'm paid
Pickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
Either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
Digest that and there's really nothin' missin' to say but

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion3Embed
