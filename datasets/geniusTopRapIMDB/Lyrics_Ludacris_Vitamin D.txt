Vitamin D Lyrics[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Ludacris]
Aw yeah, yeah
I mean there's a lot of women out here that's just, you know
They just deficient in so many things, man
You missing so many key nutrients in your life
I, I just want you to stay healthy in these streets
Oh, no no
Somebody gotta give you some vitamin D, you know what I mean?
Yeah, Luda

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
She got them handlebars
Gotta keep a tight grip on that donkey
She be givin' out battle scars
'Cause she got a tight grip on that monkey
She told me, all the weight, go straight to that ass
Make a student be late for the class
She make a nigga wanna holla even throw a couple dollars
So I gotta get straight to the cash
I love big cheeks in between them sheets
Jump back, I can't help myself
Got a nigga so weak and I get no sleep
'Cause the girls stay wetter than Michael Phelps
And she get right down to the business
She stimulate the five senses
And she like it when I grab her hair
But I might pull out them extensions
My intentions is good for her
She like that I'm rich and a lil hood for her
I beat it right and leave it good sore
Real niggas is always what I stood for
I'm all in, I don't play with it
I fall in and I lay in it
If I call in, I might stay in it
And if it's all a sin, then I'll pray in it
[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
She got them thunder thighs
I'm just tryna get struck by some lightnin'
Man, her booty is plus her size
And I like my cakes with some icin'
Yeah baby, [ciero a milo
Que a sabora azucca]
Bonita, freaky lil chica
Let's try the whole Kama Sutra, get down
Drip down, let it trickle down, dig her down
Smack it up, flip it and rub it down, love her down
I'ma keep it 100 now, that girl nasty
I'm never lettin' the opportunity pass me
But I love her boots when they thigh high
Guess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by
Take her legs, put 'em sky high
Climb to the top, I'ma skydive
Off, you feel the pump like it's sawed off
Shot gun, hold tight, don't fall off
Work, I'ma call off
Don't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off
You need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma get blue balls
'Cause ain't nobody got sex like you
That can dress like you or impress like you
You make a brother wanna woosa

Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Ooh, she got that snapback
Kinda ass if you blink, that it might hurt you
All up on the Snapchat
Try to get a screenshot and she might curse you
That there be your eyes only
Love when she grind on me
If they said I'm talkin' shit
You know someone was lyin' on me
She ain't for that he say, she say
This shakin' the DJ replay
Is like everyday is her bday
'Cause everyday's her get this D day
And she got to work with a smile on
And her skin is always glowin'
And her JJ ain't all in the streets
'Cause she ain't out her hoein', Luda
[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)13Embed
