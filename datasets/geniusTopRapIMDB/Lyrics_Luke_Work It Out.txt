Work It Out LyricsAin’t enough hours in the day
It sure does feel like all work and no play
Honey I know that the grass ain’t mown
The car ain’t washed and the leaves ain’t blown
I’m a get it just soon as I can
Lord it’s hard to be an everyday man
But darlin’ if you’re willin’ when I get home
I’ll put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can…
Work it out
Why don’t we start right now?
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl it’s gonna be, workin’
Let’s work it out
This ole world is so tough
Sometimes I think that I had enough
Back still hurtin’, bills keep comin’
Boss still yellin’, truck quit runnin’
Ain’t no tellin’ what’d happen next
Try not to break while I drive and text
But darlin’ if you’re willin’ when I get home
I’ll put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can…
Work it out
Why don’t we start right now?
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl it’s gonna be, workin’
Let’s work it out
Baby it’s true, all I need is you
Just unplug the phone
Let me get you all alone…
And work it out
Why don’t we start right now?
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl it’s gonna be, workin’
(I’ll put the kids to bed) We gotta work it
(We’ll unplug the phone) Baby work it
(Come on baby) Let’s work it out
(Let me get ya all alone)You might also likeEmbed
