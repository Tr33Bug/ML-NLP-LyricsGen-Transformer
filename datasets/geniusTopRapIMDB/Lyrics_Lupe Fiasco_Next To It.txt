Next To It Lyrics

What it say?
Next to it, next to it, to it, to it, to it, to it
Ne-next to it, to it, to it, to it, to it, to it
Hey, what it say?
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Money ain't shit when there's wealth next to it
Wealth ain't shit when there's health next to it
In the lane with nobody else next to it
Ain't get here by myself, lot of help next to it
Word to Chilly Chill, that's myself, let's do it
1st and 15th ENT, FNF music
Album number five, ayy nigga, let's do it
Don't say my name 'less my city next to it
Anything look good with a titty next to it
And the titty got a face that's pretty next to it
Riding 'round town, something really exclusive
Bump a little Pac with some Biggie next to it
Nigga, that's love with a twist next to it
Nigga, that's a Blood with a Crip next to it
At the Bulls game like a tree gift next to it
Yes nigga, that's the floor and I sit next to it, let's do it
Everything look better with a bitch next to it
Rollie on the wrist, let's do this
Top down on a whip that's roofless
Ain't impressed, it's the bitch that do it
Let's do it
Club ain't turnt 'less some bitches into it
It's the bitch that do it
Yeah, yeah

Crib ain't shit 'less a whip next to it
Whip ain't shit 'less a Benz next to it
But a Benz ain't shit when a Rari next to it
Rari ain't shit when a Zonda next to it
Really tell a difference when a Honda next to it
But a Honda is the shit when you jogging next to it
This a baby momma with a condom next to it
Cause this a miracle, I'm still rocking, let's do it, let's do it
Zero need a comma with a zero next to it
Then another comma with a zero next to it
Then a zero next to it and a zero next to it
Then another fucking comma then a zero next to it
Nigga what we talking? That's a million, let's do it
Nigga what we talking? That's a million, let's do it!
Still at the bottom with a million next to it
Cause a million ain't shit when a billion next to it
A billion ain't shit when a trillion next to it
Captain Save-A-Hoe, she want a hero next to it
But I ain't tryna hear it, put my ear up next to it
Cause it's strange to a nigga, got a weirdo next to it
Nigga, your wallet got a robber next to it
Black ski mask with a chopper next to it
You might need a bed with a doctor next to it
But nigga I ball like soccer next to it, let's do it
You might also like
Everything look better with a bitch next to it
Rollie on the wrist, let's do this
Top down on a whip that's roofless
Ain't impressed, it's the bitch that do it
Let's do it
Club ain't turnt 'less some bitches into it
It's the bitch that do it
Yeah, yeah

Nigga, my hood, feel like Heaven
With third worlds next to it
But nigga we good, and we'll be even better
With thirty girls next to us
Yeah, the White House had a trap next to it
Yeah nigga, that's a fact next to it
My house had a trap next to it
Ayy nigga, where's the house? Let's do it
Your chest ain't shit 'less a chain next to it
Chain ain't shit 'less gold next to it
But gold ain't shit when a diamond next to it
Your beat ain't shit 'less I'm rhyming next to it
Hah, hah, shining next to it
Shit ain't real, can't find her next to it
Nigga, let's park it on the red carpet
Grammy Awards, my momma next to it, let's do it
Everything look better with a bitch next to it
Rollie on the wrist, let's do this
Top down on a whip that's roofless
Ain't impressed, it's the bitch that do it
Let's do it
Club ain't turnt 'less some bitches into it
It's the bitch that do it
Yeah, yeah

To it, to it, to it
Next to it, next to it, to it, to it, to it
Next to it, next to it, to it, to it, to it
Next, next to it, to it, yeah29Embed
