Paris, Tokyo Lyrics
I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go
I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, "Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France"
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
You might also like
So let's keep it real, all in together, "Free Chill"
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honor√©, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah!"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, "Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind"
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes24Embed
