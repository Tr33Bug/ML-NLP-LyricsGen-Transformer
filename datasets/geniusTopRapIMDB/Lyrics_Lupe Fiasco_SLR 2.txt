SLR 2 Lyrics

For real though, like for real though
Like for real
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even
It's like, niggas must forget who the fuck
Did what the fuck
When the fuck
When niggas was still, not the fuck
Or whatever
Fine then, I say
Dear Lord, have mercy on my banana clips
Give 'em half, call it that banana splits
But my halves is really like a banana 6
Do these bananas have any idea who they on the planet with?
Apes, yeah you bananas to the grapes
That mean your bitch got a banana in her face
And wine on her chin, get these heathens off of my trunk
And all of these swine up off my rims
Tryin' to take the shine up off of my Benz
SLR, nigga please
Niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
Gon' roll around with that B-Y, nigga just roll up my sleeve
Got body plans, so I karate stance so I could open up my chi
Lu the boy, too Bruce Leroy to destroy
Doo doo beat like two T-boys with one freak one me
But I can DP like it's three more
Three rewards for me or me or me or me or me or me
Team me is like meat eating animals meeting a meteor
Dinosaurs, I'm fine with all kinds of wars
Knives and swords, lions, tigers bitin' boars
Lightening striking Viking hordes
Fighting heightened, violence soars
That was Adolf, reacting to my new shit
Translation: how come he can't be as evil as Lu get?
Well that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch
Took two sips of the holy grail
Then I backed up and I turned around
And I bent over and pittoo'd shit
I love Jay, that's my nigga
I feel sicker than a cruise ship
I ain't competition, I don't move shit
The only opposition is this new shit
These new niggas rappin' like they 2
They be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew shit
What happened to the game?
Niggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne
Rappin' like they Chainz
I ain't matchin' them in platinum
But I'm rappin' like I'm flames
Like smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain
And my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains
My left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain
Now we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead
And that shit is insane
He's so crazy, look at the little baby
Nigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z
You will respect me, you will reject me
But I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me
SLR, nigga please
These niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave
And when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled
DVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.
And my punch bowl's like an ocean
And I lay it on by the ladle
But it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle
Satan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel
Ain't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles
It's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan
I ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands
Welcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR
Here we go, FL bars
Hold up, go back to the hard part
Would say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls
