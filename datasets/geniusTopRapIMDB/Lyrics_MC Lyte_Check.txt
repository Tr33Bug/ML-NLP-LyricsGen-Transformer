Check Lyrics[Verse 1]
Get it if you can, if you cannot get up off the pot
You been missing, pissing up the spot a lot
And I've been waiting on the sideline, give you the guideline
Get up in that pocket like a pocket light, but they don't rock it right
They don't concern me, can't even burn me
Not even with a lighter, all them liars, they ain't worthy
You heard me, I'm a loner: me, myself, and I
I'm a powerhouse, ready to collide with the greatest tide
It's like a typhoon in the making
What I'm saying leave your whole city shaking, broken down, better start praying
I ain't playing, this ain't hopscotch, on the block, or skelly up in den streets
Get jelly whenever we meet
Chic, I'm about my paper; dudes, see ya later
South side of the equator, so hot, gotta thank my maker
I'm here, flow with the best of them, get low with the rest of them
Rang the alarm in '88 and I'm still buzzin'
Cousin, they trying to hate, but I just elevate
Get it straight: I'm Lyte as a rock and they featherweight
[Hook]
You said you seen it all, but you ain't never seen the Lyte
They talk a good game, but they ain't ready for this life
I'm trying to give you the code, let the future unfold
I had to follow them rules, that's how I open them doors

[Hook]
I put that work in; check
Hustle hard; check
I paid my dues; yep
I gave you hits like Ruffneck
And I'm still grinding; yep
Still shining; yep
I'm all that's left; yep
I'm still the best, but you ain't yet

[Verse 2]
I'm living life to the fullest, everywhere I go they ask
How you pass like a bullet, speed of Lyte and that Lytro gas
Here I go, there I go, here I go again
I ain't no fad like Michael Jack, they know I'm Bad
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
You from the hood, you understood, and understand just who I am
I live to be free, I live for the beat, I live for the biz
That's what it is, no wondering, I get it in, I get it done
You are the one, but I am the Lyte; without me, you're out of sight
I'm taking this entire game to a new height
Just watch me, just like you do YouTube and Hulu
Lyte is back and all over this map like who knew
Rapping to you; listen because I might not say it again
Find good people, wave them in
Let them haters and them [?] ain't know saving them
It's casualties in this game of life, that may not seem right
So if you get it, then get it get it, then get it right

You said you seen it all, but you ain't never seen the Lyte
They talk a good game, but they ain't ready for this life
I'm trying to give you the code, let the future unfold
I had to follow them rules, that's how I open them doors

[Hook]
I put that work in; check
Hustle hard; check
I paid my dues; yep
I gave you hits like Ruffneck
And I'm still grinding; yep
Still shining; yep
I'm all that's left; yep
I'm still the best, but you ain't yet1Embed
