Cold Rock A Party (Bad Boy Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Puff Daddy & MC Lyte]
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I rock the party that rocks your body
I rock the party that rocks your body (Let's go)
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
So what's your status?
I be the baddest B to hit the scene
Since the gangsta lean, I'm all ears
So what you got to say? I hope you bubblin' it baby
Now bubblin' it my way, let it rain
Ain't no salt up in the game (Nah), still want you the same (Yeah)
Ain't a thing changed, instead of knockin' boots
We be kickin' down Gortex
Except it ain't raw sex, roughnecks (Yeah)
Throw your hands in the air, let me hear you say "Oh, yeah"
Trust you me, I'll blow up shop
About to blow the roof right off of hip-hop

Bitch from V-A-A, and I be smokin' hay
All day in the barn, damn it, darn, uh

So you can't forget-me-not (Woo) to the yes, yes, y'all

'Cause I be "Feelin' Myself" like I was T-Boz, uh-uh

And I'ma sho' 'nuff be the boss on this team
Show all you MC's how Missy make the green, uh-huh, uh-huh (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 3: MC Lyte & Puff Daddy]
Some say I'm shady (That's right), that's me
Complicated rap star, meet Lyte the MC
You see I'm on to you baby and your mechanism
How you hit it when you're in it
So hot you keep it sizzlin', no "ooh-ah-chee-ooh"
And all of that too, keep me wetter than the waters of Kalamazoo
Nigga, who you comin' wit'?
Where your posse at? I leave the boys alone
Tell her you won't be back, I got the cheese, baby (Yeah)
My cheddar's better (Uh-huh), I got that milk
For that amaretto, trust you me, I'll blow up shop
Have a little nig' callin' the cops, watch

I rock the party that rocks the body ('Round and 'round you're turnin' me)
You rock the party that rocks the body
Upside down you turnin' me, turnin' me
'Round and 'round you're turnin' me, turnin' me (Uh)
