Donâ€™t Cry Big Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is Lyte, and I'm just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone, either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone
Of my voice, cause yo, I know I'm your choice
So when I am speaking, show your gratitude
While I am teaching, I have no attitude
I'm just here to get the job totally done
85% work, 15% fun
Sometimes I admit, I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme, I just can't fight it
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistant
[Hook]
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry

[Verse 2]
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistant
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other I'll never be beaten at a
Rap meeting, in other words a battle
Cause y'all, I'm like a farmer, and y'all's the cattle
Be a big girl about it, don't you start cryin
That'll mean I made you weep without even tryin
Lyte takes it like a big girl, I'm no jive girl
Comin direct, tellin you that I'm a live girl
'I'm positive', you've heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl

[Hook]
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry

[Verse 3]
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls, we don't fight over men
Although there's one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again, it's not worth my while
And it's also not a big girl style
And I know you're thinkin: 'Wait, Lyte is slim and short?'
While being brought up I was also taught
Take it like it comes and proceed with the flow
Lyte is the biggest of the big girls, and now you know
You might also like[Hook]
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry

This is dedicated to Milk Dee from the Audio 2
To Gizmo from the Audio 2
The whole Alliance crew
You know what I'm sayin?
And to all the big girls
Also the small girls
You got time to grow up to be big girls

[Hook]
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry1Embed
