Fuck That Motherfucking Bullshit Lyrics[Big V]
Yo Lyte, can we swing some of this?
[MC Lyte]
Nah, nah man I can't sing
[Big V]
No? What you mean, no?

[Chorus (2x):]
[Big V]
Fuck that motherfucking bullshit
[MC Lyte]
Kiss my motherfucking ass
[Verse 1: Big V]
People call me Strokes, a.k.a. you know the Iceman
When it comes to sex, you know my motto yes I can, can
Never will I front, pass it up or let it walk by
And if I don't get that ass, well at least I did try
I know the games p.m.s. must run through you
You set it up so no man can ever do you
But when you need your weave done, honey read my lips
You can beg all you want but you gets jack shit
I don't play, I work hard for my money
5, 6, 7 days a week, shit ain't funny
Now if sex is old fashioned and you're not selling out
If you're not giving it up, you better spit that gum out

[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
You wanna what? You must be bugging
A minute and a half of having sex, that ain't loving
You couldn't please me if you had his dick
That moaning you heard means you were making me sick
So don't front and lie like you were all that in bed
When I rolled your fat ass over you were nervous and scared
Mr. love man, you ain't shit
You better get your homies to suck your own dick
You might also like[Chorus (2x)]

[Verse 3: Big V]
When it comes to sex you get mo better
'Cause I was on your shit even when you had the jetta
It's '93 now and all that shit done passed
So stop frontin' miss 'cause I want that ass

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
What you what you can't get so step off, there's no room
You wanna zoom-a-zoom? Not in this poom poom
So let me tell you something Mr. Why-you-can't-quit
Save what you can do 'cause that's some bullshit
So go and tell your friends, you know, the ones you got gassed
To take a cold shower 'cause you get no ass

[Chorus (2x)]

[Big V and MC Lyte]
I want ass. Yeah, and you just the type of woman that's gon' give it to me
Step off, I ain't havin' that!
Stop playin', stop playin', take your clothes off and let's get busy
Take my clothes off?
I ain't got time for this bullshit
Who the fuck do you think you're dealing with here?
[?]
Yo, I rolled your fat ass over, and you was scared homie
And if you don't get the fuck out of my face, they gon carry your black ass outta here
Get the fuck out of here
How you like that shit? Yeah, so what you sayin'?
What I'm sayin', what I'm sayin', muthafucka, this is my song and this is the end of that shit, goddamn it!
Fuck that!
Look woman, fuck that, I don't want no ass from you no more. Look, just step the fuck...1Embed
