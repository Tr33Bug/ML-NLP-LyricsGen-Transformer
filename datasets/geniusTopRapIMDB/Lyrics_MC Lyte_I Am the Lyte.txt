I Am the Lyte LyricsI am the Lyte	(repeated)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Examine the style used in this sequence
The rhyme's the clue, the record's evidence
To the fact that I'm hypin this episode
Cold carryin the extra wide load
The beat is fat and the rhyme is thick
All over the town you hear the sound and pick
Me, the L the y the t the e
Me, and if you see the Rock, I'm sure you'll see
Me (Hey Lyte, what will you be doin?)
Kickin it, bashin down competition
And when I drop the bomb, you'll listen
Boom! Now that I've got your attention
I'm slammin what you wanna hear
I just thought that I should mention
'89 is the Lyte year
Now's the time to roll like a rhinoceros
Step to Lyte, that's preposterous
I'm heavyweight, though I'm lightweight
My looks the hook, my rhymes the bait
And when I throw the line you proceed to take
The goody, the treat that I hand you
That you couldn't refuse
Damn, I cram to understand you
Your love is to Lyte to lose
[ VERSE 2 ]
I think you deserve this, you waited long enough
For a rhyme that's super-duper extra tough
Every human is lurkin and loomin
Puba on the beat and you know the shit is boomin
Tasty like pastry, fresh from the bakery
First Priority, that's the way it has to be
Feel the drum, I bet it makes your body numb
One for all, and all for one I bet you come
Hurry, hurry, step right up and see the show
MC Lyte and K-Rock are about to throw
Get on line and purchase your ticket
(Hey, don't worry) Lyte is gonna kick it
(Go on, be happy) I put you up on the scoop
Now come and watch the party hoop

[ VERSE 3 ]
I am the Lyte, and it is time for me to go
You wanna beef, save that shit for the toilet bowl
I use styles, styles and much many styles
I leave smiles, smiles and much many smiles
On the people who come to see the Lyte perform
(Word is bond)
The rhyme will kick as the brain will tick
You can tell because the record'll sell
Old styles and new styles formatted together
Bold or dull, so it doesn't matter whether
Which comes first or vice-a versa
It won't make a difference, as long as you rehearse-a
Get it down pat, and come right and exact
MC Lyte is comin right and I'ma say goodnight
