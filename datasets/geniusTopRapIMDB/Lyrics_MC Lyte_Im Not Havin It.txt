I’m Not Havin’ It Lyrics[Verse 1]
[P]Uhm, what's up baby? I been eyeing you
Time and time again, I been trying to
Get a little closer, but you won't let it
[L]Well if I see something I want, I just go out and get it
I'm like a fluzy I'm choosy and I don't fall for tricks
Cause guys be running games, like the New York Nicks
[P]But on the square dear, you know, your style really temps me
[L]Don't try to gas me up on a tank that is empty
[P]I'm Positive, and I'm kicking the facts
[L]Well I'm Lyte, and you got to kick it better than that
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having
[Hook]
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me?

[Verse 2]
[P]You think you're all that [L]No you think you're all of this
With your baby, baby talk, and your "Excuse me miss"
[P]Well I smooth, and hey look, it's only right
I thought that we could get together, and maybe we can ...
[L]Yeah sounds good, but guys like you just wanna hit and run
Look, we're not the two, and I'm not the one
So if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
Kill that! And get a five dollar crack-head
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[P]I think you try to diss me or play me like I'm cooly
[L]No, matter of fact love, I think that you're a cuty
There's just certain things you don't understand baby:
Every woman wants to be treated like a lady
[P]So what? You want me to kick it as if I'm a doc?
[L]Listen to what I'm saying and shut ...
I'm just tryna put it, so I can make something happen
You just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
[P]Look I'm all the way live and I'm definitely not crabbing
A bit of change for a woman, that's what I'm not having
You might also like[Bridge]
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]Step to yourself, cause I don't wanna hear it
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]You're not getting younger, you're just getting older

[Verse 4]
[L]What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Friend. I'm never gonna fall in love again
But getting back to the topic of convo
In my book hone, you are a no-no
[P]C'mon I'm clean, cut, and dapper, you got to admit that
I don't sell drugs and I ain't with the wack track
I'm cool and calm, my phone is mine
You don't see me snatching taste, and acting wild
Excuse me miss, I think you better get with this
[L]Scan it damn, cause I'm simply not having it
