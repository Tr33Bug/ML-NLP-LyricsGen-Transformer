Keep On, Keepinâ€™ On (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Delite]
Remix, check it out

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot?
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right
[Chorus: Xscape]
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
Beware of the stare when I step the piece
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right, under the candlelight
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that
A-yes, I can, can or why not
If I wanna, yes, I can, can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and I'll get rid of all company
You might also like[Chorus: Xscape]
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time, trying to jerk me
Hurt me then desert me, you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool, and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name, and kick the game
[Chorus: Xscape]
(All you gotta do is) Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin' on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin' on

[Outro: Xscape & Delite]
It's the remix, uh
Yes, baby, uh
Ya don't stop
It goes on and on and ya don't stop
Just keep it on
Keep on keepin' on
Uh, yes, yes, y'all
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin' on
2000, uh, 2000, 2000 watts
Keep on keepin' onEmbed
