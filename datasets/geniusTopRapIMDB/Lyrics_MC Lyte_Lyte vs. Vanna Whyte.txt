Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte Lyrics[MC Lyte]
Oh, oh my goodness
I can't believe it um
I'll just take a Sony gold microphone
That's what I'd like
And a Yamaha REX50 digital effects processor
Yeah
And a Toshiba TX900 PCM for my DJ
(?)
And on that
(?) computer with uh (?)
And a  set of JBL
JBL speakers
Oh my goodness a four channel noise gate
I want a four channel noise gate
I'm dying for a four channel noise gate
And a DVX compressor limit
Oh wait a minute
Forget...just forget it
Oh my goodness
Just give me that dress
The dress that Vanna's wearing
I'd like the dress that Vanna's wearing
Oh just nevermind, just give me the money
Take everything back, I want the moneyYou might also likeEmbed
