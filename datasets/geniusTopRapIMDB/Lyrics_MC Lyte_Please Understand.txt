[ VERSE 1 ]
I met a guy named Tommy, damn, he charmed me
Met him at the mall, but I knew he wouldn't harm me
We exchanged numbers, hopin to meet again
We couldn't wait for the romance to begin
The relationship grew strong
I didn't wanna be right if this love was wrong
But oh no, came the problems, the first segment
The dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
The second segment: started wheelin and dealin
Didn't give a damn about how Lyte was feelin
But then he got wise, started treatin me better
Cause all of his friends said I was a go-getter
He knew he was usin me, and abusin me
He also knew that soon he'd be losin me
First I clocked him, yeah, I docked him
But I rocked him - and then I dropped him

[ VERSE 2 ]
Then there was Dave, couldn't behave
So I punished him and put him in my "Lyte as a Rock" cave
Then he got bold, tried to play insane
So Bigfoot threw him off my "Paper Thin" train
He tried to "10% Dis" me, but he pissed me off
Cause I'm the boss, and you know I'm not havin it
Lyte is too dope, and you know I ain't crabbin it
Then there was Henry, way too friendly
I needed a trip, he said he would send me
Pay my airfare, if he could come with me
I said, "Listen, honey, I don't need your money
Believe me when I tell you, I've got my own
Cause I'm MC Lyte on the microphone"
Yeah

Here's another story: a dude named Corey
When I used to work, yes, I was a clerk
At the World Trade Center, back in high school
This little player musta thought I was a fool
He took me out to lunch, offered me a ride home
When we got there, he asked could he use my telephone
I said, "Yeah, sure", flipped him to the floor
Cause he said "What's up?" and tried to feel my butt
I kicked him down the stairs and said, "What you're provin?"
Rolled him to his car and said, "Get movin!"
He tried to score it, I wasn't goin for it
You can't play me, I'm Lyte Thee MC
Never saw his face again until last week
All beat up and bleedin down the street
I looked to my left, there was a girl with a pipe in her hand
Sayin, "Why oh why can't you understand?"
