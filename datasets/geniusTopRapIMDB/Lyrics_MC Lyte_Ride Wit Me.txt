Ride Wit Me LyricsLytro, yeah, hm, yo
Yeah, fuck the rest be, nobody can test me
Rich like Nestle, thick like Wesley
Snipe out, I'm the type that be about
Crashin' up in ya joint and knockin' the lights out
Feelin' lovely, trust me, I'm drug free
Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
Cos you sittin' on my nerves, when we've already heard
That garbage, played-out crap you call rap
Some chicks say they love that, well I'm above that
Calling me a ho won't do it's two, double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up, and be puttin' that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me, been there, smelt the dope and
Rollin' with the shelter, making niggas jail free
Like a Luger, I spit thick shit
That a leave ya squad sick, cos I ran up in this shit
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Still got the little frame with the big name
Watch it change cos, nah nigga, we ain't in the same gang
We walk different and we talk a different slang
You a sidekick, and I'm a four point six range
You a one roof flat, I'm fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up, gettin' a tan
Thought you knew, I'm overdue
And you're overrated so cats are over you
I inspired you, come on now, no way
? that rumour, the consumer won't believe it anyway
Never play with the messenger, Head on Joan of Arc
When I'm coming through these parts like just cut the dark
I'm a trendsetter, go getter, bringer back
Cos I'm fed up, ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred, vision blurred
Cos I serve these words
And pitch them bitches with a curse
You might also likeHolla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me

Yo what I'm sayin I've been layin' waitin' for the right situation
New York hawk city playin', back in the BK bomber
Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you wanna, we closin' after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down, don't nobody move, I'm making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but I'm running with the torch
Race, got a lot a rats but I can't be caught, or bought
Cos I won't sell out, that's why me and the big dogs, we fell out
Not with a major, but I'm still major league
Crash ya dome with this ? then watch your nose bleed
You want it, you can get it anytime
Cos I got many lines for niggas of any kind, you know me

Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brotha, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with me
Holla, get crunk, get live with me
Brother, don't make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo' ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me, come on ride with meEmbed
