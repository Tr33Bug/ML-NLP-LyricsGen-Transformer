Stop, Look, Listen Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'
The dope def rhyme that is always being taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me
No trait of originality
But yo, I am not one to down another
So like I said before, just go for yours, sucker
I'm gonna take the time to drop a dope line
Or maybe even two, for you and your crew
So you can start shakin' and movin' all around
To the Lyte Thee MC and the King Of Chill sound
It's new and improved like a freshly cut diamond
Perfect timin', like a gem it's shinin'
Or better yet a ruby, somewhat like a sapphire
This jam you are forced to admire
Stop, stop
Look, look
Listen

[Verse 2]
Wanna battle me? Now that's strange behavior
Drink and drive, yeah, you're probably safer
Cause when I start, I never give slack
You feel like a 'kick me' sign was pinned to your back
Yes I'm the super-duper with the roper-doper
Got the clean drawers on, yeah, I hope ya
Do, because I'm gonna strip you of your peace of mind
Now your piece is mine, damn, that's unkind
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly
The rhymes that I say you can't deny
Because 100% is what I give it (Say what?)
I haunt the house with the hip-hop spirit
I tear it, repair it
Like a hand-me-down make you wear it
Save all your crocodile tears, grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers you're gonna share it
You hear me, junior? 'Cause soon you'll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand biting's not part of the plan
That's wrong, I thought I taught you better than that
But that's what you get from a stabber in the back
You might also likeStop, stop
Look, look
Listen

[Verse 3]
M.C. - Master of Creativity
Rappin' is the activity
Rhyme is the sport, let it be taught
That Lyte Thee MC is takin no shorts
In '88 I was great, but '89 is my time
Stop, look, and listen - to the right rhyme
K-Rock the DJ throws the cuts my way
Put 'em on the reel-to-reel and let them play
Leg 1 and Leg 2, they do the jumpin'
The dancin', the pumpin', always up to somethin
But when it comes to the rap category
MC Lyte headlines the story

(Extra, extra, read all about it)
(Comin out fresh and flier than we did before)
