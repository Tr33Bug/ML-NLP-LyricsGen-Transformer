The Wonder Years Lyrics[Jay-Z]
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

[Mc Lyte]
It's like the wonder years you blink and I appear
From a cloud of smoke I'm like a full court press and you choke
When I'm near pull up a chair let me explain how I maintain the youthful glow
For you that don't know it's called H2O
So stop asking when I walk by
How I look so young and stay that fly
It's elementary, kick the liquor when you turn dirty thirty
The rest is a secret so I keep it for the worthy
Some of us need to be doing the bid
Spitting lyrics that's worst than Ritalin for kids
They say "Lyte they ain't ready for nothin' you did"
So we kick the same stuff as if we were stupid
Take the same beat and loop
50 times, Why not? that other group did
It's idiotic, average and robotic
I keep it real my mental thick like a Harvard clique
I got them singing Bob Marley hits. (I don't want to wait.)
They don't want to wait in vain
But I'm worth all the joy and the pain
Come hard when I hit, goddamn you know the name Lyte
[Hook]
Lock this down like its supposed to be
The pioneers wonder years L-Y-T-E
Oh yeah she's back the industry need that
So pay attention to her I told y'all to listen to her
Yeah Lyte she's back, the female G-Rap been in the limelight
Baby girl get your mind right

(Yeah I'mma do it like this)

[Mc Lyte]
Pass on the insight, teach a seed about Lyte
And how I was the first female to smash the mic
Yeah nigga, I speak the facts of life
While a whole lot of others was crap on the mic
Still showin Mc's what cash look like
From the Jetta to the porsche to the navi I'm tight
What I got it's hot you can have it to
Praise god, work hard all you have to do
I was born to be the Lyte to give the spark in the dark
Spread the truth to the youth, the ghetto joan of ark
It's sad these kids put you at the head of thier throne
All you give them back is raps about your bone
Gettin head in your whip, a studio in your home
But who cares cause you dummies all sound like clones
It's a mystery to me how you got this far
Can't read, can't even count the miles on your car

[Mc Lyte]
Yeah, You take this easy, slow it up on them
I feel the animosity
Loosen up the grip when I shoot from the lip, I hear it constantly
"Yo Lyte kick that same shit you did in '86"
I can't do that, I'm too evolved too big to stay small
In a world full of problems, especially the U.S just can't solve them
My data too robust they can't feel where I'm headed
How I keep the mind, spirit and the body all connected
Respected by many and any that want to test
Bring them Timbos and leave home that pretty mini dress
I'm a viking I'm fighting until the death of me
As god blows breathe in me, I leave the legacy
Lyte as a Rock!
