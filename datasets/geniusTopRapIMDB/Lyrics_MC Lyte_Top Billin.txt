Top Billinâ€™ LyricsMC am I, people call me Milk
When I'm bustin' up a party I feel no guilt
Milk is cuttin' up for the
Suckers that's down with me

The one of us, that's how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the two, we're rated R
We're gifted, and we're going far

Down the road, to the bank
While I'm here I'd like to thank
Mom and dad, they knew the time
T is scratching, Lyte is rhyming
Milk is chillin', Lyte is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you?

Stop scheming, and looking hard
I got a great big bodyguard
So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dee's gonna pull the skirt

I gets money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is, you can ask Giz
I stole your nigga while you was in prison

Jail, for MC assault
You was jealous it's all your fault

Milk is chillin', Lyte is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you?

Clap your hands, your hands you clap
If your girl's out of place it's your girl I slap
You might also likeAnd if you're dumb, you'll ask why?
I am from that do or die
MC Lyte, Lyte the MC
I got a brother and his name's Milk Dee

Milk is chillin', Lyte chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
Since you understood, would you?

Bite a rhyme, if you dare
I get the papers so I don't care
My contributions to this jam
Is confusing, because I am

Milk Dee's dated all the way
The super easy mightiest MC okay
Yes I'm down, down by law
I get the fellas out on the floor

Milk is Dee, down is he
Two the, at the top is where he'll be
The place was packed, when we toured
Girls come in you won't be bored

Milk is chillin', Lyte is chillin'
What more can I say? Top billin'
That's what we get, got it good
And since you understood, would you?
Do a dance, dance the two
If, you can dance it's easy to do
This dance is on and on and on
Dance until your breath is goneEmbed
