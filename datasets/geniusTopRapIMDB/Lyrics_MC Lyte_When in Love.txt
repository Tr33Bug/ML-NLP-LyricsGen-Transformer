When in Love Lyrics[only vocal parts feat. MC Lyte are shown]

When in Love (3X)

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night, everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
It'll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard, I've done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring
So if you love me, love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
I'm not embarassed, nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past, I've been gamed
But that was then, and this is now
And there's no way damn it, there's no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of
When in Love

When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say, "I must have been deranged!"
I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car?
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right!
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love (2X)

When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job, hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like two-seater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens, she got you strung
Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun
Love'll make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said, "Love makes things happen"
It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of
