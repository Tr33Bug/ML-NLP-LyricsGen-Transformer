Zodiac Lyrics[Chorus]
Libra, Cancer, Gemini, Pisces
(What's your Zodiac sign?)
Aries, Aquarius, Taurus, Sagittarius
Leo, Virgo, Capricorn, Scorpio
(What's your Zodiac sign?)
When were you born? What's your sign?

[Verse 1]
One, zero, the month of the year
I'm not a hero, but I come when in despair
I float like the wind, the mighty air sign
When I use my mind, it's not hard to find
Those who would not like to see me fly
Like to step on my wings and watch me die
But that can never be, I use my scales
Positive, negative energy, male and female
Emotions within me
Leo, Aquarius compatibility
Also Gemini, but I got four eyes
For one set of twins, I look deep within
Often distracted by pretty little things
Like the wings of an angel or the songs they may sing
Argumentative, but I hate confrontation
Ruled by Venus and starked with hesitation
Procrastinator, but never an instigator
You wanna riff, homie, I'll see you later
Sapphire, My type of jew-el
I turn on one who thinks he knows me too well
Like the water barrier with the million dollar smile
Flowing like the Nile or the waters from the Panama Canal
Pisces, fabulous catch
They remain detached, yet to find a match
Don't lose your breath waiting to exhale
I shall prevail weighing souls on the scales
Follow me as we take this trip through astrology
The galaxy from Pluto to Mercury
What ya gonna do when the planets line up?
Your time is up and your city blows up
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear none
I'm at one with the sun 'til I'm done
Astrologically speaking on the track
Dropping solar facts about the Zodiac
The sun and the moon and the stars
Make up the universe, Earth is not far from the planet Mars
Virgo the virgin running from the twins
Stung by the Scorpions running through the Lions den
Ram with legs of a crab
With the half-man, half-horse waiting in the pass
Of course, if you check the math, it's all symbolic
Horoscopes are purely logic, check it
[Chorus]
Libra, Cancer, Gemini, Pisces
(What's your Zodiac sign?)
Aries, Aquarius, Taurus, Sagittarius
Leo, Virgo, Capricorn, Scorpio
(What's your Zodiac sign?)
When were you born? What's your sign?You might also likeEmbed
