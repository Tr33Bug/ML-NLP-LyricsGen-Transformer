Corner Store Lyrics
Corner store, 2 A.M
Got some mango Hi-Chews, a bag of chips
Rollin' through the city and we hide behind the tints
In the Benzo, gut the Swisher out the window, then we dip

Okay, 2 A.M., I'm posted (I'm posted)
Dope all in my Jansport
Movin', the youth I run with
Might treat your block like a dance floor
Finesse the rent out the landlord
Mama said "Pull your pants up"
Bendin' corners and scraper, I'm loyal to 'til my bands up
I'm pushin', movin' work, improvin'
There's commas on the way
Put the pussy on pedestal
Blow the medical to the face
It's evident on my face
Rollin' heaven in my new Wraith
Declinin' the call from labels
Still grubbin' on struggle plates
They all wanna know whats next, shit, I don't even know myself
Nah, I don't wanna hear your best shit, I don't really need your help
I'm posted and smokin' just like my uncles before me
I politic with the stagnant, forget my day by the mornin', it go
Corner store, 2 A.M
Got some mango Hi-Chews, a bag of chips
Rollin' through the city and we hide behind the tints
In the Benzo, gut the Swisher out the window, then we dip

I grew up on Old English, that's that malt liquor (Aha)
Never smoked a Backwood, it was all Swishers (Uh-uh)
Before I pulled a fake ID out on a bartender
I was on a bag of cubensis, walkin' off kilter (Shrooms, shrooms, shrooms)
We ain't have no common sense
Do that dirt and hop that fence
Roastin', talkin' shit, we mobbin', I just got my momma's whip (Hell yeah)
We blow dank out that window, right with your tape up, it's garbage
I used to roll up a spliff, and I mixed the weed with the Parliament, ayy (Oh shit)
Couldn't tell you 'bout our future (Nah)
We was on the corner, posted (Yeah)
Wasn't thinking 'bout tomorrow (Uh)
On the rooftop smokin' (Smokin')
Swisher guts in the Funyun bag (Yes)
I was just doing my thing (My thing)
Hit the hot food aisle (Uh-uh)
Got the gizzards instead of the wings (Gizzards)
But it's all love, run my route, play the course
Sweatpants, shorts, wife beater, posted on the porch
Reminiscin', 2:11, and we smokin' on some 'Ports
And gettin' hella faded
Gotta re-up so you know we 'bout to hit theâ€”

Takin' my time, workin' it out
Countin' the coin, breakin' my back
All in my loins, all on my nerves
Can't get a break, but that's my snack
Call me Almond Joy, mama's boy
Can't afford none of what you order
Shit, I'm hardly on, not quite broke
Off the wall, but on the border
Pushin' pen to the paper for peso
They wanna Lego
Close construction, no room for the huevos
You gotta love it
That's Benny, he like Montego, he save you like the gecko
He not gon' pay to date you, you guessed it, OG Maco
Boy so wonderful
Them cheap thrills, they come and they go, yeah
Talkin' 'bout we saved you a seat, boy, boy
They don't want no one to know, long as you comfortable, yeah

Got some mango Hi-Chews, a bag of chips
Rollin' 'round the city and we hide behind the tints
Off the Benzo, gut the Swisher out the window, then we dip

That's all (Gemini)
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference12Embed
