MANIAC Lyrics
I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
I could give a damn, you're a maniac
And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah

I fell in love with her moonwalk
Dancin' in the kitchen in her tube socks
I shoulda saw the signs, but refused, dawg
How am I supposed to ever move on?
Why is this so complicated? You said that you didn't love me
Said you workin' on yourself, you ain't been to therapy since 2020
Somethin' isn't right, see it in your eyes
Always give advice, never takin' mine
When I say goodnight, I'm thinkin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You get on my nerves, I'm a foo-ooh-ooh-ool
You better reimburse all the things you do-ooh-ohh
Put me in a hearse, we both coo-coo-coo-cool
It's never gonna work

I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
I could give a damn, you're a maniac
And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah

I think we need some space, I think we need a break
I think I need to move, I think this isn't safe
Why the hell you follow me to Walmart?
Gotta know everything, you ain't Nardwuar
Dress up on Friday nights, turn up 'til Sunday mornin'
I'm Mr. Probably Right, ignorin' all the warnings
I shouldn't wanna kick it, too many red flags
I knew you were problematic 'cause all of your exes are mad
Somehow, I'm back in your arms, told you, "Get back in my car"
I know you don't really love me, you deserve actin' awards
As long as the night is young, go crazy, I got your back
I'll be posted by the jukebox watchin' you dance, thinkin'
You might also like
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You get on my nerves, I'm a foo-ooh-ooh-ool
You better reimburse all the things you do-ooh-ohh
Keep me down to Earth, we're both coo-coo-coo-cool
But somehow it works, let's go

I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah
I could give a damn, you're a maniac
And you're talkin' like a killer, got me on my back
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah

I don't wanna dance with a maniac
'Cause the moment we touch, it's a heart attack
You know I love you, honey, but you got me runnin', yeah4Embed
