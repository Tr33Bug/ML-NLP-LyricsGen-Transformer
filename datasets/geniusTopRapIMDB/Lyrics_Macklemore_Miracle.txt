Miracle Lyrics
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?
It's been a long night
I just might wake up on the wrong side
I tell myself it'll be alright
Sunlight peakin' through the dark sky
Bottle it up, fall in the cut, all out of luck
Drownin' in this quicksand and I'm swallowin' mud
I taste temptation and I fall in and out of love
Grab her hand, taxi cab, in God we trust

You can wish on all the stars, way up in the galaxy
They want you to fall apart, so they can have a piece
I threw a hundred in a wishing well
Ad then I came back for a refund
Said "all this pressure just might tip the scale"
Seen it before, it's just a re-run
So keep runnin', ay, I keep runnin'

My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly goin' under
But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?

I got some secrets, I got some secrets
My palms together, prayin', but I keep on thinkin' 'bout evil
Snake-bit in blood, and the poison, it ain't leaving
Wanna sabotage everything, one and only enemy
If these walls could talk, they'd have a lot of blackmail
Is karma real or not? I can't tell
The Devil complimented me and said "You dance well"
The praise won't save me, and neither will the fan mail
I'd be a sinner, but thank God I'm not religious
And I'm addicted, drugs and women, there's no difference
I know the right, but the wrong is just so tempting
I've got a phobia, fear of what I'm missing, amen10Embed
