Next Year Lyrics
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this

Next year's my come up
I've been lackin' but I can feel that it's the one
All the last three-sixty-five-one sucked
Like God group texted the world and dumped us
Bah, bah, bah, you better watch my bounce back
I'ma be the man in here
Glass to the sky, like we tryna grab the chandelier
I'd like to take this opportunity and toast to me
For bein' exactly who I'm supposed to be
'Cause life is gonna do what life does
I don't wanna look back and regret who I was
Let go of the expectations and then fire one
Forget the tally sheet before all my time's up
And I, know I gotta roll with it
I'm well aware the universe doesn't owe me shit
I know that, all of this pain means the growth, I think
That next year's gonna be better than this (Let's go)
I'm still an optimist, yeah, I
Got a lot to live on time
Ain't foolin' that shit 'cause next year's gonna be better than, better than (Go)

Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this

I'm sick of missin' out, sick of the fear and doubt
I'ma get spiritual soon, live in the here and now
Alone in my room, but you gon' hear me loud
And clear, let's start it at the top of the year
I want, one last cigarette, one last sip of it
One last secret, one last little bit
One last upper, one last sedative
One last supper with the devil and his relatives
And I was gonna change my ways
I was just waitin' for that day to pull myself up out of that page
Run that route and make a play, so sick of sittin' on the bench
It's finally to get in shape and livin' like a scrimmage
Thinkin' that I'll get another day now, no
I ain't wait up for coach marchin' band
I'ma go and parade in my zone, goddamn
Man in the mirror finally got on, fuckin' next year
The time is now to press go and I'm gone
You might also like
I'm still an optimist, yeah, I (Uh-huh)
Got a lot to live on time (Yes)
Ain't foolin' that shit 'cause next year's gonna be better than, better than (Go)

Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this
Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this
Let's go1Embed
