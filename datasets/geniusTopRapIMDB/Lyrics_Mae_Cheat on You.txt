Cheat on You Lyrics
Yo, yo
Yo, if you gonna hit niggas' girl
Just expect niggas to hit your girl
And that's it
(112 help me say)

If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)
Ma$e, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my Jeep
And I'm with my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets, blaze plenty freaks
Be the Bad Boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I ain't work late, I say I was with my peeps
And quick to tell a ho, yo I ain't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)

Ain't nobody hotter than the Jam Don Dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick lie to, Escada, Prada
And yo, when Cease got a girl, he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 on my Benz, them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I?
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be givin' her pearls
If you know that she cheap, why you live with the girl?
Half you cats couldn't live in my world
'Cause you couldn't picture another nigga hittin' your girl, what?
You might also like
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)

Is it because, my game is stronger, name last longer?
On the brain, like a whole eighth of 'caine
Chicks stop, mesmerize, rub up on they tatas
Like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma? It's Jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless, baby
Nights is lawless, recite for ballers
And I fools y'all fake players every time
'Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due, but I'm unfadeable
Mommy screamin' "Papi, can I skate with you?"
They wanna ride with me, stay fly with me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight, but in the mornin'
I get Shirley Murdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you?
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you?)

Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin'
And the girl ain't gonna cheat
Just like you cheat, they could cheat
And I just think, you a fool if you think girls don't cheatEmbed
