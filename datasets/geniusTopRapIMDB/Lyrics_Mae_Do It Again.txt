Do It Again Lyrics
Yeah, yeah yeah
Uh huh
I'm gonna do it again
And again and again and again
And again and again and again
Won't stop, it can't stop
Won't stop, can't stop

Double Up, Bad Boy
Double Up, H-world, it's not a game
You know, no matter where you go
There's no duo that you know
Get loot though, and still love the chulo's
We talk more spinnin' girls our coolo
Than any other members and you're part of my new dough

Get where mad cats live and pray
I don't like where I'm at? Call a Lear, get away

Y'all lay away, I pay and get today (Uh huh)
Things you save for, I probably give away (Yeah)

And with Puff? Who woulda think
Plain Jesus piece, diamond Cuban Link
Salvation Army when I'm through with the mink
I buy the whole bar, my crew don't even drink
(Don't even drink)

We do sets behind the 'neck
That's my Denale right behind the Lex
Like girls that find their sex get all kinda respect
When I'm 40, I'mma get all kinda checks

You want us do it again? (Yeah)
Cuz we can do it again (Uh huh)
You want us do it again?
All you gotta say is do it again (Do it again)
You want us do it again? (Yeah)
Cuz we can do it again (Uh huh)
You want us do it again?
All you gotta say is do it again (Do it again)

Spend big, you spend a little
So I take what's big and you take what's little
I bring a full stage straight up the middle
Girl too tight? Break the middle
Now, why be the illest if your money ain't the realist?
Mad cats hate on me, mad girls feel it
Cut a chick off, let Mase mess wit' her
Pre-nup these girls so I'm never stuck wit' her
Wanna coup our group nine eight car
Doin' 20 in a Bentley even wit' out a radar
You minor, I'm major, I don't play par
I'm a shining pay star with diamonds from Quasar
Peep all your script, I don't wanna pay y'all
Let me tear wit' my kids, it's what your days are
How the f you duck infrared laser
So my sympathy goes out to the lady that made y'all, yeah
Repeat 1

Yo, marchin' around the world and met no man
That had ice like Frosty the Snowman
And though my name Mase, what does it mean?
Dolla sign, no matter what I do, make C.R.E.A.M
Out of famine steak greens, Miller A-teams
And grew up pretty cuz my pop got great genes
I hold it down now that B.I.G. gone
I hit butt naked and then keep my kicks on
I don't get my Cris on, I throw a brick on some young bad chick
That lolly probably flipped on
You better get goin', you wanna live long
Can't nobody protect me like my tres cinco siete
If you front, you'll just read about it next day
I'm that cat you know you got killer respect
Stay out my way if you're feelin' my threat
You'll know it's real when you face feel a Gillette
And I come through the club with your deal on my neck, come on
All Out
All Out, Bad Boy
What
All Out, All Out
Let's go
Repeat 1 until fadeEmbed
