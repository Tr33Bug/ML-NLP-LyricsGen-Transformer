Do You Wanna Get $? Lyrics
Uh, uh, come on, uh
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to my demo
Now I want they ass in my limo cuz now I'm a sex symbol
Intercontinental, L.A. airplay just like Jay Leno
Now all the labels out wanna send a memo
To do a remix y'all, but Mase say N-O
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed
Now a nigga tape on blast, I laugh
Figure as days pass, make more cash
And I push everything from E to H-class
Four years ago I couldn't go to a show
I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my dro
On a yacht nigga, fuck a boat that row
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?

Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, cuz it's less trouble
Make my dough and I just stack
No investment, I live off just that
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that
Why do what most do? Do what you 'posed to
Make hot jams y'all, sell bicoastal
If you want a hit you can let me coach you
Money back on anything that got my vocals
This is so true, I do what pros do
â€™Cause broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through
Dealers give me credit any place I go to
Drive out in the Benz say "Let Mase owe you'"
You might also like
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?

See, the moral of the story is
I'm not here to replace Notorious
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing
Harlem World style, pursue my dream
Cuz see the things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like
You say you got mad hoes, well where is she tonight?
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock
Cuz Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht
And a big knot to move you and your moms off the block
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo'
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us
Cuz I know you won't have this hold that's on us
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
With all this money that we can make
Why y'all cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?3Embed
