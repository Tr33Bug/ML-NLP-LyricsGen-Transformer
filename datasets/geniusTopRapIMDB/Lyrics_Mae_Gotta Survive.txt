Gotta Survive Lyrics
I dont regret nothing that I have ever done
At this point I don't owe nobody an explanation (woo yeah)

Man, they love you when you up
Kick you when you down
Look around, VH1 man, where are they now
Life is amusing, nobody like to see you cruising
But everybody like to see you losing (non stop)
So I stop despise, on top of lies
And if it prophesized I'll be ostracised
One day, I lost my rodium on the day I hit the podium
Now I'm back on top and salty like sodium
A gift to this world man, wrap me with a ribbon
Why do you look for a dead among the living
Some thought I was crazy, some said I was missing
Some said I was lazy, some said I was different (come on)
I was so loaded, that everybody floated
But once I got the notice then I got focused (woo)
And then I saw the motive, so everybody bought it
So I did the way wrote it and live it the way I quote it
Come on (yeah)
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
(Imma survivor, to survive)
So I try and to be all I can be (survivor)
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
Gotta survive (Mase), gotta survive (Imma survivor)

Hold up, trying to tell me what I'm not
Pull up in the 'Bach, not I'm all of the sudden hot
Now they want to stop just to look at what I got
Thought they want my home man
Left me out to rot (west side)
So I had to make it on my own, take it on my own
I wanted out the hood I had to 'scape it on my own
Believe me now, it's easy now
'Cause everybody see me now and I'm on TV now (woo)
But it started out with low budget
Then I took it around the world the folks love it
In the beggining man, my life it was so rugged
But now I shine like a gold nugget
Cause I made the most of it (what)
I know how you feeling man, I was weary
Some days I used to sit there, my eyes all teary
Thinking to myself, do anybody hear me
Now I know, you making it out
Is not a theory come on
You might also like
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
So I try and I try all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

I've been laughed at, talked about, ridiculed
But M Dot Betha is still not a bitter dude
And you know it's no coincidence
That me and you is not so intimate
I can't fake, I don't shake, I don't break
I don't lose, I don't use, I don't groove
I never lacked and I'm never going back
I'm nothing you ever sorrow (woo)
I'm telling you that I'm immortal (yeah)

Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me (Imma survivor)
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
(Imma survivor)
When I'm down at the back just keep it real (Imma survivor)
Gotta survive, gotta survive (Imma survivor)
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me (Imma survivor)
So I try and try to be all I can
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Got to, got to survive
Keep your head held high
Got to, got to survive
Keep your head to the sky
Got to, got to survive
We can make if we try
Got to, got to survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me (yeah)
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
When I'm down at the back just keep it real
You know there is nothing in this world that could separate me
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
From what I believe, from what I've achieved
So I try and try to be all I can
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
All of this is because of him
Gotta survive, gotta survive
And I'm telling you now, as much as you all don't want to hear this
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
I could do nothing to myself
When I'm down at the back just keep it real
It's all through him, it's all through him
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life that's being given to me
So all around the world
So I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
You don't even know success until you know him
Gotta survive, gotta survive
And him is Jesus (Jesus)Embed
