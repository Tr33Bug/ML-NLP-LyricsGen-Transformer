Love U So Lyrics
Yo, now hum all you want to and all the simple hits
Move, Cuda love, straight out the tenements
Drop the joint with Puff Dad just finished it
Would have did more without censorship?
Talk to plenty chicks, on to many flicks
Love when a girl say they wanna skinny-dip
Call room service, tell 'em to send it quick
Want gritz, don't forget, put cheetoes in my
Chill with the fellas that I came in it with
Buy 'em all minks before December hit
Player like Mase revoke your membership
Cuz this a balla club that come with benefits
They'll reminisce when lady used to diss
Now everywhere we go all the hoes generous
They must think Mase is on the rush limited
Dusty denim tip, is still the main chick
Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I can't keep my eyes off you
Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

Uh, uh, now ladies say he has this
Tendency to B.S.'s for girls who put key scratches
On brand new coups or E-classes
Jet for y'all, before I do a federal charge
Name incorporated, no problem gettin' cars
Whole entourage in the Mount Airy Lodge
When you very large, never spend cheddar, you charge
Get my daily m√©nage , Halle Berry massage
Different color Benz in every garage
Who would've thought '95, earth spinned twice
Mase be Billboard's hot merchandise
Player like me must deserve this life
Every girl a trick kid, if you work her right
My click bubble, why you wish me trouble?
So aight, Bad Boy gonna have to shit you double

Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I can't keep my eyes off you
Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
You might also like
Yo, if you never had a man than why try me?
Niggas outta town wanna learn my G
Understand me, the baller I be
Need about three pages and caller ID
When I come around, all the waiters get jippo
Wanna serve Poppy, him a big tipper
Leave the restroom about six strippers
Don't watch me, flip up your zipper
I'ma good fellow, mellow
Though I puff trees my teeth never yellow
Hello, in the club jingle like I'm Jell-O
With the kids, big as Tickle Me Elmo
Next summer, stretch Hummer for the whole state
Anything, buy no cake, hold no weight
I you ain't ready see Mase in the gold 8
I really think it's time that you relocate

Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I can't keep my eyes off you
Ooh Mase I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too1Embed
