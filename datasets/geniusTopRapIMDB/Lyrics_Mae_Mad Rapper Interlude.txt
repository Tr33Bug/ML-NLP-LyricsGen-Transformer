Mad Rapper (Interlude) Lyrics
And welcome back from that commercial break
Um, I found out some--please, ladies and gentlemen
Hold your applause, please? Can you please hold your applause?
I found out something very interesting
The Madd Producer, he's not really that mad
Uh...he...
Well, Mr. Producer, can you please tell us why you're not really that mad?

Eh eh eh yo would I be tellin' you shit though?
You can't be, y'knahmsayin?
Eh eh eh Yo, word up TV y'knahmsayin what's up for real
Yo, I gotta tell you something, for real
(What up? What up?)
Them niggas got cheddar dog and I did a track on Mase's album
And I ain't gonna lie
(Naw, naw, you can't be talkin like that for real
Them niggas y'knahmsayin they be raisin..
Naw son! Naw!)
I'm sorry dog for real yo but...
(Man dog!)
That kid Mase, he be doin his thing yo
