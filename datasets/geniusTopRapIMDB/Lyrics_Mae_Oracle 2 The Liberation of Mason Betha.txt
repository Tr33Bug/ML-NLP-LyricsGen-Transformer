Oracle 2: The Liberation of Mason Betha Lyrics
We ain't gang, we ain't goals, we ain't family, we ain't foes and we definitely not bros, we ain't nothin' nigga
And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul, we ain't nothin' nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga

I'm an unapologist, knew women like Solomon
I can burn bridge walk water like the prophets did
I can read niggas futures like astrologists
Why I'm so clean? I'm next thing to Godliness
Niggas try to starve my kids and give my money to his first born
I'm not the nigga posed to work for 'em
You 'pose the teach culture P about your legacy
And said that niggas follow you, you teaching treachery
And now you say you check for me, without a check for me
Now what you talkin' 'bout this murder niggas double jeopardy
Niggas sayin' let it go, you buggin' nigga, I can't let it be
Tell niggas don't call for me, I can only talk for me
I know what my budget read, I read the budget every week
I'm on the way I talk, but it's a way out for me
Then they try to dangle money, they didn't think I'll ever leave
Niggas never pay the artist but they love to pay the freaks
We ain't gang, we ain't goals, we ain't family, we ain't foes and we definitely not bros, we ain't nothin' nigga
And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul, we ain't nothin' nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, no, we ain't nothing nigga (no)
We ain't nothing nigga, no, we ain't nothing nigga nah
We ain't nothing nigga

He that is from above, is above them all, above them all
Yeah, I show up when thunder fall, I ain't runnin' from y'all 'cause I come for it all
Now I fire on Goliath and watch him fall
Didn't want to kill the short first cause I come for the tall
And when your main artist died, who the hell did you call?
I bring smoke with water on, I'm used to the fog
And I empty pipes when clips get clogged
And go to church on Sundays, I'm the illest of all
Don't ever put Mase with other Bad Boys who had hardship
You know I get it jumping like a mosh pit, nigga
I'm the first level, dirt level, y'all can never hurt level
Niggas mad I made it to the "I will never work" level
Since Cain killed Abel, I'm able to kill Cain
And Love don't steal, my nigga, change your name
And I see no integrity in you name
And I'm haunted by the voice of St. James
Champagne came matched my Rollie plain jane
And I say blame God I ain't changed
And if niggas never found the killer, why is nigga livin' here?
Everybody Brooklyn niggas gotta play a vision here
And niggas be selling their soul to go to a brunch
And niggas might end up sweet drinking that punch
I suffer good and niggas know I'm from another hood
So keep your brotherhood, I'm tryna make sure that my mother good
I ask sheep but I'm really goat to the goats
No matter with Top 5, I'm the nigga quoted the most
I'm the ghost of Wolf, ghost of Rezar
I come with the facts, you never consider I'm a ghost of Shyne
I speak for every artist never spoke their mind
Representing every artist that was left behind
From Craig Mack to G-Dep
I still remember them kids trample
For every producer you every stole they sample
Why you playing with me? Knowin' I make examples
Niggas hide behind money, you know that's not a man move
You know you're Frank and I'm Tony
You know that it'll get lonely, it's never safe when you owe me
You know the sayin' true
You has a chance to do right, I don't understand you
You can't stop a nigga came from Wick and Cam fool
But Karma came in getting hold of movers
You flow for the man causin' Georgia may show his wrist and piss water
He could have made it right that nigga could've saved his life
Now there ain't now way to fight, now he out there waving white
Ay, know your strategy
Now what you have is being right now, I got a mole in your faculty
So when you get the nerve to come after me, what audacity
Gotta know the dollar sign wasn't rappin free
Actually after B.I.G. died, what a travesty
'Cause when Mase left nigga, wouldn't nobody after me
I guess I got the last laugh, niggas ain't laughing huh
Niggas stay strapping up, I'm ready for a massacre
Cam blackballed Mase, the ball ain't black enough
Tupac for us nigga, I ain't even mad at ya
Pretty nigga always make they hearts melt, yeah
Guess you can say I know how Pac felt yeah
I'm just a Harlem nigga reppin' down a Vegas strip with my own Suge
You from Mount Vernon, go and rep your own hood
I'm not hating on your billi worth
Right now I'm only saying what you really worth
You ain't no architect
You just a nigga who know how to market death
Go pay his momma what he's really worth, nigga
You might also like
We ain't gang, we ain't goals, we ain't family, we ain't foes and we definitely not bros, we ain't nothin' nigga
And we definetly not goals and we definetly not vows
You can feel it in your soul, we ain't nothin' nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, no, we ain't nothing nigga
We ain't nothing nigga, no, we ain't nothing nigga nah
We ain't nothing nigga

And if you don't know, now you know, niggaEmbed
