They Donâ€™t Bother Me Lyrics
Yo (damn) Young Buck where my money at man
My niggas is playing what nobody in here but you, Spyder and Mase
There's supposed to be three hundred thousand in there (G-Unit radio)
When the drama get to poppin' it don't bother me, it don't bother me (50 cent)
When the shell casings get to droppin' it don't bother me ,it don't bother me (Young Buck)
When the wolves come out for the robberies, it don't bother me
Cuz they know who I be, it don't bother me
Cuz they don't bother me (ha stop)

Nigga I'm always strapped I sleepwalk with the hammer
I bump into you wake up then blam ya
Yo Whoo Kid these niggas didn't hear what they were supposed to hear, bring that back (bring the back)
(woo, yo)
Yo (damn) Young Buck where my money at man
My niggas is playing what nobody is here but you, Spider and Mase
There's supposed to be three hundred thousand in there (G-Unit radio)
When the drama get to poppin' it don't bother me, it don't bother me
When the shell casings get to droppin (cop a gat) it don't bother me, it don't bother me (play for (?))
When the wolves come out for the robberies, it don't bother me
Cuz they know who I be (always), it don't bother me
Cuz they don't bother me (woo)

Nigga I'm always strapped I sleepwalk with the hammer
I bump into you wake up then blam ya
It's a new day, switch the case
Semi the fully and spray, nigga u can die today
Duck or get out the way
Every nigga I know hoop dreaming or scheming
Morphine and dope the fiends still leanin'
I'm a chip off the whole block, whip off the old lot
I'll rip off ya whole spot, let a clip off and more shots
Niggas love Big Poppa, they wish Big around
Cuz I don't let them eat I lay my muscle game down
Imagine if there was no Preme there was no cat
And the game was run by Prince and run by Pat
It's the killa season, who the fuck need a reason
These faggot niggas cheesin', til they hit and they bleedin'
Peacetalks save it, squeeze the milli wave it
I cause a crimewave, 9 bodies in 9 days
Lyin' sideways, havin' the beam on the side page
Call me genius cause I know shit that you don't know
You gon' work for me or you gon' starve to ya bones show
And you can talk dawg but it ain't shit you can tell me
I'm filthy rich still eatin' peanut butter and jelly
Ain't nothin' changed but the chips, the cribs and the whips
You know me yeah I'm always switchin' the bitch
Like gooding on the mount, you know switchin' a pitch
I don't know nothin' about baseball but I'm pitchin' the bricks

When the drama get to poppin' it don't bother me (c'mon), it don't bother me (?)
When the shell casings get to droppin' it don't bother me(for the hood), it don't bother me
When the wolves come out for the robberys (10 years of hate), it don't bother me
Cuz they know who I be, it don't bother me
Cuz they don't bother me
It don't bother me neither niggas

My niggas all ignorant they don't listen to rap
They just fuck with the hoes and they be twistin' them caps
We all millionaires that be stealin' in stores
I don't pay for no G Unit's, I just walk out the door
This ain't no funny money this here the real bills
We got enough of this shit to go get Osama killed
Pay a little nigga to go figure out where ya momma live
Leave her address in the mailbox to find her kid
I don't need no helpin' hand for no other man
My name ain't game, I'm really who I say I am
I think I'm getting more accustomed to the beef
Just caught a rapper yesterday and stuck him for his piece
I love New York City, New York can hate me
I ate up Ja Rule and made his fans pay me
I look at this Joe dude and think about soul food
Ever since Big Pun died, homie ain't have no clue
We 'spose to be friends man, thought we was cool
Yeah I smoked a blunt with you Jada, but fuck you to
You know how gangstas do, they ride with choppers in they car
They sippin on syrup and they don't listen to Nas
Imma banger homeboy u don't know how I done been to bat
Up against the enemy, it's in me I'm just into that (Spider Loc)
Talk tough on the turf and I swear Imma attend to that
And you can take that vest off cuz Imma put em in ya hat
Point blank walk up ain't never did a drive by
Catch a nigga slippin and let the 4-5 fly
Fif got the east, Buck the one in the south
And the west coast is mine, these niggas runnin' they mouth

It's like a nigga play with murda cake
One in his vertabrae
You crazy enough to play with me then you deserve a wake
Of course a nigga word a wait, I raise the murder rate
Clap a shot at the cops like I never heard of Jakes
I been pumpin D, since days of humpty
They can make a million dollars just bein' my flunky
I got a set of soldiers that I send outside to check my motor
You don't respect a loader then you neglect a odor
I see em, collesium Mama have to ID em
If the boy is muslim, I lay em in the mosseleuim?

When the drama get to poppin' it don't bother me (G G G you know what it is nigga), it don't bother me (G G G you know what it is nigga)
