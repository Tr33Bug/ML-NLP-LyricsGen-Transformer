Watch Your Back (Interlude) LyricsThis Mase, what up?
Yo Mase I'mma make this short and to the point
I'm a fan of yours, you know, my kids like you, they dance to you
You know we like what's goin on wit you
All I'm sayin is don't give my girl your number no more
What?
Don't give my girl your number no more man
Who your girl B?
Listen man listen
You wild easy to get son, you know what I'm saying
I've been to jail twice man and I'm not scared
And I love and I want go back
You understand what I'm saying?
So, don't give my girl your number no more man
Come on B wit all that yo

And all them niggas you runnin with man
