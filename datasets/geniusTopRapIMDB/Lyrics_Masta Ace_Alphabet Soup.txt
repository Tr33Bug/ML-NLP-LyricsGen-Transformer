Alphabet Soup Lyrics[Intro]
Lets sing and learn about the letters of the alphabet

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
A son, how you B?
"Aiyo I'm chillin"
And I C you D to go out, and make a killin', but where E?
"F that nigga he making G's on tour with H-Town doing shows overseas"
Yeah I heard he DJ'd but stop hatin' OK? (I ain't hatin')
Smoke your L and chill the fuck out, I found a way to get paid
You know how I M, we gonna be N
Cuz my cousin Tyriq said, to meet him about ten
"Now that's that shit that I'm talking about
So yo let me just take this leak and then we out"
O now you gotta P, well hurry up it's quarter two
And I just got this beep from son, and that's the Q
R you ready? (Coming) hurry, I'll be in the S-10 Blazer
Out front, he blowing up my pager
"Aiyo I hope this nigga's about getting cash
Cuz mom's is about to evict my broke ass"
Chill, my cousin's like the 2001 Mr. T
Rock mad ice and platinum, watch U gonna see
He pushin a 600, with color TV in the visor
And got more gadgets, than MacGyver (ooh)
We gonna make dough on the W ain't seen
In your lifetime or my lifetime yo mad cream
Oh shit, you seen that car that drove by? (Yeah)
Well that was his X-ho Lisa, and that was Y
He told us to drive through the hood and if we caught her
Take back that 300-Z that he just bought her, so what's up
"Nigga I don't give a fuck, whatever we gotta do
We can take the bitch car, the money and jewels too
Make this u-turn, we'll catch her at the light
And get right, off of this quick jooks tonight
I don't give a fuck"
