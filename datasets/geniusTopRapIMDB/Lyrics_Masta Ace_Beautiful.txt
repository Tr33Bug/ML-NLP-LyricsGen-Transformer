Beautiful Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful
[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful
You might also like[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful13Embed
