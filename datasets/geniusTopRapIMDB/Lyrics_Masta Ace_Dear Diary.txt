Dear Diary Lyrics[Intro]
Do you ever song a little song like this
When you get up in the morning?

[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, (Yo) what a day it’s been (Now I hope you ain’t releasin’ another album)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Let me ask you something)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Ayo Ace, don't tell me you thinkin' about a return
I'm kind of concerned, when will you old cats ever learn?
It's time to hang it up when you stand on your last leg
When you don't write on the reg and your future is past dead
I'ma tell you ‘cause none of these cats will
You can't still try to rely on your rap skill
You ain't got nothin’ behind you and believe me
Not a label out that gon’ find you and want to sign you
Write your rhymes in the shower, you’re washed up
If there was a law against wack shit, you'd be locked up
These cats in the game pretend that they your friend
But as soon as you walk away, they talkin’ ‘bout you again
Half your old group don't like you and want to fight you
And even made songs about you to try to spite you
Big Beat dropped you and said that you can't sell
And they ain't had a hit since before Pac was in jail
It's like the shit’s up under your nose and you can't smell
Hell, you probably older than Blu Cantrell
You can't tell? It's over, capital O-V-E-R
And that's just in case you can't spell, c'mon
[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, what a day it’s been (Trust me, I know what I’m talkin’ about)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (You need to give it up, ‘kay? It’s over)
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should have been (It’s not ‘88, ‘89 no more)
For goodness’ sake, what's happening to me? (Oh you prayin’ now?)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Yeah I heard all of your prayers but I doubt that God got 'em
So break out the suits and ties and the hard bottoms
And get yourself a job with a desk in a nice office
And learn to enjoy all of the garbage that life offers
And don't ever again show your face on a stage
Or write the name Masta Ace on a page, kid ya done
Whoever let you back in the door should get a smack in the jaw
‘Cause you sure shouldn't be rappin’ no more
You already proved that at the Lyricist Lounge affair
Tryin’ to battle with rhymes you wrote on the way there
Maybe next time you'll know not to play fair
Say your best written shit and school 'em like daycare
But through the sad mess and all of the bad press
I can't recall a time in the past when you had less
Ain't nobody out there gon' keep it realer than me
We one in the same, sincerely, your diary

[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, (Stupid, man) what a day it’s been (What’s wrong with you?)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Psh, let these cats gas you up)
Woke up too late, (Thinkin’ you could put another record out) wasn't where I should have been
For goodness’ sake, (Sad, man) what's happening to me? (Start a family and move somewhere, get a job or something)
Dear diary, what a day it’s been
Dear diary, (Probably checkin’ for your ass) it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, (You gon’ waste all these people’s money) wasn't where I should have been (You ain’t gettin’ no video)
For goodness’ sake, what's happening to me? (It’s over)You might also like1Embed
