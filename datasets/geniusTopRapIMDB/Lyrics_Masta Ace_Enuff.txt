Enuff LyricsYeah, from BK to the world. I've had enough

[Verse 1 - Masta Ace]
Nowadays, a range ain't big enough, Moschino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out but my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough, label said it's not enough
Singing in the hook, I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't cost enough, and I still ain't lost enough
Money on these chickens that said I don't floss enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough about crack sales and jails
Y'all feeling me like braille, well I still got no sales
Must ain't sold enough, cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was "Born 2 Roll", they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't West Coast enough
But that's fine cause I'mma focus on mine
I'm hoping that 2009 is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game's a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers
[Hook x4: Mr. Lee Gee]
Somebody, tell me what the deal is *I had enough*
Niggas got to know it's for real

[Verse 2 - Masta Ace]
Niggas only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface, nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough, we gon' start calling your bluff
Watching your moves, we gon' be all in your stuff
Fuck around and come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price, niggas is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggas ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, know what stress is
Project girls rock vests, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire get burned
Enough dough get made, none of it earned
Enough wilding, fuck that yo, enough smiling
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough Tecs
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Masta Ace]
Enough of this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations said enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggas on it
When we in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggas from the Brook', look
Enough cats crack Mo's and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers are lost entertainers
Get found on Billboard's greatest sale gainers
Enough Beems and Benz, enough fly honies with dime friends
That want to juice you for your ends
It's getting rough, whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime dog, like McGruff, enough's enough
