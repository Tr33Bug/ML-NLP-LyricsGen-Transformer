Here I Go Again Lyrics[Intro: Jamelle Brundy] (Edo G) (*DJ Scratching)
Here I go (Uh huh) A (Yeah) Gain (Here we go) (*Here we go!)

[Verse One: Edo G]
Yo! This track really reminds me
Of when I got my deal in 1990
Moms wasn't behind me didn't take too kindly
I had to find me so I came in blindly
Got a contract to buy me
Ted got the demo hade Mercury sign me
Hip Hop became a part of
I Got To Have It, Bug-A-Boo, Be A Father
See I went for mine, next album Roxbury 02119
Yeah! It didn't sell as well
People started sayin they could tell I fell
Third album was comin out sloppy
All of a sudden, Mercury dropped me
It felt like my world ended
Until I found the blessings of independence
Life could bust your bubble
It's a everyday grind and a constant struggle
Bam! I got hit with the target
With Masta Ace, a new project, here I go
[Hook: Jamelle Brundy] (DJ Scratching)
Here I go, a-gain! (Here we go!)

[Verse Two: Masta Ace]
Been on a road to success from the very beginning
Saw everyone around me was steadily winnin
I was in the driver's seat, but I lost control
Now it's time to take a shit or get up off the bowl
I mean the mortage due, tuition from my daughter's school
Gotta be in before August 2
I still wanna fight, but it don't seem right
It's like, why wage ya battle when the war is through?
I know where I'm goin but that place is far
Kinda feel like the dog tryna chase the car
No matter how fast I run, I'll never catch it
And that reality I gotta face tommorow
Most times I feel like, "What is the use?"
I got a good mind, I should put it to use
My transit score was the open proof
But I don't wanna be the man in the token booth
Or the man sayin, "Watch the, closing doors"
And give up his live full of shows and tours
I know a lotta niggas sellin real estate
But if I did, then I wouldn't really feel as great
This time truly I'm torn
Cause my wife want that brand new Louis Vutton
And I just got a call, to do anohter show
Damn, once again, here I go

Here I go, a-gain! (Here we go!)

[Verse Three: Jamelle Brundy]
I've been doin this since I was a little girl
This music thing it's like my whole world
It's what I love fo' sure
But it's so damn hard to kick down them doors
But I HUSTLE! Cause I want it, gotta STRUGGLE if you want it
Cause can't nobody keep my man down
My passion gonna keep me around
Ridin, tourin, studio, anything to keep my mind flow so

[Hook: Jamelle Brundy]
Here I go (HEEREEE!!!!) a-gain! (Here I go!!!)
