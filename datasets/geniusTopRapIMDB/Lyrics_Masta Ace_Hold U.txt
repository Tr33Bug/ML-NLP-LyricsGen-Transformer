Hold U Lyrics[Intro: Masta Ace]
If the way I hold you
If the way I hold you
If the way I hold you
If the way I hold you (Yeah)
If the way I hold you (Yeah)
If the way I hold you (Yeah)
If the way I hold you (Lemme talk to you)

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I will never forget the day that we first met
I wasn't even feeling you then, but worse yet
I was all up in the mix with one of your friends
And when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
Like if I only knew what I was missing
I would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
I really thought you and my man was a better match
I never thought you was the type that I could catch
I used to see you out in the park with different cats
Them Big Willie types that rocked them pimp hats
Had every other guy on the block trying to get you
Wishing that they had that rap to get with you
Felt you was out of my league
It's like if you was silk and linen, then I was fatigue
I never would have pictured you and me together
But it's like the way I hold you we was meant to be together, come on
[Chorus: Masta Ace]
The way I hold you, it feels so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
Can't see you with nobody else
I just really had to let you know
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Now I spend most of my time just being with you
Early on, I was afraid to be seen with you
'Cause I knew cats would do anything they could
To stop us from being together, it's all good
They was mad 'cause I got you and they didn't
Some even tried to approach me, I'm not kidding
Had to be ten times I got into a fight
With niggas tryin' to say I wasn't hitting it right
Yup, they kept on hating, just kept on waiting
Hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
Never knew it'd be so hard to be with you
I should make it easy on myself and just quit you
(Make it easy on yourself) I need to make it easy on myself
Yup, I need to make it easy on myself
(Make it easy on yourself) Yup, I need to make it easy on myself
Yup, and just leave you alone (No, wait)
No, wait, when I hold you, it feels so great
I realize and recognize that you my soulmate
It's us forever, had to let you know
Just like I told you, I'ma hold you, never let you go, come on

The way I hold you, it feels so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
Can't see you with nobody else
I just really had to let you know
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you (One, two, check it)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
You should have known from way back I tried to amp you
Tried to speak on your skills when other niggas felt me
But you know that if you wasn't with me, they can't even hear you right
And if you tried to snatch me up, it'd probably turn into a fight (Uh-huh)
I been through my phases with cats and chicks
I know you seen me chilling with fake players
Who tried to grab me in the club and dance with me on the stage in gators (Wack)
They say you just hating, you jelly off the money that they making
Peep the stripper broads, thugs and gods and punks
Cats would front, get me high with all the smoke from the blunts
It's not love, it's just lust
They always put me down when shit gets rough
I can't do it alone, I need someone to hold me right, tell me their feelings
Speak on us to they boys, that's why we dealing (Uh)
Niggas starting rumors like we ain't chilling or split up
When you've been writing poems for me just to shut they lip up
And there's still cats who try to touch me when they spot me alone
Tryin' to tap me just to see if I'm turned on
But it's the way you speak to me, it's like we on the same frequency
And when you hold me, you make peak, come on
[Chorus: Masta Ace]
The way I hold you, it feels so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
Can't see you with nobody else
I just really had to let you know
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you

[Outro: Masta Ace]
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you2Embed
