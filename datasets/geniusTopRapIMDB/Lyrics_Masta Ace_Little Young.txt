Little Young Lyrics[Intro: Excerpt from New Jack City]
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you Nino Brown says
"Your services are no longer needed in the community"

[Edo G]
A&E!!! Uh! Uh huh! A&E yeah! Hey! Yo! Hey! Yo!

[Verse One: Edo G]
Barack Obama, we need change
How many rappers in the game have little in front of their name?
Lil' Wayne, Lil' Boosie it's a lil' shame
Lil' Flip, Lil' Cease yo they not the same
Lil' Wyte, Lil' Mama, where Lil' Zane?
Little Brother, Lil' Jon, and Lil' Fame
Real hip hop, not about your lil' chain
Lil' Keke, Lil' Kim a lil' freaky
Lil' Fizz, Illegal with Lil' Maliky
Lil' Mo, Lil' Bow Wow had beef with Lil' Romeo
A lil' teenager told me so
Lil' Scrappy, keep my head a lil' nappy
A lil' bit cause I talk a lil' shit
You gettin half bread
Unlike that rapper Lil' 1/2 Dead, you lil' bastards
Your lil' rhymes and lil' lines they fillin in
Big Ed O, lil' rappers I'm belittlin
There's Lil' Young, I'm admittin you a lil' young
Big mouth like Whodini for your lil' tongue
Hey rappers now where's your lil' gun?
[Hook: Masta Ace] (Edo G)
Understand where I'm comin from?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(UH HUH! UH HUH!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!) That's cause you a little young
Understand what I'm sayin son?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(OK! OK!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!) Boy you a little young

[Verse Two: Masta Ace]
Yo, I wonder after all these years and all the fame over
As a young emcee, could I take the game over?
I'll sign with Young Money, get rich dumb easy
Young boys get, put on like Young Jeezy (YEAAAH)
Up in the club, it's so gung-ho
Makin it rain, I'mma hang with Yung Joc and Young Dro
Up in the VIP, wit some young girl
Wearin them young clothes, Hey Young World
You got Yung Hot, Yung Berg, and Young City
He from "Making the Band", used to run with Sean Diddy (take dat!)
Remember Youngstas? Now we got Yungstar
Too young to buy a drink, drive they own car
You got Young Buck, Young B, and Young Tay (who?)
I'll play Andre Young instead of Young Dre (Dr.)
It's no subliminal diss but, someone'll find it
You say Young Chris, I'm thinkin 'bout "Criminal Minded"
