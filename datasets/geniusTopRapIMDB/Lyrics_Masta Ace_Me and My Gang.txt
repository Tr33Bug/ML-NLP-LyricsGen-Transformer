Me and My Gang Lyrics[Intro]
Get me another beer man
Yo I can't even believe it, you seen that donkey donk?
Some shit man
Ey yo, you ever had that, uh, Jolly Rancher?
.. you ever had that watermelon one?
Yeah, that got pork in it
It got pork in it?
Yeah
Yo I didn't even know I thought it was only the..
Yellow number 7
Wow I thought that was only Hawaiian Punch
I might head to courts though man, some dudes out there be playin' ball so I might head to the courts
Don't scuff up ya Chucks, brother
[Verse 1]
Ey, yo, I hang on the corner with the strangest gang
And we don't want no trouble we just came to hang
Maybe sip a little something and shoot the breeze
Some of us high on life, others use the trees
No bloods no Crips, no guns no clips
Just a bunch of fellas running off at the lips
Cause hanging with your friends be the thing to do
Let me see if I can explain my gang to you
Now first we got Eâ€“one of them crazy brothers
Got ten kids by ten different baby mothers
And another on the way, did you get that cousin?
Hope he get that snip snip 'fore he get that dozen
Then we got Lionel who drives a cab
And every female customer he tries to bag
He dun had a couple sessions on them vinyl seats
You won't believe some of the freaks that Lionel meets
Then we got E L who drives a TL, Acura
He's really a DT on the DL
Sometime it's cool being cool with pol-i
I even got a PBA card my dude, no lie
Then we got Kurt he do postal work
And it seem like he think he ain't supposed to work
Cause the line be out the door down the block so long
While he take another smoke break and talk on the phone
My gang

It's me and my gang, me and my gang
Standing on the corner and we came to do our thang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
And we don't want no trouble we just came here to hang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
Standing on the corner and we came to do our thang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
And I don't want no trouble I just came here to hang, with my gang

[Verse 2]
That's big Ox and listen, this the deal
You can tell from his appearance he ain't missed a meal
See he once had a tryout as a New York Jet
But he spent his little cheque and bought a new Corvette
And then there's Brad, he's a college grad
Book smarts are great, street knowledge bad
He had a 4 point oh in a four year span
But he stayed getting scammed by the bootleg man
And that's Bud, perfect name indeed
Cause he really loves beer, it's the same with weed
And he likes that nutrition that packs a punch
For breakfast, two blunts, a six pack for lunch
Opposite of him is Malik Jamal
Who don't eat smoke drink or eat meat at all
He be preaching every night about eating right
While he sip a cup of coffee puff a newport light
My gang
[Hook]
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
Standing on the corner and we came to do our thang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
And we don't want no trouble we just came here to hang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
Standing on the corner and we came to do our thang
It's me and my gang, me and my gang
And I don't want no trouble I just came here to hang, with my gang1Embed
