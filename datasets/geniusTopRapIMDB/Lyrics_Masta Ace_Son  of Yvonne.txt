Son  of Yvonne Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was born, son of Yvonne
Brownsville kid that wanna be on
Hit the streets run an be gone
Outside with a curfew
Got lessons on honesty and virtue
And the people that'll hurt you
Drug addicts, ex-convicts
Living in a world surrounded by these conflicts
So many too many to mention
You can feel all the tension
A mom’s intervention
Tryn'na save her son from the worse fate
Getting home after 8 when she works late
Thank god for nana, I was in her control
In the lobby, sitting on tenant patrol
Cause folks getting robbed on a regular
By chain snatching dudes, just in it for gold
Son of Yvonne had a fight up the street
He’s a nice kid, but ain’t nothing sweet
[Chorus]
All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born
But I’m glad to be the son of Yvonne

[Verse 2]
Son of Yvonne, better get the best grades
Couple of B’s, a C and the rest A’s
Not top of the class, but not nearly last
I beat your ass if you think you gon' barely pass
But all my best friends, they be ditching school
Every week is like a Friday ritual
You got a mind of your own, so let it be known
Son of Yvonne, sharp as a kitchen tool

[Chorus]
All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born
But I’m glad to be the son of Yvonne

All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born
But I’m glad to be the son of Yvonne

I was born, son of Yvonne
Grand son of Ethie Claire
Heard you rap now
Duval, let me hear
I get pissed and leave
Nana upstairs, making sweet potato pie
Cause it’s Christmas Eve
Under the tree, afx racing track
Pick up a gift, shake it, then place it back
I wonder what it is, instead of taking a guess
Next morning, open gifts, making a mess
Nana always sits in the same chair
Jackson 5, singing Rudolf the reindeer
In the background, I go upstairs
To see what Mike got
Then I come back down, to enjoy all
Nana good cooking
Life in the hood Brooklyn good looking
Son of Yvonne, Brownsville born and bread
And like that quilt, nana got on the bed
I’m a bunch of things, all sown together
To make one man, that'll be known forever

[Chorus]
All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born
But I’m glad to be the son of Yvonne
All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born
But I’m glad to be the son of Yvonne8Embed
