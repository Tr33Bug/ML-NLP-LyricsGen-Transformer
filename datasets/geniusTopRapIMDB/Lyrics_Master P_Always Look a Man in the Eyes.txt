Always Look a Man in the Eyes Lyrics[Intro]
If we was owned by the white folks it will be all good
But we independent, black owned and making scrilla
We a threat to society
They ban our movies our videos, but we still #1 in America
You see a coward can talk shit behind a nigga back
But only a man can tell you what's on his mind
When he look you in the eyes
In other words, don't judge a book by its cover
See we successful black businessmen
But we also mercenary soldiers
[Chorus]
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug seller

[Verse 1: Master P]
I sell stones out, I'm breaking them got damn phones up
Niggas they popping them keys, Master P he fucking [?]
Besides them g's, I'm [?] them keys but they didn't know
That I could go gold
Platinum and still slang keys out the record store
This caine got me sick
These niggas they talking that shit
Don't make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit
I caught the game from some old g's
Niggas they slanging they fucking keys
Got the game from New Orleans
Now the world know of me
I'm down south hustling from the west
To the east, in the midwest yeah ya'll niggas know of me
Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world
Every woman, man and boy wrap these cd's up like furls
On the corner posted up with them ballers
Slanging that yella, niggas ya'll can't hold us
Gone for 15/5 when you see me its no drought
I'm the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth
Got every fucking club bout it bout it
Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy
Cause I'm down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map
Independent, black owned and ain't scared to bust no caps
You might also like[Chorus]
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Nigga tell me what you gone do
It's just me and you, you and I
Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano
If we did the mix
Flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering
Fludging
Tell your fucking boys don't move
Cause like a rug I got them covered
Niggas ain't like they used to be
Back in the days they were playing the dozens
These days niggas will kill ya
Talking shit, say it to the end of my muzzle
We don't want no trouble, black just as subtle
Tell you what you gone fuck around and find
If you disrespect my hustle
None of you niggas fuckers, young niggas fuckable
Some niggas [?], dumb niggas suffer
Before you can even think about making a move I'm already on it
I'll have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only
Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling
The interference started from the ground up the building
Behind mine's I just don't give a fuck
Ain't no closing my eyes
I'm gone look in your face and tear your ass up
[Chorus]
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer

[Verse 3: Silkk]
Aaahh it's murder
Do or die, killed or be killed
Nigga who am I
Silkk the Shocker, do or die for a mil
Don't you see I be counting money like a machine
No how I'm saying I got to buy my green
For every fiend equals money like ching ching
My dream, know what I'm saying, got to get the cream or triple beam
By it for 15/5 and I sell it for 18
You know what I'm saying, you know what a nigga like known for
Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one
You know what we known for
And its all good in the hood, but I still stay strapped
Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack
And you know how I'm saying, 4 g's and I run it
Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game, until I done it
And its cool I gotta reach eight digits
Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him
Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him

[Chorus]
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealerEmbed
