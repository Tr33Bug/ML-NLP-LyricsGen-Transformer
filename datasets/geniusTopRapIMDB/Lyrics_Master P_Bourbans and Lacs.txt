Bourbans and ’Lacs Lyrics[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin' in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps, and macks
With the Benz, makin' ends, I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin' in the back
This is for the players smokin' doolamac
Slappin' skins, makin' dividends and riding strapped

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhh) wood grain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin' on that doja
Four niggas in the back screamin', "No Limit soldiers!"
True to the gizzame
Stopped in the projects, sold a half an ounce of cocaine
Hit interstate ten, to Texas
Listening to DJ Screw, just raced a Lexus
Called up Pimp C
Did a song last week with my nigga Bun B
Twistin' on some green spinach
And niggas still trippin', I ain't dead, I'm still in it
[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin' in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps, and macks
With the Benz, makin' ends and them paper stacks

[Silkk the Shocker]
See pockets full of dollars already stacked
So I'm gangsta leaning sideways
Today ain't Friday
Ten it is and today is my day
Take it from mister hundred spoke rider
Cadillac Suburban driver, pussy diver
Push the Glock inside when I'm ridin'
Flossin' down the block
Holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word, swerve
To the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him
I said, "Bitch, can't tell I'm off?"
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block
Dropped the top 'cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes
At the sideshow, abouts to plot
Hittin' donuts, you know I’m actin', a straight-up menace
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there
'Cause there was a cloud of smoke when I was finished
I seen 5-0, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all 'cause I gotta 185
In the hood and you know they can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that Glock 40 up on the dashboard
You never know who might try me
This is for the playas
You might also like[Mo B. Dick]
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Bourbons and 'Lacs, mansions and bitches, money and weed
A made life is all I dream
Paper chasin' for that green
I'm thuggin' on the scene, nigga
Whatcha don't believe? Well check the credentials, they'll tell ya
A nigga's livin' presidential
I'm on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought I'd get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mil
For real, I'm slangin' platinum shit until I'm old and ill
Lil' Gotti, I'm gonna make you feel what I say, I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay, smoke some hay
I wouldn't have that shit no other way
The made life, the game tight
No Limit for life
