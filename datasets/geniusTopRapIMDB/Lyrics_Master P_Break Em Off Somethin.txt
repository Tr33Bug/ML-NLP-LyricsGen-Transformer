Break ‘Em Off Somethin’ Lyrics[Intro: Master P]
Boy, we about to fill they motherfucking head up with this ghetto dope
Time to break these hoes off somethin'
Got my niggas Bun B., Pimp C, I mean U.G.K
Done hooked up with Master P
We about to bring this shit across the border
Ya heard me, from Texas to New Orleans

[Verse 1: Master P]
Hustler, baller, gangsta, cap-peeler
Who I be, your neighborhood drug dealer
A young nigga thats 'bout it
I mean these No Limit Soldiers, we get rowdy
I got somethin' for y'all haters (somethin' for y'all hater), y'all can't fade us
Ghetto cheese and drug deals that's what's made us
Now I'm space-aged pimpin' but not Eightball
Don't make me get stupid and leave your fuckin' blood on the wall
'Bout to go psycho, and load this rifle
I'm from the projects where we all think alike though
And killin' ain't nothin' but a hobby
Don't make me do a fuckin' 1-8-7 robbery
And like some brand new Jordans, you tied up
You sound like a chicken so it's time to get plucked
By a gangsta, keep one up in the chamber
Don't make me wear your ass like some '85 Wranglers
Now you all screwed up like DJ Screw
Don't have my money, nigga fuck you and your boo
Got amphetamines for them dope fiends
Where I'm from a little town called New Orleans
But blowin' up like B-12
Niggas don't give a fuck 'cause they quick to send your ass to hell
The murder capital of the world
Where niggas don't give a fuck about you, your boy, or your girl
And if you come stuntin' on them gold thangs
I'mma have to break you off somethin'
[Chorus: Master P]
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Let me set the shit straight, let me lay down the rules
If a bitch is talkin' shit, then that bitch gonna have to snooze
Pimp C bitch now what the fuck you said
AK hit the wall tore the stuffin' out the fuckin, bed
I'm lookin' at dead, I'm fully auto
Tommorow I got court, I ain't gonna go
Nigga owe me money, thinkin' it's funny, bought a 64'
I'm 'bout to pull a kickdoe
I need mo money money, mo money money
Took the keys, took the cheese, and fucked his main hunny, hunny
Now the game is escalated, 'cause ain't no witnesses
To go back and tell the Po-Po's all the shit we did
I'm lookin' at rape, I'm lookin' at kidnap
But when them bitches get here you gonna be full of hot caps
I'm breakin' them bitches off, putting 'em in the trunk
Ridin' around P.A bout-it hostages blowin' skunk
'Cause gettin' rid of enemies to me ain't really nothin' nothin'
Pimp C bitch 14-96'll break you off somethin'
You might also like[Chorus: Master P]
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'

[Verse 3: Bun B]
We comin' down like a sail, in that goddamn rover
Just when you thought it was the beginnin' you bitch, now it's over
You can call on the cavalry, reinforcements, and your local P-D
They gettin' somewhere if they see me
My nigga that's how these G's be we three, me, C and Master P
Sippin' on Gin and Kiwi
Fuck poppin' in your CD, bitch we poppin' in them clips
And now we all up in your grill live in 3-D
With drama, disaster, and death when you make me have to blast ya'
Y'all has to recognize you fuckin' with murder masters
Who plaster your ass and make your momma call a pastor
Dyin' faster than you thought, now that's your ass bro
It's the class of 9 scrilla on the for real'a
Direct from the villa of killas, now who thinkin' they trilla'
Watch me fill a wanna be cap-peeler with them slugs
Probably for jaw-jackin' and jumpin'
Bitch don't make me break you off somethin'
Nigga
[Chorus: Master P]
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'

[Outro: Master P]
And for all y'all motherfuckin'
Niggas that's rappin' about niggas on records
Real niggas don't rap about niggas on records
Y'all hoes
And hoes talk shit
Niggas know who the real fuckin' Ice Cream Man is
'Cause broke niggas talk shit
I could never talk about a nigga on a record
You heard?
It's No Limit for life
Any nigga run up
Gettin' his motherfuckin' wig twisted
Ha ha, you heard?
Don't make me break you off somethin'1Embed
