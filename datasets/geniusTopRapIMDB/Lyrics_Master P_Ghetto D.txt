Ghetto D Lyrics(*water bubbling*)
(*voice in background repeating "make crack like this"*)

[Intro: Master P]
Imagine substituting crack for music
I mean dope tapes, this is how we would make it
(There it is right there)
For all you players, hustlers, ballers and even you smokers
("Ma-ma-ma-ma-make crack like this")
Ghetto Dope, No Limit Records
("Ma-ma-ma-ma-make crack like this")
Part of the Tobacco, Firearms, and Freedom of Speech Committee
Thank you dope fiends for your support, ha ha
[Verse 1: C-Murder]
Let me give a shoutout to the D Boys (drug dealers)
Neighborhood dope man, I mean real niggas
That'll make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Ain't got a dime, but'll ride to pay the rent
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the task
C-Murder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten, ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit be cooked wrong
Overcook yo' dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine
One - look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
Two - no buying from no nigga that you don't know
Make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You get the baking soda, I gots tha D
And get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it bubble up and get harder
Then sit the tube in some ready-made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit rock and rise to the fuckin' top
And now your cocaine powder is crack
Now hope you're strapped 'cause you might get jacked
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
My phone rang I picked it up
(Need some weight)
What you need
(Silkk bout a coupla cakes)
I had it all in powder but it ain't no thang
Gimme a coupla hours I have it all in a caine
Trust nobody but my guns and god, ask Mac and Kane & Abel
You probably catch me choppin "d" choppin ki's up on my mom's table
I got a big order for some coke
I called some hoes up
I want ya'll but naked while you cookin up my dope
I told ya'll we some Tru G's
See me and P and C
In Expeditions with uzi's
Breakin' down two ki's
Baby that's twenty-four oz's a piece
'Cause see if it ain't about money
Then it ain't about me
Hella mail from sales
Hella ya-yo for scales
Come up short on my money I'm jumpin yo ass like bail
First of all you gotta have nuts
Don't give a fuck
'Cause when I bust niggas duck
'Cause they know if I miss it ain't by much
Then pick up a Glock that hold 'bout seventeen
A coupla dope fiends
Some oz's
A triple beam
And then playa hit yo block
And tell the biggest nigga to raise up off the spot befo he get got
And I get rowdy That's why I acts like this
But I still rides rims and them gold D's (Ma Ma Make Crack like this)
'Cause I sold crack like this
[Chorus]
Ghett-ghett-ghetto dope
Ma-ma-ma-ma-make crack like this (Ghett-ghetto dope)

[Verse 3: Master P]
Nigga, nigga never let a nigga front you no dizzope
Start from the ground, work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team, keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short, you better get rowdy
Kick down doors, show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break ki's down to oz's
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda, use B-12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
'Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
'Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yo'self to an Uzi
The first hit for free (damn)
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty G's
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy, that's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
'Cause legal money last longer than drug money

[Chorus]
