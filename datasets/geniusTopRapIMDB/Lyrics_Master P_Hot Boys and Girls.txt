Hot Boys and Girls Lyrics[Master P]
Uhhhhhh, ha ha
Where the real niggas at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
Where the real bitches at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
Where the real niggas at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
Where the real bitches at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
Where the real niggas at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
[Mystikal]
Nigga, I'm the buzz in your weed and the bubbles in your beer
M-Y-S-T-I-kal Its the man right chea
I ain't the '90 through the '94 Buffallo Bills
I ain't Dennis Rodman's hair and I ain't Holyfield's ear
I ain't that damn man to see the Sandman at the Apollo
I ain't that 298 dollar 60 cent check from McDonald's
Bitch I'm the line through the "t" and the dot on the "i"
I'm the motherfuckin' crocodile tears when you cry
I'm the lightning in bad weather!
I'm that nigga in that picture on your girlfriend dresser
I ain't no ho, I ain't no punk, I ain't no bitch, I ain't no fag
I ain't no sucker, I ain't no trick, I ain't no snitch, I ain't no rat
I'm that $20,000 a pop every stop when I'm tourin'
I'm that "FIRE!" on that last verse of "Make 'Em Say UHHH!"
I ain't that same ol' same, ordinary, everyday rapper
Bitch, I killed Kenny, SO I GUESS I'm THAT BASTARD!

[Master P]
Where the hot boys at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there
Where the hot girls at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there, over there, over there x2

I'm the bitch that say bring it on if you want to
From the city where we known, baby for what we goin do
I'm the lady alligator so you c-calm in that water
I'm the migrane in your head thumpin' harder and harder
I'm the floss hard ho nigga that cocks the squat
Dead smack on your face like that infrared dot
I'm the index finger on the trigger, don't move
Woops, saw you blink your eyes now you goin make the news
If I catch you in the club and you start to trippin
I'm the fist in brass knuckles that's goin hit your chin
All the snitchers sitting down with the feds to yap
I'm the loud hard chhh on the rat trap
I'm the drama in your heart when your people get killed
I'm the feeling in your stomach when you get your last meal
I'm the hardcore undisputed hip-hop diva
I'm the lady on report card day I'm Mama Mia

[Master P]
Where the real niggas at
Where they at, where they at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there
Where the real bitches at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there
Where they at, where they at
[Silkk The Shocker]
Ahhhhhhh!
I'm the past that always seems to come back and haunt ya
I'm the four five carrier, mister grenade launcher
I'm the nigga with the gun, that be askin' where the dollars at
I'm the nigga with the six hundred everybody's tryin to holler at
I be the bookie that you pay niggas to keep off your ass
I be the reason why you didn't pass, the reason why you cut class
I be the reason why they buried ya, and carried ya
I be the nigga that put the wood in your fiance
The reason why she didn't marry ya
I be the nigga they try to keep from around, hanging around your sister
I be the nigga they call Silkk The Shocker, you might call me MISTER!
Now I got a mob ties, I'm a ghetto wise guy
Military minding, on the front lines, always pull off the drive bys
Case over like the last song, like all the cash gone
Heir to the throne, cause I'm the little brother of the last don
Little bitch can't mix, flip shit, loose lips sink ships
Plus I gotta pair of cement shoes, I can make fit, your a fake bitch
Keep my ice wrist, keep her tight bitch, between the trigger
Keep a tight grip, infrared on my shit so I don't miss
Now I'm that razor that cuts the dope, the newest member of the 504
Member the one they call Vito, yeah that's me (you know)

[Master P]
Where the hot boys at
Where they at, where they at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there
Where the hot girls at
Where they at, where they at
Right chea, right chea
Over there, over there

[Kane & Abel]
I'm the enemy behind, so watch your back
When the live brown hit the chamber, I'm the click clack
When you run, I'm the danger, I'm the smack and the pimp slap
I'm the shit that bubble up when you cook that crack
The nigga that fucked up the party when I pull my strap
The nigga that fucked all the hoes y'all be trying to mack
I was scarface, sniffing with his nose in coke
The nigga that taught your little brother
How to cook that dope (Kane & Abel)
The first nigga on the block that make your momma deep throat
Iâ€™m the hustlin' ass nigga with the watches and the coat

[Master P]
Where the real niggas at
Where they at, where they at
Where the real bitches at
Where they at, where they at
Where the hot boys at
Where they at, where they at
Where the hot girls at
Where they at, where they at
Where they at, where they at, where they at, where they at
Where the hot boys at
Where the hot girls at

[Master P]
I'm the bars on your cell, I'm the fire down in hell
I'm the ice cream bells, I'm the gas you pump at shell
Nigga, I'm the wheels on the tank, ha ha
I'm the million dollars that you want from the bank
I'm a diamond on a ring, I'm your brains when you think
I'm your bartender when you drink, I'm OJ without the shank
Nigga, I'm the M in fuckin mob (mob)
I'm the clothes that you wear when you wanna jump shot
I'm the super in dome, I'm the C in chrome
I'm the hurricane that knock down your motherfucking home
I'm the K in killer, I'm the D in drug dealer
I'm the G in gangsta nigga, I'm the realest nigga
That you ever wanna meet when you walking on the street
I'm the gold on your teeth, I'm the nike's on your feet
I'm the nigga that moan when he rap (uhhhhhhhhh)
I'm the nigga that ran through your fucking hood and bust caps
I'm the nigga with these rhymes, I'm the last don
And I'm a end this motherfucker cause it ain't no more time2Embed
