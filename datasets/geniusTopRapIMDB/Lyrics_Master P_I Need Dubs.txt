I Need Dubs Lyrics{*set to an instrumental like LL Cool J's "I Need Love*}

[Master P]
When I'm alone in my car, I'm thinkin about Ms. Lorenzo
My girl Enkei, Sprewell
Giovanna, Daytons, Momos, Diablos
And my girl Asanti

[Hook: Master P]
I need dubs, when I ride to the club
Cruisin with my girls even rollin with thugs
I need dubs, 22's, 24's
Shinin in the hood I'm the king of the car shows
Dubs, when I ride to the club
Cruisin with my girls even rollin with thugs
I need dubs, 22's, 24's
Shinin in the hood I'm the king of the car shows
[Master P]
I see it I buy it, you need it I got it
I could transform a car 'til a Halle Berry by demand
Regular wheels, I bend 'em don't stand up
I'm the first one to put Sprewells on a Phantom
Girls see me and scream, I'm reppin Orleans
I got cars baby Flex ain't never seen
Xzibit in the game but he can't "Pimp My Ride"
I got everythang flipped from the in to the outside
Them Lambord golds 50 talkin about
I had 'em on the Cutlass back before I bought me a house
I put ice on my grill just to hurt them haters
27 dipped in chrome for the Escalades
Put candy on the body so it glow in the dark
Put light on my rims for at night when they walk
Can't roll like no scrub, man on no hubs
Ghetto Bill up in here, y'all know whassup

[Hook]

[Master P]
From the streets to the pen, you know these soldiers gon' win
When they see me on TV say he did it again
From his shoes to his clothes, he's ballin outta control
From the Bentley to the Beemer to the Hummer with six golds
But wodie don't stunt, make them six-fo's jump
Like Reebok pumps, P. Miller amp's in the trunk
Louis Vuitton Ferrari 360 is so clean
Asanti rims, that really bling bling
And girls trip when they get in the ride
I got the CL5 steering wheel on the other side
And I'm gangsta man, what you thankin man?
Shorty wanna roll cause I'm on them twankies man

Now I know I'm kinda young but I keep my dubs clean
Nicknamed my rims Demi cause they older than me
At the age of 15 man, doin big thangs man
Don't hate dawg, cause you ain't me man
Some say I'm ballin cause my chrome stay crawlin
Took the Phantom for a ride, now they say I'm nightcrawlin
Never get hongry cause I keep them deep dishes
The peoples just ahhh, then they take pictures
My Hummer sit clean on them Shaq's minus eight
White gold and purple just like them old days
Now it's kinda crazy cause Mercedes get me jealous
Range on Asantis, but they can't have it
All for Lexus, my baby, my boo
If I ever need help I just scream HOOTIE HOO
My P. Miller speakers match my P. Miller sneakers
The ones on my feet and the ones on my Beemer
