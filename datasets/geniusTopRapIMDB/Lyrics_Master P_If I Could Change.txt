If I Could Change Lyrics[Chorus: Master P]
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change

[Verse 1: Crooked Eye]
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga's ready to change
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this game
Feel like I'm trapped in a prison, slowly waiting to die
It's getting harder for my people, yet we don't know why
They cutting sisters off welfare, these kids can't eat
And it's the children like [?] turned out by the street
I couldn't see it while I was outside slinging my rocks
Serving death to my people, committing the ultimate evil
Robbing and killing my own kind, Lord forgive me
Blinded by this life of crime, God, somebody hear me
Since the death of my mama, my life been filled with drama
Lost both of my kids, punished for dirt that I did
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget
All the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game
Steady checking myself, God, help me to change
[Chorus: Master P]
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change

[Verse 2: Billy Bavgate]
If I could change, I'd bring my mama back from the grave
I ain't got too much coming, cause we living in the last days
Crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these days
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress
Jealous fools of the world trying to put me to rest
Last night I had a talk with my mama
Then I cried, asking god did she serve her purpose before she died
You can see it in my eyes, a brother want to slow down
I ain't mad at you daddy, 'cause you didn't come around
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it
You see the opportunity, you take it
But what about my little baby?
I got a mouth to feed but I still want to hang in the streets
And smoke weed with the O.G.'s
My homies rest in peace in the game
I don't think you even know the pain in me
I want to change
You might also like[Chorus: Master P]
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change

[Verse 3: Master P]
Lord knows, picture me balling
Trapped in this ghetto with my young G's calling
Hennessy and weed when they bury P
A quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me
Fall on my knees to no nigga
Trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigger
Never had a pops, a nigga learned to sling cream
Should have been a chemist, the way I work a triple beam
Life is like a page I want to turn
I want to make a change but Lord you let my brother burn
I done seen a nigga lose his life over [?] stones
Every night, my auntie bring a nigga home
Mama worries cause the rent late
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate
I sent him Camels with no filters
I'm in the ghetto slinging stones with straight killers, uh!
I know kids that pack gats 'cause they 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep
Cause your best friend turned into your enemy
Crooked cops is dirty in this shady game
God, take me out the ghetto, I want to make a change
[Chorus: Master P]
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I get a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change
Fast living got me trapped in this street game
Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a changeEmbed
