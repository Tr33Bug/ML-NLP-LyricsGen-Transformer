Lets Get Em Lyrics[Master P/C-Murder]
Chorus
Where them niggas at
Where them niggas at
There them niggas go
[Master P]
Uhhhhh
Fuck it, let's get em x4

[C-Murder]
I'm a motherfucking soldier
Bitch I thought I told ya, I smoke your ass like doja
Niggas mad cause my tapes selling like crack
Sold a million records, not one disc came back
You know, I gotta repre fuckin sent
My ghetto niggas got me getting paid like the president
But TRU niggas don't yap about it (yap about it)
But when I do some gangsta shit, you know I gotta rap about it
I left the dope on the motherfucking table
The feds mad cause we the number one rap label
No Limit records made history in this bitch
And it's a myth on how ghetto niggas getting rich
The whole world say they bout it bout it
I drop this ghetto shit, and get my thug niggas rowdy
My tank dogs coming through, where them niggas at
Ready to hit em, P, pass me them thangs, let me get em
Chorus x4

[Magic]
P man, pass me them thangs and let me get em
I be damned if I don't kill a nigga
They shouldn't be fuckin with ya
They don't respect a fucking soldier
They gonna roll or get rolled over, or get fucked over
Now I may be the first to go with, but you best believe
Thirty niggas came out here to get us, thirty niggas gonna bleed
I'm here to protect and serve my tank dogs
And any nigga that fuck with us
Colonel, get ready to go to war, I'm hitting hard
A made nigga, that's why they call me mister Magic
Busting that niggas that try it, Magic and laugh
I'm military minding, I don't second guess
Click clack blast, erasing niggas, it's all bad

Chorus x4

[Master P]
Nigga I ride for scrilla, hang with dealers
Daddy wasn't home so I rode with them killers
And thug niggas high off hennesey and weed
Tatoos and oz's, invested in CD's
Now the feds wanna see me dead
Independent, black owned and teaching other niggas how to get paid
Ran with some gangs, bank for some change
Third ward niggas don't play no fucking games
Me and Silkk, C-Murder, we killers
Plus Magic together, a world of TRU niggas
Taking over this rap game
It's No Limit for life, lights out I'm the trigger man
You might also like(bang, bang, bang, bang)
OK, I'm reloading. Ha ha
I told yall, No Limit niggas, we mercenary soldiers
We don't talk, we don't rap about niggas
We all about getting our motherfucking paper
A coward dies a million deaths, but a soldier only dies once nigga
Real niggas, they play the motherfucking game they don't talk nigga
Ha ha, yall fake ass niggas, yall think about it
Rapping for the motherfucking white folks
We independent black owned nigga
Ghetto niggas, ha
Real niggas and bitches unite. Ha ha
Fuck fifteen percent nigga, I want the whole motherfucking wallet
Talk to the niggas I feed nigga if you got problemsEmbed
