Letâ€™s Get Them Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, Locs, nigga, shit... I know you done whipped up this motherfuckin' dope
But we gonna break these niggas off
But, uh I need to go out and handle my business with some of these niggas
'Cause, uh, niggas out here rappin', or should I say yappin'
They don't realize that, nigga, this is real life, this reality
You know what I'm sayin', nigga, when you say somethin' about a nigga
You got to be ready to die for that shit, you know what I'm sayin'
I mean it's like uh, niggas out here wanna be me, eh
Niggas know the real from the fake, man
I smell the motherfuckin' jealousy everywhere I go, niggas is wearin' it
But, uh... we 'bout to handle this motherfuckin' shit
We gon' set the motherfuckin' record straight (Ugh!)
[Hook]
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em

[Verse 1]
I get swole like a boulder
Bitch I'm a soldier, y'all runnin' from the rollers
I slang tapes like crack
My rhymes so pure hit it with two seven eight come back
And the game won't change 'cause I'm the dopeman
But why y'all niggas still runnin' off at the mouth man
TRU niggas don't talk shit
We in the game stackin' G's, y'all niggas still tryin' to get me
With playas and hustlas
But y'all can't make no money 'cause y'all niggas is bustas
The game won't change
Y'all niggas mad 'cause Master P got some change
Seen a nigga in the ghetto slangin' dope
Now y'all buyin' my shit out the record store
And yo baby mama lovin' me
And every time you turn on the TV I feel you muggin' me
But I can't be stopped, can't be stopped
'Cause real TRU niggas make their money from slangin' rocks
Y'all niggas slangin' bunk rhymes
That's why I'm in the game and I got mines
And y'all Jewish brothers hollerin' that black shit
Quick to sell a motherfucker to the white bitch
For fifteen percent
That ain't enough money to pay my motherfuckin' rent
I made a movie nigga think I'm slangin' coca leaves
Nobody questioned Bill when he smokin' weed
And Pac and Biggie taught me a lesson (What?)
Never leave without your Smith and Wesson
You might also like[Hook]
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Bitch you went from the man that go "Ahh" and the man that go "Ugh!"
Ought be proof enough to your ass that there just ain't no limit to the shit we doin'
Only way to keep you from sayin' my name is put my dick in yo' mouth
I piss on your porch, shit in your house
Somebody said that nigga was talkin' about me, I heard that
I could fuck you up with words but you don't deserve that
Go ahead rhymes rest your fuckin' barber, but hurry back
I take a braid out my own head, whoop yo' ass with one of my plaits
Mad 'cause I'm bringin' home big old shows my nigga with no tax
Jumpin' 'cause we got a bigger fan base and gold plaques
Unfortunately a couple of things that in this industry that niggas don't understand
Ninety percent of this shit is your business, ten percent of this shit is your timin'
Slangin' tapes across the whole planet
Mystikal, Master P, Silkk the Shocker goin' to keep this bitch jammin'
Above the standard, No Limit is on the charts slammin'
Fuckin' with what we planned they goin' to leave you dead where you standin'
Ain't that fool y'all
[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker]
Real niggas don't fuckin' talk, we be silent, silent
Real niggas don't speak, they speak with fuckin' violence
That's why I play these motherfuckers like hockey
They mad 'cause they hoes jock me
They can't stop me so last result is to copy
See P where they at (There they go, there they go) I spot 'em, I got 'em
Probably mad 'cause we on the top and they on the bottom
See, uh, you run your mouth nigga, I be like nigga what
Tryin' to talk that shit about us, they want to be just like us
They talk about one, talk about all of fuckin' us
Fuck nigga quiet around killers and dealers who don't give a fuck
See I'm on some evil murderous devil shit
Got niggas over niggas head couldn't get off I was the government
(Damn what you say nigga) I roll with niggas with big triggers
I got million dollar shit nigga with big figures (TRU niggas)
And y'all can tell em, we soldiers off the bat
We don't fuck around we stay strapped
Give a fuck what y'all talkin' about you know where we at
Wherever, whenever, however it goes
I wash your mouth out with soap
Rush you straight up you won't say our name no fuckin' more
Here we go

[Hook]
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em
There they go, there they go, there they go (Ugh!)
Pass me them thangs, let's get 'em

[Outro: Master P]
All y'all fake ass niggas, nigga goin' to get y'all
Cause you know what
A real TRU nigga, when he go to jail, he never rat on his partner
He get caught by the police TRU niggas don't talk
Whenever TRU nigga fall off in the street, he hustles
Cause TRU niggas know how to pop back up
They don't need to use other niggas names or another niggas motherfuckin' game
A TRU nigga is a motherfuckin' man, got to stand on his own nigga
All y'all fake niggas, y'all eventually gon' fade with the motherfuckin' wind
Until then nigga we 'bout it 'bout it and rowdy rowdy nigga
No Limit for life
T-R-U, nigga, and when I say T-R-U, I mean the whole No Limit family
The motherfuckin' group TRU, Master P, C-Murder, and Silkk, nigga
Family, remember thatEmbed
