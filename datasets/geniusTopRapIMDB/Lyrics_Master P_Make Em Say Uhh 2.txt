[Master P:]
Make em say uhhhh!
Uhhhh! Na na na na
Na na na na Make em say Uhh
Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh Uhh
Uhh Uhh I told ya I'm the colonel of this muthafuckin' tank
Don't make me get rowdy and start pullin rank
My comrads with tanks with diamonds and TRU tats
We make em say 'uhhhh' An' 'how ya do that'
Third ward hustlaz On these streets chasin' riches
Penetentury chances Cause this a risky buissiness
A No Limit Souldier Commanderin' Cheif
An' Michael Jackson can't rock a muthafuckin' party like me
I'm bumpin' for the real niggas, playaz, and hustlaz
Qualified killaz, certified head-bustaz
Got love for the North, South, East, to the West
Soldierz throw ya rag, Killaz how ya' vest
Flashin' red lights Runnin' from the rollerz
If life was a movie, 'CUT' Pass me the dojah

[Chorus:]
Make em say uhh
Uhh
Na na na na
Na na na na

Well, if ya knew something. Fiend
Still tryin' to do somethin'
TRU smokaz dont gotta blow
We done already blew sumpthin
I still want the green, cornbread, and the cabbage
No Limit savage, well known as the baddest
When I was bustin out expeditions you wasn't ready
Turn ya lights off like Teddy, bangin out the 470
Lyrically a machete, I dig da dirt and bury
Fiend, the excited private, Nolimit mercenary
I hurt an' make you worry, thats just for the loot
Can't get get a tank dog salute, P told me to shoot
I represent the boot, An' the world is rowdy, rowdy
Makin' you say uhhh with the colonol, Mr. Bout it

[Chorus x2]

[Silkk the Shocker:]
P gon' make ya say uhhh
I'm gon' make ya say ahhhhhhh
But this time I'm gon' get rowdy by sayin na na na na na
I'm a cash getta, a No Limit ass kicka'
I'm a bad nigga ,Fast nigga, ask the last nigga
Keep my mind on my money because I like riches
House full of tight bitches, call me, I might hitcha
Now make em say na na na
Tryin ta act hard core betta for the flow
Na na na na na na
Now send the boy loot, i hit the booth and drop a verse
(Silkk still promoting violence)
I'm tryin' to clock the scrilla But it's hard not to curse
Now I'm a No Limit soldier So I get my strength through my duties
Bout to make em scream 'MISTER' Like the movie (na na na na na)
[Chorus x2]

[Mia X:]
You know we showed you once before the tank couldn't be stopped
Playa hataz yap alot but they get dropped in they spot
Off the top, Think not?
Then run up on this cocked 9 milla
Mamma Mia's asshole feeder, head splitta
Wouldn't wanna be ya, See ya
At the top of billboard, Yeah we lookin down
Wavin at you muthfuckaz,How you like us now?
Called us country way back, Laughed at bout it bout it
Now everybody shouts and wants to be rowdy rowdy
T-R-U is what we claim represent dat dirty south
4-star major general Mamma, verbal pirahna
Down to ride with No Limit soldiers, yeah we flexin'
Wit' the colonel Master P he be the ghetto Jed Clampett
Paper chasaz what they labled us, let em know
If that ass tried to play wit us, Gotta go fasho
We know what we do It's never gon die
World-wide in yo' hood P gon' make ya say Wooooo

[Chorus x2]

[Snoop Dogg:]
Man, I'm smokin' on some chop-chop from S-G-V
No Limit family wit' the D-P-G
Last Don, Big Dogg, what's up? what's happenin'?
Nigga run up We gon' tear da club up
Top rank, best dank mo' bank in dis game
Who could t be? Ya'll know my muthafuckin' name
I ain't neva met a gangsta who ain't loved to bang
Especially one who can't represent they game
See, when a No Limit soldier walks in the house
Nigga get em up, We gon turn this bitch out
BOOOOOOOOOOOMMEmbed
