Meagan Good LyricsWhoa Kimosabe!
Got the baddest bitch
Up in here right beside me
She got that good
That Meagan Good
She the coldest muthafucka in the hood
She got that good
That Meagan Good
She the coldest muthafucka in the hood

[Verse 1: Master P]
Gucci Mane told me "damn! She a keeper"
So I put her in my Blackberry under "streetsweeper"
I'm a hood nigga, love me a hood chick
Meagan Good body, thin waist
That's some hood shit
I'm loving them thighs, them legs
Her curves, her taste, them lips, her face
She bad, bad as in a club I've seen
Make me go ? friendly and spend my green
Don't pop no pills but she my drug
Gotta have shorty like Khalifa need bud
On that girl cause she's my type
Got a super-model figure
If she have to she'll fight
I'm on lil mama, cause shorty
She's so real, my nigga she's so ill
But shawty she's so chill
She don't talk to a nigga when
She mad at night
But she'll fix it, make something up
Just right
[Hook]
Whoa Kimosabe!
Got the baddest bitch
Up in here right beside me
She got that good
That Meagan Good
She the coldest muthafucka in the hood
She got that good
That Meagan Good
She the coldest muthafucka in the hood

[Verse 2: Bengie B]
Check her out: she bad, ain't it?
Clothes fit her so right it
Looked like they been painted
Man I swear she famous, can't
Nobody touch her, she was green
When I met her, now she a
Stone-cold hustler
We get it in, me and her
We're by the bar, both got
The tank around our neck
They know who we are
That's my motto, she make it wobble
Anything she want, she get it
I'm a baller in the latest coupe
Matching his and hers
Like two polar bears
With the latest furs
We doing thangs, we all about the clout
She got that Meagan Good
Know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 3: Romeo]
She got that good
But she so bad
Everything nice: first class
A real dime chick, but she's so hood
Waist-deep, she be making good
I wish a nigga would try to take her
Mean mug haters: see you later
She do what I want like I made her
See-through tights
She got them Meagan Goodies
Got that church up in the trunk
I'm trying to see what's in that hoodie
No, I'm not a car technician but
She's one hell of a model
'Vacation'
How about we fly fly out tomorrow?
I'm not a millionaire
I'm a multi ? billionaire
Just how with estate cribs in there few whips in there
I'm gonna to make you the best in the world world
I'm gonna make you feel like the only girl
