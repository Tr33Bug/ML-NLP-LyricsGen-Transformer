[Verse 1: Master P]
Hit the block dressed in white with some baggy Girbauds
A pocket full of stones, three Gs and tryna lose these hoes
And the task comin' sick 'cause it's the first of the month
Fiends on my pager like I'm tryna take these fools to lunch
Goin' crazy and ghetto's tryna kill me
My little homie's lost his life, y'all fools feel me
I pack up heat, 'cause I'm paranoid at night time
Brothas be pullin' jacks, I'm in the hood bustin' gangsta rhymes
And still gotta watch my back in the hood, G
Like Spice 1 say, these fools livin' like the movies
Little kids get 'bout it, I mean my hood is rowdy
I'm tryna make a dollar out fifteen cent before I'm up and outtie

[Pre-Chorus: Mia X & Master P]
Before you jump in the game (Ugh)
Let's get one thing understood
If you're sellin' that ice cream
You gots to make sure it's good

[Verse 2: Master P]
Mr. Ice Cream Man, or call me Master P
I got it two-for-three, call me if you need some D
Me and my little brother Silkk, we be ballin'
Got this thang sewed up from Texas to New Orleans
And 'cross the West Coast where fools get wicked
I'm in the game hella deep tryna to score a meal ticket
Breakin' fiends off boulders, I mean A-1 soda
Duckin' the task and tryna hide from the rollers
And hangin' with TRU soldiers, my TRU clique, we true to this
True to the G-A-M-E, fool, we ain't new to this
In the hood I got ice cream cones
And if you fiends want a lick, nothin' for free, that's gon' cost you twenty bones
For y'all ballers that want weight, call me on the pager
I got half gallons of milk, fool, I got thirty-one flavors
Mr. I-C-E M-A-N is on the scene
You better have my fetti if you don't have my cream

[Chorus: Mo. B Dick & Master P]
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man, ugh)
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
[Post-Chorus: Mia X]
Before you jump in the game
Let's get one thing understood
If you're sellin' that ice cream
You gots to make sure it's good

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker & Master P]
Now let's see who owes me cash, I gots to go to the grinds and get mine
Fools be tryna check it, wreck it, but it's 'bout that time
So who owe me? Pay me now, don't pay me later, crooked alligators
Tryna scheme off the top, but they be like playa haters
I gots 'em two-for-three, four-for-five, gots them rock
But killers, I got two-for-three, four-for-fives on MACs and Glocks
You can come and checks my grip, you can come and checks this
But I'm on them triple gold in the nine-skrilla Lexus
Master P in the 500 SEL with a triple beam
You scream, I scream, but them fiends screamin' for ice cream

[Pre-Chorus: Mia X & Master P]
Before you jump in the game (Ugh)
Let's get one thing understood
If you're sellin' that ice cream
You gots to make sure it's good (Better make sure it's good, player)

[Chorus: Mo. B Dick & Master P]
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
He's the Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
Mr. Ice Cream Man (Mr. Ice Cream Man)
Master P's the Ice Cream Man (Yeah)

[Outro: Master P]
Y'all fools betta recognize
