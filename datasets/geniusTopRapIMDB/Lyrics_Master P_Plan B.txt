Plan B Lyrics[Intro: Master P]
Check this out uhhhh
I mean, you ever had one of them gangsta relationships
I mean like, nobody don't have to diss nobody

[Chorus: Master P]
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
[Verse 1: Master P]
Jump in my 97 Hummer and riside
You be Ms Bonnie, I'll be Mr. Clyde
Together we be catchin g's
Flipping kis, smokin weed
It's all about you and me
Causing major pain on this dope game
You be Halle Berry
I'll be the ghetto Damon Wayans
In charge like the Lakers
You got your pink 380
I got my black nine for the haters
My homies call you that nigga
But you my bitch
Since we banging, I guess we one click
You be that nigga that I drink with
And you don't even trip if I was to let a freak kiss
You give me rubbers and holla stay strapped
You say you can't catch no fucking rat
Without a mouse trap
So we be kicking it like g's
Its a drought, but you got a connect on some keys
You roll up the Factors and drink 40s'
You'll whoop any bitch at any ghetto party
We walk past security cause you got the strap
And when my homies see ya
You the only female they give dap
You the only nigga that I'll kiss
Make love to and still do some gangsta shit with
Like Menace to Society we kick it
I'm Kane, you my thug like Ms Jada Pinkett
You might also like[Chorus: Master P]
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan

[Verse 2: Mia X]
I lays back and chill
Why you ills with the hotties
I'm numero uno in your eyes honey poppi
Yo lady Gotti
Thugged out, hooriding ready to kill
Yet make me feel like others can't with my sex appeal
Be riding ghetto thrills
But still the bitch behind the trigger
The bitch about her scrilla
The bitch to smack her nigga
If the tone faintly rises in his voice
The choice is mine
When it comes to haters living or dying
Blueprinted crimes illustrated by your baby
The unlady like mistress
Be all about illicit business
Bitches witness us together looking tenderly
But to scared to tell wifey, for fear of me
I'm only trying to be the one with the green papers
Bounce on the dick and help me pull off a mean caper
That's why you praise the biggest mama and you care
Other hoes get x'd out in what we share yeah
I give you rubbers for your friends for show
Take me shopping tomorrow
Short change them hoes
Save them 3 more nuts for me
Alize, hot tubs and an ounce of weed
Please, there's not a jealous bone in my body
Take me off to Jamaica
Then take your wifey to (aloha) Hawaii
I don't mind being number 2
You keep more ice on my hands and wrists
Than an igloo
And if it all falls through you still got me
Your true bitch nigga down to hustle
From plan B
[Mia X]
Like that nigga

[Master P]
Like that nigga

[Mia X]
But only if you bout it
Master P: Only if you bout it

[Mia X]
I can be your mistress
You can keep your wifey
I understand
I'm all good with this back-up plan

[Chorus: Master P]
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan
I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan1Embed
