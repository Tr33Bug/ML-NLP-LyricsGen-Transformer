R.I.P. Lyrics[Master P]
Rest in peace fool

[* Pouring liquor out *]

[Master P]
This for all my niggas that ain't here

[Hook x2]
R-I-P to my homies that are dead and gone
Rest in peace to my homies that done made it home
[Master P]
R-I-P to Danny and Darnelle
I reminice on when my broter Kevin got killed
I can't sleep, I know it's sad
One day they gon' put P up in a body bag
I watch movies like "Ghost"
Wonderin' if my brother really know who slit his motherfuckin' throat
And when they gone, y'all thought it was a poem
And the ghetto's tryin' to kill me, I'm still tryin' to make it home
And mama cry and daddy say son realize
Just remember one day we all gotta die
I can't trip, I'm sinkin' with this ship
In the projects you know it's one big battlefield
Where everybody don't give a fuck about another life
And lil' kids don't give a fuck about another life
They quick to put chu' to that other game
And if you lose in that battlefield then that's yo ass man
And yo life is sinkin' on with them other niggas
Cause they dead and gone now, what the fuck is goin' on

[Hook x2]

[CCG]
To underestimate, you see ya own fate
You straight gettin' poped in the "Show-Me State"
Two slugs to the face, man brace yourself
While other cats view the body at the wake
And I hate to think about what we gonna miss out on
Knowin' yo ass is gone
Cause I know we gonna miss em'
And I hate the fact that a brother done passed on
The things we do, we gotta deal with
Can ya feel it on the reala
Watchin' the blood spill from the veins of a real one
R-I-P cause ya could've been a G
And still alive to kick it with me
Never let it fade cause ya locked in a grave
R-I-P to my homies

I'm constantly surrounded by death
And my city's so scandalous
So I step with a half, cockin' that stainless steel
Cause I feel that I have to be strapped
Cause I learned from all of my dead folks mishaps
A lot of my dogs took a fall
Cause of a flaw on the streets when concernin' mail
Between two brothers, been homies forever
When lookin' past the yellow tape, fool I can't tell
This is the world I live in
My world is consumed by chaos
Makin' me not want to get too close to folks
In fear of the pain I'll feel
When another's called off, hauled off
In a Caddy brown tryin' to hang on, let em' go
I shed a few tear, I spilled some beer
And appear to be at peace
But inside I'm so cold
Cause I think of how my homie caught slugs to the mug
And I can't let that be me
Keep ya memory close to my heart
So may ya soul rest in peace
[Hook x2]

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now why life be so hard
I beend down with these wars
Since Ses, my ace caught a slug to the chest
From a tech and I hope he finally at rest
See that's why I didn't cry when my homie died, Lord hear me
Too many murderers and drug dealers and killers standin' in me
Lord forgive me
I'm bout ready to check it out but I'mma stick it out like a G
Cause it's a sin for me to kill myself
And I won't let a nigga kill me
I'ma try to hold on to these memories
But it seems all my homies done changed since elementary
Now life is the same as death and that's kind of bad to me
For every non-black males born one dies, that's kind of like sad to see
I lost my brother behind some jealousy
Not stayin' on his toes, livin' carelessly
From the cradle to grave I always see a better day
R-I-P to my G's and I hope they in a better place

[Hook x2]

[Master P talking]
Yeah this for all my motherfuckin' true soldiers
That's gone with the wind ya know what I'm sayin'
All my niggas that restin' in peace
Hope y'all in a better place homie
Cause it's hell on Earth nigga, know what I'm sayin'
We see y'all in the crossfire
For all my true soldiers, rest in peace fool
And uh, No Limit till I die
See y'all niggas on the other side
R-I-P to my homies that are dead and gone
And to all my niggas Down South hustlin
Just remember stack ya mail, live life to the fullest
Cause ya can't take none of this shit with ya
And always keep ya eye on the enemy
Might be ya best friend but watch yourself homie
Oh yeah, the most important thing never trust a bitch
Cause a bitch only out for the money
Know what I'm sayin'
Remember that though
Yeah playa R-I-PEmbed
