Stop Hatin Lyrics[Chorus: Master P]
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all this hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for

[Verse 1: Master P]
Pop the locks on the Benz, steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama -tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car, I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley must've been a coward
No more hit 'em up, like in the old days
Homies ride with Mack 10s and AKs
That's why I roll by myself I mean alone
'Cause haters be all up on
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Don't wanna see you make no money, then take ya
And try to figure out how to get what you got
'Cause haters be the same niggas on your spot
[Chorus: Master P]
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for

[Bridge: Master P]
How do hatin' get started? It's started by the jealous people
And they get mad over the things you have and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle, it really ain't hard to get
You can get yours, I got mine, so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors, I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla, fool, don't mess

[Verse 2: Fiend]
I'm only in with a few 'cause these bitch-made niggas is actors
See I done had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
Non-packers, I'm strapped like P or C
Just in case these niggas after me, capture me
Forget I'm goin' out with a blast
And I put that on some cash, I'm standin' last
For some ass, y'all young crazed punks are trippin'
Don't hate me nigga, and go 'head and credit my dippin'
I'm admittin' that I'm not only on the twat
But I know I got stopped, on the ??
It's understood that I'm not one of the best young playas that ever lived
But I got some advice to give, and that is
You might also like[Chorus: Master P]
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for

[Verse 3: Silkk]
I wonder why they hatin for? Probably 'cause we got G's
All mad 'cause we makin' moves, 'cause we got keys
But really I can't save 'em
'Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you's a motherfuckin' playa
And I'mma try to make y'all kill me in a matter of lines
I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me
When I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes upon my enemies, I gotta watch my friends
Like when I'm sittin' on top, or ridin' a Benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get somethin'
Don't worry about how I got mines
Always tryin' to point a finger and say that's not mine
And kill me
It kills me
It's disgusting 'cause I got a few G's
They try to rob me
But the white man'll make it they won't touch 'em
Smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
But I just can't call it or catch
But I still got G's and I'm still ballin'
[Chorus: Master P]
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
