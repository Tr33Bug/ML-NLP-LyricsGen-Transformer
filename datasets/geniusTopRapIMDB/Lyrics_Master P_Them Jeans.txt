Them Jeans LyricsC'mon in VIP baby

[Chorus]
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (oh yeah)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (oh yeah)
From the front to the back, girl you know what I mean
[Verse 1]
I'm country, she country, we country
Come closer, it's a free country
Damn you cute, girl you fine
Keep it right there, I wanna make you mine
Don't play no games, I gotta keep it real
Got the +Magic Stick+ and a gold grill
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Cause thugs need love, girl you know what I mean
Hold up Allie Mae you gonna work it like that
Rock the bump and let it wooble from the back

[Chorus]
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (oh yeah)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (oh yeah)
From the front to the back, girl you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
We play football, no pads, she got the cushion
I ain't Bill Cosby, but I love jello pudding
Check out that Puerto Rican body, she's a hottie
I ain't Slick Rick but +La Di Da Di+
And who's the fly white girl, she ain't that tall
So them P. Miller jeans look like two basketballs
And that Latino and Asian mommy
Make a grown man want to do the rowdy (WOO!)
And beautiful, black chick with the passions on
Make every thug in the club wanna sing this song
You might also like[Chorus]
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog

[Break]
Hey don't stop, don't stop
We can take it the floor, girl show me what you got
Hey don't stop, don't stop
You can grab the wall, girl show me what you got
Hey don't stop, don't stop
You can grab the pole, girl show me what you got
Hey don't stop, don't stop
We can take it from the club, to the parking lot
Now stop (WHAT!), then roll (HA!)
Head, shoulders, knees, toes

[Chorus]
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
From the front to the back, girl you know what I mean

[Verse 3]
I'ma No Limit soldier and I love ya boo
And her and her girl said (Female voice: We love you too)
Halle Berry head, lease the red (WOO!)
Got eight Aston 5, but that's how I prove it
Eyes lightly on me, a young Janet Jackson
Tina Turner thighs, the ghetto's main attraction
She wear boots with her jeans like Free
And homies in the hood wanna 'cuff her like the police
She so sexy, damn so nasty
A thug girl, but still so classy
Sometime she get vicious
In them P. Miller pads her jeans look bootylicious
[Chorus]
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans (them jeans)
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans
Girl grab the wall, then shake it like a dog
Shake what you got in them jeans
From the front to the back, girl you know what I mean

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wowEmbed
