Tryin 2 Do Something Lyrics[Intro: Master P]
Ugh ha, do that to one of those tenderonies
And uh, that mean you trying to do something
I'm trying to do something, ya'll hear that

[Chorus: Master P]
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something
[Verse 1: Master P]
Maybe it's the bud in me, or the thug in P
Got these ghetto hotties wanting to put they love in me
I'm a G from the CP3 and dedicated
Screaming No Limit Soldiers and these playa haters hate it
Relax shorty, hit the blunt, drop the Ruger
Come close to a nigga, let the P seduce ya
Work it like a Solo Flex, say you wanna a ruff-neck
Cristal and strawberries, weed smoking, rough sex
I want you to open your legs as wide as you could
So I can hit from the back with this nickle plated wood
Up and down like a roller coaster
From your stomach to your back
Let a gangsta poke ya
I ain't trippin, never slippin cause I got straps
9 months later, we ain't bustin no caps
Crispy clean, no strings attached
Little bump-n-grind, miss thang are you with that

[Chorus: Master P]
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something

I heard you want a real man
Won't you lay up here and give me the chance
I ain't saying romance, and what you got can be enhanced
I'm matured enough, and I ain't approach you for nothing
And the reason I came up off it cause you working with something
Now I done had a little herb, now I done build up the nerve
On top of that my head tight from everything the bar serve
I'm pitching, cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
And prove that I flip other things besides zones
Tell ya girls ya gone, baby you gots to roam
Who leaving with Fiend's, he get it on, get it on
You could make me moan, so you up for screwing me
Please use ingenuity when you doing me
Damn your dress in blues with you matching hat and shoes
Pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
Ain't no one gonna get used
Now cut the bullshits and bluffings
Straight to the point shorty
Look I'm trying to do something

[Chorus: Master P]
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something
[Verse 3: Mac]
Back stage at the concerts peepin
You wanted me to see you and I'm thinking about creepin
Far from home, destination unknown, rock bone
Hotel booked and I don't wanta be alone
Maybe it's the tone got me visualizing this song
Camouflauge love all night making me moan
Thug passion, in the back seat ripping off your fashion
Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
I'm here tonight and the vibe is right
Red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
But tomorrow my flight, and I'll be outta your sight
Take my address down so you can write
But for now lets do something
Fuck the frontin and the talking
My dogs just about barkin
Take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
And go to war with me
Pager number's on the desk
Hit me when you trying to do something

[Chorus: Master P]
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be real with ya, look I'm trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I ain't even frontin
I'm gonna be blunt with ya, look I'm trying to do something1Embed
