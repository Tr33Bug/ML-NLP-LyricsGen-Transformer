Weed and Money Lyrics[Intro]
Check this out
You a playa if you got bitches and blunts in your house, right
(Right, right)
But you a motherfuckin' TRU G
If you get the muffins and she pay for the trees (what you tryna say)
Understand what I'm sayin', nigga you feel me
Y'all Captain Kirk ass niggas ain't gonna survive
In this 97 space age hustle
(So what you sayin')
[Chorus]
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

[Verse 1: Master P]
I stack green like cheese, smoke weed with g's
Sell cream to fiends and roll with beams
Playa haters can't take me, hungry bitches can't break me
God ya made me, but ain't no man gone fade me
Got me deep in this game, some niggas don't change
Have mercy on P, just tryna have change
In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cookin' keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knockin' off chocolate hoes
Poots with initials, Ferraris and drop Rolls
I live with killers, dealers, and TRU niggas
No Limit guerrillas, mercenary killers
Beat's by the Pound, haters get clowned
Gone worldwide, but true to the underground

Blow Cohiba blunts, keep e'm rollin' up
Got your bitch fiending bro, P meaning what
[Chorus]
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

[Verse 2: Master P]
I scream "the richest", tag teamin' with bitches
'96 we went gold, haters thought we was finished
'97 went platinum, now they screaming NO LIMIT
TRU niggas don't fall off this only the beginning
[Master P and Silkk]
Coming up for what, making hella bucks
Niggas getting bumped or what, counting cash up
Got this game sewed up, niggas straight up no cut
But y'all couldn't fuck with us, y'all couldn't fuck with us

[Master P]
Swingin' like Titanic, niggas see us and panic
After big bucks no wammies, on our way to the grammy
Ya'll couldn't fuck with killers, they call us dealers
Niggas livin' for scrilla, banking with peelas

[Master P and Silkk]
Army fatigues, niggas straight like g's
Livin' like soldiers with g's, soldiers at ease
Slangin' fuckin' tapes like keys, slang 'em just like keys
From Richmond to New Orleans, we be ballin'
Keep them bitches down on they knees, keep 'em on they knees
Got them smokin' on our weed, but not for free
[Chorus]
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker]
Y'all live for bitches and blunts
I live for weed to make money
Man I want so much cash when I wake up in the mornin', I can't even much count it
Silkk the Shocker, or should I say the black Frank Nitti see
Oz's to make g's, the mayor gave me and P keys to the city
Livin' an American dream, 5 karats on my pinky ring
Ladies wanna make love to me, niggas wanna look at me all mean
But it's aaight cause you still wonder
I don't want your old lady
But she still flip me the number, I wish she'd slip me some money
See um, it's aight to have cash and thangs
Ghetto millionaires to live flashy man
600 we gonna be smashin' man
But since I can't spend no bitches
So I need some cash and thangs
[Chorus]
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
