Now which one of y'all freaks wanna get down
With the biggest nigga in town the world renowned
You can meet me downtown in the lobby
Walkin' past niggas that's dry as the Mojave (unnnngh)
Step into the elevator push the Penthouse (what)
Smell the smoke in the hall we gettin' bent out
We just sent out for room service
Why you actin' cool & yo' cousin lookin' nervous
Bullshit conversation 'bout yo' occupation
Here we go with this mandantory time wastin'
My nigga Master P is in Suite 23 doin' hella shit (unnnnngh)
To ya relative
In the ghetto we turnin' fine hoes into petals
Hands on our metals never have to fetch hoes
They come runnin' with they fans & they best clothes
To get stuck by the nigga with the million bucks
I won't lie and say I had a million fucks
I tell you what cause I get 'em then I share 'em
I get my ham fucked up then I ? 'em

Cause I'm a ho you know I'm a ho
I fuck three different bitches after every show
Cause I'm a ho you know I'm a ho
How do you know because I told ya so
