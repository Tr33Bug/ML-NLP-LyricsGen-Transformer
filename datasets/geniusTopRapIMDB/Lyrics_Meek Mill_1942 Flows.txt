1942 Flows Lyrics[Verse 1]
Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like "You did it!"
My teacher always used to tell me "You gon' lose nigga!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!
[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 2]
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!
You might also like[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 3]
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like "¡adiós!"
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us30Embed
