Believe Lyrics[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
They tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, ain't never want attention
So I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions
'Cause they ain't see my vision
I was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted
In the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance
Welfare baby, we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real
When your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway, you walk out and see the grill
Thank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
My bank account, it was on super-zero
Ain't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
Target my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me, he said "You De Niro"
Play your part, got some brains like the scarecrow
Let's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit back like a king, when they move, make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, hundred million in a year
You might also like[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down

[Outro: Justin Timberlake, Meek Mill, Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
Please, God, watch over me (Watch over me)
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (My soul to keep)
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
Please, God, watch over me3Embed
