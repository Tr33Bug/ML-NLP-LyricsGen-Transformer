Fall Thru Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Sad to say it but I love you
Don't take no offense but you're my bitch

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel
[Verse 1]
Ass all fat say she get it from her mama
She just want the money, she ain't fuckin' with no bloggers
Fuck you on a PJ the whole way to the Bahamas
Gucci, Valentino, baby, I can be your stylist
Fuck me with your friend, yeah yeah, you was wildin'
1942 shots turn you to a monster
Thuggin' like you 2Pac, you know that I got you
Love the way you ride it, move them hips like you Rihanna
I was supposed to hit, I was never s'pose to cuff you
Put you on my homie 'cause he say he wanna fuck you
When he asked me 'bout you, I just told him that I want you
But now its quiet for you, 'cause I told him that I loved you

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 2]
I was locked up, I remember when I hit you
Used to write me back every letter that I sent you
You wasn't my girl but you used to pretend to
When I came home, let me beat it instrumental
Lame left you scarred so I had to reinvent you
If you was car, shit, you ride it like a Benz do
Wraith it with the stars, every time I come and get you
We be goin' hard every time you on that Hen' too
I was in the mix, actin' like a savage
Got another bitch and you told me I could have it
I know you was sick so I doubled back to grab you
So anything you wish, yeah yeah, you can have it
You might also like[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Bridge]
Whoa, she just want a ride with a shotta, though
I'm an original don dada, though
Knock them all down like dominoes
Make me tell them other bitches, vamonos
Whoa, good gal, bad gal, small city, mad world
She just wanna shine, whoa
And last night was mad real, sunshades, advils, fuck you all the time

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel11Embed
