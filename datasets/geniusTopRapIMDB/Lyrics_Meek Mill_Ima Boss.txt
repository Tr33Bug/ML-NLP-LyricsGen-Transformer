M-M-Maybach Music

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I be ridin' through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip (Yes sir)
Same old attitude, but I'm on that new shit (Yeah)
They say they gon' rob me, see me, never do shit (Never)
'Cause they know that's the reason they gon' end up on a news clip (Murder)
Audemar on my wrist, bust down (Bling)
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winnin' touchdown (Score)
'Member me dead broke? (Broke) Look at me up now (Up)
I run my city from South Philly back to Uptown
Thank God, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin', all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand 'fore my album got dropped
And I'm only 23, I'm the shit, now, look at me
Look at me, I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shorty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way (No way)
'Cause I made it from the bottom, it was never no way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss) I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm with the murder team (Murder team) call the cops (Call the cops)
We in the building (We in the building) y'all are not (Y'all are not)
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not?
[Chorus: Meek Mill & Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (Huh!) I call the calls (Huh!)
We in this bitch, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king, now where my muh'fuckin' crown? (Huh!)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (Huh!) I call the calls (Yeah)
Hey!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Got so many shades, they thought I had a lazy eye (Huh)
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride (Huh)
No love, cry when only babies die
And when I go, that casket better cost a hundred thou'
I pray to God I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul out his shirt, let's take him for that ride (For that ride)
OG is one who standin' on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gon' eat (Huh)
Fuck a blog, dawg, 'cause one day we gon' meet (Gon' meet)
I'ma spaz on yo ass like I'm Monique
Or a double stack, bet a nigga double that
Jerry Jones money, nigga, you a running back (You a running back)
Herschel Walker (What?) Bo Jack (Hah)
Ricky Watters, better run that dope back (Dope back)
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach (Maybach)
Four hundred thou', bitch, you wish you saved that

Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (Huh!) I call the calls (Huh!)
We in this bitch, it's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king, now where my muh'fuckin' crown? (Huh!)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (Huh!) I call the calls (Yeah)
Hey!

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Couple cars I don't never drive, bikes I don't never ride (Nah)
Crib I ain't never been (No), pool I don't never swim (Never)
Fool, you ain't better than (Nah), I move like the president (Yeah)
Ery'thang black-on-black, you know I be strappin' that
Rattin' ass niggas walkin' 'round wearin' wires
Fuckin' up the game, got the hood on fire (It's hot)
Bitch I'm a king (King) call me sire
If you say I don't run my city, you a muh'fuckin liar
I'm a boss, you a fraud
You cross the line, I get you murdered for a cost (Murder)
Out in Vegas (Out in Vegas) I took a loss (Took a loss)
At the fight, we watchin' Floyd, we on the floor (We on the floor)
Yeah, scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke, I'ma take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime, you ain't take none from me
In the hood err'day, bitch, I'm good, what I say?
[Chorus: Meek Mill & Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss) Bitch, I'm a boss! (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (Huh!) I call the calls (Huh!)
