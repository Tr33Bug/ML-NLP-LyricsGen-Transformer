Issues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lord, forgive me for my sins, used to pray to get a brick
Nigga icy like it's hockey, and I'm playin' with them sticks
He don't like me, but he gotta respect the fact we gettin' rich
Nigga threw a shot and missed me, threw 'em back and he got hit
Brrrt, brrrt
Went from public housing to a glass house (Glass house)
Fuckin' famous bitches in my trap house
My main bitch fight my side bitch, Kash Doll
The only way to keep them quiet when I cash out (Woo!)
What you doin'? Gettin' paid, young nigga
How you in the mob? 'Cause I'm made, young nigga
Say you need a job, come my way, young nigga
And if I point 'em out, better spray them niggas, bop!
I'm a bad influence (Bad influence, ho)
Talkin' money and I speak it fluent (Speak it fluent, ho)
Paid a couple mill' to wear Puma (Wearing Puma)
I thank God for all this sauce, hallelujah, woo (Amen, amen, amen)
Yeah I knew it, hatin' on me, yeah, I knew it (Yeah, I knew it)
Come down to that check, I'm like Nike, I just do it (I just do it)
Boy I must be poppin', they keep poppin' up with rumors (Poppin')
Where and who I'm poppin', what I'm coppin'
Who I'm screwin' (Who I'm screwin')
What you doin'? (Wait a minute)
Gettin' paid (Gettin' paid)
She said, "Meek, you know my boyfriend
And what's his name" (What's his name)
Yeah I know him, mhmm, he a lame (He a lame)
Don't you ever bring that fuckboy up again
[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we been through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)

[Verse 2]
Hangin' by the rope buy some dope (Buy some dope)
Pretty hoe, deep throat 'til she choke (Ooh)
Pussy good, super wet, need a boat (Need a boat)
Niggas tryna ride my wave, let 'em float (Let 'em die)
Put my young bull on the chain 'cause I miss Snupe (Miss Snupe)
Fuck a bad broad, make her kiss Snupe (Kiss Snupe)
I can't ever tell a bitch, "I miss you" (Miss you)
Better not tell nobody if I kiss you (Bitch, you)
Kiss and tell, fuck you good, hit you well (Hit you well)
I just made like 20 M's, they say it's an L (What?)
Niggas prayin' that I fall and I wish 'em well
Bitch you crazy, I'm too wavy, I'm like Biggavel'

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)
You might also like[Bridge]
Hit 'em with finesse, kill 'em with success
Nigga lookin' broke, give them niggas stress (Broke)
Don't do some shit you know that you gon' regret
Reachin' for my neck, that'll get you stretched (Brrrt, brrrt)

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Brrrt, brrrt)18Embed
