Jump Out the Face Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
I just took a Perc', now I'm on another level
Tastin' on the molly got me dancin' with the devil
Poured a eighth of Kobe Bryant, mixin' purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together (Woo, woo)

[Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
Jump out the 'Rari ,then jump out a Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, woo, woo)
They jump out the face, they jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, Meek Mill
[Verse 1: Meek Mill & Future]
Came from the hood, now we jump out of states (The states)
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face (They do)
Duckin' indictments and sellin' this white (Ah)
Got to watch for these niggas, they'll jump on your case
(You watch out, these niggas, these niggas, they playin')
And none of this money don't come out the safe (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face (Ayy, blatt, blatt)
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
I be so fly, just don't shoot my cape (Woo)
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith (Woo)
Got some new money, went, bought me a K (Yeah)
You see all them VV's jump out the face (The VV)
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake (Strip club)
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula (Freebandz)
Pour up some pour up, my nigga we boolin' (Freebandz)
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys just boolin'
I'm taking your ho from you cause she was choosy (Skrrt)
I keep them shooters on deck, I approve it (Frrap)
Get me a truck of them things, I'll move it
VVS cuts on my wrist suicidal ('Cidal)
I stay lit up with that flawless on fire (On fire)
I spend it all with my niggas, let's get it (Let's get it)
Get out your feelings, young nigga let's get it
I got stars on my ceiling

Jump out the 'Rari (Ah), then jump out a Wraith (Woo)
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Ha, ha, ha, woo, woo, woo, skrrt, skrrt, Meek, woo)
They jump out the face (Straight up, woo, freaky fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh)
They jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I've been peepin', you niggas been watchin' my moves
Watchin' my stacks and my shoes
When everybody did the Gucci and Louis
We was on Jimmy Choos
2012, when we did the Giuseppes
Margielas was cool
When you lil' niggas was worried about Jordans
We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose, it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper, knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper, she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her, it's just like a pool
I bought some 'Raris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you, hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots, let it pop out the tool

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I just took a Perc', now I'm on another level
Tastin' on the molly got me dancin', with the devil
Poured a eighth of Kobe Bryant, mixin' purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together
[Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
Jump out the 'Rari (Ah), then jump out a Wraith (Woo)
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Ha, ha, ha, woo, woo, woo, skrrt, skrrt, Meek, woo)
They jump out the face (Straight up, woo, freaky fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh)
They jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, yeah, yeah, woah151Embed
