Levels Lyrics[Intro]
See, it's brackets, nigga
Them hoes ain't fuckin' you
'Cause you ain't in that bracket, nigga
Learn life, it's levels to this shit, young boy
Ayy, O, you feel me?

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!
[Verse 1]
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
And I be rockin' Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shinin' like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
Thirty grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit
And I don't want your opinion if you ain't got shit
We young niggas, we winnin', I pull up, drop shit
Mob shit, with more keys than a locksmith
You might also like[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 2]
Damn, Tommy, you ain't got no job!
DC, we the motherfuckin' mob
Young nigga gettin' straight to the money
In a Range with your honey, I pull up, like, "Ahh!"
I make them power moves with Jay and them
Them boys shootin', don't play with them
Maybach, Rozay and them
Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas
[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!

[Verse 3]
One time for the real niggas
Two times for the bad bitches
Y'all suckas be cuffin' hoes
'Cause y'all suckas never had bitches
I hit the dealer, bought another Rolls
That's the reason why you mad, nigga?
That's the reason why you hatin' on me?
I love ballin'—my bad, nigga
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
'Cause it's levels to this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hold up!

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit—oh Lord!51Embed
