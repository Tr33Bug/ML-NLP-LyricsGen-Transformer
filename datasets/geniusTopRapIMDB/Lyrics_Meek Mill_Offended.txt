Offended Lyrics[Intro: Young Thug]
Meek Milly, Jeffery, woah
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Bitch, you offendin' me (Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?)
I just might go 'head
And let this lil' bitch suck my dick till it tickle me (Suck, suck it up)
I just might go 'head
And mix me a Sprite with some lean like it's chemistry (lean, lean)
Goddamn, I had four hoes at one time, they was drilling me (Goddamn, damn, woo)
I heard the lil' boy was plotting on killing me
Fuck 'round and lift up they soul like Lil Chino be wheelin' (Brrt, woo)
I usually don't beg but I don't want the ceiling please (Woo-hoo)
Oxycontin fucking up kidneys
[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Molly, my cup look like bath salt
And I'm too high horsed for asphalt
Therefore I'm in clouds from day to dark
They say that I changed, it's the cash fault
Pay everybody like a cash cow
I switch through the lanes like a NASCAR
The Rollie stainless, stainless
We young and rich and we dangerous
I'm at Piccadilly's with your missus, nigga
And the weed stinking like a chitlin, nigga
The money long like a Philly, nigga
Make me catch you slipping then it's Christmas, nigga
The bulletproof can take a missile, nigga
I got Benji on me and he Crippin' nigga
I done wrapped the benji in the city, ho
I done wrapped the Bentley in the bity, nigga
Put a swimming pool in the living room
How I'm living, nigga, I ain't swimming, nigga
Only thing that me and Michael Phelps
Got in common is that we winning nigga
Rock star lifestyle
Your ho's going wild

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Saint Laurent shorty and toting that .40
We move through the city like BMF
Rocks on the chain like the rocks that I slang
Only difference them bitches, they VVS
I know these bitches gon' change
And fuck on whoever, whenever they see a check
If you do not fuck with the gang
Don't act like you do, when you see us just keep it that
Swing through your block, bring that sweeper back
Land on your spot where your peoples at
Smoke you where ever we see you at
You don't want no problem so keep at that
'Fore you get your man murdered
Hitters in the van lurking
I put bread on the beef (What you do?)
Turn it to a hamburger
Put that paper on the scale, nigga
Little homies talking big money
When the wars on you'll tell, nigga
Put a bag on your main hitta
When them things hit 'em, that's an L, nigga
So you should be home before mama got dinner for sale, nigga
And that’s all I’ma tell niggas, and that's it
