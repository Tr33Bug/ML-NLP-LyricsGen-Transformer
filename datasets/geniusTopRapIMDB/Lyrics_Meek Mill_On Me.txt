On Me Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, reportin' live from the northside of litty city
You fuck my bitch, I'ma keep it player
I just want you to know that we the Navy Seals
We gon' strike your whole motherfucking platoon, nigga
Gang

Ugh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Three bad bitches, fuckin' on me
Top floor at my penthouse, yeah
Young rich nigga, I'm in my robe
Fuckin' them hoes in my flip-flops, yeah
Fuck all that trollin, this hip-hop, woah
Nigga play wit me, gon' get shot (Brr)
Quarter mil' 'caine, my wrist white, woah
Bust down, Patek don't tick-tock, no
We got them bricks in a drought
I call the play and they hittin' the route
This life I'm living be trippin' me out 'cause I just let a famous bitch spit in my mouth (Ew)
I'ma buy a Birkin for a project bitch
Rolls truck coming, I'ma cop that shit
Ass all fat, tell her pop that shit like (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Every red bottom, know I got that shit
Post it on the Gram, but you not that lit
Your favorite rapper is not that rich (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Fly Dubai on Emirates
Only fly 'em out if they with the shits
All bad hoes need discipline (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I'm in a red 'Sace robe, fuckin' on all bad bitches
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I want a brand new Rolls, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Tell her come- fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
Fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes, yeah

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
(Cardi) I brought my money bring your's out (Woo)
Red Lamborghini with the doors out (Ugh)
I hit the mall, clear stores out (Ugh)
Heat to your face, clear ya pores out, yeah
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I been hard workin' and humble
Believe me, I've heard of the mumble (Look)
I'm just gon' weave it alone (Yeah)
'Cause I would put burners to bundles
Bitches are miserable, they are so typical
Hating is cheap, not my material
Look where I'm at, run back to years ago
I used to strip, now I keep a different pole (Cardi)
I do not fuck with your kind, no
I do not fuck with your vibe, no
I am a big boss bitch, I do not come in your size, no
(Booty, booty, booty)
I seen a bitch tryna switch sides (Switch)
Then jump back, tryna dick ride (No)
But I ain't really worried about these hoes (Huh?)
'Cause bitches are hurt, D. Rose (Yeah)
Gucci bags, 40 cal stickin' out (Ugh)
If they want the smoke, then I give it out (Ugh)
I might leave my robe at your nigga house
Give you two something to figure out
I seen all these shots and they brick, brick, brick
Try something new ho, quick, quick quick
Body bag, body bag, zip, zip, zip (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
