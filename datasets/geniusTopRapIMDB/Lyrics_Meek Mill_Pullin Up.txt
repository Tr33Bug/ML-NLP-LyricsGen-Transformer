Pullin Up Lyrics[Intro: The Weeknd]
We wanted the world, baby
That's why we ended how we ended
We chose to live how we live
Well now you found the one, baby
And you ain't tryna see nobody but him
Nobody but him
Ooh, ooh, but I know you well
Ooh, ooh, girl, I know you well

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, pull up on ya, put it on ya
Fuck you in the car, if he looking for you
Seen you with your man and said, “What up to ya”
Like you ain't give me that work
It was California, 5 in the morning
I was plottin' on ya, we was hot as sauna
Tryna pop up on ya
And fuck you good on that purp
We linkin' up gettin' faded, we fell in love and we made it
We only would fuck, never dated
Come get your lady, all this Ice on me she skated
That pussy was good as Crustaceans
I'm in the latest, she ride the D like Mercedes
I might just call her Mercedes
Rockin' Margiela I might just act like a mason
Will tell nobody you my baby
She fell in love with the real
Now she don't fuck with the fakers
Me and her nigga was sharing a home
I'm talking like Clippers and Lakers
And she get the D from her favorite
That pussy got me going crazy
I know that these niggas gon' hate it
But we only trip when we trip to Jamaica
Just tell ‘em

Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Pullin' up on that new thang
Mulsanne and my boo thang
And she's-a-dime like Hussein
And we kick shit, Liu Kang
And Chun-Li, is only one me
I'm like Bun B how I screw things
Front stroke, back stroke
I came, you came
And your main nigga ain't fuckin' with me
He ain't fuckin' with me
Tell that nigga go wait inside
When I pull up on you, you coming with me
Talk dirty, you say it's mine
You say it's mine when I'm cuming in it
Broke boys don't deserve pussy
Therefore, you ain't fucking with her
I'mma be there when that nigga get fly
Soon as he slippin, I'm making you mine
Buy you a Rollie to make up for time
And flood it all out to make sure you shine, girl
I never waited in line, girl
Let me just take you to my world
Soon as that nigga stop frontin' on you
You get the D from behind, girl
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Na na na na nah, na na na na nah, na na na na nah
Ooh, ooh
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up107Embed
