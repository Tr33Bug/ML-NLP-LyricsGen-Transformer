Ready or Not Lyrics[Intro: DJ Drama & Meek Mill]
Maybach Music!
They say your brain's most creative in your sleep
See, they say, in the sleep state
The brain thinks much more visually and intuitively
Ha, what is this? (Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music! Swate!
As dreamchasers, we accomplish that wide awake
Turn everything up a lil bit in the headphones!
You ready? (All-Star!)
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
They say they're down for the team but playin' two damn sides
I'm like niggas ain't loyal (no!), niggas ain't loyal (no!)
And these voices in my head saying niggas ain't for you (nah!)
And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you (fire!)
And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me
I'm barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
I'm on probation still strapped, 'cause niggas want to murder me
And lately I've been getting faded (faded)
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating (they hating)
And all these bitches wanna fuck me
'Cause a nigga made it (I made it!)
I'm getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

As dreamchasers, we consider ourselves a creative upper class
When it comes to ideas, we're just in a different tax bracket
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! (Gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga quarter millie worth of jewels (jewels)
Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse (fuse)
Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes (shoes)
Ain’t it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs, huh?
Big dreams turn to big things (things)
I’ve been waiting on this day since I was 16 (16)
Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes (skrrt!)
Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing (killing)
We in the building, every other month I make a million (yeah!)
Any nigga talking reckless cause they think I’m chilling
'Til I put some money on their head, yeah, make 'em feel it
Have they own homies do him like they never knew him (fire!)
I'll have Omelly walk up on him when we run into him (fire!)
Close range shorty have him put something through him
So I hope you're ready cause we heavy and we're coming for you

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah
[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Dreamchasers 2
We decided to share the wealth again
Care to join us?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The meek shall inherit the earth
So I’ma own this bitch until I’m buried in dirt
I only roll with niggas that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don’t know why, I just feel like I’m the one (one)
They label me a victim but now look what I become ('come)
Or should I say became, I don’t do it for the fame
I’m from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life’s a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the potholes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy (yeah)
Shorty wanna be a star, that’s why she popping that pussy
She trying to win, so she hang amongst winners
That’s why I take the time just to pray at mom’s dinner (I pray)
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter (not the winter)
Not the weather, I’m talk about within us (within us)
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends, they get to splittin', divided just like division
So every day that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
Yeah! The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger, I'm gone!

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Nigga like me?
I walk around, fear no man (no man!)
I don't owe you niggas shit! (shit!)
E'ry nigga you see around me
That's the niggas that's with me (my niggas)
Unless they in jail or dead or something
Nigga livin' life like, "Fuck all you niggas"
You feel me?12Embed
