Save Me Lyrics[Intro]
(Dougie on the beat)

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase my
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 1]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Bustin' choppers, sellin' dope, I went to runnin' wild
Threw a drum up in my forty, shoot a hundred times
Two hundred thou my cousin's case to see his daughter smile
Somebody save me, save me
All this lean and all these percs gon' drive me crazy
I see niggas switchin' sides like they KD
I can't let it kill my vibe 'cause I'm too wavy
This what I wanted, I'ma own it
Anything I ever said I'm standin' on it
Got my dog in the feds, he turned informant
I just pray that he don't say some shit to harm us

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

One time my dog tried to line me, must've lost his mind
When he know how we get down when niggas cross the line
And I hate to be the one that gotta call his mom
That money mix up with that greed, it happen all the time
If I can't trust you, it's fuck you
Know that money ain't a thang, I tell 'em touch you
Know them boys gon' bust your brain, I push a button
To make it home to see me son, know I'm gon' crush you
'Cause that's important, to keep it one hundred
I just wanna make it home to see my youngin (Papi)
Move my family out the ghetto all I wanted
Left me dancin' with the devil, chasin' this money
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby
[Verse 3]
And I'm so tired of makin' moves and gotta keep the tool
Gotta hide it from my son, I pick him up from school
With them papers with it, some would tell me I'm a fool
But all these hatin' niggas wanna see me on the news
And they debating on a nigga if I'm gon' win or lose
'Bout this paper I seen real niggas forget the rules
And I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
No I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby14Embed
