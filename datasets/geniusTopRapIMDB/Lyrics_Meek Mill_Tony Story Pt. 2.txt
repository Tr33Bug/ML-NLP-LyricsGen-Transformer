Tony Story, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Paulie killed Tony right? (Right)
And Tony killed Ty, so it was only right (Right)
Thinkin' back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper, ain't nothin' nice (Uh-uh)
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper, balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, 'cause he rocked Tony (Tony)
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money, so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him (They ready)
'Cause word on the street that Paulie did that (That)
Used Key gold, digging ass to get back (Back)
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at (Yeah)
She woke up in the morning like, "I never sent that"
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
'Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (Lord)
And Paulie on a rise now (On a rise)
Niggas that played the middle pickin' sides now (Pickin' sides now)
Plus, he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now (I want this nigga dead)
[Verse 2]
Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother, he slipping, yeah, he's a goner
Fuckin' with that lean, he dipping, one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reachin', bet you they get up on him
The gat jam, he bang back, tryna avoid 'em
Them niggas dumpin', he get up running and hittin' on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body, he dipping on 'em
Said, it's on now, try and kill 'em, it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feelin' like he dead, it ain't no remorse now
Gettin' high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now (Get on the floor)
Momma and little kids, get on the floor now (Ah)
Finger on the trigger, he feel it, it's going down (Ooh)
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
'Cause they sad when it rain, it's really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his Nina (Strapped)
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer (Thirty)
Paulie wasn't in it when, he heard it, he was steaming (Kill this nigga)
Addicted to the murder, so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead 'fore Sunday hit (Hit)
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit (Yeah)
And time fly fast, it was Monday quick
And Paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done, so he loadin' up his gun (Murder)
And show this young nigga he fucked with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight, he don't give a fuck if the law come
You might also like[Verse 3]
So he out here
Ridin' dirty, put down them birdies
And without fear, niggas lurkin'
They tryna murder, heard he out there
Niggas spinin', they try and hit him
Hittin' every corner, seein' niggas, but he ain't with 'em (He ain't)
A youngin' layin' low, he know Paulie ain't playin' though (Nah)
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin', "Go" (It's real)
But youngin', he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tagged-toe
It was four in the morn' (Morn'), Paulie goin' home (Home)
Windshields wipin', middle of the rain storm (Storm)
And Paulie, he ain't slipping, yeah, he got that thang on (Yeah)
You know what he did to Tony, he won't get the same song so (Damn)
When he hit the crib, he spin the block 'fore he park it (Park)
Paulie ain't a bitch, nah, Paulie just cautious
But little did he know, niggas in the streets talkin' (Talkin')
And out his rear view, it's like he seen a reaper walking (Yeah)
Nigga with a hoodie, all you hear is heaters sparkin'
Shots hit the window, get low, he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in, and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezin', trying get him off him (Ah)
Them shots ringing, youngins squeezing, clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him, he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, "You ain't learn from your brother, nigga?"
