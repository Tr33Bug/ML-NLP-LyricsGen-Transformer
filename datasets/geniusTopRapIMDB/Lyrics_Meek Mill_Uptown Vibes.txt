Uptown Vibes Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill]
Papamitrou Boi
Spanish bitch from uptown
I bought her a bust down
Yeah, oh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ven aquí, dame chocha to my Spanish loca
In the kitchen, whippin' that dope up, you can smell the odor
Prob gon' pitch it, we gon' hit it like we Sammy Sosa (Gimme that)
Put that Bentley to the limit, you can smell the odor
Ho, Spanish bitches call me "Chulo"
When I'm pullin' up in that two door
Diamonds different color, UNO
All these hunnids on me, mami
Man, my pockets look like sumo
I got money out the ass, I finger pop you in your culo
When I hit you with that, you know (You know)
You know, smoke a little hookah (Hookah)
Kick it like it's Judo (Judo)
Let you hit the OG (OG)
Sip some 42 though (Yeah)
And when we get in mood, I'ma dog it like I'm Cujo, whoa
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what these Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots
First we shut them down, then we open up shop
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot
They've been tryna stop the wave, but the wave don't stop

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Uptown, nigga
I was down, but they see I'm up now, nigga
Head high 'cause I'm holdin' up my crown, nigga
Never told even through the ups and downs, nigga
And if I D'usse, it's a cup of brown, nigga
Only way I double cross is
I just keep spinning, only way to make 'em nauseous
Dímelo, mami, like salsa, we could dip
I'm just tryna see you dance, salsa on the dick, whoa
It went down, she came up, you know
Y'all take shots, y'all aim up, you know
Hate on low, but we fly high, you know
Talk is cheap, free Wi-Fi, whoa

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Anuel AA]
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what these Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots (Brrr)
First we shut them down, then we open up shop (Anuel, ah)
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot (Mera, dime Spliff, los Intocables, oíste cabrón)
They've been tryna stop the wave but the wave don't stop (Ah, brrr, haha)

Vo' a estar al volante (Volante) y al la'o está el cantante (Brrr)
El que tiene guerra con los narcotraficantes (Haha)
Hijo 'e puta, tengo cuatro rutas (Uy)
Y lo' vendo a treinta y dos como Karl Malone en Utah (Utah)
Louboutin, Dolce y Versace (Jaja)
Vo' a morirme millonario, los Illuminati (Los Illuminati)
La Glock y las puta' en el bote (Brrr)
Y las nalga' como Jennifer López, brrr (Ah)
Y ella rebota ese culote
Y yo le mamo ese totito pa' que no me bote (Pa' que no me bote)
Yo tengo diez dracotes (Brrr)
Y tenemos trece R (Ah) y mil soldados pa' to' estos bichotes (Ah, jaja)
Brrr

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Heard they tryna steal the wave, cut it out, cut it out
Spicy mamis on the way, bust it down, bust it down
Saw my watch, she love the way I flood it out, ayy
Talk to me nice, show you what this Bentleys 'bout, whoa
Pipe down, throwin' up shots
First we shut them down, then we open up shop
Realest nigga around just in case y'all forgot
They've been tryna stop the wave but the wave don't stop7Embed
