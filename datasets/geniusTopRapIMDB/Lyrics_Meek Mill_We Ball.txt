We Ball Lyrics[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah!
R.I.P. Dex Osama, Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter, Truce

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its gon' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the Clearport ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of money'll get your lined up
[Bridge: Meek Mill]
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout it
Three felonies, ain't graduate, no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape
Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm going through stuff
I don't feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek, not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah, yeah, and then there's challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear, I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister
I'm a boss, I ain't never need a manager
Got rich, with thugs scandalous, ayy

Fuck it, we ball, yeah
All the soldiers we lost, yeah
Fuck it, we ball-ooh-all
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
She just got a nose job and it wasn't that bad
(Fuck it, we ball)
I was juggin' round the city, I came back, ayy
Fuck it, we ball
Yeah, fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, yeah
Fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, ayy17Embed
