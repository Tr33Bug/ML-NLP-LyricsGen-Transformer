Wins & Losses Lyrics[Intro: Eric Thomas & Meek Mill]
You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah, any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles, now we eating lobster
[Verse: Meek Mill]
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou', lawyer said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like "Lord be my witness"
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds (Brrr!)
If it was "Fuck them niggas" then
It's fuck them niggas now, fuck 'em!
Never change on my roll dawgs
'Bout that Cain bang them thangs like we O-Dog
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldn't make it like I told y'all
