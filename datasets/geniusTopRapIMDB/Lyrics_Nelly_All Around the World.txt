All Around the World Lyrics
There's no place I won't go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'd never find another you, baby!
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful

I've been around, I've been around the world
Have seen so many, many pretty girls
Been to Tokyo with no luck
I left France with no luck
Found nobody in Toronto like you
Seen a million pretty faces
Still ain't found one like yours
With a walk mean as yours
New bags, shoes couture
I've been a million different places
Still ain't found one like you
It's the little things you do
That make you so beautiful
There's no place I won't go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'd never find another you, baby!
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful

So tell me have you seen her?
The one I used to know?
Tell me have you seen her?
The one...

I've been to so many cities looking for you girl
L.A. to London
I can't find nobody nothing like you girl
And ain't that something?
Left St. Louis with no luck, Paris with no luck
I found nobody in Chicago like you
Seen a million different faces
Still ain't find one like yours
With a walk mean as yours
New shades,  clothes couture
I've been a million different places
Still ain't found one like you
It's the little things you do
That make you so beautiful
And there's
You might also like
So tell me have you seen her?
The one I used to know?
Tell me have you seen her?
The one...

There's no place I won't go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'd never find another you, baby!
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful

Baby girl where you hiding?
Guess I'll have to come find ya
I'm the only one you need
Girl let me just remind ya
I've been around, been around the world
And I still ain't find, I still ain't find my girl

There's no place I won't go
To find the one so beautiful
Just like the one I used to know
The one I used to know
All around the world, all around the world
I'd never find another you, baby!
All around the world, all around the world
In search of a girl so beautiful1Embed
