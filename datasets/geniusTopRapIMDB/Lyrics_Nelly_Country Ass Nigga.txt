Country Ass Nigga Lyrics
You know what I found out?
Sometimes no matter what you do, they only look at you one way
At the end of the day

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Call me Mr. All That, all that
E'rything you have, I'm all that
Call me wack, you better call back (Crawl back)
Or fall back before that black mack, bust all that
Old schoolin' that new thing
White V-neck with two chains
Like 2 Chainz, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
This is mine, I'ma spend it
If she's fine, I'll hit her, man
You hear that beat, that's Drumma Boy
When I see you, that's trouble, boy
Just say the word and I'm in thurr
Name the time, and that when/where
And I'ma two-piece ya like swimwear

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
You might also like
I got rubber bands on my cheddar knots
I'm super cool and I'm hella hot
A broad, a menage, I'mma let her eye
While I'm barrelin' out, and I'm yellin' out
Fuck you, bitch, I'm so stupid
I love no ho, ain't no Cupid
King of the south, thought you knew this
I screw her mouth then throw deuces
I'm wit' Nelly and 2 Chainz, and 2 Chainz give two shits
I'm A-Town, ho, West Side, Bankhead, shawty I'm foolish
Old school car, new chick, no boujee hoes when I ride, fool
These millions don't mean shit, I was the man when I was in high school (Oh!)
All about survival where I come from
Young and dumb, Bible all a nigga run from
Ignorant, belligerent
Can't wait to get a quarter-key and get to gettin' it

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
I'm a country nigga (Nigga), and I keep it street (Street)
All I smoke is strong, straight from section eight
I got socks on with my house shoes
I got my baby mama name tattooed
I got another bitch with another bitch
Mad cause I fucked up her hairdo (Damn)
Hair weave killer, an a "wanted" poster
Dance on a white girl, call it John Travolta (Swag)
I'm a country nigga, I fuck her on the sofa (Ugh)
My whip white with the black top like Sammy Sosa (Tru)
If you ain't got no money (Money), you better have hustle (Yeah)
See when I got some money, all I did was add muscle (Muscle)
Tity 2 Chainz, and the two's never too much
Extension cord is when you put together two blunts

Take away the money, take away the fame (The fame)
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old country-ass nigga
Country-ass nigga
Way before the house, way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called "Ol' country-ass nigga"
Country-ass niggaEmbed
