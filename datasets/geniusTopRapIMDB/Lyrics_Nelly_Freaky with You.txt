Freaky with You Lyrics
Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you

Uh, yeah
Pretty lady, nice to meet you
My name is Nelly and you're?
She said, "Baby, you don't need to
You know I know who you are"
Soon as you pulled up, I peeped you
Lace dress, all see through
Get to talkin' 'bout her boyfriend
Ain't tryna hear 'bout other people
Think she said he was a ball player
But all his plays under review
Foreplay, that's a preview
Round two, that's the sequel
Baby, I can keep a secret
He ain't gotta know what we do
We low as the ground
Call me when he ain't around
Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop, stop (woo)
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot (you hot, woo)
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you

Uh, uh, yeah
Quit tryna hide all that freakin', yeah
I'm fantasizin' 'bout freakin' you
I'ma need 'bout a week or two
Pretty pussy playin' peekaboo
Got some ideas on what we can do
I'm talkin' 'bout the unspeakable
You're sendin' your silhouette
It's amazin' we ain't on a pillow yet
'Cause the way that you got me hypnotized
You came with your girls and I'm with the guys
Girl, call the valet, they go get the ride
Then it's straight to my place for a different vibe
I swear I ain't never seen thicker thighs
Got plans, unless you wanna improvise
Right now, don't make a sound
You know who wearin' the crown
You might also like
Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do (that a nigga wan' do)
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you

You, I know I know what you like
You, shawty, you ain't gotta hide it
Pull that to the side, and let me get inside

Let me lick you up and down
'Til you say stop (no, I never gon' stop, never gon' stop)
Let me play with your body, baby
Make you real hot (make you hot, make you hot, make you hot)
Let me do all the things that a nigga wan' do
Tell me why
'Cause tonight, baby, I wanna get freaky with you3Embed
