Give U Dat Lyrics
Future Hendrix (Hey), Freebandz
What's popping?
I can tell the way you move that body, now
Nelly, you sing it
All my niggas say "ooh"
A whole lot of that, they know not a bitch can copy that
I'm gon' make you say "ooh"
Take it all off and do that, now take it all off
Take it all off
Take it all off
Now tell me where you wanna be now
I know you wanna be here (Come on)
But I don't see it in your body language, baby
I just wanna be clear
See, I've been spending time on that other shit
I ain't tryna get lost (Lost)
But the way you're moving that on me, girl
Tell me, what does that cost?
I love that real shit that feel good
Good head that feel good
I'mma be all off in that womb
And I'm hopin' to God that you feel good
I'mma go fast or slow, on the bed or floor
Mama, I just wanna take you away
Long hair, you don't care
Lovin' the fact that you all in my space
The way you lookin' at me, that's gon' get you that
Ooh and I put everything on it
Keep talkin' that shit that'll get you that

Girl, I swear the way you move your body (turn up)
Put that on my mama, you gon' get that
And you know I've seen a whole lot of shit
Ain't no bitch out here can copy that (ain't no another bitch can copy that - go and take it all off)
And you done fucked a few of my niggas
But I find myself still wanting that (hey)
Hey something's wrong with my mind
I apologize for my thoughts (my thoughts)
I've been thinkin' 'bout that
Let me make you say "ooh"
A whole lot of that, ain't no another bitch that can copy that
Take it all off and do that, you gotta take it all off
Take it all off, take it all off
You might also like
I apologize for my thoughts (thughts)
Don't worry 'bout my ex (my ex)
She was giving me fights (fights)
While you was givin' me sex
I'll throw you up on that sink, run that fountain over them cheeks
Bend you over that tub, got you hot here wildin' out on me
You act like a lady, you fuck like a freak
Forever my lady, you'll be a freak for me (hey)
I'm pulling all on your hair while you got your toes curling
Your eyes rolling back in your head
That good sex got you so wet you got an ocean all in my bed (oh no)
What you lookin' at? That's gon' get you that
Ooh and I'll put everything on it
That skirt right there gon' get you that

Girl, I swear the way you move your body (turn up)
Put that on my mama, you gon' get that
And you know I've seen a whole lot of shit
Ain't no bitch out here can copy that (ain't no another bitch can copy that - go and take it all off)
And you done fucked a few of my niggas
But I find myself still wanting that (hey)
Hey something's wrong with my mind
I apologize for my thoughts (my thoughts)
I've been thinkin' 'bout that
Let me make you say "ooh"
A whole lot of that, ain't no another bitch that can copy that
Take it all off and do that, you gotta take it all off
Take it all off, take it all off
Don't we look fly together?
Just look at us
Don't we fly in the place together?
We travel around this globe, girl, we international now
Astronaut - the kid
Ain't been like this in a while (turn up)
Aye - this rockstar lifestyle (move it)
I'mma share it all with ya (what up)
I'mma ball it all with ya (what up)
I'mma splurge it all with ya
Come and get this presidential Rollie that I've got for ya

Girl, I swear the way you move your body (turn up)
Put that on my mama, you gon' get that
And you know I've seen a whole lot of shit
Ain't no bitch out here can copy that (ain't no another bitch can copy that - go and take it all off)
And you done fucked a few of my niggas
But I find myself still wanting that (hey)
Hey something's wrong with my mind
I apologize for my thoughts (my thoughts)
I've been thinkin' 'bout that
Let me make you say "ooh"
A whole lot of that, ain't no another bitch that can copy that
Take it all off and do that, you gotta take it all off
Take it all off, take it all off2Embed
