Gone Lyrics
Gone, gone, she got me gone
Girl you know you got me gone
Nelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Boy you know you got me gone

Yeah... uh-uhh, yeah, ay
'Member that chick that used to live right up the block from me?
I seen her yesterday, and she's still fly
She's still right, still tight, still fine
Yup, I still wanna make her mine
And uhh, I want much more than just a moment
See I ain't tryin' to lease or tryin to rent, I'm tryin' to own it
Yeahhhh, this time I'll make my move
This time I'll show and prove, prove that I'm really irreplaceable
Plus I don't know if she ever been told
But I got whatever she needs, yeah
And whichever way we go
No one could ever take what we've got
Right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all
I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
Girl you know you got me gone
I'd do it all again if I have to, you ain't gotta ask boo
Boy you know you got me gone
Kelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Girl you know you got me gone
Nelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Boy you know you got me gone

You know I still got the love for you baby (baby)
You still be drivin' me crazy (crazy)
And all of my heart, will forever be yours
And no one could ever break what we've got
Right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all

I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
