Greed, Hate, Envy Lyrics
Right up in here, is the sweet spot
Stay right up in here, and don't bend under pre'sure
Is that what it is? The cake will do
Uhh, uhh uhh, the cake will do
Tell 'em, fuck the shame, tell 'em
Fuck the game, don't let the game fuck you
Check it out

I opened up shop at 13
Dimes, dubs, quarter sacks and O-Z's
From hand-held, digital to triple-beam
Now my pa-ger's an e-mail flip screen
Expanded my game off into amphetamines
Looked around and had a small Walgreens
Put the word out on the street don’t you fuck with my fiends
Them niggas around the corner then let the thing beam
Now they done let it burn out, phone a ching ching
Just another hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
'Cause the house, the cars, and the coffee take cream
I might ride the Range with the Rollie on the rocks
Or push a candy-colored Cutlass with a matching G Shock
When the spot get hot don't stop, move shop
Find another block restock and take it from the top now
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do

So you think you're the shit nigga Ya smell me
Shouts out to my nigga Nore
I'll never take another man's glory
Shit don't mix like Shaq and Kobe
Now you know me, I be low key
On these icey Rollie, dudes done showed me
And hoes ignored me, now they blow me
Them niggas that loaned me, now they owe me
Oh me, oh my, I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes
Now call me a lie
While you five stand by I stand by the captain
Ho play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin' higher than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days, a weekend man, I walk in yo church reekin
Aunt Esther called me, “A heathen, old fish-eyed fool”
Bitch had the nerve to repeat it, “Old fish-eyed fool” c'mon

Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do

One time out in the Range Rover
(Woop, woop, woop) Aww shit they pulled me over
What the hell y'all fuckin' wit' me fo'?
Speed limit 30 just doin' 34
"Yeah son, where the gun?" It's at home wit the dope
"Oh you a smart ass, hah?" Nah, that's my lil joke
"How 'bout I tow yo' truck in?" Ain't no need to be provoked
Besides everything up in here done been smoked
I ain't got nothin' but tapes and CDs
Pocket full of G's and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees
Ain't no more questions then hand me my ID
You could tell he was pissed
'Cause the black man in the Black Range
Doin' black things with his black change
Doin' the right thing, drivin' his ass insane
And if I wasn't in his face he probably be callin' me names
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Greed, hate, envy, what cake will do
Fuck the game don't let the game fuck you
Follow the rules stay cool and rock jewels
