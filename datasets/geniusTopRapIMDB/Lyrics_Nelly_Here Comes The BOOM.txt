Here comes the
Here comes the
Here comes the
Ya'll don't really want it now (BOOM!)
Here comes the (BOOM!)
Here comes the (BOOM!)
Here comes the
Ya'll don't really want it now (BOOM!)
Here comes the (BOOM!)
Here comes the (BOOM!)
Here comes the
Ya'll don't really want it now (BOOM!)
It's the N-E-Double L-Y
I said it so I keep it realz up in my hood, on the dirty like Bledsoe
Ain't got no twist in my hair, but I'm still dread throwin
I gots plenty of bread so I go to bed full now
Ain't in it to win, to win it I'm all in
I might call you my cuz youngblood, but we ain't kin naw
Ya think of jumpin man, you best think again
Lil dirty, I'm the type of man that might could go for revenge
Have some not so nice friends,kick the door off the hinge
Take the door of ya Benz, p-p-pop 4 of your friends
This here ain't cynical (Uh uh)
Mental, subliminal, I'm physical, financial, and mental to be a general
Lil mama come, she want a soldier
Not the type be in the tank, but in that Rover
I'm in the zone like AIDS full blown
I'm killin it like a blind man readin, I'm feelin it like (BOOM!)


He really think he gutter
When he know he soft as butter
He ain't never been a fighter
You can go and ask his mother
I'm a lover and a fighter, producter and a writer
Give your girl a quick fix, and give ya man a nice shine
(Ya'll don't really want it) And I can tell just by lookin
That you the type to run and go and tell just by lookin at ya
You want a mission for recognition by dissin
Then have no problem till the record started rippin
(Ya'll don't really want it) So let me tell ya the deal
I'm oh so serious, I'm dirty, I'm no longer for real
LIKE A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP, a Glock grip on the pump
From leavin you in da trunk, somewhere prepared to dump
(Ya'll don't really want it) So quit actin like you deaf
I'm LOOKIN TO MY RIGHT, tryna see who's left
So uh, you better watch it fore I stick to the plan
And be the next Artest to run up in your stands like (BOOM!)
You might also like

Ya'll don't really want it, don't really want it
Ya'll don't really want it with me
I know ya shook man, you ain't built for
As scared as a nigga can be
It's gon sound like (BOOM!)
When I'm comin like (BOOM!)
When I'm comin like (BOOM!)
When I come for ya
It's gon sound like (BOOM!)
When I'm comin like (BOOM!)
When I'm comin like (BOOM!)
When I come for ya
It's gon sound like (BOOM!)
