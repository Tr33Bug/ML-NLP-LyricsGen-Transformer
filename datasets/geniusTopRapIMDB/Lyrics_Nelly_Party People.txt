Party People Lyrics
This is a motherfuckin emergency~!
(Let's go) Zone Fo', St. Louis - you ready?
Haha, A-T-L... let's go!
I told y'all I was gon' change the game
L.A. all day! They can't stop ya boy
They can't stop ya boy, I get money!
 Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready, hey!

Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the flo', girls all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
 X2
It's Nelly motherfucker comin' straight up out the Lou' and
All you New Edition-ass rappers better cool it now
'Fore I make a fool of y'all, paper stacked as tall as Yao
Ming, look at the bling, settings in rings lookin like basketballs

Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the flo', girls all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

Well it's Fergie motherfucker comin' straight from Cali-for-ni-A
Stuntin' in my loc-locs, dreamin 'bout me M.I.A
Boyfriend wonderin' where I'm at, cause I'm in the spot-spot
Why he always tryin' to be puttin' me down on lock lock?

Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

Patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Watchin' these haters done come with they rhymes
Watchin' these suckers all mimickin', gimmickin'
Then they start fallin' off one at a time
You be the searcher but you never could find
I promise you durrty I'm one of a kind
Mold is broken, the formula's mine
I killed the idea and destroyed the design
I was patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine
All of you haters can kiss my behind
Specifically speakin' I'm talkin 'bout mine
Don't need you to tell me I know that I'm fine
I'm killin' it baby so call it a crime
Yeah you watch it but I'm stealin' my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry
At the liquor store
Girls, go fuck on tour
Where my party people at, oh?

Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the flo', girls all over me
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?
Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?

Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
