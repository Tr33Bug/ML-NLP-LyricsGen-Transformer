The Fix Lyrics
Yeah, Mustard on the beat ho

Shawty hit me on the late night
Got a man, got me thinkin', shawty, ain’t right (Ain’t right)
She say she ain't about the creep life (Creep life)
But all she wanna do is take pipe
I ain't mad at nobody (Nobody)
I just wanna have your body (Your body)
Now, I can give you the key, girl
Or you can meet me in the lobby
Talkin' 'bout it
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, 'til I reach your ocean
Oh, so come and get this dick

When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin'
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'
Oh, baby
(Talkin' 'bout)
Baby

Bust it open every time I get up inside
Soakin' wet, turn the bed to a slip 'n' slide
Spread eagle, nigga eatin' like it's suppa time
Shawty knows whose is it, it's all mine
I ain't mad at nobody (No-ooo)
I just wanna have your body (Your body, body)
And if you can take it deep
Then let a nigga like me, get at that body girl
You might also like
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, 'til I reach your ocean
Oh, so come and get this dick

When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin'
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'

Oh, baby
(Talkin' 'bout)
Baby
(Sweat 'em all out)
Baby
(I can't hold it much longer)
Baby
(I'm gettin' stronger and stronger)
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beatin' outta your chest
(Heart beatin' outta yo chest)
And when that pressure's buildin' (Ah)
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feelin'
I got sexual healin'
Oh, baby
