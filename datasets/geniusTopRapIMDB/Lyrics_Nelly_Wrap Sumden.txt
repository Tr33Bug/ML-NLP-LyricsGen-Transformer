Wrap Sumden Lyrics
Mo, Mo, Wrap Sumden Mo
Wrap Sumden
Why you still holdin' that?
Why you still holdin' that shit, my nigga?

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Yeah, yeah
You see Biggie be like, "What's Beef?"
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours, like a prescription I'm smoking
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool "J's" I mean bud
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden always, I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point "A" ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, I get high, you might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors
You know how we do it kid, we get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden)
Make a nigga clap something, get all mad and slap something
Yo, grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time
And I burn mine, don't you ever, ever touch mine
Fire it up, dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get blowed

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Yeah, yeah
All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more
But since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though
I keep the pants sag, bubble eye hands rag
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
"What we doin' today?" Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Okay, made a left so continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo, I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Ayo, this is no lie-ie-ie
Me and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh
Yo, if you look up in the sky-y-y
You might see us floating by-y-y
Yeah, yeah

Damn Mo, you still got the blunt?
Still got the blunt
The song is over and you still got-
I mean, I just got it from Murphy
All my niggas with the Wrap Sumden
