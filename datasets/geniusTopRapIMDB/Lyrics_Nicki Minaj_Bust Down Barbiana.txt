Bust Down Barbiana Lyrics
Bust down, Barbiana, bust down, Barbiana
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up

Uh, ayo, I been a bad bitch, cockiana (Cockiana)
And I'm still winnin', Pacquiana (Pacquiana)
Percocets, popiana, killin' everybody beat
Thank you, next, Ariana (Ariana)
You gon' have to give me topiana (Topiana)
If you tryna get some sloppiana (Sloppiana)
I call my opps Oppiana (Oppiana)
Then shut down Yves Saint, Lauriana (Lauriana)
I don't want you on my page, blockiana (Blockiana)
Flow tailor made, like Teyana (Like Teyana)
They copyin' my style, copiana
Roger that, over, copiana
Benihana to Katana, bitch, I been a Donna
He screamin' my government: O-Onika Tanya
You look like Nicki now, still you tacky-ana
To keep it 100, bitch you wacky-ana
In the hood like Kiana, or a Tatiana
Immigrant from Trinidad, rep Americana
I'm 'bout to shut it down at Met Galiana
You peanut head bitches is always jellyana
I'm 'bout to get a ring in my bellyana
Tattoo my man name, then give him some beckiana (Beckiana)
85, comma, plus three zeros (Three zeros)
Plus another comma plus three zeros (Three zeros)
Then add a dot (Dot)
Bop a dot dot, bop a dot dot doh
Been at the top
Before this song came out, bitch you been a thot (Been a thot)
Bust down, Barbiana, bust down, Barbiana (Barbiana)
Then back that shit up (That shit up)
On the gang, then back that shit up (That shit up)
On the mags, then back that shit up (That shit up)
Bust down, Barbiana, bust down (Bust down)
Then pick that shit up (That shit up)
On the gang, Barbiana (Barbiana)
Bust down, bust down, Barbiana (Barbiana)

Uh
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit upYou might also like62Embed
