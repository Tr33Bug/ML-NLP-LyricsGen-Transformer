I Lied Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you (Love you, love you)
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Don’t touch me" (Touch me, touch me)
I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, "Let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Fuck you" (Fuck you, fuck you)
I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)
You might also like
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you (Ooh)
It’s over now, goodbye, love (Ah, oh)
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart (You'll stay in my heart) forever141Embed
