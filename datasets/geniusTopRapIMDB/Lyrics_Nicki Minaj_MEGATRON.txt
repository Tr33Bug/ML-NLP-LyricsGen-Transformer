MEGATRON Lyrics

They call me Megatron, just did a telethon
He got Margielas on, and I get my jealous on
I fuck him like I miss him, he just came out of prison
Bitches be talkin' shit, but they ain't got a pot to piss in
My name is Nicki M, I'm in a sticky Benz
That mean it's candy apple red, I'm Barbie, this is Ken
That is a Fendi fact, I'm with a hunnid macs
Oh, this is custom made, Donatella sent me that
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

Shots, shots, shots, I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm-

Shots, shots, shots, I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm-

They call me Megatron, shorty's a mega con
It ain't about the race either, it's the marathon
I put the squeeze on him, th-throw up the Bs on him
Th-that ass clappin' on the D, Hercules on him
My name is baddie, baddie, I keep it tight for zaddy
He keep it comin', comin', he ain't even drop the Addy
Trunk in the front-front, I need a blunt-blunt
I own my own moscato, bitch, we gettin' drunk-drunk

Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

Bite me, bite me, that excite me

If you eatin' it, do it precisely
'Cause I'm a millionaire, this pussy pricey
(Yup, it might be, yup, it might be)
He said it's my pussy (Yup, it might be)
M-my pussy, m-my pussy (Yup, it might be)
'Cause I'm a millionaire, this pussy pricey

Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
