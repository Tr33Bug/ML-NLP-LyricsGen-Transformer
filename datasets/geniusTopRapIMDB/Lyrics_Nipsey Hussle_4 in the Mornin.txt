4 in the Mornin Lyrics[Intro]
It's that 4 in the morning shit

[Verse]
I'm off this Red Bull
I got a head full
A nigga stressed out, let's get this bed full
Sexual healing; so appealing
You a bad bitch, I'm a real nigga
Tell me that you love me
I tell you the same
That's a fucking shame
We both runnin' game
I just want your pleasure
You just want my pain
I just want you all for me and you just want the same
Let's take a flight; let's live this life
Let's get a hotel, let's both spend a night
I'm a busy nigga, you a busy girl
It's a fast life we liven' in this busy world
We in my fast car, you ain't no fast broad
You got yo' heart broke, he did yo' ass wrong
Plus yo' dad gone, let me be yo' daddy
I wanna see you happy we both come from broken families
You can tell the truth, I'mma tell it too
We gon' smoke this weed 'til they kick us out the room
Like fuck it, that's life
Fuckin' tonight; we fuckin' right?
You fuckin' right
I ain't goon' lie to you; I know I'm fly to you
Nah, fuck that girl I'm the sky to you
Ocean in the clouds; birds and the bees
Your friends proud when they know that you fuckin' with me
I got you poppin', I'll take you shoppin'
Around the world; started on Slauson
That's real shit; real shit
I know all my real bitches feel this
4 in the morning, tell me that you want it
Bend you over, I got you moaning
You love this shit, you want this shit
You got this shit, no politics
[Outro]
Smoke something with you?
It's like we pouring' some more drink
Get yours, I got mine
This that real shit
Sittin' on the top floor of the fly ass hotel drunk as fuck with a bad bitch
Make you appreciate life
Nigga work hard you know
7 days a week we do this shit
You should do it with me
When I'm gone, shit play this
I ain't trippin' on shit, ain't no rules in this
Fuck 'em all though
