7 Days A Week Lyrics[Intro]
Yuh, me and my nigga Rimpau was on the way to the studio
And cuz had that, um, that Wiz and Curren$y mixtape in the tape deck, the CD changer
And I heard this beat I'm like, "What the fuck?"
Yahp!
Ya know, only thought it's right for my 58,000th leak
Shit, hear we go
Like this, look

[Verse]
Seven days a week, seven different freaks
But I got tired of fuckin' hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watchin' Godfather, leather couches, flat screens
I say I'm on this marathon, she ask me, “What does that mean?”
Ain't no puff and pass, please roll your own, I do the same
Girl, get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame, that's why you're not used to this game
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin' gear 'cause I don't need no runway
My final destination is a cloud, it's a one-way
Fuckin' with them streets, ain't no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I don't never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets, never on no sober shit
Post-traumatic stress, I feel like that's what I'm copin' with
So I smoke the best, impossible not to notice this
30,000 feet up, I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time ain't even over yet
I'm tryna live my life so when it's over I got no regrets
The keys to success, multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it 'til it's over with
Napa Valley Dolce, my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof, ayy, you know who you rollin' with
Hussle
[Break]
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You ain't gotta worry and we ain't gotta rush, 'cause we not in no hurry
You can't be afraid to let go, you gotta let go of yourself
But you ain't gotta worry, 'cause this gon' take some time
But we not in no hurry

[Outro]
58,000
