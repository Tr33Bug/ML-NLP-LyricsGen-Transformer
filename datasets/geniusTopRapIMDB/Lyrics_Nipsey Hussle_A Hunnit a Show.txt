A Hunnit a Show Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Plug (Plug)
Bidness (Bidness)

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you, girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And, nigga, I'ma die for my fuckin' respect
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
You fuckin' with a young nigga
Two twelves in the trunk, nigga
Havin' everything he want, nigga
Life in the rush nigga
Probably never good enough, nigga
All he wanna do is stunt
Nigga’s always lookin' up to him, whole spot goin' up to him
New money gettin' stuck to him
Life, it was rough to him
Skinny nigga, he was buff to it, trying to do it like Puff do it
Do it like Russ do it, real life, said, "What's up?" to it
Need a Benz, nigga, fuck Buick
Made a plan and I stuck to it
I'm the man, you a bluff to us, small talk such a sus to us
The money is a must to us
We came from these corners but we at it 'til we affluent
You gotta bring your guts to it
Tryna get it to the point they gotta bring it in a truck to us

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Rick Ross]
Yeah, look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you, girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And, nigga, I'ma die for my fuckin' respect

Smoke with me

All 'em blogs never shook a nigga
Hundred racks just to book a nigga
Greatest ever like a Brooklyn nigga
All this ice here is hard to overlook a nigga
Fell in love with that fast money
50 racks on that back end
Walk through cause four bricks
Maybachs when I back in
L.A.X., Nip, roll that pound
Poolside at that polo lounge
M-O-B, bitch, hold that down
Pinky ring, gold Rolex crown
Testify, never go that route
Black bottles, that Moët out
My first mil, I had a Kodak smile
Tell the plug, "Bring more back now"
Fake jewels, never tolerate it
Pray Boobee case exonerated
Every night I thank God I made it
Every night I thank God I made it!
My bitch bad like Paula Patton
Big ass mansion from all that rappin'
Tell the police, "Call the captain"
Motherfucker, I'ma start the clappin'
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you, girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And, nigga, I'ma die for my fuckin' respect
