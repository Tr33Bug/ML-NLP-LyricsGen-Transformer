A Miracle Lyrics[Intro]
If what I believe
Is proved to be wrong
Then I guess I'm a miracle

[Chorus]
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say that I did it
Look nigga, uh
[Verse 1]
All black everything and my diamonds all love like Vera Wang
Look, blue rags in the south of France
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? I'm a nigga that's supposed to ball
'Cause I'm a street survivor and they mold us wrong
Before rap we was rollin' stones
I drove a Cutlass coupe, would cop a quarter zone
Front of the buildin' on my mobile phone
I'm thinkin' pace myself 'cause you could overdose
Not on the drugs but the life you chose
By hangin' niggas, I don't like the row
No such thing as they might parole
They putting cameras up in microphones
They got me sandwiched in, I want a nicer home
They know I take the risk, I don't know right from wrong
Plus any given day you might be gone
No clich√© where the lines get drawn
Come on the block, it's a riot zone
For the loot niggas stoop into pirate mode
Paint with less strokes and divide you, dawg
Guns get drawn, niggas lives get lost
Never was entitled, had to fight for raw
Necessities in life, you see the reason, right?

[Chorus]
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say that I did it
Look nigga, uh

All black everything in my 600 Benz with a heavy chain
Look, you deserve a real nigga with money
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? Fell in love with a cuban
A celebrity herself, prolly fuck with her music
She the one that the shoe fit but I can't stop for love
Look how the game has seduced us
Benihana's or the Ruth's Chris
A lot of new responsibilities with all of this influence
Spendin' racks, therapeutic
So I snow flake the face like A.C.s in my new shit
One button, where the roof went?
TMZ takin' shots, say cheese for the news clips
Dope boys and them boosters
Gangbangers and hoopers
My style is inclusive, the streets is abusive
But it's life, my nigga, wanna survive, gotta shoot shit
Hella thick skin, never bruise quick
Yellow wrists and some 7-speed shit
I talk to you on some suck a D shit
All visual, nigga going digital, nigga
Not the smartest nigga but its visceral, nigga
My understandin' on a level kinda different, my nigga
Every time I drop, the city a feel it
Every time you hate, you gotta be kiddin'
Every time I pull up, the foreign is kitted
And I can't even really walk through the Beverly Center
Hudson jeans on, ain't the regular denim
I bought the 600, not the regular Benz
Famous without a deal, that ain't regular nigga
Tired of tellin' you niggas I'm not a regular nigga, no!
[Chorus]
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say I did it
Look nigga, uh5Embed
