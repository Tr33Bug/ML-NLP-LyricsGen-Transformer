TranslationsFran√ßaisAll Get Right Lyrics[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Smokin' Backwoods, marathon OG
Uh, what? Hussle
Yeah, I feel brand new like I just started this shit, uh
Like at the beginning
I know y'all been waiting
My foundation's solid, let's take flight, ayy, look

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I got that good, still in the hood
I kept my word, yeah my nigga, I make good
6 figure niggas in them v-12s
No tint, nigga, so you see well
My Cuban link, that's 14k
My presidential, I wear it every day
It symbolizes, how I'm enterprising
I came from lint in Dickie pockets so I emphasize it
You check the filing, niggas say I kept it solid
But fuck the rumors, money talks and you made less deposits
I dropped some videos, you should go check the comments
They love me all around the world my nigga, what's your problem?

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
All my liquor from France, my cars from Frankfurt
Told them keep they advance, distribute and market my label
I own it all, I own it all, word in them offices is that I want it all
That's right I do, now who the fuck is you?
To question my request, I paid my fucking dues
Had a couple dreams, now they coming true
I'm at the Porsche lot, asking do they come in coupes?
Walking out the club with a hundred goons
Magnum bottles of the Veuve, and a pungent fume
Model bitches stunting in them fucking shoes
Bring your homegirl 'cause she coming too
Fast cars with them leather seats
Drop top, she a fucking freak
Blow me down while we ride on PCH
I'm Nip Hussle the great, middle fingers in your face, uh
You might also like[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life

[Verse 3: J Stone]
I'm Infant Stone, I just came home
My flow is sick, disinfect the microphone
In '08 we told you we was never gon'
Change, and we still on this marathon
I'm a heavy hitter like Barry Bonds
Lightweight setback for a heavy arm
Now I'm jumping on stage with my jewelry froze
Fresh out, spending money, killed the movie role
It's all money in like a Brinks truck
And it's no money out like a prenup
You need to get your green up
'Cause me and my team up
Light up some flight, lace up my Nikes
Victory lap, tonight is the night
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life (Stone)

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn off the lights (Bleh), turn up my mic (Ahh)
Roll up some flight (Nigga), let's all get right (Haha)
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
Turn off the lights (Yeah), turn up my mic (Yeah)
Roll up some flight (Bleh), let's all get right (Right)
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life (Right)
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]
