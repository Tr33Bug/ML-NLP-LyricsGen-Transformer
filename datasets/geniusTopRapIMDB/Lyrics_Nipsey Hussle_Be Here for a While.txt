Be Here for a While Lyrics[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
That's right...
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me, I kept this shit super solid
Came up, and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe, I got stupid dollars
I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me, fooly; if I wrote a script, it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice
About taking risks, you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you's a fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you's a God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit, like, "How the fuck did we build this?"
Real shit, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Came in the game then I passed up
And I can't stop, won't stop
I'm the type to get more guap
You the type to fa sho flop
I'm from Brynhurst and them dope spots
Now look
[Chorus: Vernardo]
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
(See you, they stop and stare)
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes (Switchin' lanes)
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Aye, check it out, look
I'm still runnin' laps, takin' fades, I still run it back
Talkin' guns, I got a hundred straps
And I be in your bush if you fuck wit' Fats, that's a fact
I don't fuck wit' rats
This boss life, I got a lust for that
Pullin' up at Sak's, blow a hundred sacks in my V12
I don't fuckin' slack, not at all
I gotta ball, they shot my dog
Rest in peace, my nigga, Frogg
Life is short, nigga, then it's gone
But in the meantime we tryna get it all
You should get involved, I'm really raw
Before this rap shit, I really balled
Alpina's, nigga, on white Lincoln's, nigga
Black Beamers, nigga, they can't see us, nigga, naw
Sometimes I get so offended by it
Don't compare me to none of these fuckin' liars
I'm fuckin' flyer, I'm fuckin' realer
Play wit' me, I'll be a fuckin' killer
Dropped seven tapes wit' no fuckin' filler
Now Victory Lap's my fuckin' Thriller, uh
If you broke, I ain't fuckin' wit' you
Unless you went broke while you was fuckin' wit' me
Then we bounce back 'cause it's nothing really
Gon' do it big 'til they fuckin' kill me

It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
(See you, they stop and stare)
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes (Switchin' lanes)
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while

[Interlude: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah
I could remember, like, bangin' on the MPC late night
Gettin' kicked outta the house because of that shit
Catchin' the 108 to the Blue Line
Niggas sittin' on the bridge, loadin' up they burners, sweatin'
We were just kids tryna get to it
Takin' losses, stayin' down
Frustration
Go looking back at the shit right now, it's like, it's nothin'
It's gon' feel like that for you, too
Hustlers

[Chorus: Vernardo]
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
(See you, they stop and stare)
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes (Switchin' lanes)
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while4Embed
