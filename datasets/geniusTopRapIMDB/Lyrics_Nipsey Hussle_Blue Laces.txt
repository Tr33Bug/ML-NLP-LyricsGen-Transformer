Blue Laces Lyrics[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I'm from Westside California, they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo' tats under yo' clothin'
Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it, say the wrong hood, bullets explodin'
I trust few people these days 'cause that's golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with
And chose to keep inside they circle
Satan sittin' on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit, my whole clique notorious
You've heard of us, six Os is murderers
You still servin' clucks, jealous nigga, you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts, spillin' Patr√≥n out my cup
She can't get enough, buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin' too much, I just do my stuff
Yeah, I just do my stuff
Hussle, Hussle
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch

[Verse 2]
I got Slauson on my back, Ed Hardy on my hip
Weight of the world on my shoulders, gold rollie on my wrist
Neighborhood chucks, blue checkerboard tint
Dickies saggin' off my ass, walk with a hoodsta limp
Two bricks on my white tee, same color cocaine
I ain't talkin' dope, I mean the price of my gold chain
All money in, no money out, that was my slogan
What I mean by that is stack it up and don't spend no change
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Seven grams was thirty rocks, that was my program
The block propane, young nigga, no change
Shoot-out with no aim, so they know yo name
'Cause where yo mama paid rent, that was yo gang
So when yo homeboy bled, that was yo pain
And if y'all both catch a case, you don't say no names
That's just the code of the color of my shoe strings

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch

Been so many places, seen so many things
Niggas stood against tryna chase that cream
This ain't livin'
This ain't livin, no
You thinkin' you gettin' paid, hustlin' everyday
My homies passin' away, no
This ain't livin' (Hustle, nigga)
This ain't livin, no

[Verse 3]
Look
What happened to the code? Streets all in shambles
Niggas powderin' they nose, put the shame to what we stand for
They think we on some kill another nigga shit
We really on some stay down and diligent
The streets is cold, turn innocence to militants
Young niggas gangbangin' for the thrill of it
Pops was gone, moms was never home
But the streets was right there so they took you as they own

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch2Embed
