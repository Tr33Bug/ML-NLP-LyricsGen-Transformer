Checc Me Out Lyrics[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
That's what it is
It's really what it is
Yeah

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy & (Nipsey Hussle)]
New Nipsey Hussle (Checc me out)
You in trouble (Checc me out)
Pay us now (Checc me out)
Or pay me double (Checc me out)
New Nipsey Hussle (Checc me out)
New Nipsey Hussle (Checc me out)
New Nipsey Hussle (Checc me out)
Nigga, fuck it (Checc me out)
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Nigga, fuck it, I came from nothing
Shootouts in public, ridin' buses
Buyin' Benzes, was buying buckets
Knock me off of my grind, that's what they wasn't
My life was ugly, and I got money
Caught a glimpse of that, but that's not for me
She say she love me, she think she love me
She want my money, I think she funny
Uh, a-all bad bitches
V12 engines
Broke niggas die slow
While the rich get richer

[Interlude]
Shit like that
Sound like it looks

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy & (Nipsey Hussle)]
We on the 'shaw (Checc me out)
Above the law (Checc me out)
I sag my pants (Checc me out)
To show my draws (Checc me out)
This how we ball (Checc me out)
Slauson Mall (Checc me out)
I fuck 'em once (Checc me out)
And never call (Checc me out)
Nigga

All bad bitches, (It's All Money In, by the way)
V-12 engines (Supreme)
Broke niggas die slow (It’s on your feet)
While the rich get richer

[Verse 2: Cobby Supreme]
Balenciagas, no Gucci problems
Get money with Timers, Louis V persona
Hit a nigga with a llama
You don’t want them problems
I do my thang in the kitchen
See, that's a Pyrex vision
And I roll with the riches
Stay flippin' those bitches
Stay away from the snitches
That's how you get those stitches
Only fuck with my circle
No square ass niggas
And we don't smoke on purple
Only kush out the Benzes
Where a nigga come from?
My niggas is so relentless
We don't play no games
Send a nigga to the dentist
Or to the ICU, that's how I see you
All about my business
All Money business, bitches
[Bridge: Nipsey Hussle]
All bad bitches
V-12 engines
Broke niggas die slow
While the rich get richer

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy & (Nipsey Hussle)]
OPM (Checc me out)
All Money in (Checc me out)
That's a Beamer (Checc me out)
And a Benz (Checc me out)
We do it big (Checc me out)
Fucking twins (Checc me out)
We fuck they friends (Checc me out)
Please come again (Checc me out)
Please come again (Checc me out)
Please come again (Checc me out)
That's what I told her (Checc me out)
Please come again, ay (Checc me out)
Please come again (Checc me out)
Please come again (Checc me out)
OPM (Checc me out)
All Money In (Checc me out)
Nigga

[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]
Y'all see this shit, uh
Everything I operate go fast
Today, the day go by when I ain't got
If I want it, then that's how it should be
That's what we run this game for
