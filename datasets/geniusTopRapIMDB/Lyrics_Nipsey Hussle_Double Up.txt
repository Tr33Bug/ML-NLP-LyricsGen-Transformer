TranslationsFran√ßaisDouble Up Lyrics[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin' no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (Yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Turned seven to a fourteen
Fourteen to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game
Switched up on you hoes, man
Big body take both lanes
Backseat, blowin' propane
All-black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own, man
My new shit sound like it's "Soul Train"
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we for sure bang
Tiny Locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the '80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
But you drove to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drive-bys, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

Never let a hard time humble us
Double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (Yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly & DOM KENNEDY]
I'd leave it behind if you let me
Ironic, I'd drown just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I bring you up, you just let me down
Let me down (Uh, let me down)
(Need my All Money In chain too)
Let me down (Woah, let me down, look out, look out)

[Verse 2: DOM KENNEDY]
It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk, I'ma shine
Might've been way before its time
Posted with my back against the wall
Life is a bitch, but she mine
The rag six-deuce, yeah, it's mine
The Westside too, yeah, it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall at the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendletons
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip, so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up (Yeah)
Three or four times, I ain't tellin' no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (Yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly]
I'd leave it behind if you let me
Ironic, I'd drown just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I bring you up, you just let me down
Let me down (Let me down)
Let me down (Let me down, look out, look out)24Embed
