Grinding All My Life Lyrics[Chorus]
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look
All my life, been grindin' all my life (Yup)
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price (Woah)
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look

[Verse 1]
I'm married to this game, that's who I made my wife
Said I'd die alone, I told that bitch she probably right
One thing that's for sure, not a stranger to this life
Got a safe that's full of Franklins and a shoulder full of stripes (Ah)
Don't know a nigga like myself
I say self-made meanin' I designed myself
County jail fades, you could pull my file yourself
Spot raid, swallow rocks, I'm gettin' high myself
Look, and damn right, I like the life I built
I'm from Westside, 60, shit, I might got killed
Standin' so tall, they think I might got stilts
Legendary baller like Mike, like Wilt
'96 Impala, thug life on wheels
Up against the walls, squabble at Fox Hills
Like a motherfuckin' boss, ask me how I feel
Successful street nigga touchin' them first mils (Woah)
[Chorus]
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look
All my life, been grindin' all my life (Yup)
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price (Woah)
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look

[Verse 2]
I got everythin' I said I was gon' get, on my kid
In addition to that fact, I went legit, I'm the shit
Now accordin' to the way that I'm positioned in this biz
It look like I'm just gon' keep on gettin' rich (Ah)
Know them Westside RSCs is us
LAPD on my dick, I'ma squeeze and bust
If a rap nigga diss, Swiss cheese his bus
All this rap money, nigga, look, I need too much
Money, loyalty and love, in the dream we trust
You be switchin' up the players on your team too much
Tiny Cobby, that's my Loc, Young Supreme, what's up?
Ain't we travel 'round the world gettin' cream or what?
Ain't you get off on whoever Hussle seem to rush?
Las Vegas, strip pop, yeah, you creamed them punks
After all that lookin' tough, all he seen was stumps
50 Cent and Mayweather fleed the scene with us
True story

Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look
All my life, been grindin' all my life (Yup)
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price (Woah)
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look16Embed
