Hussle & Motivate Lyrics[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Pull up in motorcades, I got a show today
This all I'm tryna do, hustle and motivate
Choppers a throwaway, hustle the Hova way
That's why they follow me, huh? They think I know the way
'Cause I took control of things, ballin' the solo way
And if you pattern my trend, I make you my protege
Slauson Ave soldier raised, niggas don't know them days
Take you in back of the buildings, make you expose your age
Take you across the tracks, make you explode a face
Now you official now, but you got a soul to save
I just been cookin' that new, I'm 'bout to drop in a few
Think if I call it the great, the people gon' call it the truth
Ain't really trip on the credit, I just paid all of my dues
I just respected the game, now my name all in the news
Trippin' on all of my moves, quote me on this, got a lot more to prove
Remember I came in this bitch fresh out the county with nothin' to lose
[Chorus: Maurice David Wade]
And I don't do this for nothin', nah, from the ground up, yeah
But I don't do this shit for nothin', no, no, not at all, yeah
My mama need rent, ma need rent, yeah, she do, aw yeah
So I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, all
I told her I got it, oh, yeah
So I don't do this shit for nothin', not at all, from the ground up
Hustle and motivate (Woo)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Back in this bitch like I never left
Stand for some shit that you never rep
Passing through stages in life
Through the ups and the downs like it's all just another test
Live by the rules like a fuckin' ref
I got respect in a hundred sets
Too many chains, need another chest
Playin' no games if it wasn't chess
Cut from that cloth that you couldn't stretch
Cut from that circle you couldn't test
Heavily pressured and under stress
Even though niggas ain't show it, we was a mess
Honest attempt, play him to the left
Judge a young nigga by they address
Left us no option, what they expect?
Only thing we knew for sure was to bang the set
Fuck livin' basic, I'm takin' risks
Fuck what they sayin', I'm sayin' this
Don't waste your time, it don't make you rich
It don't mean nothin', so fuck 'em, let's make a grip
Double up, triple up, make it six
Ballin' so hard, you could pay a bitch
Lead to the lake if they wanna fish
Make sure them niggas around you stick to the script
This should be written in stone
You should come visit my zone
Don't take my word, double-check all of my flows
Ask 'em how Hussle got on
But fuck what you heard
This is for who walked down that road
Sold everything but they soul
Straight off the curb, real niggas rich as you nerds
Addressed to whom it may concern
I don't do this for nothin', nah
You might also like[Chorus: Maurice David Wade]
From the ground up, yeah
But I don't do this shit for nothin', no, no, not at all, yeah
My mama need rent, ma need rent, yeah, she do, aw yeah
So I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, all
I told her I got it, oh, yeah
So I don't do this shit for nothin', not at all, from the ground up
Hustle and motivate (Woo)


[Outro: Maurice David Wade & Nipsey Hussle]
Hustle and motivate, hustle and motiv— (Cut the bass out)
Hustle and motiv—, hustle and motivate (All Money In, nigga)
Hustle and motiv—, hustle and motiv—
Hustle and motiv—, hustle and motivate
