Hussle in the House Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look, I'm comin' straight off of Slauson
A crazy motherfucker named Nipsey
I'm turnt up cause I grew up in the 60s
Caution to you rap niggas try and diss me
I go hard that's why your bitch wanna flip me
Big guns, nigga, turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips, I give a fuck who you 'posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it's rap money, no advance, it's all royalties
You broke, nigga, you could follow me
It's fuck bitches, get money, keep some hollow heads logically
And I'm from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work, it's a policy (Hussle, Hussle)
It's white chalk on the corners
It's yellow tape on the gates
Choppers up above
That's 'cause the Tiny Locs runs the streets where I'm from
[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on (Hussle, Hussle)
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house (Hussle, Hussle)

[Verse 2]
Blue rag, S-hat, gold on my neck fat
Gun case, catch that, cuz, Neighborhood, I rep that
Shoot first, ask last, move work, fast cash
Brynhurst, 10th Ave, squabble if you get mad (Hussle, Hussle)
And in my lifetime, I seen a lot of death
A couple cold nights, it look like it was nothin' left
But God got me, so I got him tatted on my flesh
Slauson, nigga, you ain't heard shit yet
Cuzzy, Cobby, Hoodsta Rob, Tiny Draws
Infant Stone, when he come home, then baby, we dog
And can't forget my big brother Blacc Sam
Just a young hood nigga with a million dollar plan

[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on (Hussle, Hussle)
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house (Hussle, Hussle), look
You might also like[Verse 3]
I came from nothin', so did every other rapper
Save the speculation, real banger, gun clapper
Silence, hit the opposition with the MAC
I'll turn him into candles on the curb over blood splats
Fuck rest in peace shirts, nigga, where your guns at?
It done been two weeks and we ain't seen no get back
Type of shit is that? Your Crippin' is wack
You ain't poppin', you ain't turfed up, nigga, you off-deck
I promise, I'll be out lurking with the pump
Gooned up, black hoodie on, chopper in the trunk
Ready to hop out, and do my motherfuckin' stuff
Six-oh, nigga, that's what's up, huh

[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on (Hussle, Hussle)
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house (Hussle, Hussle)3Embed
