I Don’t Give a Fucc Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town

[Verse 1]
Look, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'
She told me I'ma lose my life
I ain't trippin', I'm a crip and I'ma do it right
'Fore I run from a nigga I'll lose the fight
I gotta hustle, Mama, I'ma move the white
If I died and came back I'd do it twice
Brainwashed by the block, it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night
Mama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside
Couple niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside
Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside
Reminiscin' on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket
Life's a bitch, nigga, fuck it!
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town

[Verse 2]
Chyeah, they say we probably die slangin', bangin', pressin' the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a chopper for the coppers, keep a TEC in the ride
Every nigga got a limit, never step on the line
When the set say it's on I'm expected to ride
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga, it's cold in my hood, ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope, smokin' dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I rode chrome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil' off what I wrote in my hood
I ain't trippin' 'cause niggas know I spoke for my hood
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town

"Bigger Than Life" (Starts at 4:20)

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
What up?
What it do?
Music Corner
I'd like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need your hands up though
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I don't want your love, it’s not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach, it just seems so confusin'
That I felt my place in life, a young black man, it's seems so useless
But I don’t want no help, just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife that's in my back'll be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it, I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hopin' as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print
And you follow 'til it change your life, it’s all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion 'cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it’s not material 'cause that’s all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institution double standard
Actin' like they not the reason we ruthless
But tonight
[Chorus: June Summers & Nipsey Hussle]
Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history
Don't judge me by my progress
Look

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standin'
Y’all can say it's luck but I know that it's plannin'
Shout out to the pain that gave me understandin'
Shout out to my gang, it turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you haven’t
But it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boastin' and braggin'
This road I chose to go down, hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow, I had to let go of some habits
And it's easy to say I’m on now 'cause you see it, and it happened
But before it ever did, I had to believe and get it crackin'
So I’m gon' take you back then, 32 shots and my MAC-10
With a dream minus the means, my early teens was fuckin' tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine
That I wrestle with at night, demons that I fight I can’t get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get, it don’t matter if you plastic
We was lookin' for the lights and all we stumbled 'cross was flashes
But tonight

[Chorus: June Summers]
Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
So if it’s meant, then it’s gon' be
People love it 'cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y’all to feel me
It’s my time so I’m goin' in
We ball 'til we fall, fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin’, I know you hoes plottin'
I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Say I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Yeah, I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Yeah, I know God got me
See, I ain't worried 'bout it
'Cause I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)

[Break: Nipsey Hussle]
Once in a lifetime shit, you know?
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin' dream
Fuck what they say, do your shit

[Chorus: June Summers & Nipsey Hussle]
Tonight is my night (Marathon, nigga)
This is my moment (This shit ain't gon' stop til' I say it's gon' stop)
(It ain't  gon' stop 'til you say it's gon' stop)
Feelin' bigger than life
(And it ain't gon' be unless you make it)
But I gotta own it
(It's your time, get up off your ass)
A victory (10 toes down you here)
(I swear to God I shed tears in this booth, nigga)
Let's make history

[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]
For my niggas that's gone
For my niggas that can't be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful little girl Emani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout out my nigga Fats
Shout out my bro Adam
Shout out my A and Bs
You know what this is, it's the motherfuckin' marathon
And this shit ain't gon' stop, man
One hundred (One hundred, one hundred, one hundred)2Embed
