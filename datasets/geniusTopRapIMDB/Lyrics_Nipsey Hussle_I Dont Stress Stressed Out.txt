I Donâ€™t Stress (Stressed Out) Lyrics[Intro]
I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga

[Verse 1]
Playin' Pac in my cassette loud, nigga
I remember feelin' like a stepchild, nigga
I would hate to see my momma stressed out, nigga
Black Sam would tell me, "poke your chest out, nigga"
I could die today I've made the set proud, nigga
And I could fly away, but I respect vows, nigga
Used to always say I'd make the whole world feel this
Now I'm on the tour around the whole world, nigga
Paparazzi waitin' at my hotel, nigga
Smokin' while I'm drivin' that's with no L's, nigga
20 bands a month just for your bills, nigga
Princess cut diamonds up in your grill, nigga
Now smile in every camera and show you're a trill nigga
You feed 'em what you want cause that's your kill, nigga
And through the darkest days I was like, "oh well, nigga"
Westside neighborhood against the whole world, nigga
[Hook]
I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga

[Verse 2]
I never fold under mental pressure
I get better, ain't no code to y'all misconception
I'm just special, this an ode to my innersection
And God bless and save my soul from this imperfection
I can't measure with a number, all these niggas restin'
But it's a lot when you that young to witness life and death
You shellshocked, but ain't no tears involved
Accept it all, that's how the world revolve
Every 12 months you live another year you ball
Hindsight, it's 20-20 that was really God
Cause lookin' back it' ain't no reason why we ain't get caught
Mission after mission, we was trippin'
Me and Baby Bolt Da Fatts in Lil Killa Dave's kitchen
Police in the front, pistols in the court
When it hit the fan you get to find out who you are
Nervous as a bitch, was sweat drippin' down my palms
And think through it, thug, you got to stay calm

[Hook]
I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga

Playin' BIG in my cassette loud, nigga
I remember feelin' like the best out, nigga
They ain't feel me then, but I'm a threat now, nigga
I'm the one that represent the West now, nigga
Almost didn't make it cause the set foul, nigga
Shit'll chip you quicker than the West now, nigga
Lock you up in cages, how it went down, nigga
Ship you out of town, you need to pen pal, nigga
Plenty times I've felt like this the end now, nigga
But I catch my 2nd wind around the 10th round, nigga
Only God knows to where it went down, nigga
But if you see us up that's cause we been down, nigga
Stand up, we don't never sit down, nigga
Man up, go and get a Benz now, nigga
Damn cuhz, look at how my campaign killin'
Panoramic views, chillin' under 12-foot ceilings

[Outro]
I don't stress out, nigga
I don't stress out, nigga3Embed
