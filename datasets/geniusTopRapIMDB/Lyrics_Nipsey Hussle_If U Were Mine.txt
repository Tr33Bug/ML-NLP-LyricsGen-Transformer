If U Were Mine Lyrics[Intro: Nipsey Hussle & Sade "Cherish the Day" sample]
If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
We still up all night
And I breathe your air
Runnin' this marathon
You only can...

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, now, I can't promise commitment, but I swear we'll have fun
If you, ask I'll be honest, girl, you not the only one
Just a man on a mission, with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me, but way more people show love
Niggas tryin' too hard, they dyin' to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like it's a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different, too ashamed to just listen
See I'm way too 100, so now they hate on my niggas
Tried to hate on my Crippin', tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch, but they gon' hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip, let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider, you gotta know your position
So if it's cool, then we can hop in my Mercedes coupe
Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv'
Crank the music, blowin' circles out the roof
And just enjoy the view
She said
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Sade sample with James Fauntleroy backing]
If you were mine
I said
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
Let me hit somethin' wit' you, lil mama
Matter of fact
You only can...

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Ay, I'm not trippin', back and forth with your nigga
Scared to lose what you got as you lookin' for something different
Me? "Fly Crippin'," international trippin'
I got my numbers up and now they pay for my statistics
Yeah, young nigga, started off with a vision
Built this shit up from nothing, to the critics I ain't listen
Now, transition, so check out how I'm livin'
We V12 pushers and they transmissions is slippin'
Nigga, get yo' bitch, 'cause I be bitch-gettin'
Treat her like she wanna be treated, but I ain't trickin'
Beat it like she want her shit beated, but I don't kiss it
Just blame it on that shit that we smokin', plus we sippin'
Look, double cups, she tryna double up
'Cause I just hit it once, but she caught a double nut
Nasty, since she use to double dutch
Too quick to fall in love, what the fuck?
She said

If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can...

[Bridge: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, now, if I was yours, and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side?
So, keep yo' nigga, while I stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon' spend some time
Look, if I was yours, and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side?
So, keep your nigga and I'll stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon' spend some time
Right?

[Outro: Sade sample with James Fauntleroy backing]
If you were mine
(All Money In, No Money Out)
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air3Embed
