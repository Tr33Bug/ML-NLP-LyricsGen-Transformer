Keyz 2 the City 2 Lyrics[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
Uh, rollin' up some good, pourin' up 'til we get faded
You know how we do it, everybody takin' flicks of me
I got the keys to the city, I don't need no limousine
I turn out when I pull up and tell my bookin' agent book a show
Runnin' 'round with the paper bag
Runnin' 'round with the paper bag
Goin' crazy, spendin' all this cash
Goin' crazy, spendin' all this cash
If I spend it I'ma get it back, even when I'm ridin' 'round dirty
A nigga don't need a seatbelt, a nigga don't need a seatbelt
Nah, it don't cost to keep it real, run up, get done up
Shit can get real, fuck around and get your ass robbed
Nigga fuck around and take your shit, got you askin' God why
Drag your ass into an alley, pull out, aim for the target
Should've never been around the killers
In my town, we the fuckin' realest
No Cheddar Bobs 'round here
I get to sprayin', they gon' get down
Ski mask over my face
Catch a body in broad day
Catch a body in broad day
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
I got the key to the city, I got a ho that's saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili, tattoo my name in graffiti
Whack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of y'all niggas can't see me
None of y'all niggas can't see me

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Y'all ain't got nothin' like this over there
Bunch of front-line millionaires
Bunch of self-made, out the trunk paid
'Gainst the odds, really took it there
Any prob', I'ma reappear, with a squad you already fear
All this time I've been playin' fair, seven digits every single year
Niggas died, niggas disappeared, alibis, I was really there
Life of crime 'til I get the chair, Columbine in my trigger hair
Still I rise and I took the stairs
Feel the fire, it's a different glare
All these fights, it was never fair
Bustin' knuckles, still I'm swingin' fierce
Taste the salt inside my drippin' tears
You should know I never had a fear
You should know I never had a shot
Never had a chance, still, I took it here
Manage pride, but I see it clear, strategize, I'm an engineer
Pick a side, gotta keep it there, switchin' up, nigga, lookin' weird

I got the key to the city, I got a ho that's saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili, tattoo my name in graffiti
Whack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of y'all niggas can't see me
None of y'all niggas can't see me

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Tappin' in
Say they waitin' for it, tell the streets a nigga back again
Ridin' 'round inside the 'Bach again
Rollin' flame inside the 'Bach again
405, another traffic jam
Improvise another master plan
Sit outside a nigga family pad
Another seven grams inside a sandwich bag
My whole life is like a balance act
People's champ, but could you handle that?
I pull up inside the black on black
And park this big-ass Benz inside the handicap
What I done, they can't imagine that
One-of-one, it's like a magic trick
Matter fact, it's like a lotto pick
That's why I gotta talk a lot of shit10Embed
