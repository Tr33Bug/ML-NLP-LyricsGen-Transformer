Killer Lyrics[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios (Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip-top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy
[Chorus: Drake]
Uh
I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will never be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa, nigga

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Listen, look
Before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and you'll see what I'm 'bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blamma's out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bump you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
'Cause on a mission, your worst enemy is idle time

I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will never be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa, nigga5Embed
