Last Time That I Checcâ€™d Lyrics[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked (Checked)
I was sellin' zones in the set (Zones up in the set)
Make a quarter mil' no sweat
Last time that I checked
I'm the streets' voice out West
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked (Checked)
First, you get the money, then respect
Then the power and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked (Checked)
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'ma kill em, look
Playing no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Reinvest, double up, then explain for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And y'all niggas' false claims, it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth or you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga, what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', handled business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked (Checked)
I was sellin' zones in the set (Zones up in the set)
Make a quarter mil' no sweat
Last time that I checked
I'm the streets' voice out West
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked (Checked)
First, you get the money, then respect
Then the power and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked (Checked)

And I come through fly (Check), no cosign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (Check), and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both, and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in these streets tryna feed the babies
The single mamas working hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doing it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
That's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
That's how you start off a curb-server, end up a boss
That's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat dripping down your face 'cause the mission was hard

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & YG]
Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked (Checked)
I was sellin' zones in the set (Zones up in the set)
Make a quarter mil' no sweat
Last time that I checked
I'm the streets' voice out West
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked (Checked)
First, you get the money, then respect
Then the power and the hoes come next (Uh-oh)
Last time that I checked (Checked)
[Verse 3: YG]
I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact (Facts, nigga)
This real, this ain't rap
Where everybody wanna act pro-Black (They don't really wanna fuck with us)
The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that I done made it out the gutter shit
Nip told you, "Fuck the middleman," I told you, "Fuck a bitch"
Fuck wearing they clothes, I wear my own shit
Y'all can own y'all label, I own my own, bitch
Ayy, Nip, I remember all that game you throwed me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win, though, don't let that game fold you
'Cause when it's game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be giving game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us, no

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
