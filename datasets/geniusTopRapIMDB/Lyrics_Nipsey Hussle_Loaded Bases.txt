Loaded Bases Lyrics[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Loaded bases, that's my motivation
A nigga feelin' lucky, we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin' overanxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and I'm more creative
Signed a couple big deals, but it's no paradin'
See, it's a couple niggas every generation
That wasn't supposed to make it out, but decode the matrix
And when they get to speak, it's like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas at the Mobil station
Full circle, mogul motivation
My self-educated shrewd negotiations
Got the sharks that I'm sittin' at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes, that's for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck like the fuckin' '80s
Westside Slauson Ave, know my demonstration
Born and raised, y'all affiliated
It's really greatness, ridin' 'round like I really made it
Loaded bases, I'm gon' Wille Mays it, yah
[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Listen to my ambition, 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences, for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every second's being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom line, I'm gon' make it home

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I was sittin' on my Lincoln, I start thinkin'
Nigga ain't gon' make a hundred mil' off in these streets and
More than likely, I'm gon' end up in somebody precinct, even worse
The horse and carriage front the church, laid off in a hearse
I dealt with it, I ain't just out here for my health with it
I weighed the risk and the reward and seen the scale tippin'
Let's all get on one accord and take the world, niggas
Take the money, take the power and the girls with us
Can't buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
They breed drug-heads and jail niggas
Look all these ways they derail niggas
That's why respect me to the utmost when you see me's how I feel, nigga
'Cause I ain't fail niggas
I seen it comin', didn't I tell niggas?
Different lane, same passion for them L niggas
Switch lanes, all-black, two glass ceilings
V-12 too fast, nigga, gone

Listen to my ambition, 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences, for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every second's being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom line, I'm gon' make it home6Embed
