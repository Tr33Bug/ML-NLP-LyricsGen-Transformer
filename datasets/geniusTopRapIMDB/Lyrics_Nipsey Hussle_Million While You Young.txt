Million While You Young Lyrics[Intro]
And I'm actually gonna get right into it
And they really wanna know how
You know, how can I blaze my own path?
Uh, how can I be successful?
Um, how can I follow the path
That someone else has laid for me to be successful?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I'm sittin' on deuces while the blunt burn
Still rapin' rap music 'cause I want more
All Money In, it's just us four
It's just Cobby, it's just Hoggy, it's just Rimpau
It's just Adam, it's just Blacc Sam and Bolt Da Fatts
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban links? Nigga, where your Rollies at?
Where your big booty bad bitches stay preposterous at?
Where you hustle? Where you run from the police at?
Where you ever represented hope where the hopeless at?
Where you had to take an oath 'fore you sold a sack?
Dealt with all the pressure, played it like you never noticed that
Amongst it all, put yourself on the map
Turned into a booming operation, where your focus at?
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban link? Nigga, where your Rollie at?
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Uh, I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young

[Interlude]
So if you can tell us how exactly
And what deal you did to make your first million dollars?

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
I can tell you niggas how I came up
Similar to climbin' out the grave, huh?
Can't be actin' like a bitch tryna get saved, bruh
Get that dirt up off your shoulder, step your game up
Can't be chasin' pussy, switch your ways up
Can't be fuckin' off your lucci, gotta save up
See, you gon' probably fail, tryna play us
Streets ain't for everybody, get your grades up
Ain't 'bout your money, you just lookin' for a stage, huh?
And all that stuntin' put a bullet in your brain, huh?
Stupid-ass nigga, you can't fade us
Niggas like, "Pfft, who even raised cuz?"
Where you come from? Where you get your name from?
You was in the house, not with the runaway slaves, huh?
You wasn't never in the spot when they raid, huh?
You ain't really 'bout it, lil nigga, this a phase, huh?

Uh, I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young

[Refrain: The-Dream]
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you, it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
But this shit ain't easy, believe me
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you, it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
But this shit ain't easy, believe me

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
Self-made, self-made, nigga really self-made
And I'll never understand the type of games you niggas play
Westside to the Westside, Atlanta until I die (ATL)
Fuck with my nigga Nipsey, best believe a nigga gon' ride
[Refrain: The-Dream]
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you, it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
But this shit ain't easy, believe me
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you, it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
But this shit ain't easy, believe me5Embed
