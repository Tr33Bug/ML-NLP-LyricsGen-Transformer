Ocean Views Lyrics[Chorus]
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true

[Verse 1]
Blessings, bitches in my section
Young with all this money, I'm obsessive, weapons
Turnin' off y'all extras
Turnin' off this bullshit direction
Turnin' up my grind
Wakin' up to more pressure
But it's all in your mind, so I never feel pressured
Knew it's all in due time, now hundreds stackin' like Tetris
Hustle hard is my message, then double back and get extras
Know I spaz when I catch it
Yellow Bone, white Lexus, all black tint, two white cups, fat gold chains, Sprite, Texas
I'm just young and I'm reckless, I'm just on for my section
I'm just out here on top speed with my top down and I'm revinâ€™
I don't know about Hell, I don't know about Heaven
All I know is 'bout right now and this lifestyle is interestin'
Iced out in my session, I just write down these confessions
Niggas died and got life around me, I guess that I'm an exception
Blessings
[Chorus]
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm in these streets with my Cuban on
In my Benz with my music on
Old friends like, "What you been on?"
Shit, I've been on my grind
I ain't usually home, focused, I ain't usin' phones
Lately, I've been usin' songs to get my point across
While niggas 'round me lose it all, but that's your coin to toss
I guess I always knew to ball
And as this world revolves, I'm crackin' 'cause I do my job
Look, from fuckin' hood rats to fuckin' stars
Spendin' all cash to slidin' cards, it's the definition of livin' large
Smokin' top flight in the biggest cars
Told you '08 this shit was ours
Gettin' this cake, yeah, nigga, then gettin' more
Look at this world, young nigga, this really yours
Nigga, this really mine, my niggas is really for it
Them buildings is really high
Them cars is really foreign and all I see is

Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true

[Verse 3]
Yeah, early mornin' off that flight though
We gon' go hard then get right, bro
It seemed simple, that's not life though
Ten years later I'm alright though
Look, these niggas act like they don't like dough
They be mad 'cause niggas shine bright though
Look, I got a Ruger and a Bryco
But I'ma let you pick which way tonight go
I got my dough right, plus the right dough
I mean it's legal, pay taxes to them white folks
My procedure, stay crackin 'til my life's low
Then when I die, blue rag around my rifle
Hundred thousand in my coffin, that's just life though
Play a Stevie Wonder song, smoke some flight, bro
Crack a pint of Actavis then pour in some Sprite, bro
Until that day I'm walking toward what's in my sights though
'Cause all I see is
[Chorus]
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true3Embed
