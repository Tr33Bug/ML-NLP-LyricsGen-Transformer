Overtime Lyrics[Intro]
Gotta light up to shit like this, nigga
And I ain't even said it or wrote it yet
I just feel it, you know?

[Chorus]
Yuh
Overtime 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy
Yuh
Overtime (Overtime) 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong (Wrong)
Now them niggas know I had it right (Right)
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice (Nice, nice)
[Verse 1]
You see me up in Neiman's, right?
My chain and my pinky bright (Bright)
I valet this Mercedes Benz (Benz)
Lookin' like somebody that people like (Like)
Can't but help to think how fake it is
This world and this music biz
I just want all of this paper, though (Paper, though)
So maybe I could try and change this shit
Maybe, me, I'm too ambitious
Or maybe this a new dimension
Maybe them, they too religious
Maybe they judge my intentions
But either way, I'm on my mission
In the sky, for our love, I'ma tie a ribbon
Life's a bitch, lady luck my woman
Forever you my lady, I'm your fuckin' nigga

[Chorus]
Overtime (Overtime) 'cause I ain't have a mic (Overtime)
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong (Wrong)
Now them niggas know I had it right (Right)
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice (Nice, nice)

Cappin' for a cheaper price
Hustlin' for a bucket, keep your sneakers tight
Shoot a box, catch the cheapest flight
If it land, thank you Jesus Christ (Christ)
You ain't gon' get it till you see it right
And jump off in this legal life
Feel the pressure from your people, right? (Right?)
Still choose to lead 'em right (Right)
Sometimes I rap about my feature price (Price)
Or all of my defeats in life
They told me don't believe the hype
But I felt like this 'bout myself before the mic

[Interlude]
And you know, if you look at like the movie industry
You don't, you don't base the success off for how many tickets sold
You know, like, what's the gross? How much it gross?
Period, right?
When it come to business, the bottom line is, you know, we in business to make money
How much you gross?
So, it's like, I feel like it's a looming question mark over Hollywood, over the entertainment, music industry
What's the new business model?
And, to me, you know, the people that lead to that answer
That lend they intelligence, they hustle, they effort, they mind-power, you know?
Whatever they can offer to that question, and stick to that and come up with answers to that
I feel like that's one of the most important things going on
Like in the city they'll try and disrespect
[?] and you'll try to go to, you know, the moon
And then it was like, uh, it had industrial revolutions
Like now, I think it's the business model, creators of the new era that's gon' be able to be the type to keep the business moving forward
People that create new business models, you know, as well as products that, you know, are sold and consumed, services that are consumed, these models
But I feel like the giants gon' be the ones who create the business models
But that's we trying to do with this Proud2Pay
Fuck the middle man
And uh, this disruptive multimedia
Collab and I'm going with, uh, Ryan Legend
[Chorus]
Overtime (Overtime) 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong (Wrong)
Now them niggas know I had it right (Right)
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice (Nice, nice)4Embed
