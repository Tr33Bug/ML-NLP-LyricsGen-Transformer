Rap Niggas Lyrics[Chorus]
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga

[Verse 1]
V12 in the valet black on black, nigga
Ese in the valley do my tats, nigga
White boy in Manhattan pay my tax, nigga
Drive out to the Hamptons to relax, nigga
I stopped smokin' weed, then I relapsed, nigga
Traveled 'round the world and I came back, nigga
Worth a couple a million, that's a fact, nigga
But I am nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
I own all the rights to all my raps, nigga
German plates with sheepskin on my mats, nigga
Murder rate increasin' if I snap, nigga
Ain't no hangin' out, we tape y'all off and double back, nigga
Open trust accounts, deposit racks, nigga
Million-dollar life insurance on my flesh, nigga
Bimmers, Benz, Bentleys, or a Lex, nigga
Ferraris and them Lambos, that's what's next, nigga
[Chorus]
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga (Ayy)
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga

[Verse 2]
AMG Mercedes, back to back, nigga
Chopper to his face, now that's a wrap, nigga
The streets talkin', that's a rat, nigga
Your P.O. call you up, look, that's a trap, nigga
Beat that case, that was that, nigga
Told the world, "Look, I'm back," nigga
Signed my deal, then I'm crack, nigga
They folded, so I left, nigga
Can't no motherfucker tell me shit, nigga
We the No Limit of the West, nigga
Percy Miller at his best, nigga
Jigga with the Rollie and the vest, nigga
Acne jeans and Giusepps, nigga
Servin' fiends off the steps, nigga
Murder sprees for the set, nigga
All facts, this ain't no motherfuckin' threat, nigga
You might also like[Chorus]
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga
Look, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas
Hussle Man a shooter, that's a fact, nigga
Thirty-two extendos in my MAC, nigga
Spend a thousand on some t-shirts up at Saks, nigga20Embed
