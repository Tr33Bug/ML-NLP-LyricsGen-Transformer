Real Big Lyrics[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big
I knew one day, I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Tryna walk to school, get your jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas, get your car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
'Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
High school, didn't go
Couldn't understand my plan, now you niggas know
Self-made, well-paid
I'm from where they tell you never touch the shell case
I'm from where they teach you never trust a pale face
Let's talk bangin', I can tell you 'bout a failed race
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big
I knew one day, I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Sold-out shows, that's a door split
Niggas ain't show up, that's a forfeit
Left my record label, just got more rich
I switched it up, that's me singin' on the chorus
But still, I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars, no stutter, top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors, though
White wall, that's where my awards go
Runnin' from the law 'til they foreclose
Sit with myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question, only Lord knows
What I'm doing out in Copenhagen spendin' euros?
Night time, locs on
Do it big, nigga, 'til my Locs home
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this

Real big, real big
I knew one day, I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?

[Interlude: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could stay in this moment, I would forever
If I could live in this moment, said I would forever
Real shit, real shit
Yeah, yeah
If I could give you the stars, baby, I would
Wanna last to share in this moment, baby, this moment
And I would give you the stars, baby, I would

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Real big, real big
I knew one day, I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?6Embed
