Status Symbol 3 Lyrics[Chorus: Buddy]
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'?
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it
This a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself
Don't you know I do it so well?
Dollar signs all on my head
Rollin' solo dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ayy, almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'?
[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle & Buddy]
Rappin' for my section, roll with my protection
Who gon' die next? Ain't tryna get elected
Ridin' by myself, time for some reflection
I feel like a young boss nigga that's thankful for his blessings
I can't even lie (This a trip, trip, trip, trip), I ain't even flexin'
Block for me, Black man, know they tryna stretch us
I ain't tryna preach, I ain't tryna lecture
When you make your first mil' in cash, you gon' feel the pressure
Just wanna feel the thrust, wanna feel the texture
Wanna feel the drop-top breeze, wanna feel successful
Wanna change the game, never change the message
Never stop grindin', cherish no possessions
We ain't get accepted (This a trip, trip, trip, trip), we just reinvested
Thanks what I expected 'cause we ain't even set trip
60th the Mecca, choppers for protection
FBI invest' us, but they can't arrest us
Almost

[Chorus: Buddy & Nipsey Hussle]
Almost forgot what I was doin' (Almost)
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin' (Figure it out)
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'? (We see y'all)
Now I'm just ridin' through the city (Solo)
Now I'm just ridin' through the city (Off probation)
And ain't nobody rollin' with me (Off paperwork)
And ain't nobody rollin' with me (Smokin' good, nigga)
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it (Weed license)
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it (Gun license, nigga)
This a trip, trip, trip, trip (Ayy)
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself (Fuck y'all)
Don't you know I do it so well? (Fuck y'all)
Dollar signs all on my head (Fuck y'all)
Rollin' solo dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ayy, almost forgot what I was doin' (I almost forgot, nigga)
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin' (You know we out chasin' these)
Almost forgot what I was doin' (These M's, nigga)
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'?

Now I'm swervin', yeah, I'm swervin'
Now I'm splurgin', yeah, I'm splurgin'
On purpose, on purpose
It's a trip, trip, trip, trip
Turn the headphones up for me, G
Little bit lower, yeah

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Always had the passion, nigga, this a classic
How we came from nothing, went and got established
Livin' like a savage, tryna make some magic
Everybody starving, tryna take the sandwich (This a trip, trip, trip, trip)
I know it's elaborate, but nigga, just imagine
Felt the right to ask it, we can make it happen
Weavin' through the traffic, I can take you back then
Everything I said, I meant, I was never cappin'
I was never scared to stand front line with MAC-10's
Raise and shoot at Black men, never felt the satisfaction
When I seen the game collapsin', guess they took the rules and whacked it
Started movin' at a different frequency and it got me livin' lavish
All my partners steady passin', tryna wiggle through this madness
Tryna fight this gravity every time, I swear I can feel it pull me backwards
Puttin' thousands on they caskets, tryna pick the right reactions
I appreciate the progress, but I'm so conflicted by the status (This a trip, trip, trip, trip), look
[Chorus: Buddy & Nipsey Hussle]
Almost forgot what I was doin' (This shit can happen)
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin' (On this road to these millions)
Almost forgot what I was doin' (To success)
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'? (Don't let the money make you different, nigga)
Now I'm just ridin' through the city
Now I'm just ridin' through the city (Stay focused)
And ain't nobody rollin' with me
And ain't nobody rollin' with me (The marathon continues)
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it
It ain't a problem, I'm gon' get it (Let's get it)
This a trip, trip, trip, trip
Ridin' 'round smokin' by myself (Solo)
Don't you know I do it so well? (Off probation)
Dollar signs all on my head (License good)
Rollin' solo dolo, this a trip, trip, trip, trip (I just be trippin' sometimes, nigga)
Ayy, almost forgot what I was doin' (That's what I call a full three-sixty)
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin' (Foot on the gas on you niggas)
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'? (Just watch)6Embed
