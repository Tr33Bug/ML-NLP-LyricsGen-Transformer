Tha Mansion LyricsFresh out the club, on my way back to the mansion
You know where I’m from, you don’t ever gotta ask us
Banged out, still, these hoes think I'm handsome
And yes I run my city, run my city single handed
If they’d made a movie about my life it would be a classic
Drove a bucket and we used to share a mattress
Looking at me now you can see the contrast
When I’m chilling with a model from Toronto in the Hamptons
So what do you need, cause you can have it
Long as you willing to bleed for what you’re asking
And when you see it you seize it with a passion
Cause we don’t believe in second chances
The way you fill up them jeans make me imagine
But I don’t live in a dream, I make it happen
Don’t mean to get in between you and your standards
But since every night is a scene, I’m yellin’ action
I’ve got the meat and the cheese, let’s make a sandwich
Just grab which ever of your home girls is the baddest
Hopefully she got a swag that could match this
But she could be whatever she want, except average
And dressed in something I can mess with
Spend a lil’ something on you bag is expected
Louis Vuitton and Valentino collections
All you Ugg-boot bitches I don’t mess with
I’m international, them niggas are domestic
Fuckin' with a baller and usually bringin' out the best in
And when it’s over you can count me as your blessing
Cause every single loss in your life is a lesson
I’m on, and I know I am
And I ain’t in nobody rush cause I know my plan
Money first, women second, and you hoes is last
Cause I don’t wanna fuck if I know I can
And yeah, you got a butt, but your soul is whack
You like a coke bottle but the soda’s flat
Your style like the plastic on the sofa set
And run and tell your homegirls I told ya that
Look, damn, flow kinda tough
And I don’t hate y’all I just only love us
The title that I hold is what every one wants
But still I play the game like I never one once
It's eleven, you know, one one
And every generation had to do what I’ve done
To the people I’m a hero unsung
Good thing I don’t want fame, I want funds
But if they say my name the bell rung
I’ve been through so much pain, I feel numb
The Marathon, my nigga, I’m on one
For as long as the Lord pump air through these lungs
And I ain’t perfect, Lord knows I murked shit
Until the day that he gave me something to work with
Open my eyes, he show me it wasn’t worth it
Told me if I lowered my pride, I’d find purpose
And it was hard to see the set was a serpent
Going too fast to turn, inertia
Gotta apply the lesson that you learn
You should come fuck with a star, get off earth dick
Got money, but you still feel worthless
Fuck like a porn star, pussy like a virgin
And in return, he keep you in fly purses
But when he gone you calling my line urgent
Cry me a river, I’ve never be the buyer of them lies you deliver
The real is me is mesmerized into women
Most of the times she never been with this fly of a nigga
And I am the realization, of the dream of this motherfucking nation!
Come on, for pussy and power you be patient
Come up first, that’s the order of operations
Broke nigga hope you hear what I’m saying
Either that or you should pop Scarface in
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing
You got a cell waiting on you in the state pen
Hope you hear what I’m saying
Either that or you should pop Scarface in
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing
Cause they got a cell waiting on you in the state pen
Yeah, uh, TMCYou might also like4Embed
