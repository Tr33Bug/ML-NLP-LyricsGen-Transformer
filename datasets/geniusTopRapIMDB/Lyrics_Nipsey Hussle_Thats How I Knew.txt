Thatâ€™s How I Knew Lyrics[Chorus]
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different

[Verse 1]
I seen it, I thought it, I dreamed it
I said it, I did it, I meant it
I taste it, I loved it, I need it
I want it, more of it, I fiend it
I'm godly, I'm gutter, I'm genius
I'm prolly of cheese grits at Four Seasons
Fresh squeezed, no stressants, no reason
Toast champagne to achievements
I think we should dive off the deep end
Take you on vacation every weekend
Look, I be up at six, niggas sleep in
I be at the Ritz puffin' G Pens
Them other niggas soft, I'm the cement
Fourteen, Bonnie and Clyde, we can be them
These rich nigga rules I believe in
Manifested, gave me blessings and that's how I know
[Chorus]
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew

[Verse 2]
Yeah, That's how I knew that i was different though
Rap fast, this a different flow
Different deals gettin' different dough
Yeah, my life, doin' different shows
Catch a flight, do my shit, hit a lick and go
Oh, now I got a different goal
'Cause I reached all my old ones
I be feelin' like somebody reached out and chose us
I be killin' life, nigga, we got it rollin'
We pop and pour shit
Standin' on them couches with my whole clique
Our jewelry on some 1994 shit
Champagne flutes, watch em go 'click'
Afterwards, baby fucked the whole clique
West Coast shit
Own the masters to these classics, Death Row shit
So when that check come, I get mo chips
All money in, I went and got my own shit, nigga
You might also like[Chorus]
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different

[Interlude]
Life, and it's like, you know, you can look a gift horse in the face and not know what you lookin' at
And I feel like, you know, I'm lookin' at the gift horse
I'm just one of the ones that notice what I'm lookin' at
You know what I mean? It's actually an incredible time
It's like a gold rush, it's never been a time like this in our generation
It's our equivalent of the Gold Rush with everybody movin' to California
This technology has empowered everybody
And it's giving people, you know, it's as big as you wanna make it and, you know, it's as far as you take it
And we can quote a gang of things going on in the world right now
Or just, you know, accept it as being true
But, you know, it's like, man, giants gon' crumble
Big-big companies gon' crumble
New companies gon' pop up outta nowhere and it's-it's gon' be dramatic
And I believe that
[Chorus]
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different2Embed
