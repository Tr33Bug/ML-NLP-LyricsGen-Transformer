Victory Lap Lyrics[Intro: Stacy Barthe & Arctic Monkeys]
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could (Oh)
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle & Arctic Monkeys]
I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin'
Sitting on the steps, feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' "Bullet Proof Soul"
Every few shows, I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown, Diamond District, jewelers like, "Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low"
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, "Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em"
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curved detectives
Guess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings
Held me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it
You got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?
[Chorus: Stacy Barthe & Arctic Monkeys]
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
(We gotta make it)
Like the beginning of Mean Streets

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there
This time around, I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it, though, y'all niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
It's just another front step with candles
Lil' message from the set, "We accept your challenge"

Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah, woah
We gotta make it, yeah, we gotta
We gotta make it, oh, we gotta make it
Oh, ah, ooh
We gotta make it, oh
