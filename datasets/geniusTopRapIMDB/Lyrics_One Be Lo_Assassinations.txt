Assassinations Lyrics[Gunshots from a rifle...] + (Flute playing in background)


[Dick Gregory]
'They assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King and everybody got uptight
"Ah, they assassinated Dr. King..."

They gunned down Bobby Kennedy, "Oh, they killed Bobby!..."

They assassinated J.F.K., and everybody- "Ah, they shot the president!"
None of nobody in America got upset when they assassinated Lincoln Rockwell and Malcolm X... see America is not a nation that gives a damn about an assassination until you kill somebody we love...

...We've got to make this a nation that gives a damn about assassinations regardless to who it is, or you have to make it a nation that don't care about nobody getting assassinated.'You might also likeEmbed
