BEEF LyricsVERSE 1
Now that's some Bullshit
A lot of rappers talk a lot of beef
Got gats, wit full clips
Balls 'bout as big as those Rocky-Mountain-Oysters
You Ain't sayin nothin’ just makin a lot of noises
They ain't tougher than leather, you gots to keep steppin’
In video's:
Look at the rumps
On these heifers
Young tenderloins
Gotta skin their hides
For the meal ticket
Xzibit can Pimp 'dey rides
What the U-S-D-A say?
Grade A Prime
So that’s a prime-time slot
Just to say they shine
For the 30 seconds of fame
You can't resist
But seven days in your colon and you still ain't sh#t!
VERSE 2
It's waay too many lives at steak (stake)
“YES SIR, NO SIRloin”
The soldier say
He supposed to be the Macho Man
See you holdin' on to some Beef Jerkey knock it out yo’ hand
"Cookin" in a foreign land?
Watch the beef, stew
The women and the Children on the ground
That’s beef too
And both sides claim God, missing the focus...
Cuz one say "Halal"...
The other say "Kosher”
They Both hate pigs
Love Abra"ham"
And Moses
So why we see commandments broken?
Moses talked to God on the mountain
When he came back down...
The people started worshipping cash cows
Today we got the U-S-D-A
Trynna leave their mark
It's all politics
Slaughterhouses-chop those parts
Now ANY grade less
Than the US-Select
Still serve you that beef
But did you know it was Processed?
You might also likeVERSE 3
America consume mo' beef
Than every country on the earth
Even toddlers Obese
A quarter pound burger you can pick on the Menu
Some people don't like it (rare)
Forbidden to Hindu's
And "vegetarians" won't be beefin against you...
The same category
Pork chicken and fish too
Get all 'their Protien from Soy, Rice and Beans
Now these vegans on another level
Rebel to Ice Cream
It might seem crazy but the flow don't stop
Hippies say they don't need roast
To smoke no pot
Now da U-S-D-A say "recall that beef"
Cuz the C-O-W was M-A-D
But the farmers keep fillin'em up
We keep killin' for what?
"Meat-grillin"
The "Beef" keep "sizzlin"
Mike was a "Bull" Now we got King james
Some n!99@z dont like "Kobe" but he still got game
Who want Beef???Embed
