Dick Head Tracy Lyrics[Intro: DJ Scene]
We're gonna start this thing off right
My man One.Be.Lo, DJ Scene on the mix
And this is the official mix CD, "S.T.I.L.L.B.O.R.N."
For the brand new album "S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M." which is in stores right now
Make sure you go pick it up

Shouts out to Boom Bap Project, take one
Let's go!

[One.Be.Lo]
The life of a gangsta, danger
Known to bust Glocks, rush spots underworld, nuttin major
Been to the pen, I was in it for the paper
Stick 'em up, try to get with us get sprayed up
Came up hustlin, I'm comin to your city smugglin
Dopeheads lovin it, Feds buggin it
Don't say it twice, peep my latest heist
Most wanted, skills most flaunted, that's my way of life
[Boom Bap Project]
Tellin cats all this summer, run the funds through the numbers
Accounts on free status; I let my G's have this
We got this stored up through the routes and through regions
We keep 'em short-changed so they thugs pledge allegiance
Run a monopoly, monopolize economy
Let's operate it sloppily with quantity over quality
Two fuckin riddlers, true to life swindlers
The check's in my hand and I'm callin off my ninjas
Dick Head Tracy

[One.Be.Lo]
Tryin to play me
Especially when it comes to money things might get ugly
Call me every day tryin to make that sale
Tall tales, cash advance when all else fails
We sell retail, make noise, well
When it's time to get paid all I get is voice mails
Now I gotta threaten your life and heckle your wife
And kidnap your kids just to get the rest of my rights
Dick Head Tracy

[Boom Bap Project]
The well-known bigot
I cut a deal with you, Narc you out the next minute
Thugs in suits and we know when you recruitin'
If my worker bee's happy, I hit them on some smooth shit
Street executives through bars substance, sedatives
With emphasis on conniving your mentality's prejudices
Fuck bein sensitive, I'm clockin when you rockin it
It's all signed and sealed in these top secret documents

To all you shady record labels (fuck you, pay me)
To all you distribution companies (fuck you, pay me)
And all you wack-ass promoters (fuck you, pay me)
And if you bootleggin my shit (fuck you, pay me)
To all you shady record labels (fuck you, pay me)
And all you distribution companies (fuck you, pay me)
And all you wack-ass promoters (fuck you, pay me)
And if you bootleggin my shit

[Boom Bap Project]
Dick Head Tracy, I'm one in one-five
I'll take that signin bonus on the New Jersey Drive
It's, organized crime through the, scope of a rhyme
Ex-tortions design for, payin on time
Strong arm and side swipe, we scheme for necessity
Intricate instances like cats see complexity
Blacktops and laptops, discreet with the cameras on
We'll laminate a card, read "Welcome to Babylon"
Dick Head Tracy

[One.Be.Lo]
Walk into the room
Like everything is cool, room four-thousand-and-eighty
Smile fake handshakes, hide they hate
Anything to capitalize/capital-I's like sideways H
Criminal mindstates increase crime rates, find waistlines
Laced with nines, don't waste my time
Fake cats waitin in line to take my place, they can't fade me
Or make me or break me, they hate me
Dick Head Tracy
[Boom Bap Project]
John Wayne Gacy
You beat around the bush cause you scared to come face me
Even the arch repeat flaws on complacents
And head-crackin video budget to Big Tigga's "Bassment"
You want success when you F and suck the minimum
And the pendulum shifts through your time space continuum
Kareem swarms with the OneManArmada
Ingredients for jack moves and the whole enchilada
Dick Head Tracy

[One.Be.Lo]
Street credibility
I push weight with more intensity, mostly mentally
Moses ministry, all of y'all cats is mortal men to me
Who am I is more a mystery, moral victory
Normal tendencies for me to form an infantry
Swarm your airwaves, sound speed oral symphonies
Mass capacities, yo I'm doin this for salaries
Fuckin with my dough I fuck up your whole anatomy

[Hook: Boom Bap Project] + (One.Be.Lo)
All you shady record labels (fuck you, pay me)
All the distribution companies (fuck you, pay me)
All you wack-ass promoters (fuck you, pay me)
If you bootleggin my shit (fuck you, pay me)
All you shady record labels (fuck you, pay me)
All the distribution companies (fuck you, pay me)
All you wack-ass promoters (fuck you, pay me)
If you bootleggin my shit

[Scratches by DJ Scene]
"So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me.."
"My money, my my money, my money"
"So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me.."
"My, money"
"No equation"
"For real I'm just watchin, watchin my dough.."
"Tryin to stop my checks.."
"Hell no.."
"So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me what you owe me" {​*echoes*}​
...
"So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me what you owe me"
