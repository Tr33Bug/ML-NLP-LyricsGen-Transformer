Enecs eht no kcab Lyrics[Hook]
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army, army
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army

[Refrain]
With the eagle, I begin
Spread wings, ride the wind
My story never ends
I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bust
Nowadays, what I touch, don't need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was Able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a subterraneous cut
You only get honest expressions when I spit in your ear
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means, that means, that means, that means
[Verse 1]
Don't need a major, indie cars drive me
Highly effective 'cause my crew selected
Never take the cause lightly
Get inspiration from the Almighty
I pray Allah guide me
Even underground cats be all sheisty
False grimy wack emcees need to floss nightly
'Cause they never seen as raw like me, so their jaws bite me (ouch)
Check me now, quarterback style
Every time they pass the microphone
You would think I was a Moss Viking
My style touchdown, your style need a touch-up
Even with a Rick James sample you couldn't touch SUB (can't touch this)
Wack emcees wanna act stuck-up when you kick it with 'em
Thinking I'm dissing 'cause I ain't feeling the shit they spitting
Know the difference between dissing and constructive criticism
They should try to pen a written that can fit the rhythm
Too busy trying to hit the ism, hit the women
Feminine, get the Benjamins, watch my SUB Zero â€“ "Finish him"
Finish 'em, finish 'em, finish 'em

[Hook]
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army, army
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Uh, I'd like to say something about that
You might also like[Verse 2]
We don't procrastinate, how many times I got to say to you
We ain't the type of cats that only talk about what they would do
For years we've been paying dues
Staying true to our self while we making moves
Thank God we made it through
Won't stop until I do what I came to do
Kick a flow and get the dough, that's just to name a few
Now every rhyme I say to you is here to stay with you
We stick in your head like it was said with the crazy glue
You wanna battle? One Be Lo is not afraid of you
I could care less about your reputation
Even though it may be true
The truth is Subterraneous your favorite crew
And all them non-believing cats that came with you
Can catch the vapors too
I rock their minds like the slingshot of David do
Liver than Pay-Per-View
You couch potatoes don't believe me, call the cable crew
Every time I bus' kids think they on their way to school
This grown man ain't got no time to play with you
Theresa didn't raise a fool
You try to play me Glenn Close, nah, we can't be cool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let it be a Deja Vu

[Refrain]
With the eagle, once again
Spread wings, ride the wind
My story never ends
I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bust
But nowadays, what I touch, don't need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was Able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a subterraneous cut
You only get honest expressions when I spit in your ear
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means, that means
[Outro]
Back on the scene is the incredible one man, one man, one man...8Embed
