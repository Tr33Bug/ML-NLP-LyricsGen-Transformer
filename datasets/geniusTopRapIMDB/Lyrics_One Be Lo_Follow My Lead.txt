Follow My Lead Lyrics[Intro + Lo]
Yo it's the One Man Army, General Subliminal, a.k.a. One Be Lo... Rockin' with the Subterraneous, beats by the Trackezoids
...ya'knowhati'msayin'? This is the Subterraneous movement
Like Moses, taking my people on an exodus... here we go

[Bridge] 2X
Spotlight operator, aim at Yak-town
If you don't know the time, it's time to act now

[One Be Lo]
Ayo, my pen uncontrollable, notepads are over Lo
Going up these quotables to move up the totem pole
Would rob a hood, I pay dues with stolen shows
Wax pads, that's harder than cast over the broken bones
And gristle, officially swing rope-a-dope
Butterfly floating and bees stinging you swollen dome kings
On the throne like rats on cheese provolone
So-and-so selling your soul, genes and chromosome
Blood, sweat and tears for what appears to never be treasury
Haters get mad green, incredibly
All over the globe; emcees the same destiny
Same bit of taste, most reckon it's the same recipe
Sugar coated sex, drugs, violence- aim the weaponry
Blasphemy- amahkiyama, this weighs heavily
How you gonna battle the truth? I say let it be
I came to bless the seeds on streets that ain't Sesame
[Hook]
Feel the vibe in the place when it's prime time
Don't need no light on the stage, I got my own shine
The facts right on your face, no need to claim blind
Proceed, follow my lead, or get left behind...

Spotlight operator, aim at Yak-town
If you don't know the time, it's time to act now

[One Be Lo]
Whether it's college, we living some street knowledge
I wanna hear them lyrics make sense, no stink garbage
Listen, whatever you doing, just do it with skill
Just because it's positive, don't mean it's something I feel
Keep it real
Though still a fan of villain grans who spit it grand
Sometimes you don't understand how I could kill a man
Violence in his plans, no time for ill advance
Guerrilla hands go to war before you get a chance to score
You wanna battle kid? I'll damage your pride
Make you feel like when planets collide, travelling time
Centuries before the Africans was sent to get beat
To cave blocks, play the hard rock- I'll chisel you deep
Bring it back
The lyrics you speak can never reach the top-spittin'
They're so sick that my fans should bring a doc wit'em
So tremendous gang members run to the cops snitching
I'm not thrilling, your squad's realer than Godzilla

Feel the vibe in the place when it's prime time
Don't need no light on the stage, I got my own shine
The facts right on your face, no need to claim blind
Proceed, follow my lead, follow my lead

Spotlight operator, aim at Yak-town
If you don't know the time, it's time to act now

[One Be Lo]
I keep the slang tight, ready for fang-types
Like Dracula, vernacular expose you to daylight
You hoping it was left in the dark, left in the past
But two lefts don't make a right; you really need to take advice
After a handful of record sold, you should've stepped to Lo
Make the question known, but you let it go
The point is, you want something you need to let me know
Don't start buggin', this forced me to call the pest control
Back in the day when Cube was screaming "F the po"
Seemed like we never had beef, only the vegetables
Never thought it'd be like this, I guess you never know
Friends come and go, this world is for the eskimos

[Hook]
Feel the vibe in the place when it's prime time
Don't need no light on the stage, I got my own shine
The facts right on your face, no need to claim blind
Proceed, follow my lead, or get left behind...
Feel the vibe in the place when it's prime time
Don't need no light on the stage, I got my own shine
The facts right on your face, no need to claim blind
Proceed, follow my lead, or get what?!Embed
