[One.Be.Lo]
This apple's hard to the core, this ain't about metaphors
Given the spiritual war, we all a part of it
So much emotion inside, I spit with passion and pride
Feel the rhythms I ride? I put my heart in it (I put my soul in it)
Originality grace, my personality traits
Nourish reality based, see how my world turns
Sets anybody in weeks, I practice first what I preach
Experience what I teach, you gotta live and learn
And for the hip-hop addicts, another Sub classic!

[One.Be.Lo]
Yo, it's time to open your ears, the wait is over it's here
