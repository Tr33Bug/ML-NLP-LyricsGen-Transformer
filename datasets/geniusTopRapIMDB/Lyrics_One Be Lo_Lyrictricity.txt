Lyrictricity LyricsYo, Check out this high volt-age, I got the AC-DC
To shock emcees and leave them "Winan" like Cee Cee
So Bee Bee, on the lookout, I'm live wire
You can't handle me, gzzz gzzz [cause cause], I start fires
Crossing my path, don't make me laugh, it ain't worth it
Call the nurses, all my verses blowing all your circuits
Peep the current, cause what I bring to the mic, is like
Benjamin Franklin with a string and a kite
Electrocute emcees who battle weak
Wait a while...my flow is like death row- have a seat
Every sentenced executed every time I said a verse
My frequencies hit your measurements, where it megahertz [mega hurts]
Even with rubber gloves you still couldn't touch it
Make sure you ground it when I, bzzz bzzz, buss' it
You catch a heart attack, I take the headphones off my ear
Put them on your chest and tell the room to stand clear
This is how I operate, you don't know the half
I'm half-freestyle innovator, half power generator
Got a short fuse when it comes to whack emcees
Smack the taste out their mouth, like a nine-volt battery
I strike with a thunderbolt's accuracy
Zig, zag, zig through the crowd hit the tallest kid in back of me
Electromagnetic draw the crowd with my polarity
