One Manâ€™s Mission Lyrics[Verse 1: One Be Lo]
Yo, now when you got a joker ace
You gotta keep a poker face
I know I'm holdin' weight
But these critics prone to hate
I still motivate, even though these corporate snakes
Wanna swallow up my profits like whales in Jonah's days
Some of y'all flow is straight, but it don't amaze One Man Army
You lack the soldier traits
You anorexic, I'm overweight
I represent the motor state, real estate, low mortgage rates
Speaking of rates, emcees? I pulverate
Ain't nothing nice, like your cell phone's roaming rates
I got the Juice, I got police on the chase
Now these Marcia Clark, Chris Darden niggas on my case
I wanna place first in the Indy 500
These cats bet their soul on the race
They tryin' get paid, so they stay in the fast lane
In the long run get wrecked and slam on your breaks
[Hook: One Be Lo]
See I be on some real live shit
Many rock the mic, but never quite (like this)
The one man's mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin' (like this)
(repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: One Be Lo]
I've been verbal since Moses was jumpin' ten hurdles
Splittin' red pharaoh since Abednego was infernal
Deadly with pen journals, MAC-10 verbals
Cock this shit-BLAOW-Apocalypse Now here to kill colonels
Actually, I'm here to win, turtles
So many unlucky rappers sleep Be-Lo travel with twin turbo
Super cock-a-doodle-doo, I keep the hens fertile
Wifey can't stand the groupie chicks, they just my friend, girl
Record companies are Shady like Slim Marshall
Keep running or you'll never walk again, Herschel
All they do is spin circles and pretend service
We can't share, you can't even keep your syringe sterile
And what I got is too dope, even for ten Darryl Strawberrys
Twenty Marrion Barrys
The Binary, visionary
Spit a very literary piece
On vanilla sheets
Train militaries on a beach
With my very speech
You might also like[Hook: One Be Lo]
I'm on some real live shit
Many rock the mic, but never quite like this
The one man's mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin' like this
(repeat 2x)

[Verse 3: One Be Lo]
This is a new day
When dues paid and callin' shots
Like I'm pool playin' pops
Told me not to lose patience
Heard Justin bustin', cross Ross and knew Damon
Made a few changes wisely, now a Isley brother, smooth sailin'
Tooth Sabre crews hatin' cause I represent the Wolverine scene
Snooze takers get the rude waken
Truth bangin', spit a few statements just to prove Satan
Use majors, never lose faith in Subterraneous
A new nation under God
Too sacred, get your shoes taken
In these new places, just a few make it
Refuse takin' food, bacon
All these dudes fakin'
Tapes get ejected like a Piston with the two flagrants
Blow the whistle, get the SUB in the game
Dunk in your face
Flavors that your tongue wish to taste
Nothing you say comes into play
Bullets in your gun ricochet
I don't think you bust anyway
But any day I be on some real live shit
See many rock the mic but never quite (like this)
The one man's mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin' (like this)
[Hook: One Be Lo]
See any day I be on some real live shit
Many rock the mic but never quite (like this)
The one man's mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin' (like this)1Embed
