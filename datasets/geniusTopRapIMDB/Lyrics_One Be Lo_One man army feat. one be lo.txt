One man army (feat. one be lo) LyricsYo it's the one man army
General, subliminal

Yo it's the one man army
General, subliminal

Yo it's the one man army
General, subliminal
Flyin' through the sky ready for war with syllables
Literary, military, top secret mission
You ain't see nothin yet, it's like a self-check
My mental plane takes flight, I air-strike the mic
The mystery pilin' in the cock-pit all night
See how I keep the shows live?
I never lost a dog fight
See how my enemies know style, the name of my plane is the pit-bull terrier
Keep my targets locked in, the more the merrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly, my voice need a aircraft carrier
Tribal airways, every track is a runway
Keep your jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinkin' they shall overcome one day, they must be dreamin'

It's the one man army
General, subliminal

Yo it's the one man army
General, subliminal
March across land, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military, top secret mission
You ain't see nothin yet, I roll up on ya set

With speed, movin' like a German blitzkreig
I got what they missin', in action
Stand at attention, military fashion
And listen to the rapper Rambo, the Mic Commando
Fully equipped, I write rhymes for extra ammo
Too much to handle, you had the nerve to try to grab the mic
I'm too marvelous, when I'm droppin this, watch the mic
Turn it to a nuclear test site
MC's better hear the words of Tina, cause we don't need another Hiro-shima
Check it out

Yo it's the one man army
General, subliminal

Yo it's the one man army
General, subliminal
Dive into the mine, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military, top secret mission
You ain't see nothin yet, how deep can I get?

Six thousand leagues beneath MC level
A submarine hero, with torpedo steelos
My strategy's turn MC's into POW's
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battle ships
I send em up the creek and they lifeboats paddle-less
Sought by the Navy Seal's strategists
Ain't interested if the shark-infested
You can't see my style, and I've shown this-
Too many times, I've been in war missions than a homeless
Always on point like a compass
360 degree, all around Emcee

The one man army
General, subliminal

Ready for war with syllables
Literary, military, top secret mission
You ain't see nothin yetEmbed
