PIGS LyricsHOOK
When the Street Lights come on...
And the Darkness sets in...
Watch yo back...
Cuz we might catch you...
Cuz we know yo naame...
Yo crew and your ways...
What you you say...
When the street lights come on...

VERSE 1
In Uniforms Blue they storm thru...
With Lightening Speed
The Sirens Scream
Inside the Streets...
Heads Turn, Wheels Burn
In pursuit of a Thief...
Another Bite out of crime
More food to the Beast
Similar to what a carnivore do to the Beef...
Keep the Belly all Swelly
‘tell he true to the feast...
Sprinkle salt in the game
Take it bitter or sweet...
They the reason why you Niggas ain't feeling the Heat...
Block Hot...
You might see’m walking the Beat...
Pop Pop...
They chalk bodies under the sheet...
Lock up the precinct
That’s what we all think, but
The Judge don’t throw away keys, or toss sinks...
They ain't cleaning the streets
They makin’em stink...
Hands dirty in the Pig Pen
Shit where they eat...
No Justice or Peace
With corrupt Police...
Crime Pays...
You just won’t get a reciept...
VERSE 2
Now this ‘what we about to do...
Take you on another mission with the Boys in Blue...
There’s a few out there that serve and protect
But the Pigs on the other hand get no respect, like...
“Here they come in the Police Car”
Abuse the P to the O to the W-E-R
Pull over them runners that make Drug connects
Won’t put’em under arrest
They come to Collect...”Cha-Ching”
Crimes Progress
It’s all about Green
They can roll up on the Scene
But they not here to help
She got pulled over for not wearing a Belt
But the Ticket ain't written if she not wearing a Belt, get it?
So watch what you say kid
Undercovers tape it
That’s what you call a “Pig in a Blanket”...
No matter what the Rank is
Gettin that Bank
Do our tax Money pay dat shit?
Yep...

VERSE 3
Okay...
Let’s explore...
Pigs never sweat through pores...
So what they wanna sweat you for?
Why the Black, Brown youth feel less secure?
Pat’em down!
Hands up!
Feet spread the floor!
Poverty leads to crime
They arrest the poor
Some people can't afford a lawyer
When they step in court
So when the suspect is caught
You can rest assure
They use no less of course
Than excessive force
And it’s next to Norm...
Get beat like you stole
Leave ya cheeks all swole’
Like Gilespies horn
What if camera’s in L.A. never pressed record?
Do you think Rodney King would be dressed in court?
In a law”suit”?
Bless the Lord...
It ain't like we ain't never seen’em outta line, step before
Black boot with the Heel out...
Spill out-
Coffee when they peel out...
Then fill out...
The next report...You might also likeEmbed
