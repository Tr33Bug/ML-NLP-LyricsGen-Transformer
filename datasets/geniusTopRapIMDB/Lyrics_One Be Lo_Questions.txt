Questions LyricsWho put you here? (Allah)
What is our purpose?
What's the result? (Justice)
Do I deserve it? (Ask yourself that question)
What do you have? (All those who come to this surface)
What are you giving? (Sudaka)
When will you die? (Allah knows best)
How are you living? (Sirat al mustaqim)

Incur calamity to bring about tragedies and casualties
What's your way of life, is it blessed or is it blasphemy
I look around me, everybody's living so savagely
Trying to stay sane in this world full of insanity
Repeating our mistakes as we haven't learned from our history
Kids disrespecting their parents like (?)
Billions of dollars are being wasted to drop bombs
On poor Bedouin families because they tamper with Bush's poppyseed
As long as I speak the truth I will always think (?) enemy
Welfare recipients turn to warfare participants
Watching the news is like reruns of incidents
Fulsom prison filled with citizens that's proven innocent
Positive man defeat the rights of the indigenous
Violence the number one form of entertainment
Guide us, we need to free us from mental enslavement
Alcohol, sex, drugs, guns
A few tools the devil uses to entice what you love
When the dramatic scenes of a movie make you cry
But no remorse for the garbage that we see throughout our lives
We've got eyes but can we really see
Or hear what we want to hear
Act like we wanna be
[Beat changes to spoken word to become an intro to the next track, Oggie]

Guard your faculties, you can't afford to live haphazardly
Your kids with potential not knowing their capabilities
Justice isn't really given to the society
Your love of anything can lead you blindly
This life is a deception
Full of selection
So people use created objects for protection
When death comes, you don't have no choice but to surrender
Surprise attack like they did the World Trade CenterYou might also likeEmbed
