The ANT (i matter) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I draw more crowds and more pictures than McGraw
But more quicker
Than New York minutes
You forfeited
When the Beef is done, I stick a fork in it
When it rains, it pours
My brain got a storm in it...
Spit a rhyme, it shine just like a torch lit it
Same as the end of the world-
Sinners get tor-mented
“Daaamn”
You don’t come back no more, get it?
I Slam...
You can let the door hit it, where the lord split it...
Wide open like the legs on a whore get it???
Income (In-cum) butt the Outcome is horrific...
More vivid than King or Speilberg
Im bringing these real words
Like Damien I was born witted (with it)...
You used to see me on the floor sittin...
Now you see my face in a space, where Elroy and George livin’
Now you see me in Source, and on a tour with it
Rap is a science you can study in ya dorms with it...
It’s heavy enough, to forklift it...
Ornaments, a skull and crossbones you being warned with it...
What you hearing is real
We killin’ ears in this field...
But, you probably thought the children of the corn did it...
[VERSE 2]
Who wanna test
I’m the best
I’m the One-Zero-Zero (100)...
Be-low-G-O-D
The One, equal Neo..
The Black wearin’ villian
Or the white wearin’ hero...
My raps tell-a-vision
Sorta like, Terrantino...
Anything dealin’ with a speaker I’m the key note...
So while you’re freestylin’ I’m the one, getting C Notes...
The dope fiends needle...
The dope mans Kilo...
Now am I my brothers keeper? YES I am Nino...
But I don’t need no-
Coke to Blow I am HIRO-
SHIMA on that ass
Comin’ fast
I’m Libido...
These ladies wanna gas me
I’m already diesel...
When niggas act foul like Shaq
I’m the freethrow...
The Only one can see Lo?
The man in the mirror
I am He
I am We
These other rappers Coleco...
Vision, When you listen
I’m the voice of the people...
You want bars?
I’m not hard to find
I am Nemo...You might also likeEmbed
