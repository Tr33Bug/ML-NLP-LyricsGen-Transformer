The Future Lyrics[Female] What are you thinkin about right now?

[Verse 1 - OneBeLo]
Right now? {*echoes*}
The past, specifically the days I remember
In mind, body, soul I was far from a winner
Poor sinner, my fork in a pork dinner
Drugs, sex, alcohol; Lo is not a quitter nor a forfeiter
A vagabond, talkin back to moms, sold dope out her home
Stole everything I owned -- told lies
Ignored the old wise, glitter caught my cold eyes
Didn't really know why, truth is where the gold lies
What was present then, past now
Had me thinkin that's how life was 'sposed to be for every black child
Strange words, same feathers flock together
When the cops endeavor, lock together, better off a caged bird
Sight closed minded; Lo find it hard to believe
I could lead by example I was so blinded
See every action has a consequence but then
I didn't beware or prepare or really care
[Hook]
If I thought about (the future), let's talk about (the future)
The children are (the future), who's ready for (the future)
What happens in (the future), we not promised (the future)
Only God knows (the future), the future (the future)
Let's think about (the future), let's talk about (the future)
The children are (the future), who's ready for (the future)
What happens in (the future) , we not promised

[Female] Everyday is just an extension of yesterday

[Verse 2 - OneBeLo]
Now in the present day, I'm blessed to say let the record play
Usin my music as a movement to correct mistakes
Knowin my death awaits, I hesitate to question fate
Boys and girls, this world is nothin but a test of faith
So now I'm plannin every step I take, must be a better way
Deeply meditate on these ahead I pray
Seek to elevate bein lead astray, flee the devil's face
Evil separates, reach the heaven gates (gates)
Easier said is the known rebuttal
The mind is willin but the flesh is weak, peace/piece form a puzzle
Jihad means the struggle, so I sacrifice
Satisfy today's seed could be a garden in the afterlife (afterlife)

[Hook]
Think about it (the future), let's talk about (the future)
The children are (the future), who's ready for (the future)
What happens in (the future), we not promised (the future)
Only God knows (the future), the future (the future)
Let's think about it (the future), let's talk about it (the future)
The children are (the future), who's ready for (the future)
Only God knows (the future), only God knows (the future)
Only God knows (the future), the future (the future)

[Verse 3 - OneBeLo]
I heard the future was impressin when you doin some investin
Allah multiply 10 times one of your blessings
Qu'ran full of wisdom, it answer thousands of questions
Muhammad soon to show us the way, follow directions
Life humble essence, wife operation stomach section
Now I witness somethin precious, baby boy young and restless
So many fathers exit, don't bother, this one is present
Even under pressure, family's a treasure - follow my lead
Now as I look into your innocent eyes, full of potential
So much I wanna say that I can't put it in pencil
Or verse, just remember what I caught at your birth
A voice sure could show the world good works (good works)

[Hook]
Let''s think about (the future), let's talk about (the future)
The children are (the future), who's ready for (the future)
What happens in (the future), we not promised (the future)
Only God knows (the future), the future (the future)
(The future, the future, the future, the future)
(The future, the future, the futurrrrrrrre)
