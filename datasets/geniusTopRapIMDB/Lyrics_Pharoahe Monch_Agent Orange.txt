Agent Orange Lyrics[Intro: Pharaohe Monch]
Uh, c'mon
Uh, c'mon
Uh, yeah
Uh

[Chorus 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my sins (C'mon)
My life is all I have to give
Please, Lord, forgive me for my sins (Woo!)
My life is all I have to give (Uh)
Them youth have lost their will to live
[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn
I threw a rock, then I ran
'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grips of the man
Y'all wanna ask me who's sane?
These biological gasses are eating my brain
It's a political grab bag to rape Mother Earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged Dad for what he's worth
Thousands'll die now so millions'll smile later
This ain't the Rockford Files, nigga, they stockpile data
From satellites, where you discuss whose style is greater
In this killing pool, you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When y'all ready to rock like Led Zep then I'll cater
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identity today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Hennessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity, your life is the penalty to pay, motherfucker

[Pre-Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & crowd]
Y'all ready to rock?
We ready to rock
Y'all ready to roll?
We ready to roll

[Chorus 2: Pharaohe Monch]
My life is all I have to give
Please, Lord, forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Them youth have lost their will to live
Trapped in the game, just tryin' to win
Just tryin' to win, just tryin' to win

It's not a Vietnam song
I know women from Desert Storm who came back deformed
Missin' limbs and disease in their legs and arms
Chemicals twice as strong as Agent Orange
(lortnoc dniM) It's messages in the bass drum
War goin' off in your mind, no man is safe from
It's not a Game Boy, Xbox or PlayStation
It's Resident Evil when every president's a mason
Robbin y'all fools like Dick Grayson
And y'all inherited roots and you don't know how to retrace them
Place them back, face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes the authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like Minority Report
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Catch me on the block, in the hood in the trenches, sayin'

[Pre-Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & crowd]
Y'all ready to rock?
We ready to rock
Y'all ready to roll?
We ready to roll

[Chorus 2: Pharaohe Monch]
My life is all I have to give
Please, Lord, forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Them youth have lost their will to live
Trapped in the game, just tryin' to win
[Outro: Pharoahe Monch & crowd]
Y'all ready to rock?
We ready to rock
Y'all ready to roll?
We ready to roll
Lock, load, into positions
Rocks, hold, it's primitive conditions
Lock, load, into positions
Rocks, hold, it's primitive conditions
Lock, load
Rocks, hold, into positions1Embed
