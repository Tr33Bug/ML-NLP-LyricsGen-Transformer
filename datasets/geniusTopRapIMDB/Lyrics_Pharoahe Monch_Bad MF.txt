Bad MF Lyrics[Verse 1]
Totally intoxicated when he drove across the state line
Rapper gone insane, story on Dateline
Lost his wits, didn't take his meds
When they pulled him over, this is what he said
I'm a Bad MotherFucker man (shut your mouth)
Well we talking about Pharoahe
Mashing in that Aston Martin on the Verrazano Narrows
Greatest of all time in the latest apparel
80's baby, ladies crave me on some Mercedes shit
Go tell your favorite rapper eat a bag of baby dicks
They keep singing the same ol' song
I'm a bring 'em the pain for saying the name wrong
Got me going insane I'ma ask you again
[Bridge]
Who put these pussies on top
Putting out that pussy music, call it pussy pop
Playing them pussy games, sucker shit
Fucking around but they don't know just who they fucking wit

[Hook] (x2)
I'm a Bad Motherfucker man
Universal, worldwide, you know my circle
Renegade, on the mic I might just murk you
Putting in that work, cause I do work, every verse is a virtue

[Verse 2]
The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars
The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired
When the truth walked in the building every liar retired
Deception was defeated and deceit became deleted
Uh, they mad cause they can't stop me
Cause I said fuck swag I got moxie
Lyrically ecstasy I got that oxy-contin poppin
They can't carbon copy or mock me
Reign, independent off the books
Off the chain off the hinge off the hooks
It's not a game, I'm not a rook
"Y'all Know The Name", you love the look, listen
