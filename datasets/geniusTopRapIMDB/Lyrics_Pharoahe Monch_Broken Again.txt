Broken Again Lyrics[Hook]
Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That I'd turn around, and be broken again
(2x)

[Verse 1]
They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin'
She rescued me, my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring
Tap! five times to find a vein in there
Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education, beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
I'm relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But, it's so hard to learn
