Calculated Amalgamation Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

[Verse]
I was determined as damaged, psychologically
But still managed to gain a new perspective on the term
'Surround yourself with greatness'
Found myself standing in a room full of mirrors
But even my reflections disrespect you
Like a freshman during hazing (What an amazing assessment)
The police booked me for Booksmarts
But who the promoters book now?
Raised the bar so high that the bar's afraid to look down
Spent nights in a casket, at dawn, I'm a king
Play pawn to a queen, put her throat in the tabernacle
So actually, you should build a statue
Of my likeness in the center of your city
(Your women riddled it with rose petals)
No justice, no peace, no settle
We are renegades, fuck your gold medal
The people are the majority
You can't survive without us, you need us
Attitude, never defeatist
Rebels, so please believe it's
War on the streets of Egypt
My vocals a total eclipse of totalitarianism
You seek to mistreat us
So this is calculated amalgamation
One shot fired inspired by hope to arouse a nation
(I) I am the renegadeYou might also likeEmbed
