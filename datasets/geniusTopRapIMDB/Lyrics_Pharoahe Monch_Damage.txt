Damage Lyrics[Hook]
Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

[Verse 1]
They cock them hammers, wave them llamas
But that's that in front of the camera drama
So when the cameras are attached to dollys, I call them dali lama's
Mold me, loathe, hold me in the palm of your hand, load me
You know exactly what I am, murderer
When I'm inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
It's the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter, the martyr
This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity
Pro-fo-fo-fanity when they manually hammer me annually
You dont figitty faze me yo
I won't tigitty tase you bro
Figgity fucking cut you in half like it's nothing minus the laser scope
Then I will ring your bell like Avon
Before displaying some of my various tattoos (Trayvon)
The (Oscar) award winning (Aiyana Jones) hey (Sean)
Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
Fuck a stray bullet, I take aim when the gun draws
For ever-lasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder, ask any vet I've worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus
[Hook]
Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

[Verse 2]
Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver (TWIST)
Scratch your name off my calendar
See that was me thru a silencer
What you just heard was a .44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause I'm willing to flip
See I'm sort of certified, I'm fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what I've seen
Horrified holy Bibles, rivals, vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies, bridal gowns coffins
Morphine, gang bang, gangrene, slauson, swap meet
Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop
I love hate, hate cops
That's why I laugh when you pull it
I'm motivated and crass
I'm so elated when I see them on the news (you fuckin' pigs!)
They flying the flag half mass
See there's no need for conversation
When we're discussing the bullet's point of view
