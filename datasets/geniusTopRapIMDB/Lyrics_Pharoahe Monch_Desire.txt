Desire Lyrics[Intro: M.O.P. sample]
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!) Oh!

[Chorus: Showtyme]
Said, it's my desire, yes, it is, yeah
Yes, it is, yes, it is, oh, yes, it is, ugh

[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Comprehend the guidelines
My chest out, chinchilla, all relaxed on the sidelines
I'm so famous, understand
New York City respect my game like Joe Namath
And I protect my name like your anus
In prison, y'all don't hear me, y'all don't listen
Y'all just wanna shine, y'all just wanna glisten
Floss, knowing that the soul is still missing
(Who am I?) I'm the poetical pastor
Slave to a label, but I own my masters
Still get it poppin' without artists and repertoire
'Cause Monch is a monarch, only minus the A&R
When my brain excels, your train derails
Pop shit, make you feel The Clipse like Pharrell (Woo!)
You will feel me, you will admire
(My) Struggle, (My) hustle, (My) sole desire
[Chorus: Showtyme, M.O.P. sample]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah
Said, it's my desire
Yes it is, yeah, yeah
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!) Oh!
Said, it's my desire (Hey, hey-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2: Pharaohe Monch]
My book is a ovary, the pages I lust to turn
My pen is the penis, when I write, the ink is the sperm
Desire, the fire that ignites the torch to burn
(This is not rocket science) This is easy to learn
My mic's the gavel; when I talk, court's adjourned
Respect, even if you was ashes, you couldn't earn
I embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs
Rap's fatally ill, please, get concerned
Players pick turns to play, get burned
I color commentate the game like Chick Hearns
This is the moment of truth for my opponents and liars
Vocals alone invoke the emotion of Black choirs
Fire, you don't wanna get burned like Rich Pryor
Move back, who's that there? The live-wire
You will feel me, you will admire
(My) Struggle, (My) hustle, (My) sole desire

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Said, it's my desire
Yes, it is, yeah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro: Showtyme & MeLa Machinko, M.O.P. sample]
It's my desire
Keep pushin', keep strivin' (My-y, y-y-y, oh-oh)
My passion, my fire
That's my desire
I keep pushin', I keep strivin'
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
That's my desire
Keep pushin', keep strivin'
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!) Oh!
That's my desire
Keep pushin', I keep strivin'
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!) Oh!2Embed
