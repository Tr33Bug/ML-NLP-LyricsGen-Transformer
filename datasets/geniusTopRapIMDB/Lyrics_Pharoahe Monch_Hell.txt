Hell Lyrics[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Follow for now
For no formidable fights I've been formed to forget
For Pharoahe fucks familiar foes first
Before fondling female MC's fiercely
Focus upon the fact that facts can be fabricated to form lies
My phonetics alone forces feeble MC's into defense on the fly
Feel me, for real-a
Let's get the skrillas out the hands of these gorillas
Make the whole world feel us
From the crack to the cap peelers
To the niggas in the back shooting craps with the axe wielders
Relax 'til it's time for the immaculate miraculous
Thirteen, ow! The illest
To all my niggas who been shitted on, let's get it on
Dick, I'm gonna let it hang and sit it on
The desk of any redneck record exec
I strike 'em with the right hand, send 'em a step
And this is
[Chorus]
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Hell, incest kids under pressure
In the corner clutching their genitals by the dresser
A hundred CCs of the uncut cleanest
In the vein, twenty-four hours of intravenous
To the left, we have right-wing extremists
On a screen, a man exposes his breasts with no penis
My team is probably just as raw as Lady Saw and Chaka Demus is

[Chorus]
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)
Hell (this is)

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Yo, yo, I feel like I'm one of the livest
One of hip-hop's finest elite rhymers
And I plan to graduate with honors
But one day, we'll all be a bunch of old-timers with Alzheimer's
Lookin' at our label's roster
Wonderin' how the fuck they forgot us
After we done recorded dozens of albums
And made 'em hundreds of thousands of dollars
They still dropped us
We givin' niggas what the fuck they want
A Holocaust, stompin' niggas with a thousand-man march
I ain't livin' in Hell, Hell's livin' in me
That's why I'm always screamin' on you fuckin' MCs
The shit that I quote, float with the buoyancy of a boat
With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose that's extremely fatal
Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you
You can't breathe, your chest feels painful
Your skin color's goin' from dark brown to beige-blue
Your whole room is full of angels
All in your ear tryin' to tell you which God you should pray to
You pray to Jes√∫s, but he don't wanna save you
'Cause you unfaithful, so he gives you to Azazel
You're paralyzed on the operatin' table
Prayin' for Canibus to slice you from head to navel
You banned from TV, banned from CDs
Banned from DVDs and downloadable MP3s6Embed
