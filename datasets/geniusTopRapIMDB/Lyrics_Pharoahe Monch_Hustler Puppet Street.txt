Hustler (Puppet Street) Lyrics[Produced by Fatin]
[Verse 1]
This here is cocaine city
Got four dames with me in the slow lane
Coupe Deville, so hard
They told me they want to sniff some unemployment lines
I gave them equal opportunity, blow jobs
Menace to society
Drink a flask of Bacardi fast, crash, claim sobriety
Still pass a polygraph
Nina in my right hand, her cousins on the night stand
I ain't never work a day in my life for the white man
I am the most imaginative pimp
Slick sentences, diatribes defenseless
When soliloquies set in, it's like cyanide
Lord, I have tried to learn these hoes
But they are hard headed, so god please let it be known
That I'm a hustler
[Hook]
I'm glad we could make it out
You're so cool
You're so cool
And it hurts, now

[Verse 2]
Kleptomaniac, they used to call me Lefty
Poppa was a rolling stone, the streets is all he left me
So now it's better when I jettison
Jet set, jet ski, cool out
You know man, kick back, Jet Li
I even use to sta, sta, sta, sta, stutter when I talk
But now the cops know that I bop with a ca ca cane
When I be walking up the block
The way they jock my whip I call it Secretariat
Various horses inside my stable, it's hilarious
Scavengers live vicariously thru the hustler pimp
And bottom feed (SKRIMPS)
No woman is exempt -- I hustle so that I can see weed
Scrilla, deceased commanders and chiefs, seaweed
Liberal, I do not discriminate with customers
It's the shit you couldn't sniff if you was Mr. Snuffleupagus
Stay after that green bitch, Captain Kirk, muscle up
Or eat a knuckle sandwich cause I will never struggle
I'm a HustlerYou might also like16Embed
