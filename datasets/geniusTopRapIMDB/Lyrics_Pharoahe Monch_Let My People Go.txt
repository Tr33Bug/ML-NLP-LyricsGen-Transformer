Let My People Go Lyrics[Chorus: Pharaohe Monch]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
Let my people go
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
Let my people go
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
Let my people go
Yeah, somebody say let my people go
Hey, somebody say let my people go
[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Spit miraculously, sip Dracula's blood exist for centuries
The body chemistry mends wounds, heals injuries
My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin
Ha, I push the envelope like US mailmen
Ha, we need a leader who is not mischievous
Devious, from Satan’s grip to lead us
Won't retract the facts then act facetious
In fact, the raps are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us, easily leave MCs speechless
Read from the palm of the non-believers
Sell 'em, they wondering how they become underachievers
One of the best of the perennial keynote speaker
My guidance, you want it, come get it, so I’ll flaunt it
And I will show you a way to let my people go today
[Chorus: Pharaohe Monch]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
Let my people go
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
Let my people go
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
Let my people go
Yeah, somebody say let my people go
Hey, somebody say let my people go

[Verse 2: Pharaohe Monch]
They’re trying to sell lies to the people, huh?
Knowing it's hard times for the people, huh?
I'll knock your ass unconscious
Put it up on YouTube, then film the sequel
So it's free for the people, huh
Go on ahead and download it, I'ma teach you how
P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
I'm trying to learn your monkey ass, I'm trying to reach you now
But still, you're like, "Who's this dude?"
Return to fix, shape the game like Rubik's Cube
Chicks see he's brolic, now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do, damn
Open your eyes, man, you've been bamboozled
By the usual plans, hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If y'all are telling me today's music is suitable and appealing
Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual
You might also like[Chorus: Pharaohe Monch]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
Let my people go
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
Let my people go
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
Let my people go
Yeah, somebody say let my people go
Hey, somebody say let my people go

[Verse 3: Pharaohe Monch]
Young children, pull your pants on up
Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt?
You need to let all the people go
Pass the collection plates and give me all of my dough
And if you’re wondering what’s under my robe
An old rusty-ass .38 snub nose
And just because you’re thinking that my shit don't work
That's a *gunshot*
Go on and try robbing my church

[Chorus: Pharaohe Monch]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
Let my people go
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
Let my people go
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
Let my people go
Yeah, somebody say let my people go
Hey, somebody say let my people go
[Outro: Pharaohe Monch & Mela Machinko]
I'm too high (I'm too high)
I'm too low (I'm too low to get on up)
I'll make you feel so good, you don't need to wonder
(Make me feel so good, you don't wanna)
Let my (Let my)
Let my (Let my)
Let my people (Let my people go)
Let them go, mmmm1Embed
