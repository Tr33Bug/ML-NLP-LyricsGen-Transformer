No Mercy Lyrics[Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
Ohh, hear me though

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch & M.O.P.]
They'll bury me with my SP-1200 (For sure!)
Fuck the trinity, inseminate the earth, now take its virginity
In my vicinity, rap is like energy pack
Sending me back behind enemy line to rap too melodic
Melodies, never melodramatic
But hypnotic like cellos for fellow fanatics
I fiend for who fuck wits, inappropriate
Fill 'em with so much lead I'll call Berger and Associates
This rhyme will remain in the minds of my foes forever in infamy
The epitome of lyrical epiphanies
Skilfully-placed poems and carefully planned symphonies
Who would be ignorant enough to have the audacity
To fuck with the likes of I and my tenacity?
This is what you get when you fuck with the likes of
The magnanimous flows of total assholes and ignoramuses
M.O.P. slash Pharoahe Monch cause damages
The advantage is we banish artists, labels and managers
Amateurs found six feet deep in metal canisters, we
[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & M.O.P.]
Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer
Aim, cock
Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer
Aim

[Verse 2: Lil' Fame]
Lil' Fame bring it live, yo, that's what I strive for
I'mma settle this before you get to call five-o
You wanna see me four-five blow?
Nigga, put the phone down 'fore I dump two times four
What you wanna cry for? You know that my hammer is heavy
And it got kick like taekwondo, now you gwon die slow
I'mma show you how to stretch a motherfucker if you wanna watch tae bo
(Yo, we down by law) And when I hold this pound down for
It's for me to put it down (By war), shit is like downhill
I'mma make a nigga smell the corpse from Kings County Morgue to Brownsville (Ohhh!)
Rep your hood and wave the flag
For almighty Pharoahe, Fizzie Womak, and Danze
(Guns up) Guns down
(From sun up) To sundown
Make you sing 'til ya a-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, dow!

Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer
Aim, cock
Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer

[Verse 3: Billy Danze]
I'mma put you cowards in perspective
If you looking for child's play, don't look my way
They have never gave me any credit
So I developed a homicide fetish, deal with it, motherfucker, it's your call
It's only seven ways a nigga usually fall, I'm abusin 'em all
Now will the real comers please stand? Get up against the wall
(Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!) Yes, yes, y'all
Make it easy on yourself, Danze don't sleep
When I catch you on a creep, I'll lift the ground right from up under your feet
That's word to 'Lah, be a man and prepare to die
It's the return of the hooded soldier, your man should've told ya (Be cautious if it's walking sideways)
Intended to blaze (First family) and Pharoahe Monch, studying criminal ways
[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & M.O.P.]
Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer
Aim, drop
Show no mercy
For the love of this shit, here niggas are bloodthirsty
Try, load
Lock, hammer
Aim, cock3Embed
