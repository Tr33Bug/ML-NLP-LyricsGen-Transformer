Official Lyrics[Chorus]
Pharoahe's official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
From my intricate ways to shake your whole team
Official, Starter hit harder than Fort Greene
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
For my intricate ways to break your whole team

[Verse 1]
My style makes the crowd say, "Ow!"
Like number 55 on the Chargers
I promise thee, I dodge a nigga like Raul Mondesi
Sombrely stay calm, by any means like Natrone
The bomb like Hail Mary's inflated with napalm
Rap please us, deliver scriptures similar to Jesus
That you couldn't catch if you was Ivan Rodriguez
So don't compete within the zone where the mind enters
I'm on the phone in the luxury box like George Steinbrenner
The owner, making you give your diamond back like Arizona
Winning, always Indian like Chief Noc-A-Homa
Sock a nigga in his face, Pharoahe's a sporting authority
Blacks attracted to my rap like dames to sororities
You already fucked up when you stepped up to bat
Strike (one), strike (two), strike (three), that's that
[Chorus]
Pharoahe's official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
From my intricate ways to shake your whole team
Official, Starter hit harder than Fort Greene
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
For my intricate ways to break your whole team

[Verse 2]
Yo, the realness stuck, females 'blauch' my knob like Chuck
Dispense the standing eight count
Commence to rebound like Buck Williams
Triple Crown threat to score, plus the bonus strange
Without the Rover, more range than Rey Ordonez
One of the MC's, flip my kind of grammar on the break
Three on one like Phi Slamma Jamma
Serve a slot, a curve-splitter-knuckleball-spitter-change
Every bitter rhyme hit a note, quote, "Get a game"
Not Allen Iverson, forget crossing over, shake men
Similar to Troy, I bring the pain destined to ache men
Break men off, take men out, make me wanna slander
Prime Time, my rhyme defense beyond Deion Sanders
I walk the earth with my rod in this strick land
Promise, people thought I was Thomas Hearns the way I hit, man

Pharoahe's official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
From my intricate ways to shake your whole team
Official, Starter hit harder than Fort Greene
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
For my intricate ways to break your whole team

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on
It's Lee Stone, Pharoahe Monch for real
With the official Hip Hop to kill
Know what's the deal, come on, check it
Yo, yo, yo

[Chorus]
Pharoahe's official like Starter, hit harder than Fort Greene
Authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
From my intricate ways to-to-to-to, yo, yo
Official, Starter hit harder than Fort Greene
No authentic, Nike, Adidas and Spalding
Then hid it behind the back like making 'em all fiend
For my intricate ways to-to-to-to
[Verse 3]
Yo, I stick around like hockey, now what the puck?
Cooler than fuck, maneuver like Vancouver Canucks
In your speaker, destroy your woofer, mids and tweeters
Not Wolverine but still I holds claws like Chamique
Waterboys get slaughtered automatic like Bobby Boucher
Push your wig back like Marv Albert's toupee
Blaze a trail like Portland on a track that'll amaze ya
Omnipotent on the D like Clyde Frazier
Slide, phase ya, glide get off the, uh
I'm coming with the *scatting*2Embed
