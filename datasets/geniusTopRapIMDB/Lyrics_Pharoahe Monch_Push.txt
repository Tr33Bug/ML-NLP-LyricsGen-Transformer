Push Lyrics[Chorus: Mela Machinko]
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'

[Verse 1: Showtyme]
I live my life one day at a time
Hold my head, so I don't lose my mind
Sometimes you might fall down, but you get back up
Get on your journey, yeah, keep on
[Chorus: Mela Machinko]
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'

[Verse 2: Mela Machinko, Showtyme, both]
I walk by faith and not by sight
Done pushed my struggles, endured my pride
I fear no man, I know wrong from right
We push until the day we see the light
And we keep on

[Chorus: Mela Machinko]
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'
Pushin'

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
You weak-ass Compu-Box power shots miss and fly over me
My accurate jabs connect like rotary
Make you notice me, be like, "Damn, dude's awesome, totally
When he rides the bass line like Ginóbili"
I'm—vocally unmatched, globally
With the flow, so underground, but more public than notary
Push, in this era of G.W. Bush
We must load mental ammunition and bust
Thus, I'ma hold you down, I got you
One more repetition, I'ma spot you
This is for my blue collar workin', beer guzzlin'
Bootleg, DVD sellin', keep hustlin'
Push, if you represent the struggle then push
Peep the pieces of the puzzle and push
Never let 'em place a muzzle, just push

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
(Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
(Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep onEmbed
