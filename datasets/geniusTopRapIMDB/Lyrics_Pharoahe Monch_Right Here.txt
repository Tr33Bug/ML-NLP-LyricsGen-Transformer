Right Here Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Ayo, Uptown (What?!)
The Bridonx (What?!)
Long Isle (What?!)
Stridong (What?!)
Yo, Brooklyn (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)
Yo (What?!)

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the fuck is Queens? (We right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the... yo
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo (We right here!)
[Verse 1]
We can face the fuck off like hockey or Face/Off like Travolta
Face off like car radios with the mind of Minolta
Face off like Treach if you're fucking with Vin Rock
You still pop shit? I face off like fembots
And I'm the six million motherfucking dollar man
With a six million motherfucking dollar plan
For thug niggas and pimp players and drug niggas
Your technique, I sweep under the rug, niggas
Out of Queens, shit, I serve with the fiends and bug niggas
I'm above niggas, but all in all, I love niggas
Like my man Benny Rat showed me the rap game
Told me never to act sane on a record or rap plain
Now the name reign supreme, seen major cream
Rhymes sicker than Lyme disease and gangrene
I'm the most obligated, nigga creating havoc
Check the meaning for Monch, the meaning becomes tragic

[Refrain]
Raw, if you want it, raw, yeah, we got it indeed
Yo, actually I'm just trying to eat
For sure, if you need it on tour, yeah, we ready to bleed
I'm saying, God, I'm just trying to eat

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayo, Uptown (What?!)
The Bridonx (What?!)
Long Isle (What?!)
Stridong (What?!)
Yo, Brooklyn (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)
Yo (What?!)

Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the fuck is Queens? (We right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the... yo
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo (We right here!)

[Verse 2]
Basically y'all could get eight twice like Lynn Swann plus get ate like pussy
Get ate like Mickey D's after the hydro when you push me
Get ate like cannibalism and sliced surgical
In any extremity, y'all get infinity vertical
Every line to word of mine will be verbally placed to murder you
The master, flipping convertible flows irreversible
Unobtainable to the brain, it's unexplainable what the verse'll do
Pharoahe's the sperm, your mind's the eggs I'm bursting through
Y'all heard of me, I pack macs and crack vertebrates
Leave niggas with third degree burns and back surgery
Mics, guns, knives, pick, declare which object, flip
Have niggas running like The Blair Witch Project

[Refrain]
Raw, if you want it, raw, yeah, we got it indeed
Yo, actually I'm just trying to eat
For sure, if you need it on tour, yeah, we ready to bleed
I'm saying, God, I'm just trying to eat
[Pre-Chorus]

Yo, Brooklyn (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)

[Chorus]
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the fuck is Queens? (We right here!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo, where the... yo
Where the fuck is Queens? (Right here!)
Yo (We right here!)Embed
