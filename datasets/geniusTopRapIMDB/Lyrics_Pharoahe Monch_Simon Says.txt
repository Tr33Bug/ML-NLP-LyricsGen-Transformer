Simon Says Lyrics[Produced by Pharoahe Monch]

[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, ahh

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, "Get the fuck up"
Throw your hands in the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty
[Verse 1]
Y'all know the name (Uh)
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed (Uh)
You all up in ya Range and shit, inebriated (Uh-huh)
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold Platinum 'round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit, it's all good
I'm soon to motivate a room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, style's greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall, then you missin' the point

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, "Get the fuck up"
Put your hands to the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties (Yeah)
Yeah, fuck it, I said rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 2]
Yo, where you at? (Yo, where you at?) Uptown, let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BMs
Heads give you beef, you put 'em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping 'til after 12 p.m.Â 
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday, you will agree I'm
The most obligated, hard and R-rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess, the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
'Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rollies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point
You might also like[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, "Get the fuck up"
Throw your hands in the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Outro]
New Jeruz (Get the fuck up)
Shaolin, yeah (Get the fuck up)
Long Isle, c'mon (Get the fuck up)
Worldwide, c'mon, c'mon (Get the fuck up)38Embed
