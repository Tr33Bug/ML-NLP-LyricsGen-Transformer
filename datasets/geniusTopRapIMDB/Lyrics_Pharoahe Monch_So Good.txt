So Good Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Let go of your fears, don't run and hide
Just open up, let me come inside
Earth is what heaven is once we get into it
There's no need to speak, I just wanna do it
Are you feelin' depressed? Give it to me
Stress? Give it to me
Uh, give it to me
Ah, give it to me
[Chorus]
It's so good, so good, it's so good, so good
You're so good, so good, you're so good, it's so good
You're so good, so good, so, so good
So good, so good, you're so good, this is so good
It's so good, so good, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 2]
Very provocative, plus a little deeper
You mind if I get a little deeper?
Got something to share with you, I got wisdom to teach you
Sexiest spot, something to reach you
In the clothes you were born in
Late in the night, again in the morning
Insatiable, your face, your taste
Your skin, the space I'm in

[Chorus]
It's so good, so good, it's so good, so good
You're so good, so good, you're so good, it's so good
You're so good, so good, so, so good
So good, so good, you're so good, this is so good
It's so good, so good, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 3]
Seventies black zodiac poster positions
Venus and Mars, this is the God, kiss the star system
We sip Shiraz, dick is hard with the bard's rhythm
Stay up to pause, lick guitars with the god's wisdom
Is it starting to rain? Yes
Such a beautiful pain, give it to me
Undisputable claims, give it to me
For a suitable

It's so good, so good, so good
So good, it's so good
So good, so good
So good, so goodEmbed
