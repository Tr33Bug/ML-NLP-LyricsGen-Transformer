Stand Your Ground Lyrics[Intro]
If speed is what you need
If progress what you want to possess
See, when the system get you down

[Verse 1]
I am just one man but I know my power
It's the final call, we're in the final hour
And we must not divide as we march toward our future

Ahh, that could've been my mother
Ohh, that couldâ€™ve been my brother

Get involved, get involved, get involved, get involved
[Chorus]
Stand your ground

Descendent of the blood of slaves
Used to be the one afraid
Until I learned my soul's divine
Amalgamate, let's combine, unify, get in line and

[Chorus]
