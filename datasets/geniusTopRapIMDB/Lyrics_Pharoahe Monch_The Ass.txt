The Ass Lyrics[Chorus]
The ass
The ass
The ass
The ass

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Fuck it, I shagged her without the usages of Viagra
Had her coming like Niagara Falls when I bagged her
On the cellular, my genitalia pitched the pelvis
Uh-huh, when her hips gyrate like Elvis
She tried to scurry hurry to finish very alone
Tell my doggs what's necessary 'bout how I bury the bone
She said, "When you ready to blast, don't ask, say when"
Had her screaming like lighting a nuke when I was halfway in
In the past I used to send 'em back, give 'em the minimum
Now I leave 'em with venom on their chin when I'm bending 'em
Y'all know the name, get it engraved, sex slave
Stadium style, from the back, ass doing the wave (Hey!)
Yelling to me is a felony
Hell'll be froze over when I celebrate celibacy, case closed
My dick rules everything around me, D.R.E.A.M
Get the ass without spending the cash, now look at 'em
Standing tall with the veins all in it
Nuts ripped up with the brain all in it
My man Mike to see more dick than Dastardly and Van Dyke together
Help me make it through the pain, struggle and the bad weather
Yo, be on your way on your lesbian quest
I'm chilling at the rest with Five Fingers of Death
And a whole lot of cash
Especially if y'all sisters ain't up in the
[Chorus]
The ass
The ass
The ass
The ass
(Ladies)
The dick
The dick
The dick
The dick

[Verse 2: Apani B Fly]
Vaginas diamond studded, you know you love it
Rub dick the right way, don't be coming quick like express trains
Make your Jones crazy
Swallow bones but no babies, to stick this, gotta lick this
Tonight's entree is cherries Bombay
And Thai-Thai's flavored caf√© latte
Broke-ass bumbaclaat, let's rock, can't play with mines
Need nine inches dangling, pinching my spine
Hanging ten with the best of wenches that never flinches
Bench your game, poor form won't score
Gotta hit the backboard, like it raw backdoor
Want to pause hardcore porn style, baby
Who do it better? Say my name backwards and spell each letter
Be having grams of spasm, leaving on a stretcher
And gets you wetter and incredible, suction
Punk-ass you're whack pumping, ready to rupture
Busting wildly like NYPD
So typically we wasn't ready for the fantasy freak
Don't sleep, privately I peep with devices
Energizers keep me vibrating in a crisis
Representing my bitches, throwing clitorises
Like ventriloquist-es limp penises, don't kiss these pussy lips-es
Please, you play clay with top grade shit
I seen bigger dicks in pre-K (Nah!)
