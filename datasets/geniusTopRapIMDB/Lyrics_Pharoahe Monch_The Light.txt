The Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground, I was like, "Ohhhhh... shit!"
She's off the hook
I would dress her decently, but look, her body is immaculate
I'm attacking it from all positions of thinking inside my mind
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there
And say, "Excuse me, can I have your number, please?
I'll get on my knees if I have to"
She'll laugh through the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked down
No cock-blocking please, this one's mine
Dimepiece and shit, son, shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme, I wouldn't lie, I swear
Sparkling the whole time as I whispered in her ear
[Chorus]
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

[Verse 2]
Now some say I'm a little bit of thug slash b-boy gentleman
But let me introduce myself, also begin
So that you can further understand what I say
I took this last swallow of the Grand Marnier
And slid her to the dancefloor, now she like, "Wow!
Oh, damn, money got style"
Funny how things change when you got a little liquor in you
You're quicker with the tongue, giving me rhythm now, huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us, impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns, let's blow this joint
It's pointless to stay here, so let me anoint

[Chorus]
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

We kissing and we wrestling, sexual confessions
I never lack to pack prophylact', I learned my lesson
First impression, to be discrete, use discretion
Back of the cab, undressin', uh-huh
I'm here with you, sort of like a bond, spiritual
All night, all I could do is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Aliz√© on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away, nothing to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
I'm her horizon, right, but in the night though
Night glow type shit

[Chorus]
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

[Outro]
And I know can see the light, baby
Once you understand
What, what you mean to me, girl
What you do, no doubt, check it out now
Now I know you can see the light, baby
Once you understandEmbed
