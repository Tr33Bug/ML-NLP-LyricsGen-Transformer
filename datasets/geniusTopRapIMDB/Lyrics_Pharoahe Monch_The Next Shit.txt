The Next Shit Lyrics[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We 'bout to introduce the next millennium rap now
Pharoahe Monch Busta Rhymes
That'll bang your head shit (Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What you talking about? Yeah

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & Busta Rhymes]
The next millennium rap, now everybody listen
Condition yourself to be knocked out of commission
Watch out, 'cause this is a new world transmission
Permission to shine now, our time to glisten
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I scatter data that'll have my niggas Catamaran-ing
Around yachts, cop figures like Knotts Landing
The last batter to hit, blast shattered your shit
Smash any splitter or fastball, that'll be it
Didn't figure the ridiculous flow will hit vigorously
Triggering a rigorous amount of energy
That'll be definitely needed, defeat a foe who retreated back
See no need to repeat it
Permission to shine, stop this and rewind that back
Listen and find Pharoahe Monch, the rhymes phat
You run up on him without a gun, I run up on 'em
And son 'em, stun 'em, verbally never seen me comin'

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & Busta Rhymes]
The next millennium rap, now everybody listen
Condition yourself to be knocked out of commission
Watch out, 'cause this is a new world transmission
Permission to shine now, our time to glisten
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)

Yo, Busta Rhymes, the imperial lyrical you heard
Kill like the one syllable word
The criminal of the lyrical killing you pitiful
Niggas leaving you in a critical, destroying your mineral
Back when I was scrambling in front of the deli
Live on a celly, which was in a street whipping on shiny Pirelli
Now every millisecond I try to reckon with niggas for jacking
Like they really thugging, I ain't even checking
How niggas could try to act like they really them foul niggas
Fucking with now niggas, better bow, niggas
For moderation niggas going to hibernation
While I legally chase the situation of hyper nation
Now that we credible, I require a busy schedule
Collecting federals, being put on a pedestal
While we clean and we keep on your feeding, you know the meaning
Start to holler and screaming until your stomach start bleeding

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & Busta Rhymes]
The next millennium rap, now everybody listen
Condition yourself to be knocked out of commission
Watch out, 'cause this is a new world transmission
Permission to shine now, our time to glisten
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
The next shit (The next shit)
