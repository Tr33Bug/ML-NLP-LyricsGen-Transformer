Trilogy Lyrics[Intro]
I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may now kiss the bride
Act I:

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
[Verse: Pharoahe Monch]
God, why is my wife bleeding?
Sheet covers her face, paramedics are leaving
Behind her clothes, it's apparent she's not breathing
I'm a little confused about what it is I'm seeing
Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the living room with all of their guns drawn
Out, and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is
I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cellphone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six-pack of O'Doul's and some soul food
Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it, 'cause my wife isn't back from her trip
I sneak the gifts into the house and she'll never expect it
Except that though

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life

[Chorus: Dwele]
He put the gun in my hand
Told me, go take my revenge
Killing him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

[Verse: Pharaohe Monch]
I tied his hands behind his back to the night-stand, fast
Ropes made bruises on his light-skinned ass
"See, I can play games too"
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to
Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck, man, we grew up together
Run-DMC, tougher than leather
With the same outfits, forty-deuce
Takin' flicks like, "What?" "Shit!"
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man
I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
*muffled talking*
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everything you imagined, was it perfect?
[Chorus: Dwele]
He put the gun in my hand
Told me, go take my revenge
Killing him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dwele]
He put the gun in my hand
And told, told me to go take my revenge (Take my revenge)
Killing him won't make it go away, no
It's only gon' bring more pain
Act III:
[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love, to cherish, but
Death did us part, what a coincidence
Now perhaps the police will be convinced that it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker says, passing up my residence
And to believe those files set a precedence
From the start, it should've been obvious it never did
Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And the sadistic way you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art
And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
Three-sixty-five days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how I would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

[Chorus: Tone]
Evil eyes that bide, how they go you so much
Why do we, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry 'cause slowly you try, so slowly you die

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Buried alive in the grave, too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
An old friend of mine, she sleeping with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times
And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishing checks and royalties
She thinking it's true love, he's scamming her for the guap
Got alone to devise my own intuitive plot
Put the prose on him, launched the probe on him
And I haunt him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted
Guess we all 'bout to murder tonight
Miss Pretty Brown Eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib
You'll find under the mat in the front of the house
Just do it, word out

[Chorus: Tone]
Evil eyes that bide, how they go you so much
Why do we, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry 'cause slowly you try, so slowly you die1Embed
