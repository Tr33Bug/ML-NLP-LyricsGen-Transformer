W.A.R. Lyrics[Intro: Pharoahe Monch & Immortal Technique]
Okay
Yeah

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
We are renegades, this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades, never slaves, this means war
One-hundred percent uncut, raw
Fuck limited freedom, nigga, we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army, motherfucker, this means war
[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I got a middle finger for mass media, mute the news
'Cause 'When The Gun Draws' received a million views
Which gives me the right to break the rules
Say, fuck radio if the people can't pick and choose
While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
It's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions, mysticism, call me Mr. Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it

[Pre-Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
Population control, make the babies sick
RFID chips, RU-486
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime, said

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
We are renegades, this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades, never slaves, this means war
One-hundred percent uncut, raw
Fuck limited freedom, nigga, we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army, motherfucker, this means war

Alhamdulillah's a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
It's not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves, you can't tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
It's not your average rap recording
This is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins
The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
It's not The Doors, man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours, man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu

[Pre-Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]
On some rabies shit, RU-486
Population control, make the babies sick
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And I am on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime
[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
We are renegades, this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades, never slaves, this means war
One-hundred percent uncut, raw
Fuck limited freedom, nigga, we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army, motherfucker, this means war1Embed
