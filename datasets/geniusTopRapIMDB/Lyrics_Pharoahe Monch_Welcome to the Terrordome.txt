Welcome to the Terrordome Lyrics[Intro: Talking]
(*voice being scratched*)
In a time when we're spending billions of dollars
In a war to control oil in Iraq
Three-thousand soldiers have come home in coffins
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq civilians have lost their lives
Our brothers and sisters in New Orleans
Are left homeless and hungry
They murdered Sean Bell
They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury
And it's time to say no more!
No more! No more! No more! No more!
[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
Here's your ticket, uh
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black attack
So I sat and japped, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it, huh
Hear my favoritism roll, oh
Never be a brother like me go solo
Lazer, Anastasia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex (Hear me now)
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em goin in fear
Rhetoric said, it read just a bit ago
Not quittin', it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin' jerked
Changin' some ways to way back in the better days
Raw, metaphysically bold, never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows
'Cause it's comin' from the heart
What I got, better get some (Mm-hmm)
Hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respects been givin', how's ya livin'?
Now I can't protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An international wreck played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
So welcome to the terrordome
You might also like[Chorus]
Come on down (Get down)
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Come on down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Get down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
There's a hole in an apple, an apple has been rotten
Scheme like the Klan, I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme screen writer, slick street editor
Drop the LP and he hit like Hezbollah
Seven years later, it's the year of the Gods
United States government is just a facade
The Catholic Church got ties with the mob
I see it all like The Wizard of Oz
Now there's a yellow brick road, the fame, riches and cars
If you only had a brain, you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation, cut your education
Secret information, world domination
Take over reservations, trigger the energies
In the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes in the sky, hidden observation
If you're over sixty-five, they'll take away your medication
Like, "Give me that" (Give me that), "Fall in line" (Fall in line)
"Go to war" (Go to war), press rewind
'Cause when I get mad, I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin' that you never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Black to the bone, my home is your home
Well, welcome to the terrordome
[Chorus]
Come on down (Get down)
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Come on down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
You can get it, get it, get it, get it1Embed
