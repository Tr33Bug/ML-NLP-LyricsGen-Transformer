When the Gun Draws Lyrics[Intro: Tom Mauser]
Something is wrong in this nation
When a child can grab a gunsâ€”grab a gun so easily
And shoot a bullet
Into the middle of a child's face, as my daughter experienced
Something is wrong

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
First the gun draws and you know
That something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You can't be scared now
When the streets is calling you
[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Good evening, my name's Mr. Bullet
I respond to the index when you pull it
The trigger, so make a note, take a vote
Quick man, nickname's 'Quaker Oats' 'cause
Whether domestic violence or coke deals
See, I lust to change brain matter to oatmeal
And when I kill kids, they say shame on me
Who the fuck told you to put they names on me?
White man made me venom to eliminate
Especially when I'm in the hood, I never discriminate
Just get in 'em, then I renovate
Flesh, bone, ain't nothin' for me to penetrate
And it can happen so swiftly
One false move just might shift me
If I'm enlodged and your soul's not claimed
I will remind that ass when it's about to rain, like

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
First the gun draws and you know
That something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You can't be scared now
When the streets is calling you

Would the new method of murder be arson or firebombs
If the cost of a single bullet was more than the firearm?
Strange, that is, when all exits are final
Point blank; range, that is
My attitude is cold and callous
Killed kings in Tennessee, presidents in Dallas
And if the past be known, at last we know
What happened that afternoon on the Grassy Knoll
It's what made a widow of Jackie O
The government hired Lee Harvey to blast me, though
Fatality shot entered from the right temple
Was not fired from a six-story window
Can it be that it was all so simple
But yet remains so painful to rekindle?
I come through your city, I'm hot
Whether you're jiggy or not, whether you're Biggie or Pac
When the gun draws

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
First the gun draws and you know
That something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You can't be scared now
When the streets is calling you3Embed
