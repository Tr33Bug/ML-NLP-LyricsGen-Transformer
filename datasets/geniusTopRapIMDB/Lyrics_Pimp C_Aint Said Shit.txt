Ainâ€™t Said Shit Lyrics[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's realness over millions
You niggas fake it till you make it though
It's love over money
Won't put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch ain't bad, she basic
These niggas ain't said shit

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh uh
Hoes sell pussy and I be selling rap's
I don't gamble with this game I ain't in to shooting craps
I don't fuck with no dice and I don't play with no cards
But I know how to get some paper with my dick when it's hard
I squeeze it like some lard, I'm a pimp like a hoe
I get down and dirty like a pit bull dog
Lose or fall, all jumping love it
I got the Bentley through the fall with having money
I've been hearing Devin since the Odd Squad
Original, them other niggas broads and frauds
Walking over your for sure pussy
Tryna get some more pussy
Them nigga gave my piece to suck in the right lane
Tell my bitch she still on my team
Cause she know if I was with it was all about some cream
Tell my bitch she still on my team
Cause she know if I was with it was all about some cream
[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's realness over millions
You niggas fake it till you make it though
It's love over money
Won't put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch ain't bad, she basic
These niggas ain't said shit

[Verse 2: Devin The Dude]
It's time to roll, who got a cigar?
Oh shit I do, let me get that hoe from out the car
Fix it up and twist it up right quick
There's no surprise why my eyes like this
See I keep a cold blank
I smoke and hang all over the wall
The weed is good and stink
While putting my thing all over you love
But I'm never hard on them, I pet the cat softly
If papers involve I pull out my black sharpie
Because I'm much too cool to lose
To hot to be held
It's time to bail when the pussy starts to smell
And grip the grain like my man C
'Cause strangely mainly lames be tryna hang me
But I keep flipping keep stepping
Keep repping keep accepting all the head the hoes be giving
Its Devin in the house
Sweet off in my mouth
All the time I'm high high high

It's realness over millions

Won't put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch ain't bad, she basic
These niggas ain't said shit
