Coming Up LyricsHold up, we jammin
I can't let nobody hold me down
These hoe's could never hold me
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin
Livin these hoe's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maze
And these bitches, they can't stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
(On them dubs)
Choppin on dubs and showin 'em love
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough
Young bitch, hold up, hold up, young bitch
Bitch, I just don't wanna stop comin' up
Uh, it's never too much, the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real, them hoe's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto, had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin
Now, I go and do movies in L.A
Playin the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm tryna get my mothafuckin paper on
I want the new [Incomprehensible] and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they records sound shitty
When I see you in the town, I'ma hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up
I can't let nobody hold me down
These hoe's could never hold me
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin
Livin these hoe's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maze
And these bitches, they can't stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
(Comin' up)
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
Thats the reason for my uncontrollable ballin right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store, I paid the price now
My life is too valuable for me to play with life now
Of course theres gon' be some niggas who gon think I done changed
They find me guilty simply cause, now, I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business, so, give me my cash or give me my check
See I can vividly remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin', sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night, to see another day on the block
Movin rocks got us full pockets plus knots in our socks
But now, money be comin in wads like blocks
Lets go half on a Yacht, I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters, you've been muted by my paper chase
I can't let nobody hold me down
These hoe's could never hold me
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin
Livin these hoe's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maze
And these bitches, they can't stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
(Comin' up)
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far?
At 18, I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now, I'm smokin hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle, now, I'm rockin clubs
After 'Diamonds N Yo Face', I was coppin dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So, if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin us
Look, you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia, huh
Look, you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click, peep the watch I'm wearin
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Leclarion
Lil' Flipper, tote pistols, for them non-believers
Cause down here we poppin trunks on Cadillacs and Regals, oh boy
I can't let nobody hold me down
These hoe's could never hold me
Cause I'm comin down, playa surroundin
Livin these hoe's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin maze
And these bitches, they can't stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
(On them dubs)
Whats up? Lets go, choppin on dubs and showin 'em love
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough
Young bitch, hold up, hold up, young bitch
Bitch, I just don't wanna stop comin' up
Young bitch
