Dickies Lyrics[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, already
Two underground kings, one underground legend
I've been in my dickies, my black flags since day one
Yeah, Pimp where you at?

[Hook: Pimp C]
Got my dickies on ho

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhhhhh, Uhhhhh
I'm Pimp C bitch, got my dickies on ho
Keep a chrome .44 and a bumper full of snow
Got red dickies, white dickies, orange dickies too
And I even got the blue for when I represent for Screw
Nigga, I been wearing khakis since before that shit was cool
Fucking with Jon Johnson wearing dickies to the school
With them hard heads packed a condomn, gangsta night
Way before I had a record, I was rocking the mic
Got a pocket full of stones nigga
Call me Sweet Jones nigga
You girl love me, she can't leave my dick alone nigga
Cause she a carnivore
Take the leash off the bitch cause she a real live whore
[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say man I'm fresh off the west side of 9th street soldier
I be up on my grind early morning, no Folgers
No Starbucks, nigga no latte
Need it for me, I hit up the streets and get it grande
Hit the swap meet, I head up to the flea market
Swang the candy slab through and let 'em watch a G park it
I'm buying Jordans or them thousand dollar I.D's
And a fresh pair of dickies that's how I be
I'm khaki'd up, I'm creased tight
With no cuffs, yeah that's right
Strapped in the back, not in the front
Tec on the side, 'bout to smoke a blunt
So pass the strawberry Philly bro
Or the Swisher Sweet cigarillo really though
And fill it up with the sticky
Make sure the ashes don't fall on my dickies

[Hook: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Got my dickies on ho, got my tickets on bitch
Young fresh nigga, hundred thousand dollar outfit
Got a new one everyday, hundred dollars ain't shit
Made a hundred for the fit, left a hundred dollar tip
One time I lost a crip, tax in Missisip
I'll tell you 'bout it later, bet you niggas gon' trip
Ask me how I did it, I tell them clientele
Now everybody hating on me, that why the hell he ain't in jail
Bitch I ain't in jail cause I'm a muhh'fucking G
Making dirty money so I put it in the clean
Lights going on, baby way too many carats
Watch keep blushing, got a young nigga embarrassed
Hate where you, no way you always sitting Ferris (wheel)
Look into the mirror, changes scare me
M.O.B that's how the rich got rich
22-20 make a real nigga snitch
