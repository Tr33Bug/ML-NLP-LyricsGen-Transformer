Down 4 Mine Lyrics[Intro:]
Foreign cars and foreign hoes
Foreign hoes, c'mon let's go
Yeah man.. talkin' 'bout
This my first solo album bitch, I ain't never had one before
Yeah, they dropped that other shit while I was in the penitentiary
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I got out and dropped that comp on they ass and fucked 'em up, know what I'm saying
But hey man you done slipped and slid to another lid, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah you know, uh uh uh uh uh
This is a Pimp C starring in The Naked Soul of Sweet Jones
A blast from the past
[Verse 1:]
I stay paid and I like blades
Old school cars and loving maze
I got hoes and I do shows
Getting money and driving Rov's
I keep my grind, I don't waste my time
Comin' up getting down for mines

[Hook:]
I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to have it (Gots to have it)
I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to grab it (Ohhhhhh)

[Verse 2:]
Foreign Cars and foreign hoes
Gators slippers and mink robes
Up my folds, they broke and I got a big bankroll
Stand up in yo' bitch and make her touch her toes
Make your girl lose her mind when I penetrate from behind
Comin' up getting down for mines

[Hook:]
I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to have it (Gots to have it)
I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to grab it (Ohhhhhh)

[Verse 3:]
Touch yo' liver, hit yo' spine and yo' spleen
Yo' pussy get wet when I step on the scene
I got Malcolm X and purple leaves
Have some coke, na bitch have some weed
Dick taste good, ohh wee wee you my kind
Marvin say lets get it on Kelly told me to bump and grind

I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to have it (Gots to have it)
I'm a fuck you baby, 'cuz I gots to grab it (Ohhhhhh)

[Outro:]
Hol' up, Smoke somethin' bitch
Trademark know what I'm talkin' bout
Ohh wee wee, know what I'm sayin', toppa knocka bitch
Uh huh I've been inducted to the chuch, Know what I'm saying
Mothafucka
Sanctuary, sanctuary
Hol' up, Hol' up, yeah motha fucka
All you old bitch ass niggas out their buying that old King Johnny
Them old cloudy ass diamonds nigga, nigga
Nigga you come in the room lookin' like Hurricane Katrina just hit nigga
Take them big dinner plates off the chain nigga (Take 'em off)
Step up yo' game nigga (Step it up)
You need some big pointers in yo' watch (Bitch)
Yeah, every time you niggas need to get big diamonds you go to, uhh, Emmett
Know what I'm takin' 'bout, I see you
Gave a man, fuck Emmett too for that bitch overcharging a nigga
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, give me something for free bitch
Fucking hoes don't know how to treat a nigga when he come to the store
Eat a dick, I'm out here bitch
I ain't buying no more Bentley's mane
Them hoes ain't got no good customer service over their mane
Man, my shit be fucked up, they don't even give a nigga another car to drive
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, so fuck them hoes I'm getting live
Aye man, I went to the Lamborghini lot (What you did?)
Where I got a apple red motherfucker (What color?)
[?] nigga, ain't no Lamborghini unless the doors go up
Murci√©lago nigga, however you want to pronounce it bitch
Hol' up bitch, dick up in yo' ass bitch
Aye, don't cum fast bitch, smashing on the gas bitch
Pimping class bitch
Chuch!2Embed
