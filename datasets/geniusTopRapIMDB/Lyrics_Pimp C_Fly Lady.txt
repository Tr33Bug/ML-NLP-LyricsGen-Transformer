Fly Lady Lyrics[Intro: Pimp C]
Let the top back, lean to the side
Let the top back, bitch lean to the side x2
Lean to the side x2
Bitch

[Hook: Jazze Pha & *Pimp C*]
Fly lady on my grill, [?] chain
Super fly keep it trill, I ain't gon' never change
I'm really pimpin' mane x4
Fly lady on my grill, [?] chain
Super fly keep it trill, I ain't gon' never change
I'm really pimpin' mane x4
*You got to let the top back, bitch lean to the side
Let the top back, bitch lean to the side x2
Lean to the side, bitch lean to the side*
[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Bitch on the front hood, got them vogues on the ground
Hot drop down when I'm riding through the town
Dick on swole, pockets is too
Can you eat the whole thang? bitch what it do
I know she is, I know she is, I know he ain't
Tryna ride up on me swangidy bangy, when I got pure blood in my paint
Apple over silver or wine berry over gold
And brandy white ain't got no shine, but she too wet hoggin' the road

[Hook: Jazze Pha & *Pimp C*]
Fly lady on my grill, [?] chain
Super fly keep it trill, I ain't gon' never change
I'm really pimpin' mane x4
Fly lady on my grill, [?] chain
Super fly keep it trill, I ain't gon' never change
I'm really pimpin' mane x4
*You got to let the top back, bitch lean to the side
Let the top back, bitch lean to the side x2
Lean to the side, bitch lean to the side*

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Welcome to Grant, country of lac
Ounce of dro, bought in the pack
Niggas want to know why I don't show no love
Cause you a bitch you ain't Slim Thug
Diamond pressing hard, even marks on the grain
Keep head bitches, dead pussy ain't my thang
Listen up bitch I will fuck you with this finger and this rang
Had yo' cock feelin' like a rabbit
Pussy just ain't settling carrots
Sick a scary like the pussy bald, well bitch I like it hairy
Never tricked a bitch and bitch I bet you never tricked a Larry

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Bitch you looking funny you been fucking with that ?
Oh you burn, fucking germ, got that gangsta STD
You hit yo' wall, hit that fucking worm, you was on ecstasy
Get the fuck around me bitch you see you disrespecting me
I don't want yo' pussy anyway, you slow I move to fast
One day I'm in L.A, next day I'm in New York getting cash
I ain't Aston Robert I don't fuck 'em underage
I fuck with grown woman, never swimming, mink coat in between they legs
