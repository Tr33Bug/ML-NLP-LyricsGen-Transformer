Hogg in the Game Lyrics[Intro]
Hold up, hold up bitch
Sweet Jones in this bitch
P-I-M-P, representing the trill ass niggas
Sweet Jones, cutting you fucker

[Hook]
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I got some wet and some brown
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some brown
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town
[Verse 1]
I'm a pig on the streets, I'm a slug in the game
Putting D on the corner heavy as fuck was my name
They call me Sweet James, keep cocaine
Doing 90 in the Benz switching lane to lane
I'm a candy-mane, hot like a flame
Your jewelry look funny, that ain't no byzantine chain
Take that monkey watch off, you a bitch to me
You can use my style but you gon' pay me a fee
Cause ain't shit for free, I'm on a popping spree
Rap-A-Lot mafia life, ain't no stopping me
They call me Tony Montana because I'm letting them hang
When you see me recognize, I'm a hog in the game

[Hook]
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I got some wet and some brown
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some brown
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town

[Verse 2]
Young hog, vicious dog
Keep a bad-ass yellow broad
On the slab, in the nab
Chef Boyardee in the lab
Cook it fat, cut it small
Fifteen thousand at the mall
Gucci shop, Bally shop
Scratch it off, in the drop
2000 C-5
Got 3 million from the Jive
You was tricking with my hoes
I was playing with my nose
Coming down, candy gold
Nigga y'all was playing the role
Telling bitches 'bout my pack
You can get hit in yo' hat

I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some round
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town

[Hook]
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I got some wet and some brown
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some brown
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town

[Verse 3]
Baby you was in your drop, that's when my boys love to pop
Make his fucking jelly jump, step-daddy got hit with a pump
Hit with a pump, it's in my lap at all times nigga
And ain't nothing for that fuck boy to get hit nigga
Cause y'all niggas is some motherfucking hoes
We don't want your records or your motherfucking clothes
You shoes ain't tight and you're phony at your shows
So bend your ass over like a bitch is supposed
I make my fucking music for the boys with the O's
The old school pros and the strip club hoes
The boys with the heart in the motherfucking South
Bitch you ain't had a hit since I saw you break 'em off
[Bridge x2]
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some round
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town

[Hook]
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I'm a hog in the game
I got some wet and some brown
I'm a hog in the game, I got some wet and some brown
I got some white and some syrup, I'm trying to sew up my town2Embed
