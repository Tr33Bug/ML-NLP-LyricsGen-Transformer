I Know U Strapped Lyrics[Chorus: sample of "Project Pat - Drive By"]
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you's a killa

[Intro]
Hol' up
Smoke somethin' bitch
Sweet Jones
The Sweet Jones Stories
Know what I'm talking bout?
P-I-M-P
[Verse 1]
I know you strapped, but you still a fucking bitch nigga
Ya talkin' bumpkin cause I know you ain't shit nigga
And if you don't shut the fuck up, you'll get hit nigga
And we'll put seven in your stomach through yo Hilfiger
I went to Dallas and some bitches tried to test me
But my nuts too big to let a pussy nigga check me
And I ain't laugh, bitch niggas don't disrespect me
You shoulda killed me, bitch the first day that you met me

[Chorus X2]
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa

[Verse 2]
I told you nigga I don't fuck wit no K. Rude
When I was young that nigga fucked me out some paper dude
But'cha called him to the studio that was across
But bitch you almost got your homeboy broke off
Cause Uncle Paul was gonna hit him from the front door
The whole time I had my eyes on this yellow hoe
Tryin' to talk like an O.G., better shut up
Before you get you and your homeboys wet up
You might also like[Chorus X2]
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you's a killa

[Verse 3]
The next night I'm at the kitchen makin' hits and ends
I see some niggas drivin' funny in a square-like Benz
And sure enough it was that bitch that put me in the cross
The first line in my mind was to pick him off
I said "fuck him, let's don't do it yet, let's let him talk
But if that bitch go for his pistol we gon' kill him off"
I told that girl   of that mafia life, bitch
And if you ever try it it's gon' be repercussions and consequence

[Chorus X2]
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you's a killa

[Verse 4]
You niggas week so you call Houston for the hit
But didn't know that we got gangsta niggas all over this bitch
So now you bitches gotta deal with the king, hoe
Cause you done crossed me three times, we just can't let that go
And to that phony 2Pac that threaten my precious momma
You and me down to get some beats for life, you'll feel the drama
They gon' be flyin' ya to the center for that gun-shot trauma
You could get hit in your Bentley or your purple Impala
[Chorus]
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you's a killa

[Outro: talking over Chorus]
Bitch
You ain't no gangsta nigga
Fuck-ass nigga
You ain't slappin' nothing here junior
Better get yo mind right bitch
Dedicated to all you old stick daddy-ass niggas

[Outro: "Scarface - Murder by Reason of Insanity"]
Boy, you should've known not to fuck with me bitch X4
Cause I'm a put it dead on yo ass when you reach

You can eat a dick
Ol' 2Pac wanna be-ass nigga
Get your brains blew out on your dashboard, bitch
Goin' down
Sweet Jones
Platinum bitch!

[Outro 2: "Scarface - Murder by Reason of Insanity"]
What happened, my brother?
He just laid there shaking, bleeding like a muthafuckaEmbed
