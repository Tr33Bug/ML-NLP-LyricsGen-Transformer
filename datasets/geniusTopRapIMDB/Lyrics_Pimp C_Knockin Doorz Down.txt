Knockin Doorz Down Lyrics[Intro]
Another Myke Diesel production

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
[Verse 1: Pimp C]
R.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south
Anything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P
If them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?
Slim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting
Need to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get
Paul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking
Money speak, all that bullshit keep walking
Y'all niggas got the game fucked up
All you record company people need to shut the fuck up (Shut the fuck up)
Cause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping
The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening
The same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out
Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south
Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit
I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Hey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
It's the great state of Texas so I can't believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
It's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
I'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don, Pimp C a king
Lil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team
It ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued
But if we man up and press, we could lead the league
We some all-stars, the roster is sick, man
I ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man
Rap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man
Three, two, one, swish, and

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]
You see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?
Masterpiece, dripped out with the fours on it,
Trunk airtight, speakers and them show lights
Holding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown, knocking doors down
10-11 slabs in a single-file line
Flossing, swerving, the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing
My roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off

[Interlude] (Music Video)
Is this true you're part of the largest mob family in Texas?
Then what are you here for

[Verse 4:Pimp C] (Music video only)
Since I drop Knockin Doorz boys sort it out
Seen the light, want the paper, can't live it out
Z-Ro and Young Thug in the studio
They already platinum you already know
Mike Jones and Koopa they done shook hands
You can lay a plex aside if you a real man
I think that Paul and Chamillionaire talking but ain't rapping yet
It's a start though, we knockin down doorz
TI and Flip still on that boy stuff
Acting like kids, that ain't what time is it
I know you don't like what I'm telling you
But I keep trill, fuck what you feel, that's what I'm telling you
Stop listening what your homeboy selling you
'Cause when pop off, they gon' be bailing fool
And you gon' be alone when you catch the case
So watch your mouth and get that stupid look out your face

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
