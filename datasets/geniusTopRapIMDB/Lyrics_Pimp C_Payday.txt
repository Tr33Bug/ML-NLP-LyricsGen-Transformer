Payday Lyrics[Hook: Pimp C & Juicy J]
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
If you not chasin' money you just in the way
If you a hustler you gon' always find a way
Cause
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Niggas say that I was tricking and sucking them hoes cock
Letting them keep half the money, playing the short stop
I was quarterbacking nigga, putting a bitch out on the track
Looking to get down for the grind and bring all the money back
Bitch you got 8,000, you ain't no P
I get 15,000 for my choosing fee
The Bentley 200 and the house was a mill
200 on my neck and I'm working wood wheel
Tell me how you feel, when you see a pimp shine
Your bitch in your cover got my dick on my mind
Slick on the grind got what them hoes like
Smell good dick good, she Tina, I'm Ike

[Hook: Pimp C & Juicy J]
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
If you not chasin' money you just in the way
If you a hustler you gon' always find a way
Cause
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day
Everyday is payday, day

Nigga, the numbers in my bank account longer than a Limo
If you ain’t getting bread you must didn’t get the memo
All my cars off the showroom floor, I don’t test drive
My new shit ain’t got no roof and the doors suicide
If you try me then it's suicide, goons open fire
Everyday is Halloween nigga, their go Michael Myers
Masked up to get his cash up, wake your ass up
Think you save off in the burbs, ‘til you get your ass touched
All this money, overflowing, I can't even walk
Stepping in the bank, I'm gonna rip the vault
I got some cash,  I can’t hide that shit
Just see, what I wanna go buy that shit
Your girl on my nuts want to try my dick
And she spit back that shit, I'm gon' fire this bitch
