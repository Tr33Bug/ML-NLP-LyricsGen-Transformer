Pourinâ€™ Up Lyrics[Intro: Pimp C]
Smoke somethin', bitch
A trademark (trademark), know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Young Pimp know what we doin'? (Texas!)

[Hook: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, keepin' lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it
[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Grippin' grain, switchin' lanes, sellin' cocaine outta candy thang
Jammin' Lil' Wayne, got a trunk of bang, cause I'm a hot boy, got a hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin' daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock your lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her?
I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin these square hoes out to dinner
The bitch chose me cause she want a winner
I mix a ho head up like a blender, ho need a daddy, you'se pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the 3 just like Steve Jackson nigga say my name watch ya bitch reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James?
Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off cause his raps are shitty plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snort some white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, we play with our nose
Wear platinum piece and with the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match the mink on the floor in my candy 'Lac

[Hook]
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, keepin' lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
Uh I'm comin' out in that candy thang
8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see butter guts and swangs
Candy paint what I'm flippin on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin on
MOMO wood grain I'm grippin on, grippin on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin on, codeine in cup I'm sippin on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin left to right then I turn up the bang
I'mma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick
Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum
I said I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum
I said I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum

Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut

[Verse 3: Bun B]
When I pull the slab out and hit the block, with them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi, maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like the white but I'ma roll the green, purple dro up in the swisha
Chromey lady sittin on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We "G" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down with that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you'se hater
If so, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight
Not like them boys up out that Lone Star state so get it straight
We be...

Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, keepin' lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it13Embed
