Since The 90's Lyrics[Intro: Pimp C]
Uhhhh, hol' up
Sweet Jones

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uhh, I stay draped up, rocked up
Pistol on me, glocked up
Got yo' bitch legs in the air, straight cocked up
You say that he a dealer, I don't think he got no brick
Real weight selling niggas ain't swapping out shit
I'll get you on the next one
You can stop calling Bun
Trying to get me off yo' ass
Empty the clip and smash the gas
I'm Michael Jordan since my record went number one
Number two, twenty-three, that's the bullets that fit my gun
Say something, pussy nigga you ain't gon' have no face
Gangsta party, like E-40 make 'em bring the yellow tape
Closed casket bitch
Still trying to get it since the 90's I been rich
Pussy nigga! Hol' Up! Smoke somethin' bitch

[Hook x2: Gator Mane & *Pimp C*]
Say what I rose up quick
From a O to a brick
Then the cheddar got better cause I'm cold on a bitch
Ice froze on my wrist
Money old then a bitch
And why you *still tryna get it, since the 90's I been rich
Pussy nigga!*

[Verse 2: Gator Mane]
From the ? to ?
UGK '94
I was moving bricks through them Cubans on banana boats
Plenty hoes say that I'm the blackberry Manaloe
Man them bitches pulling tricks, seen it out the antitope
Bitch need a fix, Gator Main got the antidope
Touch J. Prince, I'll put a hole through your cantaloupe
Busting with this Cali code, you think I'd love that Can-N-Go
Yeah I'm from Dallas ho but I don't do know dancing though
Ball player, Gator Mane, Pimp C, 40 water
Real niggas holla trust, tab a knocker, holy water
Ball player, Gator Mane, Pimp C, 40 water
Real niggas holla trust, tab a knocker, holy water
Yeah bitch get 'yo mind right! Rap-a-Lot ball players!

Money old then a bitch
And why you *still tryna get it, since the 90's I been rich
Pussy nigga!*

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'm a monster, triple lobster fettuccine
I ain't never been no weenie
Light a nigga up with the mini
Mini Mini Mac 12
Sending a head with no bail
Penitentiary chance is jail
Fucking around with this scale (scale)
Get back skills of a fail
Just a real nigga 'bout his mail
Got that weed for sale
Can't leave no 'ye per trail
Best believe I'll never tell
On the next man, time to expand
Elevate to the next plan
Transform from the weed to the cocaine
Follow my lead and proceed, I'm the dope man
My whole family got to eat, I'm the only hope man
Living in the ghetto with the goonies and the grimies
Been getting money since the mothafucking 90's
Hung around dope fiends, junkies, alchy's
Pushing that ice cream Cadillac outies
Holding them rifles, choppers, shottys
Questions hot once murdered bodies
Bitch! Who is it? UGK4LiFE

Pussy nigga!*2Embed
