The Honey Lyrics[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Ladies and Gentlemen! (it's Pimpalation pimpin!)
Ladies and Gentlemen! (gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen!)
You are now tuned in to the best!
This here Jazze Fizzle... producshizzle!
Pimp C (ladies and gentlemen!)... Jody Breeze!
Ooowwwhhheee!

[Hook: Jazze Pha & Jody Breeze]
If y'all niggas want the honey
Yeah!
But I just want the money
Young chump change!
Just fifties and them hundreds!
Girl I know you want me I'ma...
Scoop ya in my Impala, new Gucci and that Prada, gotcha coochie by the collar
Well I'mma strip off ya clothes and lay ya down on the flo'
He fucked the shit out that bitch, I fucked the fear out that ho
[Verse 2: Jody Breeze]
Yeah.. hey, uh oh there he go, look who slid through the door
It's ya dog Jody Breeze, I'm the shit on the low
Y'all niggas make me sick, spendin chips on a ho
On the grind, tryna get it, I shit on a ho
Off top, let 'em know, I'mma mack, I'mma pro
Matter fact, lemme hit it from the back later on
Baby, gon' bend it over, tune it up let me see
I ain't from Houston ho, but I'm still a pimp, see?
All I drink is Hennessey, all I smoke is stickery
Hoes wanna get with me, but they ain't get shit for free
I'mma playa, you can tell, ATL where I live
I ain't with the kissin, hoes, Jazze Fizzle let 'em know

[Hook: Jazze Pha & Jody Breeze]
If y'all niggas want the honey
Yeah!
But I just want the money
Young chump change!
Just fifties and them hundreds!
Girl I know you want me I'ma...
Scoop ya in my Impala, new Gucci and that Prada, gotcha coochie by the collar
Well I'mma strip off ya clothes and lay ya down on the flo'
He fucked the shit out that bitch, I fucked the fear out that ho

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Y'all niggas wanna lay, I wanna play in a bitch mind
If she, playin her Daddy, I will knock out her spine
I'm out here on the grind, 24/7 I'm gettin it
I'mma let them tricks eat it up (up!), I ain't trippin bitch!
(Bitch!) Bitch, bend over, let 'em see it girl (girl!)
Hoes in the club, like '96 showin niggas love (love!)
I used to be off in the Chi-C in Atlanta ('lanta!)
Young girls poppin cock out in Alabama ('bama!)
I seen it all from the pimps and the tricks (tricks!)
The real live boys, opening the pussy stores (pussy stores!)
I got respect for the flat backers (backers!)
Black, yellow, or crackers, keep ya Daddy ridin' cause I'mma Cadillacker

[Verse 3: Tela]
Oh, he Tela in the change, I put the "G" in the game
Put the "P" in the pimp (pimp), brought back the blue to the flame (flame)
Break a bitch like a trig, write out some magical shit
And while I feel more slim, that ain't my starter bitch!
Drop the top on the Rolls and roll under the sun
Throw my finger in the air like, "Kiiiddd! Ho I'm the one!"
Got my gators and suits, multiple colours like fruit
Pimp aroma on my breath, Tropicana and Goose
To the roots of pianos, see my moves she can't handle
H.B.O., nigga ho break up overtime Soprano
Diamonds up against panels of wood, it's all good
Lean back, candy 'llac gettin head on my hood (hood)

[Hook: Jazze Pha & Jody Breeze]

Well I'mma strip off ya clothes and lay ya down on the flo'
He fucked the shit out that bitch, I fucked the fear out that ho
Well I'mma strip off ya clothes and lay ya down on the flo'
He fucked the shit out that bitch, I fucked the fear out that ho
