To Lose A Whore Lyrics[Intro]
To lose a whore know what I'm talking about
Cold shit know what I'm talking about
Check it out so I can sing it better

[Verse 1]
How does it feel to lose your bitch?
I'm talking your main girl
The one that go handle shit
And how does it feel to lose yo wife? uh huh
The bitch that had your kids
The one you'd laid down your life
And how does it feel to lose your queen?
How does it feel to drop a whole pint of promethazine?
It's the same way with hoes and pimps
If she don't grind for me I don't eat steak and shrimp
[Hook]
When a pimp loses a whore uh huh
Hold up sometimes it's more than a man can handle
When a pimp loses a whore uh hey hey
Hold up funky bitch
How does it feel to lose the one
The one that the one that had your kids
The one that had your son
How does it feel to lose your mate
The one you came up with
To help get your papers straight
When a pimp loses a whore uh huh

Sometimes that's more than a man can handle
You know I find myself uh you know watching television
Till television went off know what I'm saying
Then I find myself riding by they house few hours later
Shit I'm wondering should I just kick the door
Should I just take back my whore
You know the bitch that would open up the pussy store
And sell cock galore and bring me back chains and cheese
How could this bitch choose this lame
When I'm on top of my game
When I'm getting all this fresh shit and having all these fly things
This bitch must have lost her brain
To go to another nigga after she done been down with James
I guess she wasn't a winner all the time
She was nothing but a lame
She was nothing but a lame
To lose a fucking whore
Sometimes I find myself missing the bitch
Know what I'm saying but then I sing to myself
You know what I say? I say I say whoooo whoooo
Funky bitch I'm missing you funky bitch
Whoo whoo hey hey I'm missing you
Yeah man I hate that bitch for that
You know what I'm talking bout
But I'm a play it by the way the game go
I'm a get me a new bitch
You know what I'm talking bout
A top notch bitch that uh just take all these funky whores spot
You know like Pimpin' Ken said
It's captain slave a hoe not captain save a hoe
Put some of these funky crackers out there to get some of that money back
Get them slaves made for you funky white honkies
And no we ain't voting cause we ain't down with neither one of you bitches
Pimps up and hoes down you bitch
How you gonna be a pimp and you got a pussy
Get your mind on your paper fake ass motherfucker
You ain't even made your mind up
Whether you was gonna pimp or not yet
Until you been in there for ten years or more motherfucker
Until you done lose a bitch and lost your whore motherfucker
Get real Sweet Jones
2002
Really 2006 'cause I'm light years away from your bitch ass
