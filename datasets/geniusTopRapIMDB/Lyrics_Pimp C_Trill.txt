Trill Lyrics[Hook: A'Doni]
You out here grinding for a meal so your family can eat
Holding the chopper with your boys in the streets
I know that when it gets real some hitters ride for me
That's how it's gon' be cause am down with some G's
Show your grill one time for me
Show your grill one time for me

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Bitch my neck on fire and my paint still dripping
Got the internet going up but I ain't tripping
There's a whole lot of niggas on this song right here
But I'm Sweet Jones bitch got your life on my ear
Hanging off my lobe like a big shiny globe
Nigga say they mad, say my name hoe
Y’all niggas faggots and y’all reputation shitty
The New San Francisco is the old chocolate city
[Hook: A'Doni]
You out here grinding for a meal so your family can eat
Holding the chopper with your boys in the streets
I know that when it gets real some hitters ride for me
That's how it's gon' be cause am down with some G's
Show your grill one time for me
Show your grill one time for me

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Show your grill if you real and you down with the trill
Pop pints by the seal went from broke to mill's
Get killed down in Texas we don't play no games
Dope boys in the hood rocking big boy chains
Pulling up in that Benz but ain't got no job
Keep a big four five for them jackers that rob
Steel grip wood wheel then that Caddy with grill
R.I.P Pimp C, I'm still down with the trill

[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
I been a trill nigga day one, never took a day off
Been grinding since I got up, I'm ready for my pay off
You better get your check up, hating niggas catch up
Sweet James Jones make a nigga ice his neck up
'Cause I'm trill, rich before the deal
Six figures with the seven put some rocks up in my grill
Down with them Texas nigga trust me you can see it
Young don seven thirteen please believe it I'm down here

You out here grinding for a meal so your family can eat

I know that when it gets real some hitters ride for me
That's how it's gon' be cause am down with some G's
Show your grill one time for me
Show your grill one time for me

[Verse 3: ESG]
Now show your grill if you real
I made a mil independent
Show the grill in my mouth or the grill on the whip
Bitch that's on the Bentley
R.I.P to my nigga name Chad
He ain't gone but I'm a still act bad
Right about now I got a bitch in the back
With twenty brinks in that god damn bag
Yeah I passed through that Louisiana
I can't wait till I touch down in Atlanta
This for my trill niggas one time for Shanora
And now I feel good a half a mill in my explorer bitch

[Pimp C]
If you got people in lock up man
Send them some bread
Send them some pictures
Write 'em a letter if you ain't got no bread
Write them and tell them
If you had some you would send it to them
And stop being a bitch
It ain't never late to stop being a bitch
[Hook: A'Doni]
You out here grinding for a meal so your family can eat

I know that when it gets real some hitters ride for me
That's how it's gon' be cause am down with some G's
Show your grill one time for me
Show your grill one time for me
You out here grinding for a meal so your family can eat
Holding the chopper with your boys in the streets
I know that when it gets real some hitters ride for me
That's how it's gon' be cause am down with some G's
Show your grill one time for meEmbed
