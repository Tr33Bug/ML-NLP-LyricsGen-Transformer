True Story Lyrics[Intro: Pimp C]

True story lil' bitch
[?] Trademark, trademark, smoke sum' bitch


[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Drop seven in the pot, hit it with the soda
Now I got what them Cali boys call A1 yola
The south is circles and them Atlanta is squares
Lying about the prices, it ain't seventeen up there
I'm down with Young Buck and Buck is down with Pimp C
But ain't nobody got of a ten in no damn Tennessee
It might be twenty-seven or might be twenty-three
Dawg and Biz used to come and get it for 16 from me
They had two niggas that were driving shit back
And they were serving T.I. took his bitch and his Lac, his jury and his money and his 5.0
She had a baby for priest but still my ho
She was translating Spanish with the Mexican
Tryna get a better price, T got fucked in the end
She a square now, Dawg and Biz both dead
Pussy nigga T got locked in the feds
That was his ferrari in the Juve video
The bitch killed Dawg cause he was fucking his ho
Same time, T was fucking Dawg wife
Shawty from the back, T a bitch for life
You can see me in the streets bitch, better keep steppin'
Because even on parole, I'm ice-cold with the weapon
So R.I.P to Big Doe and his mother, but atleast before you die
Kill your pussy ass brother
[Hook]

You niggas ain't real, You lying on your records, you fucking with the trill
So nigga come check us, lil bitch
A true story lil' bitch, a true story lil' bitch, hold up!
( X2 )

[Verse 2]

Aye look they call me Young Rayful, I keep that white bitch
So drop it in a pot, Pussy nigga get rich
The 'Lac sittin' pretty, all black chrome lid
I keep it occupied by a bad yellow bitch
She stay out on the stroll tryna get daddy rich
A couple pink booties entered with the bitch
I done lost everything that I own but my dick
The music ain't nothin', so I had to push bricks
So I hit the fuckin' slab for the 16.5
Fuck scorin' at the crib cause that shit too high
Bad bitch, fake titties push 'em home in the ride
Pop a Xanax pill, two cars behind
Aye look my nerves fucked up I just spent 82.5
If she get pulled over nigga, then I might as well die
But I'm a make it home nigga, set that bitch on fire
For every 36 bitch I'm making 72You might also like2Embed
