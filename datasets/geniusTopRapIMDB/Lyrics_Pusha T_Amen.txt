Amen Lyrics
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)

You like that, don’t ya? I wrote it myself, by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish, but I picture myself gettin' paid
And you might catch pneumonia, 'cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it, now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m tryin' to get paid

Tryna get saved? (Too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stockin' mask, niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’ma let all y'all niggas pray for it, my young niggas knockin' off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end, only fuckin' way I’ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on, my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep tellin' me to go hard, number one spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more, front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red, "Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin' in my lane for, not knowin' that it’s a landmine?
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze, throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood, solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers, I’ma flood, black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine, rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin, under bright lights, where do you belong?
You might also like
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, how many people do you know hatin’
On your downfall, sittin' there, waitin’?
When you shine, I don't know what they gon' say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s child
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over, no reason, beat 'em

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin'
They say they want that dumb shit, well, this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah, now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraordinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it 'cause I lived it' man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen11Embed
