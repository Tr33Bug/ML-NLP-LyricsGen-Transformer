TranslationsEspañolРусскийPortuguêsDiet Coke Lyrics
Yesterday's price is not today's price
Like, like—like, crack—crack, like, like
Like, li—li—crack, crack, crack

Imaginary players ain't been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
Everybody get it off the boat, right?
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?
If your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life
Missy was our only misdemeanor
My tunnel vision's better under stove lights
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
My workers compensated so they don't strike
Wish me luck, see green like Don Bishop
The ones you trust don’t change like them chains you tuck
Far as I'm concerned, who's the best? Me and Yezos
Wash, then dry, so give me all of mine in pesos
Add it up (Add it up)
Your bitches in them pictures but they laser taggin' us
They mad at us, who wouldn't be?
We became everything you couldn't be
Everything your mama said you shouldn't be
The Porsche's horses revvin', like, "Look at me"
Saddle up
I'm still pitchin', baby, batter up

Imaginary players ain't been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
All you niggas get it off the boat, right?
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?
If your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life

The flow's untouched, the drums is tucked
Drive Cullinan when roads get rough
Snow’s a must, the nose adjust
Young Gs like we Hov and Puff
Best jewelries and hoes we lust
Chanel trinkets and hoes'll blush
Crush hearts like pretty boys
And we drivin' pretty toys
Extendos will make plenty noise
Crescendo make your car endo
Pierce your car window
Missy was our only misdemeanor
Nike box hold a hundred thou' with no insoles, uh
The crack era was such a Black era
How many still standin' reflectin' in that mirror?
Lucky me
