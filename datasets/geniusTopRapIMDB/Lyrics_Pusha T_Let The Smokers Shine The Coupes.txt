TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsLet The Smokers Shine The Coupes Lyrics
If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em, baby, I'm Jim Perdue
Cocaine's Dr. Seuss

We sip Ace out the flutes
Chanel scarves out the roofs
If I never sold dope for you
Then you're ninety-five percent of who?
How forsaken arе the rules?
I done paid for all of you's
Thе first 48's the clue
Your jail cells made for two
AMGs on auto cruise
The wrist singin' autotune
The dope game destroyed my youth
Now Kim Jones Dior my suits
If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em, baby, I'm Jim Perdue
Cocaine's Dr. Seuss

Coca leaf and potpourris
Chains over Le Coq Sportif
Don't brag bricks to me
If they ain't tell you to bring your skis
My Patek, hers petit
The triple play be E. Phillips
Bird feathers done made me chief
Whatever happened to black marquise?
Might buy your bitch a jeep
I can make you lose your sleep
You millionaires on just TV
Now make it make sense to me

If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em, baby, I'm Jim Perdue
