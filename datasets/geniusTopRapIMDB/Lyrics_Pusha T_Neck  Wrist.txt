TranslationsEnglishРусскийPortuguêsNeck & Wrist Lyrics
You supposed to put the first five hundred in the safe and lose the combination
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

First in the Beach with a million-dollar auto
Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narcos
812 matte black, lookin' like charcoal
I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie
The money counter ding is so exciting
Summertime, Winterfell, I'm the Night King
The Colgate kilo, the hood needs whitening (Skrrt)
We fishscale niggas like we all Pisces
Your bitch in my bubble like I'm still typing
She hopin' that you let her go like a kite string
Your eco-friendly jewelers, you keep recycling
Cartier bustdowns just not my thing
The B in the center of that left and right wing
The only time you'll ever see me next to Breitling (Skrrt)
Wonder where this started from, the facts are frightening
Richard Pryor's flame gave birth to pipe dreams, now we here

First in the Beach with a million-dollar auto
Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narcos
812 matte black, lookin' like charcoal
I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
(And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line)

The phase I'm on, love, I wouldn't believe it either
I'd be like, "JAY-Z's a cheater," I wouldn't listen to reason either
All I know is E's a felon, how is he sellin'?
Weed, the Caliva brothers, deep down, I believe you love us, huh
Feast your eyes, the piece unique, it's sapphire
Rappers liars, I don't do satire
Neither I nor my wrist move mockingly
Y'all spend real money on fake watches, shockingly
They put me on lists with these niggas inexplicably
I put your mansion on my wall, are you shittin' me?
I blew bird money, y'all talkin' Twitter feed
We got different Saab stories, save your soliloquies
They like, "If BIG was alive, Hov wouldn't be in his position"
If BIG had survived, y'all would have got The Commission
Hov was gon' always be Hov
It 'twas the universe will 'cause Allah said so, and now I'm here

I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
