TranslationsEspa√±olNo Regrets Lyrics
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Say hi to the bad guy, say ahhh to the champagne
Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
(Woo!) They see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Momma had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back, can't you tell?
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sport cars, Italian leather, Princess Cut with baguettes
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
No regrets

Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Presidential, I came back, April showers, I rains back
Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black
Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here
Mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got that by the square (Woo!)
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there
How you acting like I ain't here? D-Boy and I pioneer

Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...25Embed
