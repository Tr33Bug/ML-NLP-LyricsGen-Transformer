TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsScrape It Off Lyrics
I just scraped it off the top (Cut it)
Got it off the road, off the curb, off the block (Cut it)
Was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (Cut it)
Too deep in the streets, felt that pain, but it meant a lot
Whenever she calls, the world, I gotta do (Uh-huh)
I'm movin' with a tool (Yeah), I pity that fool, woah, yeah, oh

Yeah, uh, tell me what I gotta do, pull up in a bucket coupe (Skrrt)
One for me and one for you (Huh?), yeah
Like, what the motherfuck's a roof? (Yeah)
I'm off the chain, don't cut me loose, yeah
I'm off the chain, I'm off the noose (The noose)
Yeah, get 'em pickеd off, Bentley white likе cotton (Cotton)
Residential so good, my doors don't gotta lock 'em (Gotta lock 'em, yeah)
Wash the dirty money with Oxi, I miscount 'cause I'm off of Oxy, yeah
These niggas faker than a damn proxy
Callin' my shooter, he said, "Copy," get that nigga plucked like A Boogie
I like riches, hit like noogies (Noogies), how the fuck you ain't scared of no nigga, but you scared to put on your hoodie?
Man, my buzz light like Woody
I just scraped it off the top (Cut it)
Got it off the road, off the curb, off the block (Cut it)
Was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (Cut it)
Too deep in the streets, felt that pain, but it meant a lot
Whenever she calls, the world, I gotta do (Uh-huh)
I'm movin' with a tool (Yeah), I pity that fool, woah, yeah, oh

New toys (New toys), convoys (Convoys)
Hundred karats on my neck, my boy
That a hundred bunny rabbits tryna get, my boy (My boy)
From the cabbage I collect, my boy
Heard you niggas is gorillas, let me check, my boy (My boy)
Say nothin' silly you regret, my boy
'Cause we got banana clips on the TECs, my boy (My boy)
And I can send it in a text, my boy
Thumbs up or the emoji with the flex, my boy (My boy)
Personalize every threat, my boy
Toll-free (Toll-free), that's direct, my boy (Word)
And if you need a couple keys, I'm the connect, my boy, off the top

I just scraped it off the top (Cut it)
