TranslationsEnglishSunshine Lyrics
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me
You might also like
It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long27Embed
