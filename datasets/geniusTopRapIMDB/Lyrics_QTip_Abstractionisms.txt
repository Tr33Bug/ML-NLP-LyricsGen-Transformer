Abstractionisms Lyrics
I ain't getting caught up in your damns of impression
No matter who the diva I'm the verse for your oppression
Standing in my rightful place, residing as it seems
That it's earthed inside the dark, hopefully you catch the gleam
You turn unto the village, you can see how we get tranqued
Seems to pawn follow pawn, and become the queen's bank
I'm not part of that, I may be ghetto, spack
But I'm too smart to embark into the deadly traps
Never gettin' glassy eye although glaucoma rarely follows
I pride myself as optimist, but damn this place is hollow
Guess I better hit the grind, fill my jams taut with substance
Sprinkle vibes around with result and abundance
Falling prey to categories can be black and abysmal
Damage to the aura, which encases us like crystal
The raising of the bar, is a part of repertoire
We gon' edit negatives off this little black noir
Abstractionisms, for your daily rhythms/nigga 

Peace everybody, glad I've got your attention
We drove the path of ease, and steer clear of pretention
Now we riding high because the weight inside the trunk
Has been sifted, with specifics, its been shifted for the junk
Here's the funk, and the anchor is the bass that make you wiggle
Don't over-analyze it, it's no need for you to niggle
I stand inside my power, like a knight inside the court
Everybody follow suit, if it's rigid don't abort
It's heavenly, somebody sound the reveille
The day is starting in the rhythm's highest pedigree
I got the beat reverberating and energy's on 10
Sending sound-waves through orals, I revitalize the den
Or deep, it's still TM, everybody's got it in them
Don't hold these words as boring even though you all are snoring
Constantly restoring cause we living and we breathing
I'm injected and infected with this premise I'm not leavingYou might also likeEmbed
