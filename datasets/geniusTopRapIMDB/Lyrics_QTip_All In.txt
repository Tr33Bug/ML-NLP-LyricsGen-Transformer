All In Lyrics
"Yo. Niggas be on the mic, they be all serious...
It's good to be serious but... effortless shit
Effortless... effa-efortless. Mmm-hmm
Turn my music up, Duro. Yo, yo, you my hero
Make the shit get louder. Even more in my headphones. Louder
Uh. Sweetheart, shake yo' ass cheeks
Bust it. Mmm-hmmm. Mmm-hmmm."
We gon' knock it down and put this
Rock solid Amplified shit up
It hurts like a sit-up
So you betta send a letta to the betta
We cut the bank and takin' all the bankin' chedda
Girls get pretty-ed up
Then they comin' out the club. Rap cats, lock it up
Worldwide vision where
Everybody sees clear
I could get you ten here
Uh. Makes no fuss. Keep my shit plush
Compliment, I get blushed. That's just how a brotha is
Big Willy kids and we really run our jibs
Ladies, breathe easy. Let your man please thee
Uh. Takin' rhymes to another zone
Is your mother home? Cause we can get the moans
And stay strickly on a rhythmic notion, and
Keep the joint close for the commotion and
Keep movin' around. Movie stars
Buy a little car, buy out the bar

("All in...") ...for the nights of ecstasy
("All in...") ...for the way we work and play, doin' it
Everyday. This is how I need to be

"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?"
We do it alive, blowin' the spot of this
Showin' to prove what rap is. ("What is it?")
Marauder, pass the blue moon
Hit 'chu wit' the ill tune
Ass cheeks move wit' the help of my jacket bloom
Insert the veteran
Who consecutively come wit' shit yet again
On the dance floor, chicks get horny
Hopin' that they all move on me
Word, for REAL for real
Do it hard for the love of the game
Pull your card and I'm askin' yo' name, bitch
Jay-Dee be champion
Tip be stylin' and definin' yo' chick, best compan-ion
I'd advise you to fix your self, for real
And do your shit wit' more zeal. ("More zeal.")
We in the mix and it's thickenin'
My rhyme and it's tickin' in
The hatin' and the shit is so sickenin'
Picasso, original. ("'Riginal.")
You forg-azy and the shit amaze me
Sharpen your contrast and put a little color in it
High Define your screen and put this brotha in it
