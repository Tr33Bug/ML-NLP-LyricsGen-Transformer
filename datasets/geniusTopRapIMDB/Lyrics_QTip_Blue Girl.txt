Blue Girl Lyrics
Looking in your eyes and it's sparkling
Listen to your laugh, it's disheartening
I can see your common sense, it's clear to me
I can tell you're hurting, it's plain to see

Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be blue, girl
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be blue, girl
Don't be blue, girl
Wanna let you know how you're making me feel
Got my head spinning like a ferris wheel
We can ride  until it's shangri-la
When we get there, I can marry ya
Got my head spinning like a wonder wheel
Said I wanna let you know how you're making me feel
Making me feel
All you gotta do to soothe your pain
Close your sparkle eyes and chant to me

Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be
You're a blue girl
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be
Don't be blue, girl
Girl
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be
You're a blue girl
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Don't be
Don't be blue, girl
Girl

Wait a minute, you got brains in your head
Then why you got that pain in your head
Always testing folks and always have a reason
Blame the pain from before, the sight is never leaving
Them self help books and that meditation
Can't set you free, you still have hesitation
Been trained "through pain there's love"
Most of us have sailed above
Pain, games, and lighting old flames
Girls, being blue is such a shame
Taking secrets with you to the grave
Little girl, it's you I can't save
Playing games and lighting old flames
Girls, being blue is such a shame
Yeah, yeah, the birdsEmbed
