Damn Youâ€™re Cool Lyrics
Damn
You're so cool that you're frigid
Cool
Gotta loosen up so you can get with it
Damn
It could be simple if you focus
Cool
Can you feel that magic, hocus pocus
Damn
You're so cool
We sipping in my car and I'm thinking to myself
That we could do something else
That this doesn't have to end
But I have to be cool
-er heads that will prevail
Let me think of something else
They're taking wind out my sail
As I peripherally watch you move around
I could see you peripherally watch me move around
And we in the same shoes
And I'm far from eloquent
In fact, I freeze
I'm silent
Could you please intervent?
With some else,  good joke
I don't even care, damn
Look at you, you're pretty, yo
The way you're sitting there
You smile and I say "what up"
You say "Nothing"
You cool but I think that's pretty clear
I guess I'm cool if I'm here, right?
Why y'all fuckin' with the kid?
How come every time she near
 always disappear?
My demise  is imminent
I'm turning up the song
Maybe when the chorus ends
I can think of something strong
Like
You might also like

I said I gotta use the bathroom
You wanna come inside
Yeah, I guess
Don't stress
You ain't going outside
What a night
Look at her light
Her aura not free
I can kinda feel the heat
Now I'm low in the seat
Open the door
She offers me her couch and some water
Normal hospitality
I figure that I'll order
Acknowledging acceptance
Seems her space is well kept
And she looks, I look away
Starts to chuckle
Then expects
 a moment
Her with ease
Yo, she's such a cool breeze
That it's actually disarming
I'm not Jay or Prince Charming
Just a bit un-chic
And a little too unique
On top of being really cool
Yo, you know she really sweet
And the CD player runs
A familiar tune we hum
Then she tells me that it's 8
Of course she compliments her day
Starts to move a little closer
Ain't no room here on the sofa
Starts to move in
Let me lose this silly grin
Damn
Hey you, you are so cool to me
I got a whole on my mind
And I wonder why you're here with me
Damn
Hey you, you are so cool to me
I got a whole on my mind
And I wonder why you're here with me

Damn
You're too cool for me, baby
You're too cool for me, baby
Damn
You're too cool for me, baby
You're too cool for me, baby

Damn, you're so coolEmbed
