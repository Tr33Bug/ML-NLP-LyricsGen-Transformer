Do You Dig U? LyricsAre you runnin' late?
Did you show 'em love?
Even if you didn't there will never be another
Like you
Did you write the hit?
Did you hit the bong?
Even if you did it wit your friend under covers
It's you
Maybe it was on a strong run
Either way actin' like get it done
For the lovin' it was all one
Cuz girl you know it takes one to know one but
Do, Do you, dig you?
Do, Do you, dig you?
Did you drink the drink?
Talkin' up the sun?
Fightin' off the dragon when it's lookin' in the mirror
At you
Workin' all day
Playin' all night
All I wanna do it just get a little hit up
To you
It's you
Do you dig you?
