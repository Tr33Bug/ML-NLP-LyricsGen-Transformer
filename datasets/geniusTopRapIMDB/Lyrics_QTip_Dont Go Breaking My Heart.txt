Donâ€™t Go Breaking My Heart Lyrics
Don't go breaking my heart babe
I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart babe
You take the weight off of me babe
Ooh baby, when you knocked on my door
Oh I, I gave you my key

Yeah, yeah ooh, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it)
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart, ohh oh
I gave you my heart, yeah
And nobody told us
Oh 'cause nobody showed us, no
And now it's up to us babe
Oh yeah, I think we can make it, yeah ooh
Don't misunderstand me, no
You put the light in my life, yeah
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights, yeah

Whoa
Ooh, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it)
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, oh yeah, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it, yeah)
And right from the start
I gave you my heart
Ooh, I gave you my heart, ooh

Don't go breaking my heart, no
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go breaking
Don't go breaking my heart
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, don't go breaking my heart, don't go
Don't go breaking my heart, don't go breaking
Don't go breaking my heart
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Ooh, don't go breaking my heart baby
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Yeah, don't go breaking my heartYou might also like2Embed
