End Of Time Lyrics
Just feelin' things out for real, ya know?
Just wanna do me for real, ya know?
No reason to make it complicated, for feelin' agitated
You love it or you hate it…fuck it
Desperation jumpin' off of street corners and
Hustlas lookin for runs like Pop Warner and
Local state officials….man they out of touch
Getting money for some, aiyo, ain't nothin' much
But yo…let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it
You don't understand, so don't gel it
You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds
Cuz our lady friends have likings for designer clothes
People in my hood think….if I'm lookin raggedy, then the cat is just a weakling
In the very fake chain of oppression….the television taught me any lesson, it's
"Image is Nothing", but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirst
What's worse?  Your rings or your purse?
All aboard!  All aboard!  Make your way to the back there! Hey you!  Step lively!  Women and
Children first! What's wrong with you?
The world is coming to an end!
Come on now, we're looking at the end!  There's not enough room for freakin' everybody!  We have to leave all of our paraphernalia behind!  Come forward wankers!  All of those wankers!  Come on, let's go!  This way!  Come on now, lot!  We're looking at the end.  Let's go!  Move it to the back, there!  Come on now, let's go!

Buck that, bum back
Bum dick, broke back
Baghdad, bomb back
Bum dick, right back
Dark dick, broke back
Right back, bomb that
Bum dick, bomb back
Bomb back!

It's kinda scary you see
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a breath
Hell it could be your last
There's so much shit around us
Things we can't even see
If this is end of the line
That's where I wanna be (repeat 4x's)

End of time (repeat 4x's)1Embed
