For the Nasty Lyrics
Let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me tell you a story, yes (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
About a boy from the Tribe Called Quest (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I be that nigga that I think y'all know
With Mr. Busta Rhymes (A-yo, I'm in the studio)

Close the door, akh, let a nigga rock
Cause we 'bout to eat real shit, not shit slop (Right)
Nigga can't say shit about this hip-hop (Right)
Cause I build dudes lanes while at pit stop (Right)
Built they styles and they names, Frankenstein Rock (Right)
It's a high stake game, dudes are playing it (Oh)
I be questioning a lot of y'all who made it in (I know that's right)
Just move with the joint that we chartering (Uh-huh)
Make you disappear quick, like you're part of wind
Then laugh, ah-ha ha, and laugh again (Uh-huh)
Shorty, move a lil bit, I'm looking at your friend (Uh-huh)
Let's get an ass shake for the beat, girl
Get a lil eye wink, throw a tongue twirl (That's right)
We gotta him locked smashed in, tied down (Yeah)
We on your block, turned hot spots to ghost towns (Right)
A-yo, I'm tired of these niggas, Bus-a-Bus, now
Say it to 'em

This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

Ugh! Pardon me, ugh! Gimme room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
NOW WHO'S THAT?! Bus-a-bus-a-bus Rhyme
(Ah-RAAAAAAAWR!!!) See, I ain't do that in a long time!
Spitting shit, make the streets do more crime
Cop some cribs, cop a little more shine (I know that's right)
Alright, yea, shh shh, mm, uh, I pity y'all
The way I bang niggas, and how I shit on y'all
And spit the slang bigger, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang, bitch, from here to Senegal
We getting a lot of money, me and my friend, Kamaal
I take your money too, I ain't a friend of y'all
With so much class, my shit will kill ya, blood
Zhe-zhe-zhe-zhe, zhe-zheâ€”when I don't wanna rap
And still I will smash and make the bitches make it clap
As soon as I'm finished with her, homie, I'll give her back
Say it to 'em

This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)

Girl MOOOOOVE!
Show me what y'all know
When the beat bang, and you're in the club
When you listen and you feel a thud
When you hear my voice, understand the love
When the DJ spins it back, it's a friendly rub
But when I'm behind, I cannot be kind
With your waistline and the way you move
Like a old breakbeat, I'ma catch a groove
Or like a old hip-hop joint, you Nice and Smooth, come on, girl

This is just, for the nasty
A-yo, this is just for the sassy
A-yo, this is just for the classy
A-yo, this is just for the what? (Tell 'em now)
