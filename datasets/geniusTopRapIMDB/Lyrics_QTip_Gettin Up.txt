Gettin Up Lyrics
Sent you a message, sent you an email
Hasty decisions we made still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways and nooks, and things with good times
Memories, certainly, yes, they still bind
Still a common man and yeah, that's for sure
Still a bankroll, and yeah, still couture
But man, this thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a rat race and no place for a girl
Amongst the scavengers, I found a pretty pearl
It's for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we call 'em duds
And we, and we, and we, ahhh!
We got the gettin up, we got the gettin up
Today is nice, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up
Tonight is right, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up

Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I advance, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end, you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man, no other could contend
Or we could be like those exposed to history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all nite
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up, I promise that I'll bite

We got the gettin up, we got the gettin up
Today is nice, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up
Tonight is right, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up
You might also like
I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come thru
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives, are so colorful
A wonderful spectrum, not one-tone, dull
Full of excitement and not one lull
See we had an understanding, oh, yes, we did
I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin in my bid
Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs
We like Ruby Dee and Ossie, Martin and Coretta
Doin it to death, no one can do it better
When we leave our physical, our sprits still together
Come on now, here's a placement for your hand
You rockin with the number-one MC man
The number-one controller of right with the plan

We got the gettin up, we got the gettin up
Today is nice, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up
Tonight is right, come on, we gon' gettin up
Said we gettin up, said we gettin up13Embed
