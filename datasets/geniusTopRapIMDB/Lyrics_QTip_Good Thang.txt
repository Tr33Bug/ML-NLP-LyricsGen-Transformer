Good Thang Lyrics
She a good thang
I don’t even think twice about my good thang
She turns me out up inside
I’m staring at both from the outside
So good that it turns into a bad thing
I be thinkin’ too much about my bad thing
It’s so intoxicating
Her infection always keeps me waitin’
I just need to get a minute to tell her
I’mma call her up in the late night
And talk about the love that’s too tight
It’s floating on a belt atlantic
Phone is tapped so we not that candid
It’s your sweety ticket and brandin’
When I need it you gon’ have to unhand it
When I need it don’t leave me standin’
I just really had to tell you that
I want you
You know I need you
Good thang
You know I want you
Good thang

And I thinkin’ that you remember my rappin’
This confession of all good trappin’
Your impression has marked me deeply
I think you need to see me
Don’t have a hittin’ agenda
When I hold you and befriend ya’
This substance here, not empty
It’s emotional you forfeit me
There’s a spark inside that’s glowin’
You feed it and it’s glowing
You radiate, you showin’
I just had to get a minute to tell you

You know you really touch my feelings
When you think those thoughts
You know you really touch my feelings
And when you talk that talk
You know you really touch my feelings
And when you move like that
You know you really touch my feelings
Get a minute to…

Just picture us together
And in the end it feels better
It’s the last single in 
You reward me like Embed
