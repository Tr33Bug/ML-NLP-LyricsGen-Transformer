ManWomanBoogie Lyrics (Q-Tip)
Get down... (Make it easy)
Good God, make it easier now
(Good God, make it easier now)
Get down... (Man and woman get down)
Good God, make it easier now
(Good God, make it easier now)
Get down... (Man and woman get down)
A-doogah-doogah-doogah-doogah-dah doo

Man and woman be patrollin the earth
Puttin shit in the game
Citizens of the world, we runnin out
Precious time is a grain of sand
Ignored by the hand
(Work hard man everyday)
Work hard man everyday
(For who?) For another man's plan
Man orders woman when he come home
"Getcha ass in the air!"
(My woman wants it just as much as I do)
Woman wants it just as much as he does
But makes as if she don't care
Man and woman in the same where I'm from
We havin things on the mind
Minimum wage and the internet page
(She cry) Protect themselves from crime
The bluest collar on the brownest of skin
White, yellow, red too
They don't care who it is
They watching you
Conspiracies, so you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu
Man and woman, yo you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu, c'mon, c'mon
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Men and women, what's goin on...inside of our minds?
(Oh no, sing it one more time, c'mon)
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand

Check it out
Red man was the first on the continent
This you gotta understand
Woman not behind, she's right beside him there
And they both toil land
White man fightin for independance from, an old empire
Woman makes a flag for a new nation and
Lets the flag raise high
Black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
Bought the breastfeeding new
Black man, mentally, he broken too
But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do
Man, woman, always doin the dance
One wops, one pops
We'd be lucky if we both find a groove
That we both can lock
Can man be stronger if a woman was there?
I would have to say yes
Can woman make it without men being there?
She would have to be blessed
Woman and man are the spiritual forces
Brought together to live
Good thing there's many of us here in the world today
Find a good one to give, let's go, c'mon
