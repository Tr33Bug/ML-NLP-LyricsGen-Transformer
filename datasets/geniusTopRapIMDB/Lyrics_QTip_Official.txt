Official Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Well the bell has rung because the time is here
Oh, yeah
We gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear
Oh, yeah
Not much is for sure, but this here is true
Oh, yeah
I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you

Major attraction, trouble distraction
Scramble up my name and it still come action
Music's our number, doubters who slumber
Open up your ears to the low, tender thunder
Creative Queens native, mixes are the Native
Want some fresh shit? Then we're correlative
Busta is ferocious, unflawed and precocious
Airin' fools out cause my willy bodacious
Peoples don't blame me, shorties can't game me
Country Cherokee, but the city here made me
Rock like coral, distinctive 'bout my orals
Got lil' grime and got a lotta laurels
The rhythm stay bangin, my one-two thangin
Is exemplified by the comp left hangin
Percussion's our weapons, drums are Smith & Wesson's
Lyrics poppin' off, leavin' deep impressions

I feel what the beat does, people fuck with me cause
When the song end, I become what the beat was
Same thing as other, no need for cookie cutter
The bar gets raised, not your average old gutter
For that I hit a chin up, B, ya time been up
Would've came sooner, but I overslept my get-up
Now let's get in the middle, girl, I'll solve your riddle
Cause we can be strong and protect against the brittle
If dudes need to see me, go and get the CD
I'll aerosol your wall top to bottom like graffiti
Bismillah-in', dudes sound pardon 
When you hear the music, thus begins the Mardi Gras-in'
Rhymes ain't the issue, that's how I'm gon' get you
Don't need a Billboard hit for me to hit you
The clairvoyant micist, who always come the tightest
Queens everywhere, demonstratin' who the flyest
