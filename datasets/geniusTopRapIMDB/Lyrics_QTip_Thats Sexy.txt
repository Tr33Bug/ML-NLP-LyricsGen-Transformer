That’s Sexy Lyrics
The way you style your hair, oh oh
That’s sexy—oh oh—that’s sexy
The way you care, oh
That’s sexy—oh oh—that’s sexy

You look just like a teacher, girl, with your glasses on
That’s sexy—all night long—that’s sexy
No matter how we push or thrust, they stay on…
That’s sexy—and it’s sexy to me—that’s sexy
Hey, it’s something like a phenomenon
Unearthing these feelings is coming on
I get a rush like a team on Monday Night
Lord, you always look out, so make it right
And if not, then I guess your will is done
But I’m still gon’ to reel this one
With this world complex from voting fraud
And an unjust world, we need you Lord
Got a glass that’s filled with Jack and Coke
And a heart that’s filled with will and hope
While these phony ass rappers I spoke about
Kill this hip-hop off without a doubt
And I need that resilience and the strength
And a life that’s got experience
So I could learn this lesson and maybe then
I could e-mail this shit to my friends

Gotta get brave, I have something to tell you
You’re so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave, I have something to tell you
You’re so sexy and I hope I compel you

That little gap between your teeth—that’s sexy, that’s sexy
That space, where your thigh meets your knee
That’s sexy, that’s sexy
You might also like
The way you chew and pop your gum, it’s so rude
That’s sexy—little girl—that’s sexy
It’s so unreal, time stood still … from the way you move
That’s sexy, that’s sexy

And I’m walking over to you to say “Hello”
Yo, but here goes the things I’m seeing, though
I’m seeing us on the floor, us on my rug
Shooting shit, getting high, and making love
And the TV is on but it’s watching us
And the evening is going marvelous
You got a brim hat on and open toes
And the house is empty like we open shows
Fall asleep, wake up, and do it again
Fall asleep, wake up, and do it again
You get so impressed, you telling your friends
Fall asleep, wake up, and do it again
And we walk outside into a wind
Closed eyes as we lift, I mean ascend
And we going upstairs, in God confide
Shows us love and where our folks reside
There’s so many places that's laced with peace
And it seems we escaped the snarling beast
Caught up in the excitement, I lost your hand
Don’t worry ‘bout it, girl, I’m still your man
And I’m running through the mist and finally
I see ya flapping your wings, you’re over me
And you going even higher than where I can
I said, “Wait a minute, girl, I’m still your man”
I said, "Wait a minute"
Gotta get brave, I have something to tell you
You’re so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave, I have something to tell you
You’re so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave, I have something to tell you
You’re so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave, I have something to tell youEmbed
