Want U 2 Want Lyrics

The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
The love of your name can only pertain
To the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
When your name is mentioned, I can't hold back or restrain
It's the flame I got in my vein, I never complain
I just want you to want me, want you to want me
Hey, ho, hey, want me
Hey, ho, hey, want me
Hey, ho, hey, oh, oh

I wanna see you fall through, quick, fast, without havin' to call you
Quick fast, I know just what they all do
But you can do it better and it's all cool
Never seen a stop sign or a stop light
I wanna see what livin' on the top like
You wanna see what livin' on the top like
Then shadow me and take me on a joy-ride
Look both ways wherever there I go
In case I run into you, I drive slow
I know your sex-drive go all day
Then we can roll  'till tomorrow
Lights out for the insecure, self-centered
I know your heart won't be the same when I
Dive in head first, I don't mind if I drown
In other words, girl I need you right now
I said--
