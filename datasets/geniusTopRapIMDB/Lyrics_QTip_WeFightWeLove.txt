WeFight/WeLove Lyrics
And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks "How many cigarettes does it take?"
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fucked a thug through fucked up weather
And she thinkin' about her life
With no more work, just being a wife
But instead her love she gave to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight the love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, that's her campaign
We fight, we love
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
(Cmon, yeah, yeah, uh uh uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah cmon)
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
(Cmon, yeah, yeah, uh uh uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah cmon)
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
(Cmon, yeah, cmon, yeah, cmon)

Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
You might also like
And it, yeah, and it, and it begins, he's off the wall
He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
(Cmon)
They say "Salaam!", they carry bombs
In crowded places, and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, it's cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin' for your soul, and WMD's
You can't find nothing, cause it's empty
You got your gun, and he's your friend
And he's your man, until the end
We fight, we love

We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
(Cmon, yeah, yeah, uh uh uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah cmon)
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
(Cmon, yeah, yeah, uh uh uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah cmon)
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
We'll find out who we are
(Cmon, yeah, cmon, yeah, cmon)
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)
We just keep on fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit
Fighting just a little bit, loving just a little bit more
(Yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh, yeah huh)4Embed
