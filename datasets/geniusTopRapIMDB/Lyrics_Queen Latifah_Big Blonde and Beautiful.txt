Big, Blonde and Beautiful Lyrics
Yeah, well, well, owww
Yeah yeah...
Bring on that pecan pie
Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl
I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
Face the fact, the simply irrefutable
No one wants a meal that only offers the least
When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast (oh ho)
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese (woah)
Then take a look inside my book of recipes (ooo)
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite
I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice (oo ooo)
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable (oo oo oo)
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid (ooo)
When Edna, you look like the whole parade
They say that white has might and thin is in
Well, that's just bull
'Cause ladies, big is back, and as for black
It's beautiful
All shapes and sizes, follow me
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree (oo, oo oo oo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, groovy baby, groovyYou might also likeEmbed
