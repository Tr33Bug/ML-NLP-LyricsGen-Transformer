Black Hand Side Lyrics
Why y'all ain't sayâ€”?!
Yo, you KNOW
You know you was supposed to say something to me
Ooh, baby baby!
Aww yeah
Clap your hands, y'all...

Check it!
Dig it while I rip it
Check it while I wreck it
(Give it to 'em, La!)
Okay, gimme a few seconds
First, I give a shout to every
Jersey-born-and-bred head
And everybody in New York
From brunettes to red heads
Who got my back? (Jersey got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (The Bronx got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (Brooklyn got your back!)
Yo-yo-yo who got my back? (Uptown got your back!)
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink 40s
Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on (hoo-ooo)
That's what we about to do (hoo-ooo)
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop
But chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Just chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Yo chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Come on chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)

Check it fear don't live in here
Tears don't bring me cheers
So gear for another year because I had it up to here
Yeah, I'm about through with you
You wack and rooty poo
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two
I'm ret' to set it off again
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin?
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it
Attack it with my tactics
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket
I flip mines to get mines
I'm happy to get with you
But you can't come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
It's all game
It all sounds the same
Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But they're ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy
I'm the La La La from Halstead
Bred with the Queen as a prefix
It's off with your head
And that's a promise 'cause I don't make threats
So mind your neck, 'cause it's about to get set
You might also like
C'mon set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Somebody set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Checks the Queen, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)

Parlay
Ah uh, yeah (3x)
