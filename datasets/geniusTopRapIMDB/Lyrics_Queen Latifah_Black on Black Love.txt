Black on Black Love Lyrics
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
That's what I want from you
To thine own self be true
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
C'mon, 'cause we're in this together, y'all
Let's try to make our hoods a little better, y'all

Last night after I prayed, I layed my head down
Tired after a hard day
I blocked out the siren sound
As I fell into a deep sleep
I don't have dreams of cream
My dreams are vivid and seldom seen
And much to my delight
I saw my peoples in a different light
Tension was gone
We stood Black and strong
Instead of a day
We had a lifetime of atonement
I felt loved
I didn't have to treasure the moment
Instead of drugs, we gave out hugs
And you payed with pain
No more thugs and
Everybody knew everybody's name
No tricks, no cheaters, women beaters, pimps or whores
Less stress, and a whole lot less liquor stores
Children played without worries of strays
Longer days with shorter nights
No need to fight
We all stuck tight
We stayed away from the traps
As a people, we lived right and exact
And showed a whole lot more of that

In my dream, we all loved our neighbors
Did each other favors
And used the good sense God gave us
Watched each others' backs
And lifted while we climb
There was no crime
None of my brothers was doin' time
And they treated all their sisters like ladies
Women didn't worry because their men didn't act shady
Mothers were proud of their seeds
And kept a big smile
'Cause the whole village chipped in
And raise that one child
We supported our local Black-owned stores
We were down for the cause
The next man make sure you had yours
There were no robberies, murders, or rapes
No child molesters
We took control of our own fate
The life span of the Black man increased
Times were less stressed
We did our best to live in peace
We showed love for rap
Kept in contact
We stayed away from the traps
And showed a whole lot more of that
You might also like
Now as I wake up to face this harsh mentality
It's just a dream or prayer, far from reality
As I wait, the siren sounds begin again
I get up, walk to my window
Wondering if it will ever end
When I look out, nothing's changed
Hustlers are still there
Lady on the phone yelling how her baby father doesn't care
Conflicts with derelicts over squeegies
Homeless will work for food
"Would you please feed me?"
It's our duty to try and help remove some of the stress
Every 20 minutes a child dies a violent death
Parents are frustrated
Wondering where they went wrong
Knowing that that fast money, it won't last long
We got some that fight for rights to be equal
Some struggle, and still we commit crimes against our own people

Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that
