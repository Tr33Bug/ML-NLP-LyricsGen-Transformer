Do Your Thing Lyrics
Southside, Northside
Eastside, Westside
Alright, alright
Alright, we ride

Ain't the paper, that makes me Dana
I just see the strangers they look at me stranger
They all give me more lip
So I give ya more music, more scripts, Less actin'
I stepped up to salary cappin'
Passin' traffic and lookin' what happened
See how life takes a turn (uh huh)
More paper earned
Lawyers poof, case adjourned good-bye
I am what I am, I come from Newark
So crème de la crème
Specially when, y'all pray for my downfall
That's why I try to stay from round y'all (let's go)
Turn my days in the dark, they find less (let's go)
Like metter maids when I park but I'll be
Still, doin' me, still, so beautifully
I pray to brushin' off haters for stuff they do to me
Go and do your thing
Cuz' people will talk
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
Cuz' they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing

Yo, yo, yo
Now just imagine how the world'll be witchu cruisin'
Top down, popped the blouse, get girls aroused
Talk bout shoppin' and browsin'
Not for clothes and copped the house
Could it be that you feel you need me?
Hey, you love the way I flow cuz' it comes to easy
When life imitate art that's where the hatin' start
You gotta love dat, try to stay above that
Who knew I'd come this far
Business woman, and movie star?
My moms always told me I come from God
And the stress that come from y'all keep achin'
You'll get there, keep waitin'
Keep trying, be patient
Y'all wish I can stand united
And really feel the love cause my fans provide it
You might also like
Go and do your thing
Cuz' people will talk
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
Cuz' they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing

Lately, it just seems to me
That people ain't what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know there's snakes in the grass
So I pay my staff, to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin'
I combat that with positive thinking
I'm me till I'm old and grey
And when that day comes
Imma teach my daughters to be the same way
I am the way I am, I'm from the hood
So crème de le crème
And specially when, y'all pray for my downfall
That's why I try to stay from round y'all (that's why)
You never keep me down
So I'll always be around (forget about it)
Still doin' it, (still doin me)
So beautifully I see you rushin' them papers that ain't new to me
Go and do your thing
Cuz' people will talk
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
Cuz' they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing

Just do your thing
Cuz people gon' hate you anyway uh
Just do your thing
Cuz people gonna hate you anyway uh
Just do your thing y'all c'mon
Can nobody stop me y'all c'mon
We Yellow City y'all
We gon' keep doin' our thing, keep doin' our thingEmbed
