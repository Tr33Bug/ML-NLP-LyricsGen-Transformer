Elements Iâ€™m Among Lyrics
Booty rappers posing as gunclappers,get bitch smacked!
Need to switch to being actors, image is all ya after
Hold the laughter,in the lip, the glamour and the glitz!
Flip a flow like the mob be turnin' tricks!
My clique and I will hunt ya like (?), who want the beef come spark!
I leave darkness where there used to be your front teeth
I'm heartless when it comes to havin' the back of my partners, yeah we artists but testin' us ain't the smartest!
You can huff, puff, but blow me down I doubt it kid, or
Get yo' ass Whooped behind what ya mouth did
You need more "Hail Mary's" than a catholic!
Yo ass ain't slick I'll mess your shit quick
I got connects, I get that ass stuck like glue, stand to the F you I had to make it so your parents forget you
Cause if I let You get Over and then I pass you, think you can do it on a reg so Ima wreck you!
Elements that I'm among, these none. Fools be gettin' done, but over
Dumb
Reasons. Yall didn't Know. Elements that I'm among, these none. Betta
Check it out
Before you become one. Elements that I'm among, these none. Fools be
Gettin'
Done, but over dumb reasons. Yall didn't Know. Elements that I'm among
These
None. Betta check it out before you become one

Now you said no tricks in '86 it's time to build, now we gone be pushin'
'96 and
Niggas still gotta kill. Tryin to keep it real... but is it really real?
If you could fly

Head
Because if a fifth was a fifth we all be drunk... nigga dont, put no
Yayo in my
Blunt. I just, wanna bring the funk like a puma.. yo wannabe niggas is
Fired or be

Back at you, lyrically hack at you. I keep the facts here, I keep it
Real hell yeah, I
Keep the facts there, dont make me hate you like a papsmear, thats
Where, I get
Ticked, matter fact in the '96 I'm also pistol grip pump on my lap at
All times shit
Niggas be on some black on black crime shit. And I can't let it slide
Cause I'm
Terrified that I might be the next homocide, the pound is on my side
You might also like

Niggas be all in my face like government be in my check, every time I
Pick up the
Mic and begin to wreck. But right now my job is more important than a
Nigga
I'm in to peace, its so tricky this ain't the way I figured. An evident
I wasn't
Raised that way, we kicks a grip to stay that way, and I'm tryin' to
Stay "forever
Free," like AZ... baskin' in the riches of this hip hop M U S I C
Cause when the
East is in the house, "Oh My God!" Is right. I know girls that's givin'
Niggas fair
Fights, so you damn right. Ima stick up for mine, like a queen at a bee
And Ima
Get my own rythm wihtout a "G". Hey, if ya kiddie come come, well ya
Need to
Run run, like a bee yall get stomped, by my diggy dumps dumps, all
Because of ya
Tounge. And I'll be lampin' in the sun when the day is done
