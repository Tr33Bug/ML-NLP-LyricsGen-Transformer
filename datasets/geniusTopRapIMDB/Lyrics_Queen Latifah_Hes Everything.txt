Heâ€™s Everything LyricsI see Him when the children are at play
I hear Him when the church bells ring on wedding days
I feel Him when the breezes blow
Adore Him where the flowers grow
Revere Him when the oceans roll
He's everything
Oh, oh, oh
He's everything
We're born, we live, we die and life goes on
We love, we laugh, we cry
And we're a part of His creation
Every person, every nation
He's in every situation
Everything
He's everything
Let's lift Him up
Through everything, He's loving us
Is it asking all that much
That we should do the same
So let us sing and raise our voice
Let us make a joyful noise
Let us praise His holy name
He's everything
Oh, oh, oh
He's everything
In everything, He plays a part
In everything, He leaves His mark
Restores our lives, our broken hearts
The God of hope and change
So let us sing and raise our voice
Let us make a joyful noise
Rejoice and praise His name
Rejoice, sing it again
Rejoice, His joy remains
He's everything
Oh, oh, oh
He's everything
Oh, oh, oh
He's everything
He's everything
He's everything
Praise His name, His holy name
He's everything

We should show a little love in everything, everything
He's the God of hope and change
He's the cure for hurt and pain
You know He loves us all the same
'Cause He's everything, He's everything
Everything He plays a part
Heals and mends our broken hearts
Restores us when we fall apart
'Cause He's everything, He's everything
So lift Him up, rejoice, rejoice
Let us sing and raise our voice
And let us make a joyful noise
He is everythingEmbed
