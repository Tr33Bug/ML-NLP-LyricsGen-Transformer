How Do I Love Thee Lyrics
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How much do I love you
Well, multiply your love by infinity
Picture a vision of beauty
As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a Native Tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me

Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude it's not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
You're so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you"re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
'fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Don't stop
Ecstacy

I adore you
Come to me
That's right
Come to me
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me
Please don't go
Happiness is nothing without you
Stay
My sweet one
I adore you
Hold me
Come to me
Love me
Love meEmbed
