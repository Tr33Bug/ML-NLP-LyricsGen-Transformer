Listen 2 Me Lyrics
Listen to me, hear me now
Listen to me, hear me
Listen to me, hear me now
Listen to me, hear me
People in Jersey, dem listening to me
The people uptown, dem listening to me
And people back in Brooklyn, dem listening to me
And people in Jamaica, dem listening to me
Well it's a party over here, a party over there
In every nook and cranny, it's a party everywhere
And that you should have known
When I walked through the door
I'm told I got the flavor, I'm told I got the flow
Before you even try to diss me
Let's get something clear
There ain't no fear between you and me or the atmosphere
Hail to the queen and the sire
I'm lighting fires
Your style is wack as two flat tires
It will only take a second
For me to just wreck it
Smoother than my body buck naked
I don't have to prove shhh...
Just keep doin' hits
And niggas be all on my two tits
And even if you think it's odd
I'm telling you, after every single rhyme, I thank God
For giving me the power to make your heads nod
Tony Dofat style, gotta keep 'em going wild
Listen to me now

People in L.A., dem listening to me
The people in the Bay, dem listening to me
The people in D.C., dem listening to me
The people in Miami, dem listening to me
Our people in Chicago, dem listening to me
Our people in Detroit, dem listening to me
The people down in Houston listening to me
And everybody, dem listening to me
You might also like
What a beautiful day and I'm riding down the highway
On my way to the studio, gotta go 'cause I slept late
I just came back from cool ass Cali
Where Mandy was bumpin' MC Ren's 'In the Alley'
Driving so fast that no one could catch me
While I'm knocking "Gangsta Bitch" by Apache
This is the mood for making the hit hip-hop song
You should have known it was on
The places I've been, the people I've seen
And everywhere I go, it's “Give it to 'em, Queen!”
'Cause hip-hop is for real, I'm dealing with the truth
'Cause all over the world, it's aggravated youth
So every time I grab the mic, you know that I could rock it
So I can have some fun and put some money in my pocket
You can always know the time, just recognize the sign
Can't nobody put a padlock on your mind
Listen to me now

The people in London, dem listening to me
The people in Atlanta, dem listening to me
The people in Japan, dem listening to me
The people in Seattle, dem listening to me
The people in Germany, dem listening to me
Our people in Rochester listening to me
Our people in Virginia, dem listening to me
And everybody, dem listening to me
Lover of the people (lover of the people) living in the city (living in the city)
On and on (on and on, baby), on and on (on and on, baby, c'mon)
Lover of the people (lover of the people) living in the city (living in the city)
On and on (on and on, baby), on and on (on and on)
You're rollin' with the vibe (vibe)
You get into the vibe (vibe)
You're rollin' with the vibe (vibe)
Just get into the vibe (vibe)
You gotta feel the vibe (vibe)
Just get into the vibe (vibe)
You're rollin' with the vibe (vibe)
Just get into the vibe (vibe)

Take a trip on back into the third verse
Of the originator of the concept of ladies first
You came along and tried to freak mine
To the contrary, 'cause I'm not your ordinary piece of feline
See I know the book because I read it twice
If I bite the hook, then I'ma pay the price
Mama taught me Black was beautiful when I was young
And told me all about where babies really came from
So you can hit the door with the theory
That all Black women are hoes, hear me?

East Orange, listening to me
The people down in (?) dem listening to me
The people inna Trinidad listening to me (Yeah!)
The people in Boston are listening to me
People in Bermuda listening to me
North Carolina is listening to me
(It's a Queen Latifah, Flavor Unit thing in '93!)
The people in...are listening
(My girl 99 in the house)
The people in...are listening
(Hip-hop is worldwide! So I'm OUT!)

Lover of the people living in the city
On and on, on and on
Lover of the people (lover of the people) living in the city (living in the city)
On and on (on and on, baby), on and on1Embed
