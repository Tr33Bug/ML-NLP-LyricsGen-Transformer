Nature of a Sista Lyrics
Coming from the bitty bitty bottom of the basement
The first floor's a bore, so I’ll rise
Don't want to make it to the top too quickly
So I take step-to-step all the time
Take a look at the flow of the future
If you can't shake to it, then it don’t suit ya
Break off, back off, before I bust off
Bad is the worst, some are bad but soft
Bad this, bad that, who's bad enough?
For those who are bad, then batter up
I pointed this rap with my index
So baby, come on with a rag and some Windex
I'm stepping the step tryna meet me there
I'm avoiding all political fanfare
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista'
Who's a king, who's a queen, who's tryna bang?
I see myself as a queen but it ain’t for rank
This for all, not one, not for income
But for knowing who and where we descend from
I kick off with a choke, I come crazy new
They call me Mama Zulu but I won’t baby you
I'm not the type to look for a man with cash
But the only thing you get if you’re broke's a cast
I dip, then switch, what floor is this?
I go higher than a fire, try to diss
This is a little of my headed-for-top style
Rippin tracks, whippin' in fact, it's that wild
Right on flow, a few floors to go
I see suites instead of concrete, so
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista’

Here's a knick-knack, sit back, hold ya hat
Here's a big rap, ya got close now get back
I got an army bustin through the enemy's wall
My thoughts on the situation was "fuck em all"
Salt-N-Pepa said it was time to grow
So me and Spin did 'em in, now time to go
Yo-Yo grabbed him, he said, "Hey, diddle diddle"
While I and Nikki got Monie out of the middle
Sisters in action, strong, real, still complete
I say "what up" cause you can't come or compete
The La, the Ti-Fah booms like a speaker
I hold more soul than a sneaker
Don't ask if I'm fast, I come swift, sis
Cause I'm passing an ass if you with this
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista'You might also likeEmbed
