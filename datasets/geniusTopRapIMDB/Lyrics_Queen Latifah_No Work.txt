No Work Lyrics
You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
Or any Flavor Unit MC (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work, no work)

Don't try to get fly, y'all
We're blackin' up eyeballs
I run with a rough set, so don't get me upset
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin'
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass, so why you startin'?
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin' on my bra, you freakin' straphanger
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you, 1993
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family
'Cause I would die for all them and they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female, all catch hell
An explanation of the Queen Latifah spelled well
So blow up and know me
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin' me
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
Check it

Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home

That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin' joint with the hardcore phrase
Amazed I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it coming
And even then, I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning, cunning as a venus fly trap
'Cause, word up, I fight back, you're damn right, it's like that
So step back, I'm not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
I'm not the type of girl to be running to the cops
I know about everything that goes on on my block
And right beside my bed, I keep a Luger and a Glock
They're for the protection of a Flavor Unit queen
Me not gon' let ya go until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes when I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you
You might also like
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)

Now, this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives, you're kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstile and the conductor threw me out
You feelin' kinda horny? Call a clinic on that crotch
You's a dingy, dirty bitch, so I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here, plus there
'Cause I'll be here plus there
We'll bump heads
There's nuff lumps everywhere
Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody, but they're bad instead
We're ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought, I thought twice, thought through, and thought first
The queen picks the verse off a shirt
You hurt when I smirk 'cause you know first
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
I said you ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
I said you ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)2Embed
