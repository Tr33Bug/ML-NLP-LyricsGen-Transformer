Princess of the Posse Lyrics
Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds, O Lord
They know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib

The call me the high priestess of disaster
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor
I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn
Let me know now if you would like to protest this proceeding
A greeting, or would you rather progress
Onto a higher plateau, truly I'm taking it slow
Enough for you to seek the knowledge and to know
I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H
Queen of the R.E. Posse, the GLA which is Get Live Alright
You standing there chewing on your fingernails nervous
Watching me doing the live thing
Singing like a bird sings, ringing like the phone ring
I'm the Queen and you're the underling
I'm never following, I follow none
The princess of the posse is a cool one
You might also like
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
It's a concoction, for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they don't know I'm the one to front on, or two
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
I'm kicking gold, so grab a hold and get a good grip
Stop the lying, the trying
The time buying, you've been denying
'Cause you're dependent on me, the princess of the posse
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King
To the posse, peace
Got to let you know where I come from
The princess of the posse is a cool one

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world
Latifah run the family
Me say me haffi do it for the R.E. posse
You try to be down, you can't take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me
Latifah run the family
Me say me haffi do it for the R.E. posse
You try to be down, you can't take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me1Embed
