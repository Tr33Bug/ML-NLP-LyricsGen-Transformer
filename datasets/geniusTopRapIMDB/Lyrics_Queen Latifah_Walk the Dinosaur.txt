It was a night like this forty million years ago
I played my favorite songs, picked up a monkey skull to
Go
I heard the sound of drums, didn't know where they were
From
Wherever I was it started to buzz, and now I'm having
Fun
Everybody walk the Dinosaur, they do the dinosaur
Put your back into it, do the dinosaur
They'll be shocked, do the dinosaur

Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur

Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom
Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom

I met you in a cave, you were painting buffalo
I said I'd be your friend, follow wherever you go
That night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath
The stars
You fell asleep, I stayed awake and watched the passing
Cars
You might also like
Everybody walk the dinosaur, they do the Dinosaur
Put your back into it, do the dinosaur
They'll be shocked, do the dinosaur

Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur

Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom
Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom

Everybody walk the dinosaur, they do the do the
Dinosaur
Put your back into it, do the dinosaur
They'll be shocked, do the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaur
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the dinosaurEmbed
