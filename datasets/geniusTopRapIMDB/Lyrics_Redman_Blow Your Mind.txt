Blow Your Mind Lyrics
Ah, look out, it's the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin', comin' at ya, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher, "Red, get freaky to the rapture"
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check a-one, two
It's you, who? Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kids
Yo E (What's up, G?)
Bridge
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)

I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda, I'm a star at war, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up, girl
Come on and get it if you with it, troop
Krush groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
저리 가 비켜라 몰라 가라
누구냐? 나다 나 나는 Redman
나보다 잘난~ 내~ 누구~ 나도~forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (Rewind)
You might also like
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I—)

Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can wax on, wax off like Daniel-san
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to Herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)1Embed
