Bobyahed2dis Lyrics
Ah
You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman
Let's take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure
To where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered
Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics
From a place we call Hell and beyond
And I say
Right about now, you are rocking with the best
Can I get a hit? (Hit it) Thank you (Hit it)
What you're about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic Devil himself?
To all knotty head niggas, bob to this
Come walk with Def Squad on the dark side
Coming to you live and direct, without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it
God damn (Word is bond, word is me)
So who's that funky nigga that's known to kick the fat shit?
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard"
Talking 'bout the dog, dogcatcher
It's the dogcatcher, I'll catch you
Oh, how insane
Catch a contact from the weed, it'll bust your brain

The top notch of hip-hop and I'm on the charts
I'm catching applause when I rock the microphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the Eyes of Laura Mars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin' down the highway with my forty between my lap, bitch
Crossing the GW, coming into Manhattan
Boy, my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettoes like crack
Go in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that
'Cause your multi-platinums can't save your ass from the block
And you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin' wattage out your fuckin' trunks
Like Pete Puma, I'm known to give a ho lots of lumps (Ha-ha)
Props I got, coming through your block, nine cocked
My socks even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang 'em like them niggas do in Texas
You don't have no heart, you chestless
'Cause your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap, Buckshot, Busta B, and I'm from
The East Coast, where a nigga like you'd get laughed at
And since you came out gassed, well, I'm closing your gas cap
The creature from the deep, the ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the Preacher (Uh)
A menace like Dennis, I got game like Guinness
I can French kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentences
Lord have mercy (Stop), it's too much funk to cope with
Droppin' dope shit after dope shit, we're the Trojans
Yell from the lungs
That rings from here to kingdom come
And I don't have to be a special ed to get dumb
You might also like
So fuck what you heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama, plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers'
Badmon, here we, here we come
From New Jersey, in the place to be
So fuck what you heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama, plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers'
Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me
'Cause they here to stay
I'll be outside when you get there1Embed
