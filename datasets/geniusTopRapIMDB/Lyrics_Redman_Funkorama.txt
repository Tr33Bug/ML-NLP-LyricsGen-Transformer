Funkorama Lyrics
We, hah!
This is Funk Doctor Spock!
As we look, at our clocks
We gonna take you, on a ship to another journey
To the Darkside
Hah, we've conquered, new evidence, that there is life

My funk prognosis make my brains comatose
One hundred percent funk runs bloodstreams through your nose
I don't have to be Madonna, to make your eyes freeze
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the Thai weed
For this, you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood and boondox
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks
Now who kicks that phenomical, astronomical? Uhh
That's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you
I swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death
That's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul
Hot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech
My funk speech make words wear sun visors
I'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk
Def Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks
Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk

Ahhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers
Def Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers
Punks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice
I'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight
The top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped
I'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia
I'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades
I'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid
My grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama
I never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters
My style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef
Def like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep
One, two! Big up to my niggas on one-deuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*
Rrrrrah! With weed for you!
Who says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?
I cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers
'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam
When I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T. Goose
Heavily armed
