It’s Like That (My Big Brother) Lyrics
Due to technical difficulties beyond our control
Reggie Noble's stinkin' ass will not be performing with us tonight
Erick Sermon, keep it on
Def Squad, Erick Sermon, Redman, keep, keep it on
K to M Keith Murray, keep, keep it on
Keep, keep on, ya don't stop
Keep, keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep, keep it on, and ya don't stop
K-Solo, Redman, and ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray, ya don't stop
I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin' off
Cliffs grabbin' their ass cheeks yellin' Geronimo
It ain't a problem at all we can't solve
Three-hundred sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged by my entourage who put the Ram in Dodge
Ras cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused, hip-hop's the main aim

Well, it's the Funk Doctor Spot, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def, yo, I ain't even hearin' this shit
Biscuits be cockin' back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin' MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin', thinkin'
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us?

Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit 'em, real quick 'cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet could do to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock 'em out at the drop of a dime
You might also like
Yo, the long faced murderer
Servin' over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin' a shifty hour like a burglar
My crew herbin' ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens that I'ma be the one creepin'
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bizarre, the rap non-superstar
When I step up, I pump volume like Ra'

My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabulary's very loquacious and gregarious
Pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly words that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshh—
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kit

Come closer while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might have, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me the Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggas is fools, playin' with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung "I Missed You"
Dissed you, dismissed you, yeah, I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through
Haha, yeah, haha
Keep, keep it on
Haha, keep, keep it on, look
Ha, keep, keep it on
Ha, keep, keep it on, look
Haha, keep, keep it on
Yo, what we doin', son? (Haha)
Knockin' niggas the fuck out1Embed
