Nigga Like Me Lyrics

Check it out
Redman, star fives
Twenty two on a car tire
Ring bells like Mel's Diner
I'm sharp hair made of barbed wire
Chemdawg, nicotine for your menthol on Crenshaw
43rd fresh off the herb
I got connects like SIM cards
I know hip-hop is part of my life
I love it like it's my wife
My credit card that I swipe
True Religion's all on my Nikes
7:30 train wreck, brain freeze
I'm Capo, Marvel, got the Iron Man, Stan Lee
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I can't stop like Diddy, boy, when I'm grindin' (I said, "Why?")
I hold down Brick City, boy, and Shaolin (I said, "Why?")
These hoes rub they titties, boy, when I'm driving (I said, "Why?")
My boys smoking that loud when we be wild'n

Check it out
Sour diesel, medicate
Start a cypher, elevate
Fuck the hater, eliminator
These angry birds is featherweight
Hood down, street smart
With a cap and gown, class clown
Failed math but graduated from a dime bag to a half a pound
'90 era is harder (Yeah)
Orca out the water
Before Wayne started The Carter
Before T-Pain did the auto
I had lyrics, nigga
Drunk as hell, I spit the liquor, Dirk Diggler
I kick it off like Monday night then run it back like Emmitt, mister
You might also like
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I get it, you can't fuck with a nigga like me (Copy that)
I can't stop like Diddy, boy, when I'm grindin' (I said, "Why?")
I hold down Brick City, boy, and Shaolin (I said, "Why?")
These hoes rub they titties, boy, when I'm driving (I said, "Why?")
My boys smoking that loud when we be wild'n

Copy that, copy that, copy that
