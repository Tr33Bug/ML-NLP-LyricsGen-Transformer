Nigga Whut Lyrics
Yo yo whats good my nigga I got it nigga, nigga I got it what you need nigga?
I need that sour!
Brick City let's go!

Yo Redman my nigga, who else?
A double O.G. in the game with two g's on the belt
The flows I create, it'll drown Mike Phelps
Its no sleeping here I'm anti NyQuil
Look at this nigga here, I control the stage
Boy I do it like Moses I part niggas waves
And white boys brains, they know I'm pure death on iTunes and they could choose 6 million ways
I want lazed chips, that old folks money
You know, getting paid but unemployed like Tommy
Brick city designed me, they don't wanna blame
Banana clip rounded neck that's a food chain
What up Homie, is time getting hard?
Well I'm like an alcoholic, its all about bars
My truck so big, I need a six cars garage,'
And all challengers better dodge
Hey
I got my game face on whut you know about it?
Im rolling up that Grand daddy whut you know about it?
Im driving in an exotic whut you know about it?
I pull up my car (errr) and looking at you punk like nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?

Yes sir, yo I'm on a highway cruising, loving my life
That 8 0 8 like  yeah the D nice
I've seen Tina and Robin, sitting at the light
I said I beat it up I be the new Mike and Ike
Redman on blast, perfecting the craft
Smoke all ya cut, then ride off and laugh
All types of girls love Red I ain't mad
Shit I got Islamic women tryna bag dad
Yo you need crack? I move like a cartel
Even smack and B say URL
When the Wu tang sprang out of park hill
I turned up my C.R.E.A.M game getting Carvel
Yo dogs, when times getting hard
I'm like an alcoholic, it's all about bars
I'm like an AmEx card nigga, I take charge
And all challengers better dodge
Hey

I got my game face on what you know about it?
Im rolling up that Grand daddy what you know about it?
Im driving in an exotic what you know about it?
I pull up my car (errr) and looking at you punk like nigga what?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?
Nigga whut? Nigga whut? Nigga whut?

Redman in the building
I got that sour diesel nigga
Yo DJ Naim, you a fool for this one nigga, yea
Brick City all day, haha
Yo Jaws, what's good nigga?
Yessir, Mr. Yella what's good my nigga?
