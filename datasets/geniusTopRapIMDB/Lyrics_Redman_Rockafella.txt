Rockafella Lyrics
Ayo, yo, yo, yo, you better pass it
Ayo, check this out
We coming to you live from that bomb Chocolate City, my man
Where the knotty-headed niggas and the Brick City brigade dwell
And if you don't know, your fool behind better ask
Yo, yo, you better pass that blunt
Ayo, E, we comin' to you live with the Cosmic type stuff

Well, it's that brother coming six billion feet from beneath
And you should be peepin' how I get smoked out on the weekends
I swing it to my crew, or down to my fam
Schoolin' hello's knockers like final exams
'Cause, it's that (Huh), Funkadelic, hit you with the irrelevant
Elements, and it's coming through your blocks, can't you smell it, trick?
Wanna copycat my whole format
So you get funk tracks, punchlines, and skull hats
Huh, got a little Redman in town
Who's the effin' clown soundin' wack with the frown?
I don't know, man, but you better warn him what I would do
Wild out on this staff like birds one and two
My crew runs thicker than syrup from the barrel
You get hurt up, word up, jammed like Pearl
Knock off a bloodclaat, puff on a rough block
R.I.P. my man, Rockafella, it don't stop
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin' on to the funky shit, come on
(On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin' on to the funky shit)
I said Jersey's in the house (Jersey's in the house)
I said Brooklyn's in the house (Brooklyn's in the house)
I said Uptown's in the house (Uptown's in the house)
I said the Bronx in the hid-ouse (The Bronx in the hid-ouse)

Newark, New Jersey, rock, rock on, word is bond
I'm comin' in swarms, so turn your flashlights on
Due to difficulty, my style blows wattage across the planet
In forty-eight hours like Nick Nolte
Droppin' the flavor, stay sky high like pager
I'm magical like Fantasia on paper
I saw the light like Kraftwerk, of course
When the T-L-A Rock shock the stuff, it's yours
In your drawers, your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin' you gonna sell two mil' cakes real fast
But you flopped, and your image choked like a TEC
Now who freakin' style your ass gonna steal next?
Are there any more imitators in the house? There are no
Bust like NBA Jams, and you can have Chicago
Catch the combo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back when I pumped 92 KTU in Harlem
Huh, I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna, shh, my style like a junkie on crack
Trick, you better back the freak up, for real now
When I break it down from Newark, NJ to Illtown
You might also like
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin' on to the funky shit, c'mon
(On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin' on to the funky shit)
I said Virginia's in the house (Virginia's in the house)
I said Cali's in the house (Cali's in the house)
I said Atlanta's in the house (Atlanta's in the house)
North Carolina's in the house (Carolina's in the house)

Yoo-hoo, watch the birdie while Red wreck your brains early
If rap was B-ball, I'd have assists like James Worthy
Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device, Run-D.M.C.'s from my rock box
Hey you, better come clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another pay-per-view to your crew
I give a boom bip to Q-Tip
Standin' tall like Shaq, money, I'm back, this ain't Blue Chips
The new stuff, creamin' brothers like Breyers
He's heating up, nah, brother, I'm on fire
Dribble dribble, shootin' three pointers to the drum
Trick try to take my style, foul, and-one
DJ Twinz in the house for the nine-square
My man Shaft, you don't know, you better ask
Hah, that bomb Chocolate City coming to you live
For the ninety-four era
Ayo, you better pass that blunt, ayo, check this out
We gon' take it to you live where Newark, New Jersey drops that chocolate funk for ya
Every day and all day, how we do it, word is bond, word is day
Def Squad's in the house for the nine-four, word is bond, word is day
They said Hawthorne Ave got the good smoke, word is bond, word is day
Knotty-head niggas in the house for nine-four, word is bond, word is day
Brick City brigade in the house for nine-four, word is bond, word is day
Redman rocks on and on for the nine-four, word is bond, word is day
Word is bond, word is bond in the house, I'm in the house
Word is bond, word is day
You can suck my balls and lick my clip, not word bond, word to me
Word is bond, word to me
Word is bond, word to me
Check it out, check it out
We comin' to you live with the Cosmic Slop
On the fuckin' block and we got the Glocks to your knot
Who's the funk nigga and I'm comin' to your blocks
It's the Cosmic Slop, hit you with the irrelevant, eleâ€” yeah4Embed
