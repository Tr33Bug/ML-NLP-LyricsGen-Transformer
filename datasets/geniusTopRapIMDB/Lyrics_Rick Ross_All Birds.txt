All Birds Lyrics
Walk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire (M-M-M-Maybach Music)
What more could you ask for, huh?

I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati
I'm a John Gotti, got my own army
Worth fifty million and it's all on me
Fifty on my Rollie, knowin' yours phony
Last problem I had, a nigga headshot him
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him
I got Lears and all, don't need Aaliyah problems
May she rest her soul, I got a sleeping problem
All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double MG this little thing of ours
Take it to the door, a motherfucker plea
Niggas layin' on your crib while your momma sleep
Home-cooked meals for the real niggas
Hot TEC-9 for you little niggas
Wanna shoplift? Come and boost this
We run the fucking game, nigga, truth is (Maybach Music)
Cargo pants and my red bottoms
Talking 'bout birds, you know the boy got 'em
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds (Hah)
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds (Hah)
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds (Hah)
And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first (Uh)

Anything you need, know I get it cheap (Hah)
My nigga Rozay make millions while he getting sleep (Hah)
Cars European, come and see the fleet (Hah)
We're commercial, come and see us if you need the street (Hah)
I'ma bring it home nigga, bet the bank (Hah)
Sierra Leone all up in the link (Bling)
'Bout to double up, Mason Betha shit (Hah)
Huddle up, round table, King Arthur shit (Arthur shit)
Shorty ass fat, she can't stand straight (Hah)
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggas sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause (Blrrt!)
Slicker than a can of grease
Paid the state in the ice, hundred grand a piece
Coke Boy, I'll be thirty for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope now (Hah)

No clothes in the closet, it's all birds (Hah)
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds (Hah)
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds (Hah)
And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first (Hah)
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds (Hah)
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds (Hah)
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds (Hah)
And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first
