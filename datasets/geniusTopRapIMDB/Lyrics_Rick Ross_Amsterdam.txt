Amsterdam Lyrics
We get ghost, you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit
Cameras in the ceiling, CÃ©line on my arm

Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
Refugees runnin' wild, Wyclef with a SIG Sauer
Nothin' to lose, I was starvin' from the start
Now the same cat drivin' Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standin' in the field of dreams, tryna see a hundred mil
These boys goin' blind they just happy bein' free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a ki'
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased
These boys snort lines, I'm fine just sippin' wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always runnin' late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're gettin' rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas actin' like they want a war!
When it come to whackin' niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm ridin' in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour
I'm laughin' at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn
You might also like
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

I'm speakin' on unwritten laws, the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my motherfuckin' business..
Ugh! Ugh!
It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We green light you bitch niggas
