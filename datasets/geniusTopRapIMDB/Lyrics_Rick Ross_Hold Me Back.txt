Hold Me Back Lyrics
I see how these niggas playin'
But I could adapt

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
I look in my fridge, my shit lookin' scarce
I got a few kids, we need some shit on the shelf
I get a knock at the door, they say my rent overdue
And while my niggas sell dope and don't know what else to do
The only thing on my mind, I'm tryin' to keep on the lights
I call up my slime, I need a kilo tonight
Everything went well, I'm eatin' steak, no more soup
Then I parked the Caprice, I went and got me a coupe
Everything takes time, but this shit came fast
Niggas standin' in line, they wanna hold me back
I multiplied my hustle, stimulated my mind
Motivated my niggas and we'll never divide, NO!

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no

First I got me a Taurus, then I copped me a Lexus
I took over Florida, my connect out of Texas
Then I start sippin' purple, got my shit screwed
When you feedin' your circle, watch your shipments improve
Fabricate 'bout your fortune, all my fabric's imported
Fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage
24k my toilet, all my taxes reported
All my exes deported, shout-out Texas, New Orleans
All these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance
I just bought me the purest, but I need some insurance
Niggas watch who you fuckin' just to hate on your bitches
Niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspension
You might also like
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no

Momma workin' three jobs 'til I told her to quit
How we rose from the sewers, funny now I'm the shit
Niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion
Had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis
Killers ride for that paycheck, AK, okay, check
Bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex
These niggas won't hold me back, told the feds they sold me sack
Whip 'em right and then come right back
Whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no
Pussy ass niggas, pussy ass niggas
They all pussy ass niggas, pussy ass niggas
Lookin' down on these niggas, pussy ass niggas
Pushin' my new Ferrari on these pussy ass niggas
Pussy ho, pussy ho
She a pussy ho until she give me pussy ho
Pussy ho, pussy ho
Pussy ho, she a pussy ho

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back...17Embed
