I Wonder Why Lyrics
The day you decide to get you some money
Nigga fuck your friends
Ain't no friends we ain't even on that
All these niggas taking Instagrams, selfies
Point me to the money
Point me to the money
Business, big business
Maybach business
If you ain't with it I don't fuck with you
You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk
I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time

Nappy-headed nigga, pocket full of crack rock
Nineteen, living like a fucking rap star
Watching from my point you thought it was a fucking film
One day he buy the car, next day the fucking rims
Curly-headed bitches, tall and they slim
They know him as the myth but see I know it's him
Never testify, I seen it in his eye
Attempted murder on his life in that 360i
With my two eyes
Two different pistols
One with registered and one to get your issue
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
All this fame and fortune leave you traumatized

You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk
I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
You might also like
Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Stand your ground, stand your ground
Stand your ground, you gotta stand your ground

Got on my hoodie and my motherfucking Desert Eagle
You wanna do me, then you go and tell the people
Knock me down, temp drops as the sun rise
I could see a hustler in my son's eyes
I never knew that money bring so many enemies
Dreams come true, they dream of killing me
But it's fuck 'em and I feed 'em fish
Them killers coming, 'X' you off the list

Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Stand your ground, stand your ground
Stand your ground, you gotta stand your ground

You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk
I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
(Okay, they're having trouble hearing you, so take your time)
Creepy-ass cracka
And then he said 
(And he's still following him?)
