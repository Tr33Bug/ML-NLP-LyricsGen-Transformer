MC Hammer Lyrics
Boss
Ricky Ross
It's Triple C's
Color cut clarity

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm ridin' dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm MC Hammer, I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere, I'm MC Hammer
Started sellin' dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pullin' out the stick
I'm at the car lot, I'm goin' broke
I pay for 5, they front a couple mo'
I take them home, like I do my hoes
I dress them up, I buy them clothes
Glass slippers, I gas hoes
Now she's actin' brand new on you assholes
Limousines, I did that
Two door coupes, boy I live that
My top back, uncircumcised
I pull it back, just to go inside
She thinkin' Phillipe's, I'm thinkin' Wing Stop
Fiendin' lemon pepper, I got my thing cocked
Black batmobile, it's only new Ferrari
It's called Scaglietti, one button like an Atari
I'm just advisin', my profits risin'
Niggas buyin' stocks in a nigga like I'm Verizon

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm ridin' dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm MC Hammer, I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere, I'm MC Hammer
Started sellin' dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pullin' out the stick
You might also like
I cop the Porsche, I was so ecstatic
100 grand a day my operation is so elaborate
Credit card scams, that was for the faggots
Motherfuck' window shoppin', boy I gotta have it
Now my shit be boomin' all across the atlas
Gucci Pucci money long, now we call him Alex
Had to move from Davie, 'cause that shit went local
Pick up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in Boca
My baddest bitches Latin, but they call me loco
'Til I fuck them in the ass out in Acapulco
I'm thinkin' money, every moment thinkin' money
I bust a nut then I'm back to thinkin' money
My wrist froze, my mind blown
Her mouth slow, my eyes closed
You gotta judge a man by his principles
Teflon Don, I am invincible

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm ridin' dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm MC Hammer, I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere, I'm MC Hammer
Started sellin' dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pullin' out the stick
Diamonds movin' on my chest, wanna Hammer dance
Seventy grand make my jeans sag like some Hammer pants
Ambulance, ambulance, 911, 911
It’s Gucci Mane, yeah that’s my name, I’m goin' dumb, goin' dumb
Blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
I’m like MC Hammer, I put that on my grandma
I ride through East Atlanta, in my new Ferrari
It’s a 458, if you don’t have one, sorry
I’ll let you borrow mine, I think I’m MC Hammer
I never borrowed jewelry, I’m tippin' naked dancers
It’s an occasion, a celebration, at Central Station
With Haitian hoes and Jamaicans, I’m tryna make it
Old school, wanna race it? We can test it
I’m flexin', I’ll leave a sucker eatin' dust for breakfast
So expect the unexpected, I’m well connected
I’m MC Hammer 150 on the guest list
Gucci!

When it's hammer time, I'm pullin' out the stick13Embed
