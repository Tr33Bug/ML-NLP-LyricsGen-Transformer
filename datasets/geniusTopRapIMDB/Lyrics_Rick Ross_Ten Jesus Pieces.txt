Ten Jesus Pieces Lyrics
God forgives, He's so honorable
But livin' amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury

I wake up excited, I made it through the night
Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?
My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fuckin' feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fuckin' reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thuggin' when they dick-ridin'
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbin'
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows in my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doin' wrong
My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Askin' for a hundred mill as I pray to God
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Young nigga comin' up, they wanna gun you down
Drinkin' vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you P-Nut)
Ridin' real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)
Shoppin' for them Os when the mall close
Reppin' for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowin' on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)
Forty dollar tab meanin' forty grand
Lil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holdin' on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smokin' in the motherland
You might also like
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice
All these jewels on, all Moissanites
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black market
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screamin' your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfuckin' killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Versace shirt, Jesus layin' on the chest
Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean
Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stuntin' on these niggas cause I couldn't back then
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't tryna match them
I remember bumpin' Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scrapin' up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm danglin' chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I buy em
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

We untouchable

Xolaal sama guys, dundu ben yoon la
Dangay dundu sa dundu, gemm Yalla
Ligeey, xalis, gnax, amoul nelaw, gnafè
Sa life yako dugal, ken du ko jappale
Yow ya ray sa bopp ba dee. Moy loolu
Mi historia es complicada, pero al final del dia valio la pena, porque ahora estoy trabajando con el jefe
Yo vivi en Colombia y vivi muchas cosas, me entiende?
Vi muertes...vi muertes...vi cuerpos en las calles, sangrando despues del colegio, con 12, 13 años viendo estas cosas en la calle
Y siempre queria venir para aqui otra vez, y me vine, y trabaje porque tenia otra mentalidad. Y cuando llegue aca entendi mi proposito: hacer dinero, ser rico para siempre
Dios perdona, yo no5Embed
