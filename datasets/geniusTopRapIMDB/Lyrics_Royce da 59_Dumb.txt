Dumb Lyrics
Yeah, we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
Dumb
Dumb

I'm no longer a prospect
I'm what you call a veteran, a legend man, I'm a prophet (Huh)
You ain't no artist, you're what I would call a concept
Made to inspire gossip like Shade Room or like Bossip
Welcome to the Grammy's where your likeness is used
For promos, hypeness and views, okay, I hope that you knowin'
That if you voted, you might as well've not voted for no one
They knew when they made that category where that trophy was goin’
All this industry shit is (Dumb) there ain’t no middle class
Raise yo glass, here's to classism
Either you a rich ass nigga or you’s a bum, there ain’t no in between
Sinners sell they souls, angels sell they halos and they wings
I had dreams of fuckin’ a R&B chick
Then I found out that R&B chick already had a dick
Already slept with your favorite rapper, aren't we sick?
You start as a artist and turn to alcoholicking quick
This shit is (Dumb)
Man I wish I would let a nerd who work at Interscope
In a coat by Kenneth Cole, consult me about my image, bro
I’m the best rapper out this bitch
Except the only catch is that I’m in this ho
Oh (Dumb)
They so dumb (So dumb)
And nothing that they do is new
They so dumb (So dumb, yeah yeah yeah)
Oh (Dumb)
They so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)
They ain't foolin' me or you
They so dumb (They so dumb, so dumb)

Let's bring the punches back
You see them fake woke niggas that had to come to that, mm
I love promotin', elevation and a space that all my brothers at
And why I'm lyin'? I be turnt up to these mumble raps
Watch who you comin' at, don't be (Dumb), uh
This where Confucius started thuggin' that, uh
This Metro Boomin' mixed with Thundercat, uh
That’s where my niggas gain they muscle at, uh
Somebody eatin' off your plate, how you gon' stomach that?
'Cause of that, all my niggas is (Dumb) like how we get to this year?
Man I turn basic into intricate, I kill you with my simple shit
No tweetin' when we kickin' it, don't tell me what you finna get
Silly, you could drown without a membership
Watch who you swimmin' wit (Dumb), it's ten of us ridin' up on the city bus
Sittin' here tryin' hit for the scripture like it's Leviticus
Tacklin' reality, prayin' that it don't injure us, uh
I love my niggas but it's really us
When we gon' notice that we so-?
You might also like
Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one
Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one (Dumb)27Embed
