Legendary (Success Is Certain) Lyrics
I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki, I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire, rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubik's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the "I" in "try"?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my Lost Sessions
I'm legendary
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
'Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow, the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig
You might also like
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary5Embed
