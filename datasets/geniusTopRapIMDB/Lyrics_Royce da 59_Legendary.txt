Legendary Lyrics
A woman's loyalty is tested
When her man has nothing
A man's loyalty is tested
When that man has everything
The definition of a legend
Is a man who starts with nothing
And leaves the game with everything

Legendary
That shit there gon' make you legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary
Make me legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary
Pardon, nigga, I'm the hardest nigga out
The farthest nigga out the party nigga, I'm the artist
I put all these niggas in the garbage
All these niggas in the toilet
While I sit in orbit, I'm not getting better
I'm just getting started, started I'm just getting
I just flipped it like I do all my competition
Let me slow this shit down
I just need me a bad one
Come over here and wear my flag hon'
I give y'all the bottom line, I don't do a lot of talkin'
Cause a lot of talkin' take up a lot of time
And I don't got a lot of time
Since a kid sittin' in the wicker chair
With the sweater with the collar out of mine
I swore a lot and swear to promise to cut the line
Swear not to get out of line
I can't have 'Pac in my closet, I don't got time to idolize
I just cop it and toss it
I don't got time to itemize, my flight is high
Probably the only thing around me tonight that's high
Besides my I-D-E-O-logy
Pockets chubby, I should say tubby
'Cause I'm ballin' like Dr. J
Wonderin', "How could they sub me?"
I certainly got comrades like Conrad Murray
Who operate ugly from around the way
I'm lookin' around at these pretty girls, and this what I got to say
You might also like
Ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That right there gon' make you legendary
That right there gon' make you legendary

That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
I ain't tryna fuck every bitch that's tryna fuck me
That shit right there just ain't necessary
All I'm tryna be is legendary
That right there won't make you legendary
I remember I was just a pimp
Save all that extra shit
You bitches' neck'll twist quick as The Exorcist
Just tryna catch a glimpse, bitch I look excellent
Soon as I exit, I peel out advantage
She try to look hard 'cause her ride lookin' small
We will suit up and boot up and get out like Mexicans
All you niggas do is party all the time
Party all the time, party, party, party
Once you my target, I'll stop you while you're startin'
Started, why you stoppin'? My niggas clock around the party
Around the clock, wearing choppers 'round the .40
And rocket launcher down the block
Mwah! And they ain't got no lawyers
That gon make 'em fuckin' legendary
That's gon make you fucking legendary
Beautiful women asking "When we gon' get together?"
I told all 'em bitches "Nevuary"
Now all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense
'Cause they know that I will fuck 'em once
Like a record company then drop 'em
Hold up, that's that shit gon make you legendary
That shit gon make me so, so, so legendary
'Specially if she acting suspect
And the pussy just end up being so, so
I'm just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow
Got the underground wire, like the tires low pro
Got the eye of the tiger inside of the mind of a, old soul, yo
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That right there gon make you legendary
That right there gon make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary

That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary
You get more for your money when you fuck with Mr. Porter3Embed
