Malcolm X (D12 Diss) LyricsRoyce talking
D12, worst fucking rap group ever (You ready?)
Royce Da 5'9" would like to apologize to the family of my homeboy Bugz
For lettin' that line leak out the radio, it was a long story how it happened
D-12 though, y'all better quit actin' like that wadn't my man too
Like I was tryna disrespect him or somethin', I was tryna disrespect y'all
Cause that's what I'm doin' (gun-loading sound) from here on 'n
My new name from now on, don't even call me Royce Da 5'9" no mo'
Call me Malcolm X, cause e'rybody in the city wanna kill me (*gun shooting sounds*)
I'm Malcolm X now haha, we gon' see who goin, I ain't goin nowhere motherfucker
We gon' see, e'rybody who against me, nigga I'm mad (BITCH)
Haha, yeah, there's only one problem
Everytime you motherfuckers breathe on the mic
It's a motherfuckin' lie nigga, nobody believes you (*echoes*)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
Y'all niggas sound like y'all write y'all rhymes with motherfuckin' crayons
Bitches

Yeah, what rap crew I gotta snatch up out the game (bitch)
Who must I smack for sayin my name?
Somebody gon' die, it's probably YOU
You couldn't fit Bizarre's body in my shoes
Niggas quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggas with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'mma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'mma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
(You bitch!) Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'mma snatch you out of that truck
And tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just
Feed you, you already look like you about to bust
Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra "g's" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speech impediment
(You bitch!) Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
(You bitch!) Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year, both y'all be rakin' 50's leaves
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow
(You bitch!) Let's face it I gave it to y'all
My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (barking sounds)
Niggas is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash it yet
Kiss my ass! I don't wanna talk to Hex!
I am so sick I should be compared to cancer
Y'all throw up y'all dukes but don't swing like Fred G. Sanford
I be makin' motherfuckers scratch their heads when I rhyme
Y'all lil' niggas scratch ya heads then rhyme, go play;
You lil punk ass niggas, y'all can scream and yell all you want
I feel like I'm battlin' Kenan & Kel
(You bitch!) None o' y'all can put in the call to Kino
Paul better call me, like he called Benzino
Matter of fact, I might even do a song with Ray
Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song a day
You might also like
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)

I don't even want you lil' punks to think I'm mad
Y'all lil' niggas are Ninja Turtles, you're nothing
Nothin', you're not on my level, I will beat your boss's ass, nigga
Tre Little, bring it on

Tre Little, the baby gorrilla, I'm just that guy
I'm 5'6", got stacked lines, shit that high, I'm ridin'
Fuck you and your commercial appeal
I turn your head into blue and yellow Purple Hills
I bet you whatever that nobody beats my family
Eminem, Nelly said that he'll eat you like candy
What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us
(You bitch!) Yo' crew some local hoes
I hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man
I understand you backin' yo' crew, but this my brother
Anythin' that happen to him, somethin' gonna happen to you
And I don't give a fuck for that, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop; yo' money don't buy you stripes
Only thing that money brings is fake niggas and problems
Followed by niggas who hate fake niggas and rob 'em
But you niggas is wack
Denaun I'mma stab you so many times, I'mma feel bad when you collapse
You niggas is so bitch you make me sick to my stomach
Every beat that you ever made sound like it was missin' somethin'
Timbaland lookin' ass, nigga, my style is realer
What producer you ever know only good for album filler
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)
We gon' beat yo' ass (down)

You!, Yea, punk ass niggas, yea we in the streets now too, nigga
Big Homie's out nigga, what up

Yea you stuttering ass motherfuckers, what y'all thought
My brother here ain't have no backbone?
Nigga, it's on when I see y'all
Proof what the fuck you thinkin' of nigga, that's cash boy
Need the white boy to get y'all started ass niggas
Fuck y'all hoes, I told Royce I ain't like that motherfucka
Faggots, I smack the shit outta any one o' y'all niggas
Sell my bill one nigga
What the fuck y'all thought nigga y'all'll get bought bitch
Street orientated; y'all motherfuckers hate it
Learn how to flow stop bein' mad y'all bitches
Trick Trick, when I catch yo' bitch ass, yea dude
Asked about cash nigga, you comin' to yo' doom
You'll end up like click boom, bitch
Rock City motherfucker, regardless
Get the point bitch, or get the hollows motherfucker
It's Cash Flow, bitch, Big Homie1Embed
