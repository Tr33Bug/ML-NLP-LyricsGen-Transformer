Overcomer Lyrics

Ayo
Ayo

All we did was slang dope (All we did was slang dope)
Mini Tec, that's my main ho (Grrr)

Fishscale pictures, wish you well
Heard you got 30 up North, it's aight, mean he ain't need no scale
Ruger shells at Bloomingdales (boom-boo-boo-boom)
Word on the street he had two for sale
Pistol in your mouth like a root canal
Aston with the missing roof, pissin' Vueve (Vroom)
Put ten on your head, I bet they get you soon
Courtside, Zion got thirty, Bron got fifty (Ah)
I better cook a brick in a jiffy (Whip)
All we did was slang dope (All we did was slang dope)
Baby TEC, that's bae, bro (Grrr)
Came home scramblin', all you heard was ambulance
Somebody got hit on the corner, doin' hand to hands
12-12's out the minivan, it had the ceiling fan
Dashboard had the chandelier
Sold grams for years, baggin' up, taste the tears
Hit 'em up close, you gotta face the fears (boo-boo-boo-boo)
Where I'm from, driveby's overrated (Overrated)
If you got five bodies then you famous (Then you famous)
Get a hammer for the brick, we gotta break it (Gotta break it)
Shit broke the blender, nigga (Brrr)
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope (Doo-doo-doo)
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope

(I need your sweet love
Darling, can't you see?
I need your sweet love
Darling, can't you see?
Oh-oh
Woo, I love you
All I wanted)
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boom

In search of right like the birth of Christ
Breakin' every generational curse in life
Perverse, concise, make sure the verse is right
Return who adverse to the Earth
Make sure that my hearse is white
And the contract Jewish, to match a grind that's foolish
A Qur'an that's Buddhist
Rappin' so Mike Caren and Denaun stack moolah
As I sign on the dotted line with the passion of a blind tattooist
In reaction to slithers from lizards mouth
Yelawolf this is your first and your last pass
I ain't gon' put it on blast, your punk ass know what this about
You think it's 'bout being loud or tryna be hostile
'Til you get found face down on the ground outside of Kid Rock house
Though you a vulture pundit, I hope you get sober from this
Men lie, women lie, so do numbers
The energy never lies when you a overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer
I don't rhyme for the likes, I'm who the jealous target
I'm underground for life this shit is a seller's market
The rich get richer, the po' get mo' greedy
We need Clarance A. to get what's owed in these board meetings
Rappers catch Ls after just squeezing 'em four Feezys
Crackers pattern themselves after the teachings of Morris Levy
But I was dubbed the greatest by the gossip
I'm King Tut to haters from this Spyder cockpit
It's Jacob, custom makes me fire watches
Inspired by Cool J drivin' Saabs
With Cut Creator right beside him drivin' Mazdas
I was labeled "drug-related" by the coppers
A government that through the republic
Has been subjugated by the mobsters
Martin got shot on the Lorraine balcony, became alchemy
Was spit on at the hospital when suffocated by the doctors
Michael was sniped at six at night, precisely by a laser
Mac Miller died pleadin' for his life, reciting God's prayer
Immaculately conceived, the product of Nas' labor
Ain't shit like me, I'm Chris Lighty, I'm Violator
Dedicated to the edification of sellin' blackness
I feel like Dame yellin' at Kevin Liles over leather jackets
Prince when he told Nas, "Own your masters or you ass out"
Best rapper between Cardi and Meg Thee Stallion is Kash Doll

Overcomer
This Detroit, energy I'm on forever
Shout out to everybody who made it out (Overcomer)
And remember, God doesn't call the qualified
He qualifies the called, that's Christine Caine
Overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer (Overcomer)
The energy never lies when you a overcomer (Overcomer)
Oh yeah
The station that keeps you in the groove
 Saint-Tropez
It is that kind of weekend
Keepin' it cool, laughin' with friends, family5Embed
