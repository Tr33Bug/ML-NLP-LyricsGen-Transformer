Rhinestone Doo Rag Lyrics
Motherfucker, say what?
Yeah
White Jesus taught you heathens cross you niggas just to stone you
Knowledge empowers all you quicker than ignorance disarms you
I hate to see Tee Grizzley going through shit he shouldn't be going through
I hate to see Shady respond to shit he shouldn't respond to
I hate that your Commander In Chief is more demander and thief
And it seems like this boy just can't be impeached
I can't be under the thumb of one who seems to be attracted to his own daughter
Why should we not set up shop?
We black, we are our own barbers
But even a jewel from a fool is still a gem
A dude'll put more energy in killing you than healing him
We went from riding in Yugos to buying sumo statues
When you fall from that level of flying, who gon' catch you?
Pac and Biggie died for you rappers so you don't have to
Martin and Malcolm died for your blackness, pursue your masters
I wore that rhinestone doo-rag so you don't have to
I'ma need you to Google that too
I wore a rhinestone doo-rag, but you don't have to
Next generation, it's on y'all
Motherfucker, say what?You might also like1Embed
