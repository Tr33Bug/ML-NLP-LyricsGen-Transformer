Rock City Lyrics
Rock City
Royce five nine
Slim Shady
Come on

Can't stop the hustle, Royce nickel nine
Glock stops the tussle, nine shots'll bust you
Pine box, they'll stuff you, fuck you, I am not the tussle
Niggas don't know me, I'm Detroit's king nigga, bow!
Rock City's where the niggas pimp hoes and ball
Strip hoes in bars, steal clothes from malls
As long as your city's got the
Bombs and your city's got the
Arms and your city's got the
Titties sagging looking like they got forearms
Gold bottles, green bottles, Cris' to the don
Niggas get popped for selling weed, shaked with seeds
If you hate me you hate the D, nigga please
I'm taking shit back to the riots in the sixties
Think I'm lying? Visit me (Where you live)
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me
Rock with me, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on the block with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come and rock with me
Rock-City-c'mon-rock-on-city-c'mon

Suburban and city niggas hustle together
Long as it's money involved, niggas'll tussle together
Long as the hustle's a hustle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buying if the price is right
So, drop the mics, everything's on cock
From the shots to the dice, we are not into hype (Nope)
You can't say we can't work
Either we some plant workers or we some niggas that plant work
What? Detroit bitches is 'bout it
You can just ask any one of your niggas that visit about it
Any seven mile bitch know how to get rich
She'll fuck you 'til you sleep plus lie to your bitch
Plus she'll suck and swallow up outta your dick
And she'll keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit, come on

Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock with me, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on the block with me
Rock City, come and rock with me
You might also like
The city with the bars, where the goons
Where the cars is produced, here we are with the

New casinos, car shuffles, numbers to bet
Disrespect and get a new smile under your neck
A city full of thug-ass niggas, and punk-rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
Them shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys look, act, and rap like Slim (Hi)
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearns thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans with weed-connects like whoa
Type of weed, no need to test like 'dro
Type of cats who got dough, they like - so?
You real then you might go, where?

Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock with me, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on the block with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on and rock with me
Rock City, come on and rock with me (c'mon)
Rock with me, come on the block with me
Rock City, come and rock with me
Rock with me
Detroit, Rock City, Slim Shady
Won't you come on the block with us?
Royce da 5’9”, won't you just come and rock with us?
Royce da 5’9”, it's the next level, Rock City
Royce nickel nine, Slim Shady, Rock City
Won't you come and rock with us?
Rock City, won't you come on the block with us?
Rock with me, won't you come and rock with us?
Rock City, two-thousand, rock with me, touch it
