Strong Friend Lyrics
Reflections of your strong friend
You need to check up on your strong friend
Nobody ever checks up on the strong friend
Uh, strong friend

I remember 2003, out hear screaming, "We next"
I was grippin' that 300, Rock & Rye Lexus GS
I put rhinestones in my durag, I put on leather pants
I went to parties just for Bacardi, I tricked, I never danced
All my friends expect to be treated just as my next of kin
Eyebrows lift up if I'm out with them and let them spend
The question is, "How is y'all problems becoming my problems?
I'm already hiding all of my problems behind my pop' problems"
When I was nine, seen my father beat the shit out of my momma
I'm smilin' right now, I'm trying not to cry about her
Alcoholic, I just spent five thousand tryna buy bottles of Patron again
Now sing along with your strongest friend
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength that's never gon' end
The one with sense, take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him, the Devil play to win
I remember I had Maia Campbell in my Mercedes Benz
You probably thought she gave in to the plot of Satan's sin
She got demons greater than, you and I
And this message is to Denaun and to Shady, you say we friends?
Well take care of Lyric, 80 and baby Quinn like they Hailie then
Well shit, it's my funeral, y'all should play all of my songs too
Hope my body look beautiful, while I lay in my strong suit
Rumors spread about me that ain't true, that's how the fake do
If I'm the strong friend, then what the fuck do that make you?!

Check up on your strong friend, uh

"The worst thing to call somebody is crazy
It's dismissive, I don't understand this person so he's crazy
That's bullshit, these people are not crazy, they're strong people
Maybe their environment is a little sick." - Dave Chappelle
"Black people don't know a goddamn thing about therapy." - Self
