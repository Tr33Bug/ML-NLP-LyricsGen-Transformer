Young World Lyrics
Now the moment you've all been waiting for

Yeah, that double barrel need a couple beams
They wanna chip em I ain’t trippin baby up my streams
That's how I'm swimmin', hear the hissin' from the serpentine
They tryna rattle my cage, I raised the hell evaded cells and won some battles with greats
Die or fall from his grace, banana clips, them crackers wish that we evolved from the apes
Who done see they homies bleed to death?
The ambulance was runnin' late
The homies had to beat his chest, the pages in my jungle book
Is crazy, baby, come and look, bandana Baloo
Big drums and the sticks, band camp with the crew
Made music in feuds before I seen a studio
Glock held the stock, 10 shots like it knew Malone
You ain't thuggin' 'til your mothers know you doin' wrong
He was a soldier, he can't come home, she kiss him through the phone
But y'all ain't ever do what you rappin'
Yankee fitted, barrel kickin' like it's Snoop in Manhattan, Norf
Hey, young world
 fake man
Y'all know the beef from the hood, it'll never
Tell 'em DJ turn it up, turn-turn-turn it up
The bitches, the chains, respect before fame
Those are things that make the young world go 'round
The riches, the game, the Bentley Mulsanne
Type of things that make the young world go 'round
 & Royce da 5'9"]
Hey, young world
Hey, young world
Don't you change, for the world (You gotta be you)
Hey, young world
Hey, young world
I saw you change the world

Yeah, that Adderall got you up
Them student loans that you owe got you fucked
Niggas like me still stuck on parole
Niggas like me caught cases and never told
Stick to the code, you cracker men make your own rules
But that's only if you really in the for a movement
Got my first check and put some ice on my neck
Dropped ten on my card co-signed by my Bic, yeah
Lyin' with the Crip, yeah, doin' wild shit, yeah
Comin' from the ghetto where this ignorance is bliss, yeah
Gun fire sparked the mind now the mind had changed the world
High fashion got me scorin' big with all the fine girls
It was all a dream, GQ magazines
Hit the Billboard, throwin' up the 2 when the big G
Young world, young world, make way for the new progressive gangster with the curl
You might also like
Hey young world
 fake man
Y'all know the beef from the hood, it'll never
Tell 'em DJ turn it up, turn-turn-turn it up
The bitches, the chains, respect before fame
Those are things that make the young world go 'round
The riches, the game, the Bentley Mulsanne
Type of things that make the young world go 'round

The Carolina Panthers have selected with their number one draft pick, Chauncy Blackburn (Hey, young world)
It is rumored that he brought his mother into a brand new home (Young world)
She'll be paying off the interest for the rest of her life, congratulations (Hey young world)
Recent action says that P.Diddy wants to buy the Carolina Panthers (Don't you change)

Fuck the Panthers, we are the fuckin' panthers
Throwin' Benjamins though we could hardly trust the dancer
The truth should set me free, but somehow I'm stuck with answers
Wish I could give George Zimmerman Karlie Hustle cancer
I made millions off of PRhyme, bruh
No one would front though, like where the fans be lined up
James Baldwin speakin' to street niggas with peace signs up
Straight boss, my pheromones secrete Elon Musk
I've grown to rebuke the Bible, had homies that suicidal
I loaned them until they wronged me, when grown men were too entitled
Took my first drink at Dr. Dre home 'cause I was homeless
But nowadays while in Rome, Romans should do as I do
I ain't here for the prize or medals
Knowledge of God, or lies of Devils
Knowledge of I, or the eyes of several
Death from the gun at the drummer's expense
Tell Trump don't send a tweet, send a plumber to Flint
Take the sky as your limits
Take the sky as your limits
Same ones that tried to hide your lineage
Young world
Young world, young world, young world
World, world, world, world, world
World, young world-world3Embed
