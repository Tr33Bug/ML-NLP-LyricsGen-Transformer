Diary of a Madman Lyrics
Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out

Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
Is there life after death too?
And what about the nigga with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as well face it we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And its the diary of a madman
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with the torch
Shot him in his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the fo rilla, but now I'm a born killer
And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't no thing to me
To go up to a nigga's house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'ma take ya
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to care
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand-yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'ma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
You might also like
Dear diary, help me 'cause I'm frantic
Sometimes I think I'm going schizophrenic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe 'cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfuckin world with my eyes closed
To myself, I'm a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere 'cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked off, now I'm living in my diary2Embed
