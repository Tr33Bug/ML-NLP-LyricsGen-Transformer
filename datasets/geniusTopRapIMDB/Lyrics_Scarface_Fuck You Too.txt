Fuck You Too Lyrics
You know they always say, man, it's tough being at the top, huh?
I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did... I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!
Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is "get it"
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have five-K-one's, gun killers
 bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!
You might also like
Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
My grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble ain't
Just another saint, fuck 'em!2Embed
