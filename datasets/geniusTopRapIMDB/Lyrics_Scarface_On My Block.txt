On My Block Lyrics
Woo! This for the block, boy!
Take a breath... Woah!

Every day, it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On your block, you pro'ly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B-I, your homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dog, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was "Creepy"
If Black June could see me, he'd be tripping
And I'd bet he still try to tease me
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block, it ain't no different than the next block
You get drunk and pass out, and they back you to the house
And when you wake up on the couch, you going right back at it
On my block, when you're that fucked up, they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fly, pass it around a few times to get high

My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, everybody business ain't your business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, you had to have that understanding
'Cause if you told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once your mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set your ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets, shellshocked
Who never quite got right; now, they inhale rocks
On my block, it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small, little section we living in
Oh, my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
'Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me9Embed
