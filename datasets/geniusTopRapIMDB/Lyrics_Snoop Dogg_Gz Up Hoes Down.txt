Gz Up, Hoes Down Lyrics
Yeah, what's happening?
This one is dedicated to my niggas
All my niggas out there, G's up, hoes down

Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the mic, pay attention
One, two, oh what shall I do?
I'm slipping on my khaki suit (Which one?)
The blue one, gun by my side as I mob to the beach
On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Sagging like a mothafucka, khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg, not your average motherfucka, see
Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be driving ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'mma hit ya up with the Pound, G's up, hoes down

Will all the real G's, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rolling with the Row

Back with the one, two, three, and to the fo'
It's the S-N, O and to the O, P
(Why am I so fly?) I don't know, but
(Why am I so high?) It's the Indo

I don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this
Fucking with The Chronic cause The Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these, follow me
As I take ya rolling with the real OG's
East Side is the motherfuckin' place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, twenty grand and
You might also like
Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be driving ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'mma hit ya up with the Pound, G's up, hoes down

Will all the real G's, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rolling with the Row

Hell yeah, you know what I'm saying?
This is stricly for the G's, you know I'm saying? Fuck that, bitch
Niggas always handcuffing that ho
When a nigga like me steps in the place
I don't want that ho, I don't love that ho
I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, Indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down7Embed
