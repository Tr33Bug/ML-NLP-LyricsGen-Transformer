Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto Lyrics
Is that the Black Santa Claus? (Ho ho ho ho)
I want a Super 'Intendo (Merry Christmas!), yeah
Sega Genesis (Mommy, mommy), yeah
Street Fighter 2 (Mommy, is that the Black Santa Claus?)
And a gang of toys (That is the Black Santa Claus!), uh
Mommy, mommy, mommy

It's 12:30 a.m., Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog head up-up in my cup
Put Rudolph in motion, sleigh all bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block, but be careful for the hawk because it's posted
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homeless and bums got to sleep? (Nowhere)
Where do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)
Life is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't unfold
The young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh
'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
'Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"
Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Run to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine 'til next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb
And when you find it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
Well-wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)
Is coming straight to the ghetto (Welcome to the ghetto)

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on a open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?
I didn't pout and I ain't even shouted
I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
Don't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? (Can you dig it?)
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana?
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the tree
Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have less as X-Mas get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived
And thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and mom's private secret

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
