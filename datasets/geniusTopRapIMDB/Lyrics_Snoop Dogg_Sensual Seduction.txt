Sensual Seduction Lyrics
I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

So she can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
She might be with him but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall, we don't go out to eat, eat, eat
All that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette, then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
'Cause we done got a

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa

I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

If ya don't know by now, Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak
I keep a bad bitch with me, seven days out the week, week, week
And all that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Then smoke us a cigarette, and go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
'Cause we done got a

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa
Sexual eruption
All the time, anytime
