Signs Lyrics
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G

It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leavin'?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody trippin', VIP they can't get in
If somethin' go wrong then you know we get to Crippin'
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncin' cars
You with your friend, right? (Yeah)
She ain't tryna bring over no men, right? (No)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Mami, Mamacita, have you ever flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sundays with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga, don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doin'
You don't know what you lost until she's gone (til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Ooh, wee!)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G (Hey! Haha!)

Ooh, wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!
Ooh, wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!10Embed
