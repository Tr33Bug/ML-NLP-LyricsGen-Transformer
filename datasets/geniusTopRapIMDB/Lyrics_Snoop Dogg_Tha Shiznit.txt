Tha Shiznit Lyrics
Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'm a O.G
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch!

Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him gimme the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seein'
No, I'm not European bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them D's on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
G'z up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to thisYou might also like26Embed
