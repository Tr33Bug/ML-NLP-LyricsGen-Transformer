Code of the Street Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
The Stack Bun shit
The Alcatraz shit
The rep your hood shit
Me and my man Data
Ecko International shit

[Chorus]
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak
[Verse 1]
I stand grounds, flood blocks, and lock down towns
Take over families, execute 'em with live rounds
Hold grudges, wear gloves, no fingerprint smudges
So when in front of judges, they have no case
Used to use pepper spray, now I'm carryin' mace
Some niggas, they think I'm pretty, wanna scar my face
But my life trife, break dress codes and fuck hoes
Pop moles, blow shoes, leave hoes in doors
Come test that, I spit rounds of four pounds
I leave town surrounded and drowned in slug sound
Fourteen buildings, two casings, seven floors
That's Red Fern, the home of the Scram Lords
Had temporary wars with Bloods and hoo-boys
I done cocked back the fours and put holes in doors, a warrior
Yours look better, I'm takin' yours
Stack Bundles, no faking jacks, I'm breaking jaws

[Chorus]
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak

I'm disrespecting any nigga think he gangster from birth
The name's Stack and I'll spit on your Earth
Now check this off, I'm tellin' y'all this year is mine
In a cypher near you, I ain't hard to find
You better bring your guns if you plottin' to get me
I got a banana clip that I'm dyin' to empty
And the bitch, she trigger happy, so please don't tempt me
I'll make your whole family resent me
Y'all niggas is dicks
Quotin' Hova and thinkin' you big pimpin'
You and your funny ice grills and walkin' the streets limpin'
Crack money is tempin' and rap money is livin'
So I'ma do me, I ain't never gon' give it
'Cause I been through all out wars and earned mine
Knuckle game tight, son, and y'all scared to fight
Bet in Redburn, you won't walk a block at night
You better have your chain tucked and your vest on tight

[Chorus]
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak
Yo, I live by the code of the street
Fuck cops walkin' the beat
A street nigga never muffle the heat
Niggas that want war never turnin' a cheek
Don't try to negotiate, I got burners to speak
[Verse 3]
So if you can stand the rain, then come outside
I ain't only wettin' niggas, I'm takin' they pride
Takin' they brides, shake 'em down, takin' they pies
You don't believe that I'm real, nigga? Look in my eyes
Speak with caution, please take the proper precautions
Breathe too hard, you'll bleed like you had an abortion
I ain't tough talkin', nigga, like Big, this a warning
Promising one thing, you will not see morning
Won't be yawning, won't be tasting that stale breath
Go out with a bang and wake up in Hell depth
And Stack the type of nigga to wild out for nothin'
My hand in my pants, I'll back your clique down and I'm bluffin'
Only party out of town where chump niggas be frontin'
Come to the club no ice, but I'm leavin' with somethin'

[Outro]
Yeah, this Stack Bundles
Y'all niggas better not get out of line
You know what the gun do
Straight like that, niggaEmbed
