Did It My Way Lyrics[Intro]
Okay! I'm reloaded
Jay what up, nigga
Feel like [?] past this shit
And I'm tellin' you I'ma do it my way
West side of the Windy, what up?
Our medicine

[Verse 1: Stack Bundles]
You know it's no holds bars when homes layin' these bars
No horse playin' with broads, homes made him a star
The stars made him a target
'Cause he's the reasons fans are sayin' his shit is garbage
And mines is much better
Admirin' touch better with much more in advance
And nowdays I'm lookin' forward to much more in advance
Coulda been in the hood, usin' Desert for street cred
What I did for the game, I gave the Desert its street cred
Me and the A-Team took the streets by storm
Group cosigned with the courtesy of the Storm
Now I'm tryna reflect the tone like the tsunami storm
Tell Joe and Dame I get it, I put the Roc on
C-I-N-C-I-A [?] the squad
Y'all niggas oughta salute me
Admire the truth, B, you niggas ain't got what it takes
The closer they get to the light is well, bein' a groupie
[Hook: Kanye West + Stack Bundles]
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it

[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
Like you can't say that I'm like, who the fuck said?
Who the fuck made you Puff, and who the fuck said
This was Making A Band? What I'm sayin' should stand
A few rappers alive but the best niggas is dead
See I'm the rebel that led the hometown to the forefront
Treat the game like the corner, milk crate at the storefront
OGs had it poppin', I'm the block's newcomer
My product is proper so I'm doin' my numbers
This shit is sellin' itself, but a few producers helped
Like Ye, Dame, Grease, need a little search for self
Now this shit won't stay in the stores like it's allergic to the shelves
And change won't change dude like he immune to the wealth
My presence is felt like braille, oh hell
It's hip hop's savior, flow sweeter than that sherbet's flavor
If you ain't never seen a star, won't you take you a glance
I ain't lean back, nigga, I just pull up my pants and dip my way
Ye, talk to 'em!

Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it

[Verse 3: Stack Bundles]
I did it my way, you can call me Frank in the flesh
When I do it, I spew it like I was spittin' it for Frank in the flesh
You can't imagine the triumph of an orphan's life
I've overcame the obstacles, defied the odds twice
Met Ye in the Chi, had a deal and all
Didn't work out, back to the drawin' board
Back to the hood, back to the basics, y'all
Had to learn to cook [?] with raw, no fakin', y'all
Always knew that I would make it, y'all
So the failure wasn't quite my style
Had to recognize, it was light at the end of the tunnel
I see more cake, like [?] with Betty Crocker
Betty rock 'em, got me rockin'
Crop you downs like [?], I came, I saw
I keep my [?], and thoughts I pour
Leave you the Porsche, the keys to the T-OP floor
Either or
[Hook: Kanye West + Stack Bundles]
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it
Ye, talk to 'em!
Dawg what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I've been on the grind and I stay into it2Embed
