Dirt on a Record Lyrics[Hook]
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme
And never catch them
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them (never let them)
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm getting closer to my goals
The favorites getting close to the goal
Yeah niggas album is still bricking
Labels want to know my situation
Well if I was situated
I wouldn't be in a legal situation
But I am pacing
I ain't racing for a deal
I'm patiently waiting for a mill
Gin that is
Spend a little Yen out in Japan
And bring some red monkey shit
Back for my fam
The family is doing well
Cop a little blow from Emanuel
Have your tongue number than that ambucell
Gurtin in the kitchen
Mixing and fixing that twerp mane
Now you understand
Why I fuck with the Byrdgang
What, they got me feeling like a virgin
Cause niggas ain't fucking with me
But I'm still ducking a narco
When In that black and charcoal
Eight-fifty riding through fox
Knocking DeMarco

Yeah
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme
And never catch them
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them (never let them)
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme

[Verse 2]
Do you have any Idea
How many faces I've smiled in
Hands I shaked to get a mad freestyle spin
So on my off days
I play and spin a bottle with that yayo
Just to cop the coupe the color of tomato
Tomato, Tomato
Now I promised for us all
But I came from the bottom like the Oz
Bottom line is I gotta grind
Just to sell that last line
So I sell out Colosseum's just to hear my last lines
Even in I gotta stay on my toes
Stay on my flows
Gotta stay ahead of my foes
The bezel is froze
The roof is exposed
The band is thorred
The pedal is floored
The seats are valor-ed
The metal is yours
But I'm bringing the prize home
Niggas grounded round me
Like a no flying zone
And we move like the presidents fleet
Before the cops catch me
I'll be dead in the streets
[Hook]
Yeah
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme
And never catch them
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them (never let them)
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme

[Verse 3]
Let me explain to you
I am so anal pause
I am so Fa-breeze
So Windex, so Popori
So bored I halved
Do you know what that means
My criminal background
So crystal clean
I've been saving a felony
For the day they try to play me
Like I'm light skin with long hair
Five a clock shadow for a beard
When it's my turn to pluck
These bitch niggas pull my car
I'll be talking to God
For give me father
For I have have sin
Dash and I kill
And I will never do it again
Cause that's the day
They put dirt on my record
And kick dirt on your
Motherfucking grave

[Hook]
Yeah
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy Kreme
And never catch them
Still hear the dirt on the record
They try put a little dirt on my record
I never let them (never let them)
Cause my shit crispy clean
I'm getting dough like Krispy KremeEmbed
