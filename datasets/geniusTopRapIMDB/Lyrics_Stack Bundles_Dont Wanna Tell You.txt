Donâ€™t Wanna Tell You Lyrics[Verse 1: Mike Millz]
I'm only 22 years of age
It feels like I'm goin' on 45 from all the tears and rage
Tryna to pray to get my mind right
But being that I can't write a rhyme, it got me feeling like I'm fading from the lime light
This writers block thing is a bitch
I'm like the rappin' Barry Bonds, they can't see me take a swing at a pitch
Labels want me to rap about money and jewels
That's kind of hard when I'm used to looking bummy and bruised
I can't even fill my tummy with food, so how the fuck I'm supposed to rap about luxuries or living the life?
I never had shit but a few homies and a bad bitch that kept me up to par when my gear was looking past tense
Been stabbed and back-stabbed, so I know how the knife feels
Results of most insolence, gave my body slight chills
Hooked up, S5, hope we get a nice deal
And even if I do, I'm gon' always remain Mike Millz
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Dawg, what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I been in the grind, and I stay in to it

[Verse 2]
I made a vow to the Roc
I'm on now, I'ma move units, like we moved vowels of the rock
It's a crowd at the block and everybody's praising him
Cause they know where I'm taking them
And if you fuckin' with Bundles, then they talking 'bout the boy
Trust me, they ain't talking 'bout the boy
I'm 'bout to fill a rap boy, rockstar
Gone both, hustler turned mogul, you can't stop me, I told you
Yo, this S5 shit is a movement
It's reality rap, I'm tired of being on the blocks with packs and bustin' my guns, and choppin' til my hands get numb
Money makes the world turn, so don't play with our funds
Whether you like it or not, man, "We gon' make it"
It don't pop off, then "We gon take it" back to the block, man and it ain't all good
And If I go platinum, I can still come to the hood

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Dawg, what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I been in the grind, and I stay in to it
You might also like[Verse 3]
It's been a lot time comin' and I came up from nothin'
Waking up broke and hungry, I ain't frontin'
And the odds of me shinin', it's called grind
And I cry in a song, shed tears when I rhyme
It's like yesterday, I was just sellin' to the fiends
And every nigga heard me rap, was sellin' me dreams
S5 is the team, and the beat's from Kanye
I get like Usher in the booth, and do it my way
Still in the struggle, tryna duck the law
Tryna calm down my nerves by puffin' raw
Got negative ways, but positive thoughts
Hope the judge don't remand when I'm goin' to court
It's reality rap, and I'm tellin' the truth
Can't get a job, the easiest one was Summer youth
And I guarantee it's goin' down, once bitch touch down, cause I know what to do, you better know what to do

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Dawg, what you gon' tell me?
How you gon' sell me?
You can't tell me the way to do it
'Cause I been in the grind, and I stay in to itEmbed
