From the Roc 2 Rochester Lyrics[Verse 1 - Stack Bundles]
You already know how I play
Real territorial
Shoot up the funeral
Piss on your memorial
Body something over them birds like Oreos
Black coupe white guts calling my Oreo
Yeah, from the Rock to Rochester
Fool went Woolwich hide to Windchester
There's no cuddle on the coke I move
Niggas tapping on their shit like they wearing dance shoes
Share a mans views I'm principle driven
If you broken freedom what's the reason for living
The fiends coming with shorts, but still ain't need hard
No credit, gassing for their EBT card
It's even exchange, I even my change
And crazy you can tell I hit the B in the range
I put a bullet in the same hole twice
They thought it was dope of their plans like that ain't you right
[Hook - Eto]
They speaking my name ti'll they pop a vain
Spill wax on my picture
I guess they don't feel that I'm a victor
A past to the bitter feed the dogs to cats in the litter
Seem like you rather chat with the chitter
Shit I've been doing that since the jitter
But not on my nose buckle
I hit em with the shot of my phone buckle
Get em my own hustle with no one eats
Nigga my prime soul runs deep
I ain't ready to go up creep

[Verse 2 - Eto]
Nigga handy to take her on
To take em out
Every some wanted all
No squelch will raise a brow
Get pinched a wait a while
And while awaiting trial
You talk about the waiting style and how to make it style
Talk about the broken shortcuts
Instead he got hung and cut short
I got it with the door shut
See the three strikes a wash drug
That's why I make it happen
Can't rely on rich chokes will fall up
Lost money itching the sands
While I'm at the glitter and glands
The fam gotta sit in the can
If I get the rapping sister(?) the brand
Then I'd be alive the players hitting the bench and
Hatters hitting the stands
What we die, what we living for
Stack put prices on hers
It's bidding war, get bread get in the door
I've been did it before
Just try do it bigger homes
Live, get a better home
Nigga I get it on
You might also like[Hook - Eto]
They speaking my name ti'll they pop a vain
Spill wax on my picture
I guess they don't feel that I'm a victor
A past to the bitter feed the dogs to cats in the litter
Seem like you rather chat with the chitter
Shit I've been doing that since the jitter
But not on my nose buckle
I hit em with the shot of my phone buckle
Get em my own hustle with no one eats
Nigga my prime soul runs deep
I ain't ready to go up creep

[Outro]
I ain't tryna go up creep either nigga
Yo E I'm about to come up top
It's been a cold winter down here
Come up there making snow we have a cold summer nigga
Them Riot Squad Boys in the building
From the Rock to Rochester
You know how the fuck we do it in the streets
Sq-sq-sq-squaaaad up, cheeee!Embed
