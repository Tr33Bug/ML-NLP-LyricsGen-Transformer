Fully Loaded Glock Lyrics[Intro]
Niggas loving the Riot movement
Bynoe, Cau, Chinx Drugz what up
Harlem what up
Southside what up
Nelly & Ashanti was *mm mm* kissing
I was bagging a thousand grams in my kitchen
Kimora was telling Baby I love you boo
I was stuffing them dimes shit you know how I do
Got a fully loaded Glock, I'm still on that block
I got, I got a fully loaded Glock
I got a fully loaded Glock, I'm still in Far-Rock
I got, I got a fully loaded Glock
[Verse]
Look
Motherfuckers want beef, ok the shit all good
I'm fresh of the tour but I'm back in the hood
Keep the hoop ride parked in the back of the hood
Hop out, shoot a nigga through the back of the hood
Stay the fuck out of nightclubs thinking you're tough
Don't believe me then ask dude that got his ass snuffed
Security won't do shit when niggas calling you bluff
I've done study some of this rap shit far to much
We catch him slipping we get him we gon keep that nigga
Scoobys was with me you lucky they ain't eat that nigga
A hollow was goody J's like was popping five
Jim mag is surviving the drought is still copping pies
This rap shit is a persoda I brought cars of crack
Reach your son ask he'll say he won't be like Stack
I'm an ounce from a robbery
Freestyle away from success
In other words my life is a mess
They don't know how to express the hate
You tryna get a rep, you gon get an expiration date
Everything that sparkles ain't diamonds
Everything that glitters ain't gold
Everything that's brought ain't meant to be sold
The coke price supposed to go up
He say he got it for cheap
Then they selling you that 40p blow up
I'm a grown as kid, I'm never gonna grow up
And I don't care if it's raining, the roof never gonna go up
I put in a garage
Bitches can't believe their eyes
I'm sort of like looking at a mirage
Arm out the window and showing of Geopard
Try get a quickie from Vickie hoping Nicki Minaj
You might also like[Outro]
When Ray J and Whitney was ugh, kissing
I was bagging a thousand grams in my kitchen
Ciara was telling Bow, I love you boo
She was just running games she told 50 that too
Got a fully loaded Glock, I'm still on that block
I got, I got a fully loaded Glock
I got a fully loaded Glock, I'm still in Far-Rock
I got, I got a fully loaded GlockEmbed
