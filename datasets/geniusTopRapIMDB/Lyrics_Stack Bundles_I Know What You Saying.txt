I Know What You Saying Lyrics[Intro]
Reeh, Reeh, Reeh, Reeh
I know what your saying
(I don't know If I give a fuck though but ehm)
I know what your saying
(Shit Bynoe and G$S)
I know what your saying
(They probably won't care either)
Look

[Verse 1]
The women are saying
Damn how fucking cute is he
And he smells like the new Issey Miyake
I am like Mami Benaki
We got a special thing like Madi Benari
She like he so sexy and rough at the same time
Always seem to mention me and Jim in the same line
Had she wouldn't mind having mimic the same time
Letting her ride is like the soul train line
They all want to play in my hair
While I pull on theirs and I beat them from the rear
She can't put out anything that I wear
Or wouldn't mind trick on a nigga like here
And nah I don't take that likely
I don't disrespect when a women likes me
Keeps me Icey
Sassy and feisty
Don't care about the title she don't want to be wifey


[Hook]
I know what your saying
I hear your whispers when you talk
Read your body language when you walk
I know what your saying
But love that's not nice
You damn right I caught that like rice
I know what your saying
I hear your whispers when you talk
Read your body language when you walk
I know what your saying
But dog that's not right
You damn right I caught that like rice

The hood is saying
This nigga really living his rhymes
Industry and the street the nigga stay on his grind
Old heads like these burning his bridges
Young nigga getting to big for his bridges
You know my response
Suck my disick

Get out of line
Take a hospital visit
Here is a small thing like a midget

The winter is always plaudem (?)
Haters want to see the deal a Honda Accord-em
But nowadays even the beam is making me itch
