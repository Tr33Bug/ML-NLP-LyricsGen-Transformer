Iâ€™ll Holla Lyrics[Intro: Stack Bundles]
I'm getting too much cash
I'll holla
I'm living way too fast
I'll holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time ain't now so love
I'll holla

[Verse 1: Stack Bundles]
Listen, the plan is clearer than Smirnoff
I'm tryna get these squares off
But groupie niggas keep talking my ears off
I tell them if it ain't about a dollar
I ain't got time to chat with you niggas, I'll holla
Gotta be about kitty when it comes to stack
No penny-pinching shit, better come with stacks
I done sold more trees than a lumberjack
I done had more HOOOs than Liono from the Thundercats
The younger cats love my raps
Identify with a trapper
Ballin and he dapper
No wifey, you could call him a bachelor
My broads got STDs, they'll clap ya
An actor, I'm far from doggy
I smell something fishy and its far from porgy
That's the scale, feds tryna get a collar
I ain't got time for jail so tell em I'll holla
[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
I'm getting too much cash
I'll holla
I'm living way too fast
I'll holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time ain't now so love
I'll holla
I, I, I, I'll holla
Ma, you got em open he looking like "I'll holla"
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma, please turn around and tell him that I'll holla

[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
Holla at your guala
The top don dada
Pop my collar
Don, when I leave ya follow
Homie, one way to see if I gotta
Taste test mine, don't waste that you gotta swallow
Nautica thermal, with my chains on, chain gang!
Tavernati my jeans, I do the damn thing
Without spring break, I show the world how
Baking soda and some water make girl gone wild
Crocodile or gator, either way they Maurie
Fuck 'em now or later, Bitches all adore me
Mister twice, son I'm bored with orgies
Kiss the girl and make 'em cry, young Georgie Porgie
Gorgeous gangster or whatever you call me
Take a picture, snapshot, record me
I'm spending till it ain't none left
Think I'm stopping don't hold your breath, I'll holla
You might also like[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
I'm getting too much cash
I'll holla
I'm living way too fast
I'll holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time ain't now so love
I'll holla
I, I, I, I'll holla
Ma, you got em open he looking like "I'll holla"
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma, please turn around and tell him that I'll holla

[Verse 3: Stack Bundles]
Hit the strip club blowin' thousands of dollars
End of the night I'm leaving with something like I'll holla
Try Prada, I'm Mr.Red Tag
Keep a bird by my side like Mr.Mcnabb
She like stack, "they don't do it like you do"
Skulls round my neck like I'm practicing voodoo
Black magic, a rabbit out the hat
Show you how to get a Carrera out the trap
These young boys don't spit it like Stack
They don't hustle, they just be around shit like a pack
It's the youngin with the cocky flow
And in the words of King Jaffe Joe: "I'll holla"
[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
I'm getting too much cash
I'll holla
I'm living way too fast
I'll holla
And yea a nigga tryna slow down but the time ain't now so love
I'll holla
I, I, I, I'll holla
Ma, you got em open he looking like "I'll holla"
You tryna dance
He keep tugging on your pants
Ma, please turn around and tell him that I'll holla1Embed
