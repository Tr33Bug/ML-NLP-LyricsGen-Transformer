Kiss of Death Freestyle Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-oh, Stack Bundles
Yeah
Valentino the Don
It's the two comma kid
Shout out to Figures and Far Rockaway, what up?
Love Dinero
'Bout to get ugly in here
The streets are talkin', volume four
That's right
Feed your lil' cock mouth, fuckers
I hear you bastards, I'm comin' for you
This Stack Bundles here, you ready for me?
I brought the Grits with me, yo
Let's go
[Verse]
S-T-A-C-K
Y'all faggot ass niggas can't see me
I cop goals by the dozen, ask BJ
I got whores and they cryin' all over me, soundin' like Freeway
Take a whiff, y'all can smell
And when I put it in the bag, it's gon' give your whole fuckin' block hell
I got bundles, where your dough at?
And the same place I piss from is where the whores gon' blow at
No matter rap or crack, I bubble like Moet
And it's no coincidence, I'm always where your ho at
While you be prickin' around, I'm gettin' around
Throw a cock in her mouth and dickin' her down
You shit in your hood, I shit on your town
I'm the best kept dog when I'm luggin' a pound
Get your chest wet, shit talkin', think the shit you poppin' smart?
I put more holes in you than shopping cart
The Grits post on the roof and clap niggas the snipe way
Slugs twist thugs and turn your jersey the right way
White gold, gotta be kidding, my dude like gray
You in the wrong division, I'm heavy, you dudes lightweight
Son, I cook the rock so hard, it make the pipe break
Fiends can't smoke it at once, you need a slight break
Rap niggas makin' you dance and put your hands up
I'm tryna make your paper advance...You might also likeEmbed
