Lost in the Rock Lyrics[Intro]
I'm just sitting here in the dark
I needed a little solitude

[Verse]
I seem to be lost in my own thoughts
Reality is chasing my dreams
My cries seem to be mistaken for screams
No trust in my eyes, can't believe the shit that I've seen
Follow my lead and end up in a place that's serene
Sirens ring in my ear
Night scenes, teens everywhere
Pipe screens, smell the fiends in the air
Light green when I stare
But I'm still hoping to hear the same shit I've been hoping for years
Sign right here
Montblanc John Hancock been ready
Thought it'd make my heart stop, feel my palms get sweaty
I've done this on the date of my birth
Felt so wrong, the shit made my emotions reverse
Had my heart beating fast as fuck, had to back shit up
Settle down for a while, thought I was acting up
Money'll make you a slave, love'll make you a fool
God paved the way, I'm never losing my cool
Understand I'm a man 'cause of circumstance
I was dealt this hand so I'm focused, fam
Ignorance is bliss, confidence is this that I am
I'm Attila the Hun, maybe a Genghis Khan
Black viking, I'm getting it on
My music has been right, you was listening wrong
Young nigga, try and take my plight
Punchlines is clever, but you niggas can't have my synclavier
And that's why I flow so better, you don't know no better
Never learned about money, won't own no cheddar
Bet I learned about money at the age of 13
In Vegas doing my thing
Exotic gators, me and my team
My oldhead had me at the by party with Jennifer Lopez
Spitting game like Gomez
Hair to twist, way before I had braids, I was trying to grow dreads
Bred by the thoroughbreds, it ain't hard to tell
Check my family tree, what you expect from me?
Papa got it in bricks, I'm a chip off the old block
And I'm lost in the RockYou might also like1Embed
