Money Ain’t A Thing Lyrics[Hook: Stack Bundles & [?]]
We in the rain screamin’ “money ain’t a thing”
Throw it in the air, let it rain
You should do the same if you got change
Everybody scream out “money ain’t a thing”
We gon’ sip [?] in the Maserati
Do it like the gotti;s, you know you can’t stop me
Sorta like a Don, money in my palm
Spend 100k on a link and a charm, nikka

[Verse 1: Stack Bundles]
Yeah, they been waitin’ for the dude’s arrival
Benz killin’ them, the doors suicidal
Your whore suicidal, she calls you to bribe you
She ashamed ;cause you can’t really do like I do
That’s ball like Michael, whores might like you
‘Cause you treat ‘em all like wife do
I treat ‘em all like Ike do, beat ‘em to the floor likeMike do
Might even bite you
Oh, we jumpin’ off in the penthouse
Mami gon’ stroll in, but she gon’ limp out
I pull a [?] out, lobster and shrimp out
No Xibit when my ride gets pimped out
I got my braclet, watch and my link out
Let me think, brought everything but the sink out
I know what ya’ll think about me, that i’m a straight motherfucking G

We in the rain screamin’ “money ain’t a thing”
Throw it in the air, let it rain
You should do the same if you got change
Everybody scream out “money ain’t a thing”
We gon’ sip [?] in the Maserati
Do it like the gotti;s, you know you can’t stop me
Sorta like a Don, money in my palm (mhm, yeah, Dirty Money)
Spend 100k on a link and a charm, nikka (Nicki Minaj, nigga)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Now when I tell ‘em I’m the best, i’m so very fresh (Uh-huh)
My flow super-duper, SD on my chest (Okay)
I rep Dirty Money, (Yeah!) I get that dough (Yeah sir)
When I get mad, mami get low (Uh-huh)
Spend a lil’ change, (Uh-huh) cop a lil’ range
Shawty with the braids he could give me brain
Got him like “yo, l-look at Nick’s stat”
No, lil’ mama, d-dat’s a big mac
That’s how I do, that’s just how I act
Never been a fake, that’s just what I lack
Got a lil’ whip for Christmas, lilac
You gon’ need lots of chips to buy that
Ask the nigga Ransom “who the fuck fuckin’ with me?”
Cuts in my jeans and a lil’ white tee
Now all these lil’ girls wanna be me, be me
That’s why they salute when they see me, see me
