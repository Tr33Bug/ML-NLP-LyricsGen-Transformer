My Grind Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ay yo, it ain't no need to talk
Just know when I squeeze, you won't have no knees to walk
I ain't never gon leave New York
I'm the opposite of Weight Watchers -- I'm getting diesel off
Move like I did time before
Got bread for the Feds -- who said you can't rob the law?
By all means, I'mma break the rules
Got cops on payroll, snitches on interludes
Move coke through inner tubes
I don't trust no bitch, so they cook mines in the nude
Make em strip like the Moulin Rouge
Four-fifth in the clip make the back of your medulla ooze, nigga
You's a fool, I use the tool
Leave you in a blood pool the size of hula hoops
So you better warn you crew stop playing with dude
The four-fifth'll cut em short like Daisy Dukes
[Hook]
Y'all know who it is; if not, you better find out
Be eager to die, show you what a nine 'bout
Fifty rocks bust into dimes what my grind 'bout
That's what my grind 'bout, that's what my grind 'bout

[Verse 2]
Compare me to smoking at the gas station
I'm about to blow -- you get it? I'm about the blow
Nah, dog, I ain't about to blow -- I been done that
Way back in a suede black Alfred Dunn hat
Your mouth, you run that, I gotta sit you down
Let a few rounds down where your lunch at
Clowns trying to come back
Dog, you ain't Mike
Even that dude can't get right
I'm not that dude, get that right
Stack clap two, ransack back room, get that white
Fiends wonder how I get that white
Cause I whips that right
Baking rain or gain or tool in each hand
Background, clap down you and your man
Nigga calling me Yosemite Sam
Two semis in hands
Mac spit, backflip, have you send me a fam
Understand, I'm the boy, yeah, great
Bringing the rock back like we balling yay

[Verse 3]
Y'all know who it is; if not, you better find out
Be eager to die, show you what a nine 'bout
Fifty rocks bust into dimes what my grind 'bout
Players trying to pause the game, need time out
Last quarter, got more head than tails
In the street, been in more blaze battles with shells
I don't need a team of Ghostbusters
All I need is a mean exhaust pipe on a muffler
Did I mention I started the rap tension?
Ain't no love, so bulletproof your henchmen
Gucci rain suit for the jewels that I'm drenched in
Fifth got a slick kick back like it's flinching
Slide the clip in, start to spitting
And I shoot clumsy -- bystanders be thinking I'm tripping
Used to ball in Chicag-izzy like Pippen
Wrists every bit of plat is, you know, given
Watch look like it's holding its breath
Won't be able to hold on when the bullets rip through your flesh
Motherfucker!Embed
