N**** U Food Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where I'm from, n****s ain't worried about the long arm of the law
They worried 'bout the long arm of the boy
'Cause I can send them at ya broad day, in the park with your boys
And have n****s run upon ya with toys
Now do you have any idea how many dogs I'm feedin'
So many fucking red flags, it looks like I'm bleedin'
But the Riot is the Gang I'm leadin'
That you motherfuckers best believe in
I flag green, but I'm cool with the boys in blue
You thinking cops but I'm talkin' 'bout Crips with choppers
Revolvers spin like propellors on helicopters
'Tell your OG fall back, I gotst this
You don't wanna piss me off
I got some folks from Milwaukee to stab you with pitchforks (blow it up)
N****s better pray to the lord, I make you call the shots you'll be at war with the law
[Chorus]
Look n**** u food
You don't let these n****s gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Run 'round here, thinkin' you bait, I have them blue flags drinkin' your milk
Look n**** u food
You don't let these bitches gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Make a phone call to my dudes, I have them damu's eating your food
Look n**** u food

[Verse 2]
Everybody, some n****s built for the sidewalk
You gon' fuck around and get your whole good side chalked
'Cause all it takes is the tip of a second
I'll have an inf pointed at your direction
Look n**** I check 'em
Get outta line and I get out a nine n****
Talking that stupid shit and get it blow out your mind n****
Come business, I'm handlin' mine n****
I ain't deaf, dumb, stupid or blind n****
It's all mapped out, we all strapped out
New block, new spot, all tall, cap out
This ain't an illusion, I'm literally movin'
So much 'you kiddin' me', you'd think I was Cuban
You don't know me, where the fuck have you been?
He ain't fed crazy, motherfucker I'm losing
And you so icy, play with my [?] man
I won't go out like Gucci Mane
You might also like[Chorus]
Look n**** u food
You don't let these n****s gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Run 'round here, thinkin' you bait, I have them blue flags drinkin' your milk
Look n**** u food
You don't let these bitches gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Make a phone call to my dudes, I have them damu's eating your food
Look n**** u food

[Verse 3]
N****s only respect only money and violence
Bad boys move in silence
[?]
Get a n**** head spinned, (Squad Up!) it won't cost me a red cent
Thirty five pounds'll take you a long way
Why you think the Riot Squad is as strong as it is today?
My n****s fresh from the yard
Been gone so long, they don't know how to use metro cards
My young n****s is worse, they got stripes to earn
Playing tags with the system, and it's Rikers time
And, they don't give a fuck about making a block hot
Mama gon' keep 'm right, no matter of they guap not
So how you gon' win with a n**** that's street tied
I was gettin' it in when you was rocking Fila's
[?]
They call it the color purple, I'm banging on both sides
[Chorus]
Look n**** u food
You don't let these n****s gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Run 'round here, thinkin' you bait, I have them blue flags drinkin' your milk
Look n**** u food
You don't let these bitches gas you fool, now you run around actin' a fool
Look n**** u food
Make a phone call to my dudes, I have them damu's eating your food
Look n**** u foodEmbed
