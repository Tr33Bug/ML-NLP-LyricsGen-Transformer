Streets Of Far Rock Lyrics[Intro]
Motherfuckers, we bust guns like we at war nigga
We Patriotic, we red, white and blue
Got red Bloods, blue Crips and white Cops
To patrol a motherfucker
We don't give a fuck
My nigga Stack Bundles
Come out here
Spray these motherfuckers

[Hook (2x)]
On the Streets of Far Rock
You can't trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
You ain't getting that guap
Then nigga you ain't nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
In the Streets of Far Rock

[Verse 1]
Where I'm from
First thing you learn is a gun
And how to empty a clip
You'll get ripped
You gonna need more
Stitches then a scene strip
While I'm stuck in the mayor
I'm fixing my fitting
I'm loathing the clip up and
Walk out with it, it's that simple
You can tell I don't play with cake
Without touching it, you can see the piece
About as heavy as a paper work
Getting raw far from work
Who just went up
Third came home don't even ask about bury
I'm boss amongst bosses
Harry put them all in your face
So it won't be a viewing for the coffins
If don't make me blush it's not an offer
And for the rush niggas like Jamal's he is a offer
Far Rock is a different planet come around here
With your chest poked out it's evident
You ain't learnt shit from Janet
Went behind the scene is where the access granted
Your eye seen the body
But your stomach couldn't stand it
You might also like
[Hook (2x)]
On the Streets of Far Rock
You can't trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
You ain't getting that guap
Then nigga you ain't nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
In the Streets of Far Rock



[Verse 2]
Look
Everybody play a thug
Until you run up on a nigga
For his carrots with a shotty like Elmer Fudd
Then they play a different tune
Niggas soften up
And start singing for the bitches like Loon
You ain't got to take my words for it's your
You don't know what St.Johns is nigga the 4th
Put them in intensive care
Fucked up how he was riding in a Bentley
Now he rolling in an expensive chair
You ain't really from the streets nigga
Then don't pretend to be
Range the terrible thing to waste
Ask the Kennedy's
Got an unforgettable face
They don't remember me
Young nigga that let his thing smoke like a chimney
Patience is a virtue, and I ain't got a PhD
So PH on SB and I'm a hurt you
I can't even beef with these bitches
They too commercial
And if you got hot when I signed
That mean I birthed you

[Hook (2x)]
On the Streets of Far Rock
You can't trust nobody
Niggas will run on up you
With a hammer screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
You ain't getting that guap
Then nigga you ain't nobody
From Redfern the Hammels niggas
Is banging screaming
Squaaaaaaad Up!
