Yaâ€™ll Niggas Is Trash (Ali Vegas diss) Lyrics[Intro]
If you ain't Riot Squad
You shouldn't say that
Screaming that Squaaad Up
And get you shot



[Verse]
When I met you with L Odom
You was a bitch
Got with that has been's offspring
Now both of ya'll on my dick well
It's to late fam
The young don's buzzing like Intercoms already
And ya'll niggas is trash
I am trying to understand
I guess your Nas and he's Jay
Or he's 50 and your A
Well that whole shit is gay
And not adding up
I am tired of doing the math
Ya'll niggas is trash
You's a disgrace to 40
Far from a hoodlum
My half shan a hoodlum
Come back to your hood
And finish what he started
And you came crying to me with your soft ass
Ya'll niggas is trash
And Fab got your little man bitter
So now he's Matolas new bitch
Like Mariah in glitter
And his boss a snitch, we ain't forget
We not letting it pass
Ya'll niggas is trash
You call yourself the pony
So watch how horse the game
Got my folks who got lost in it mane
You missed your generation
And I am leading this one
I am feasting while ya'll fast
Ya'll niggas is trash
Your not apart of my circle
So when I knock start the square
Not a chance niggas I'm still here
Saying my name on these tapes
Is only free promotion and getting me more ass
Ya'll niggas is trash

[Hook]
You niggas screaming Southside
But you're soft and won't ride
Don't matter what ya'll do
Clue ain't fucking with you
And seeing you with my mans
So don't bit to him and feed you
I know you mad
Ya'll niggas is trash
I am still repping the rock
The Riot we Squaaaad up
And no matter the block
We fucking the Squaaaad up
But I ain't in to the threats
I am still screaming city
You feeling gully then see me
