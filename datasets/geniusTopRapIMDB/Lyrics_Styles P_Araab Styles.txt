Araab Styles Lyrics
Yeah, Poobs
Tunnel vision on these niggas
Araab, this shit is crack, Duke salute
My eyes on the prize
You're now listening to AraabMUZIK

Phantom but not of the opera (Phantom)
Death of the doctor
Shotty or chopper?
Handgun or the hawk?
Yeah, Pinero is proper (I'm proper), certified
Hop up in the whip, you willin' to take the murder ride?
Rollin' with that Ecuadorians, Cubans, coke emporium (Hahaha)
Came up doin' G shit, real gangsta historian (I'm a gangsta)
On the real, my nigga, I never squeal and I never do no sucker shit
Go out on my shield (I go out)
Yeah, shoot my brains out, shoot my heart out
Catch me at the juice bar pourin' a little bark out
Catch me on the mic, just givin' a little spark out (What up?)
I'm electrified and you petrified (You're petrified)
You niggas buggin' me, spray a little pesticide
I take face shots, you could put the vest aside (Put it away)
No need for 'em bloody, you gon bleed for 'em (You gon' bleed for 'em)
You gon be the one to hold his dick when you pee for him (Yep)
'Cause he paralyzed, look at the barrel size (Look at it)
And I ain't buyin' that gangsta shit you advertise (I ain't buyin' it)
You a fixable problem
Kill him in Yonkers and dump the body in Harlem (Ooh)
I’m despicable with a hawk and revolver
Ask the shooter or a carver if The Ghost is the hardest (Ghost)
The answer's always yes (Always)
So you could fuck around 'cause it's always death, what up?
Yeah, should be a hook
I'ma just pop a little shit right here though
You niggas is nowhere near ready
I can't even figure me out
You're now listening to AraabMUZIK

Every rapper reppin' the set, I know they pussy though (Pussy)
Take my knife, stick it up in 'em like they a pussy hole (Hahaha)
Yeah, I been a boss, but then my cars all verbal
And a hoopty playin' verbal intercourse (Figure it out)
It's foul thoughts when I'm re'in' up
'Cause I don't mean the ball court when I say they D'in' up (They D'in' up)
I break the law, fuck the court of law
Penny never seen, with a dime or a quarter so (Never seen)
And I’d rather die before a dime or a quarter, y'all
But you could get killed for your motherfuckin' Audemar (Get killed, nigga)
But I ain't got time for time (Uh uh)
Dancin' in the shadows of the shadows, no time to shine (You do that)
I take the digis though, you don't get the picture, nigga
I'm Samsung, lil' nigga, you Vizio
I'm a better show (I'm a better show) and a better sound
You don't get the picture for the paper, spread the lead around (Pop)

Fuck everything Poobs
I ain't even wanna sign off, I'm just rappin'
