Blood, Sweat & Tears Lyrics
No longer wild, I watch the money pile
Funny ass niggas will act funny style
Funny how they want you slowed down when you running round
Be able to lift you up but they will gun you down
Plan is expand and travel throughout the land
Some scam, some blam, some niggas go hand in hand
Since the Dana Dane days is the times I was slinging haze
Got the picture but never the frame in the same day
Ain't a Blood but my man is, I bleed for him
Ain't a Crip but my man is, I C for him
Couple homies locked up I'm staying free for 'em
The youth need a old head I keep it G for 'em
I'm usually riding in the back seat
But if I drive i'ma play the lane to the max speed
Extraordinary gentleman, last league
Pardon self I mean last breed
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years

I could shed a tear, I could shred a beer (I could)
I could dance on a track like I'm Fred Astaire (ha!)
Reflect on the past and look forward to better years (forward)
Settle my affairs with whoever, I bought the metal here
On a mission looking for God, you brought the devil here
I don't like your energy homie it shouldn't settle here
Hot and I boil like the water in the kettle yeah
And I set the standard for bars that you could never near (never)
Full of grief, put you to sleep, I'd rather chief
Know my style and you give me some weed, give me a leaf
I would two piece and stab up the devil 'cause he a thief (facts)
Stealing the joy, stealing the peace
But that's another time and another rhyme (another time)
Feds got your phone tapped, I wouldn't say another crime (shh)
And that's my word nigga (my word)
I keep it G but I'm honoring my nerd nigga... Ghost dog
You might also like
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years

Ever lost part of your mind? That shit is painful (I have)
Used to sell dope to my folks, that shit is shameful
World is full of sinners so nobody could blame you
I am out enjoying the sun, that's what the rain do
I am out enjoying the rain, that's what the change do
I am ordained in the pains and the flames too (I'm ordained)
Don't you know that dog? (huh)
It's a Kodak moment when the feds come
And niggas take the low jack off (woo)
Love to see the bad guy get away (love it)
I'm a stoner so I never let the high get away
And my ghost got a ghost, it's a rival today (ghost)
And I found a new way, I've decided to pave
Out nigga...
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of yearsEmbed
