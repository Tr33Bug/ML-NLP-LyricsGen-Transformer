Bubble Up Lyrics
Whoa
Ghost
That's right, that shit movin'
D-Block
That shit movin'
Yes, it is
Yeah

Long time comin' out the gate (Had the golden key)
Whole squad waited for a plate (Now it's time to eat)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
Stay on your shit, you gon' bubble up (Bubble up)
When you on lit, you gon' double up (Double up)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
Stay on your shit and you gon' bubble up
We was all poor but we squad so we huddled up
If it ain't a bullet or the law it don't trouble us
High doin' dirt but I'm hopin' the Lord cover us
Uptown doin' it, downtown doin' it, out of state pursuin' it
A cop or a shot from a Glock might ruin it
All I think about is who I drink this King Louis with
My nigga's my main squeeze from the jungle
But it seems that money contain G's
Told the plug make the call whenever the plane leaves
Feel joy from the money whenever the pain leaves
But the pain never goes
Money's the root of evil, am I sane for the flow? Insane for the flow
But this the fast life and the lane never slows
Mary Jane for the dome
Ghost

Long time comin' out the gate (Had the golden key)
Whole squad waited for a plate (Now it's time to eat)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
Stay on your shit, you gon' bubble up (Bubble up)
When you on lit, you gon' double up (Double up)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
You might also like
When you on lit you gon' double up
Louis everything, two of everything, cuddled up
Got the work, blew up everything, now they fuck wit' us
Long climb but it seem fast like we shuttled up
Tuna in a can to that lobster, buttered up
Now I eat plants and I plan to plant some
Plannin' to stamp somethin' and niggas can't fuck it up
'Cause we ain't golden until we all shine
Can my Ghost live longer than one lifetime?
Four left turns, I'm in my right mind
Flyin' to Tiffany's from kickin' epiphanies
While I was hittin' trees and thinkin' of victories
Turned a nick to a dime and bought me a nick of weed
Made me a little rhyme, planted a little seed
Tomorrow's ghost night, today is ghost eve
So I told my ghost, "Go, flow, proceed"

Long time comin' out the gate (Had the golden key)
Whole squad waited for a plate (Now it's time to eat)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
Stay on your shit, you gon' bubble up (Bubble up)
When you on lit, you gon' double up (Double up)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)
Heard them niggas prayin' that we fall, nigga
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em
Rather peace, I don't wanna go to war with 'em
If I had to swear to God, I'd give it all to 'em
Know the feelin', my nigga, I've been poor with 'em
But they can't walk on me, I'm not a floor for 'em
Only God knows what He has in store for 'em
Lord doeth as He shall and that's all for 'em
Ghost, nigga1Embed
