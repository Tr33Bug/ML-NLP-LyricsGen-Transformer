Harsh Lyrics
You know, one day I got a call from the Ghost
Who told me I had to get on this conference call
To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay
Know a situation transpired
Where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly
Yeah

Root for the villain and shoot with no feelin'
Like Audio Two, yeah the crew is top billin'
Blowin' the Dutch in the coupe with no ceilin'
Invisible bully like The Gooch when I'm illin'
Cash too green, it's taped to the toilet
Like I'm Michael Corleone in the bathroom scene
Young black Vito, chopped and wrapped kilos
Clap torpedoes, stack Doritos
We in the Mexico sippin' the mojito
Discussin' perico, green weed and diesel
AK muzzle airholes you can see through
Ridin' the bulletproof five, yeah, I'm lethal
Yo, when niggas hear this shit, they say it's (Harsh)
Type of shit that make you wan' handle a nigga (Harsh)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (Harsh)
I'm like a Rothschild with money, that's why I'm (Harsh)
How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh) How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh)
How we handlin' em? (Harsh) How we manglin' 'em? (Harsh)
Stop bitchin', you the one who done caused me to act (Harsh)
It's that L.O.X shit right here
And if I'm itchin' and you front, it's my duty to act

Style is infectious, actress in a Lexus
Sunroof open, hashish for breakfast
Beef never settle, I'm Lyor to the ghetto (Huh)
Russell with the hustle, Rick Rubin with the metal
When I lick a shot, I'm aimin' at ya top floor (Woo)
Blocks like stocks, everybody bought more (Hah)
Birds fell out the sky, rats could drop dead
Flyin' through Bed-Stuy, white drop head
Sticky green twist, guillotine click (Huh)
Dapper Dan three-piece suit for the trip
Link with Dominicanos, straight to Sofrito
Three point range, hit free throws with kilos (Huh)

Yo, when niggas hear this shit, they say it's (Harsh)
Type of shit that make you wan' handle a nigga (Harsh)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (Harsh)
I'm like a Rothschild with money, that's why I'm (Harsh)
How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh) How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh)
How we handlin' em? (Harsh) How we manglin' 'em? (Harsh)
Stop bitchin', you the one who done caused me to act (Harsh)
And if I'm itchin' and you front, it's my duty to act
You might also like
Shine like brightening, sure but I'm the titan
Hard like when Cus D'Amato was trainin' Tyson
Gun, weed and 'gnac in the car but no license
Life on top of the city could touch lightning
Cocaine wave, dollar bill slave
Rangler's tough but the inside is suede
Ride with Louch and 'Kiss until I see a grave
One third of a legacy
Pedigree is I can make a don a don cause of integrity
Rap like a phenomenon, sleep for a better dream
Nine is for deadin' things, smoke for medicine
BIG is the only rapper I don't think that I'm better than

Yo, when niggas hear this shit, they say it's (Harsh)
Type of shit that make you wan' handle a nigga (Harsh)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (Harsh)
I'm like a Rothschild with money, that's why I'm (Harsh)
How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh) How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh)
How we handlin' em? (Harsh) How we manglin' 'em? (Harsh)
Stop bitchin', you the one who done caused me to act (Harsh)
And if I'm itchin' and you front, it's my duty to act

Yo, I rub stones together and cast a spell quick
Like a Zo hittin' voodoo blessings 'fore I move bricks
I beat you like the number eleven with two sticks
Money from the door then when I bop with two chicks (Come on)
It won't stop, never stop, there he go again
Together watch the coke and how the baking soda blend
Fredricka kinda pure, see how we make the fiends flock
And watch the line for the coca quickly wrap around the block
They say we bad for business cause the coke price dropped
How we flooded and we bubble white 'til it's white hot (What?)
Pot purchases we choppin' up to pieces
'Til only the shake is left, countin' the profit in Ibiza
Eight million dollar yacht, scotch, a little refer
Diamonds so big, they call it an obnoxious little creature
Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa
High the way I feel a cloud sittin' on my Caesar
Yo, when niggas hear this shit, they say it's (Harsh)
Type of shit that make you wan' handle a nigga (Harsh)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (Harsh)
I'm like a Rothschild with money, that's why I'm (Harsh)
How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh) How we dealin' with 'em? (Harsh)
How we handlin' em? (Harsh) How we manglin' 'em? (Harsh)
Stop bitchin', you the one who done caused me to act (Harsh)
And if I'm itchin' and you front, it's my duty to actEmbed
