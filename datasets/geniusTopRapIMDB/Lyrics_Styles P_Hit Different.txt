Hit Different Lyrics
Ayy
Space Ghost, you know?
Back at it as usual (Luxury Music)

I be getting high staying in high spirits
Ride of my life, but I'm watching the side mirrors
You gon' smell smoke, you pray to the sky near us
Ask God for forgiveness, you ever to divide with us
So far I've given you soul bars
Got a new frame, but I'm still seeing the old scars
New frame of thinkin', my nigga, know that I'm so charged
Five-star general, all the stars is gold stars
And I got all of my stripes
You could ask your boss about me, you could call him tonight
He don't know me, then his man do, that's what the plan do
And the whip moving fast, but it got the handle, yeah
Meaning I stay ready
And I came from the bottom, my nigga, I'm way pеtty
I got the trey-eight, you know that thе J ready
Wanna meet with the reaper? I'm getting a day ready, Ghost
Yeah, hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah
Hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah

Inhale the love, exhale the pain
No stress on the chest, more stress on the brain
Stress on the soul, but I know I'm ordained
Found my om, but believe me, I could move through Orleans
A nigga staying alive
Staying out the way, I upgraded the vibe
I subscribe to energy if it's all good
If it's bad, then I'm bouncin' out or pullin' out the .9
You say go figure, I figure you ain't going
If you ain't got dough when I was drinking malt liquor (I got that)
Just imagine when my act clean
Alkaline body, I'm never taking a vaccine
I reclaim my time like Maxine
'Cause I was in the waters with the crack fiends
I was in the mud with the dope fiends
Came from a gritty place, why you think I'm so clean?
You might also like
Yeah, hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah
Hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah

Workin', finna energize the money
To energize the wolf that ate the Energizer Bunny
You know how it feel if you been around the money
Or you could be 'sleep and you could be the sheep
To get skinned for his coat 'cause you thinking you the GOAT
You should smoke with me if you thinking you could float
Catch me overseas, nigga, waking from the boat
If I throw the Jet sign, I'm only saying to hang loose
I'ma need a plug in Hawaii, you know I slang fruit
Yeah, I say peace a lot, but know I bang, too
I been on the streets a lot, you know I'm gang, too
You could tell I'm alpha, my nigga, you see the fangs, too
I'ma pull this thing out and bang it like it was Beirut
I am like the beat of the streets, you know I stay looped
I'm probably pushing a gray coupe
Whole crew rolling up Js, but we ain't J.Crew
Yeah, hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah
Hit different
When I'm on the mic, you know that I spit different
If I got a enemy, know that I get with 'em
Dead presidents, I'm thinking to flips with 'em, yeah1Embed
