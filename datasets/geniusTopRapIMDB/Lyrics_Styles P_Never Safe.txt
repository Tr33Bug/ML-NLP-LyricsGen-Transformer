Never Safe Lyrics
Looking in the mirror, just telling myself to pray more
God ain't taking cash for them sins you got to pay for
Ghost here, but you don't need to the ouija to work
I blow the blunt, travel the smoke, leaving the earth
And I'm on an ill journey, you pussy then pull your panties up
Spit on Satan's face, tell the antichrist to ante up
Serpents in my sleep, bullets fully awake
I guess the angels got my back, or it could've been faith
Cuz my soul travel the earth, out in the space
Think of my niggas on the highway, out of the state
Touching weight, but a gym ain't around
If you're the king of the deadman, rarely do we give them a crown
Shit, I'm just trynna talk sense to ya
Said he's your homie, but I bet he won't pay the rent for ya
But he's chillin and gettin bent with ya
Sittin in the whip, just thinking of what I said to ya
Will he feed your seed if you need him to?
We all follow the path that greed lead us to
If you bleed for me, I'ma bleed for you
And be right there when you need me to
Other than that, let's go our separate ways
Cuz I'm in the jungle where the lions and all the leopards stay
Niggas let it spray like pepper spray
But everybody prays for a better day
I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe (x2)

Street niggas is lookin for a better contact
Rap niggas done signed up the devil's contract
Niggas'll leave their brother behind just to shine
Back then, you told him you'd give him your last dime
You and him would kick it, that's just a pastime
Now it's past times when you both would blast nines
All the money went where the hoes was
Your mind ain't designer like the clothes was
You a low down nigga, no love
No tears, no sweat, no blood
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe
Pound of the kush in the telly, trynna levitate
You a bitch nigga, don't make me demonstrate
I'm heavy where you're featherweight, every bullet'll penetrate
But fuck that, I'ma meditate
Blowin on this OG medicate

I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe (x2)You might also like4Embed
