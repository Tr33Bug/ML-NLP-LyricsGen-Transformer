Shadows Lyrics
I mean... Sometimes I see things, I guess cause I'm a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasn't there, but it was there...

They're as far as the eye can see
(as far as I can see though)
There are shadows haunting me
(I see shadows)
They're as far as the eye can see
(and I'm looking real far, even if I'm asleep)
There are shadows haunting me
(ain't that something?)

Something in the shadows
Maybe it's the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light, cause the vision's so narrow
Maybe it's the killa's in the cut, with the barrels
Getting high, but can't fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard, life's fragile, meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damien's, no Omen
I don't bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for 'em when it's dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say "at the least,"
If they coming, tell 'em come now
Sunset, sundown
I don't put my gun down
And I ain't tryna run, clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing there's something in the shadows

They're as far as the eye can see
(Point blank period, get high and hallucinate)
There are shadows haunting me
(Stress is building up)
They're as far as the eye can see
(I smell murder every time that the wind blows)
There are shadows haunting me
(I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling)
You might also like
Something in the shadows, maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that I'm deeper
I'll know soon, have faith in a goon
I broke date, mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun, on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier, time's the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier, unless you set your watch different
We got eyes, but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars, but the Glock kicking
I'm in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs it's a fair game
I get high, and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane


I won't rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him "wish me the best,"
If I dont get it this life, may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street nigga's say I did it the best, which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows, but I ain't got a clue though, (I got no clue)
I'm getting drunk off the booze
I'm getting high, just recording with 'Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head, but I can never make the noise stop, (can't stop, can it)
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see, know there's something in the shadows
