The Key Lyrics
It is the key to all the doors
(Vinny Idol)
It is the key to all the doors

Focusing when I wanna quit
Understand I was raised on some other shit
What's the pain to ya?
What's the name to ya?
What's shame to ya? What's the game and the fame to ya?
These is the questions that I ask myself
Like the haze and the hashy for help
Or Courvoisier straight
A parking lot full of thugs and parking there late
It is the key to all the doors

Make moves but take time like a chess piece
Before I start the car, four dimes to the chest piece
Windows ain't the only things tinted
Niggas is too, I been tryna blow but it might take me a minute
Shit, time is money though
I'm on the low, but my ghost acting funny though
He saying chill nigga, now you could build or you could kill, nigga?
That depend on your will, nigga
My reply, it's the thrill, nigga
I be seeking adventure
If I kill the starting 5 that'll weaken they bench up
Seek time in another frame
And I'm thirsty for knowledge
What it really mean my mind got a hunger pain
Could I shine when it come to rain?
And could it rain when I shine
Once in a while to keep me on a humble plane?

It is the key to all the doors
It is the key to all the doors
You might also like
Honor and respect
Llama in the bama check, the drama in a sec'
Think 'bout the days when we blew chocolate
Gin and tonic 'til the death
And niggas grew up fast and threw up cash
To get sneakers, cars and clothes, and who want blast?
And this is our life, we live this, nigga
Sound trife, but we did this, nigga
(It is the key to all the doors)
Just to breath out here is a motherfucking privilege, nigga

It is the key to all the doors

Maintain and persevere through the hard times
But is it hard if I ain't doing hard time?
Work your ear, hard rhymes through the God mind
Best on the street and I only do it part time
Flow is just the tip of the iceberg
Low when I'm spitting them nice words
Get dough when I'm hitting them right curbs
Live off of principle, nigga
Complex, but I try to keep it simple, my nigga
I got to work on my physical and mental, my nigga
Nowadays they bust shots at your temple, my nigga
I said the streets don't love you back
So I sleep with a eye open, hug my gat
I'ma ride for my man, I'm a thug like that
It's family first
It's going down I'ma blam you first
Step back, you see the man at work, you know
It is the key to all the doors
It is the key to all the doorsEmbed
