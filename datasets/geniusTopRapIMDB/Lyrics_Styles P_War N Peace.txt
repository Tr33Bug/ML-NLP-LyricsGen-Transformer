War N Peace Lyrics
A calm wolf is still a wolf
Never confuse peace
Can't wait to buck a hunnid shots at the enemies, ayy
It's like that

Shouldn't listen to the Ghost if you was never insane
Never the same once you learn to weather the pain
May you be never indicted, never arraigned
Can't appreciate the sun if it never would rain
Respected by the Crips and the Bloods with the old flags
Ridin' dirty, ratchet on her but no tags
Keep your foot on the gas or you gettin' a toe tag
Get a hole in your mask, you ain't able to draw fast
Ask God for a autograph knowin' he draw fast
But how I'm gon' get it when I'm on the warpath?
I would battle the sun and the moon for more cash
I could humble myself if I'm on the Lord's path
I'ma schizo, maybe I'm a psycho
Disciple of the night and all that is trifle
Ex-dope boy, did all that, was trifle
I'm about peace but still got my rifle
I'm about peace but I'm with these hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street
I'm about war but I'm with my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
I'm about peace but I'm with these hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the streets
I'm about war but I'm 'bout my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat

Thinkin' to myself, I shoulda took my time
Left the dope game for rap, shoulda took my lines
Get the city on my back, never took my spine
Off the stoop by seven, was a crook by nine
From the era where they screamed out, "Do that shit!"
Do that shit, you had coke, you moved that shit
Police chase, got work, yeah, you threw that shit
Now it's different, got weed, homie, grew that shit
Sold a watch, who you 'bout to drink Blued Out with?
Play Suge, get lined on some 2Pac shit
Two joints together, Queensbridge, oowop shit
Home invasion, nigga, I shoot niggas, Guwop shit
You could die or chill, yeah, nigga, two options
I'm Lew Alcin or Bruce Lee
But it's the Game of Death if you ever choose P
I'm about peace but I need a few feet

I'm about peace but I'm with these hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street
I'm about war but I'm with my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat
I'm about peace but I'm with these hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the streets
I'm about war but I'm 'bout my brother and his family concerned with how they live and how they eat

Wolf is still wolf and I ain't cryin' wolf, my nigga, so you know that the wolf is gon' eat
Loadin' up a hunnid shots, I ain't but a hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street
Lion's still a lion and I ain't even lyin', my nigga, so you know that a lion's gon' eat
