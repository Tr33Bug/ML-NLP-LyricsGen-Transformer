We Thugs (My Niggas) Lyrics
All for one, one for all

This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to 'em baby...

This for the cold D's that won't snitch

For the murderers that won't miss
For the hustlers that'll front bricks

For the hoodrats that want chips

For the stick-up kids creepin with they Pump's ripped

For lil' shorty with his rhyme books

Black girls going to school, carrying like 9 books

For the hood niggas...
That go to work because parole, but they tryin to be good niggas

For all the poor mothers...
Thats always goin through the struggle, still screamin' that the Lord "Love us"

For the ghetto life...
For having to hold your metal tight lookin for a better life
You might also like
For the family...
For if I'm rich you rich and that shit's a guarantee

For the best of life...
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas
Any time, any place, we don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you, my niggas
We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

Aiyyo, yo, I'mma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual

That's how you keep the love unconditional

That's why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do

I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail

And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale

But that how life is

And that how the gun and the knife is

It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya

When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper

Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me

Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me

Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and...

Let off

Thorough niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin...

And just wipe the sweat off


Fuck with P, the thug'll come out

The slug'll come out

You don't put in enough work, I got chu

No doubt

They don't want Sheek to wild

Betta cover ya child

With two guns out the sun-roof...

Swordfish style

Who that kid?
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag

You get it in a hurry

All up in your Burberry

Through your assisstant

Through your fucking secretary

All y'all do me a favor...

Walk with me

If you want money or drugs...

Talk with me

Know I got my niggas my guns

Now hawk with me

Guess who? Jada, P, and The Sheek

Three bricks

Three whips

Three motherfucking ouies a week

Ten spots OT

Two blew off leak

My niggas cop...

Pop and toss, and we applying the pressure

So when you address us...

It's Boss...

Boss...

And Boss
