Window To the Soul Lyrics
Vinny Idol, nigga
Idol
We the hit nigga all the way
Zone the fuck out

I get higher, go and leave earth
Before I do the verse, I, breathe in the weed first
A man with too many ones, never put his needs first (never)
Just a little boy if you ain't puttin' your seeds first (little boy)
Dance with the devil in a den (I dance)
I'm a soul of the earth, I can transform the wind
Niggas say they righteous but they trans for the gin (It's what they say)
When you let 'em in the cypher then the cancer begins
My man said he God body, I told him I'm God soul (I'm God soul)
On my mind, do a chariot come with a console?
Think it a paradise 'cause niggas is parasites
Vampire suck your blood right under the candle light
Back on my Ghost shit, my nigga was Phantom Knight
Got wiser off the bud but it wasn't from Anaheim
Get this blood money dirty, my hands is sanitized
Keep my eyes on the prize, not things that tantalize
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal

People'll text you prayer hands but won't say a prayer (pray for me)
Life is a bitch, unexpected to be fair (ha)
Play the hand you was dealt, if it's wack, keep the bet low (keep the bet low)
Wait for the next go
Calm, then it's Israeli arms dealers like Deathstroke
Strike like cobra (strike) or your life could be over if you let 'em shoot first (let 'em shoot first)
See my enemy, tell you what I let 'em do first (I'll tell you what I do)
The answer is get murdered 'cause I'm tryin' to get further (ha)
There's niggas who sell drugs but they won't flip a burger
Shit, I was there, too, nigga, I don't care to (I don't care)
Still crack the ground but now I move the air too (I make the air move)
Ride of my life but I ain't got spare room (ride)
No spare tire, the truth it's a rare lie (rare)
Yeah, my rhyme is a gunshot, niggas could hear fire
And I don't fuck around with niggas that wear wires (uh-uh)
It's the king of the slums, yeah it's David, you hear Sia

Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal

Hopin' God see the the Lord in me (God)
On the grind, only time move more than me (only time)
Only water could flow better
These niggas should know better but they don't act accordingly (uh-uh)
Used to push the Honda Accord before tours, scored raw
Moved work in the 'jects, the fourth floor (facts)
Now we advance through the light, we sold more (we sold more)
Gettin' money every day without breakin' the court's law
Ghost

Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal
Eyes are the window to the soul
Your soul is your house, you should keep it in control
I ain't die young and I ain't gettin' old
I'm just livin' in the present, yeah, that's my only goal1Embed
