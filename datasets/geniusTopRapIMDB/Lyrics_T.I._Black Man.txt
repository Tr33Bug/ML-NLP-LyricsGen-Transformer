Black Man Lyrics
Black man, drop top
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops
Is it because of my people? (Huh?)
Is it because of my sneakers? (Huh?)
Is it because of my jersey? (Huh?)
It is because that I'm perfect? (Yeah, ayy)

Ridin' down 85, three in the morning (Skrrt, skrrt; skrrt)
Why you pull me over sayin' you smell marijuana? (Smellin' the gas)
I said I got a ID, I got glaucoma (Yeah, I got ID)
He said, "We ain't in Cali nigga, get out, put your hands up" (Uh)
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (Shook the taser)
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (Shook the taser)
I told him can we split it, we gon' shake 'em (Split up)
Nigga hit my phone when you made it (Brrt)
Out of here, PJ to Jamaica (Out of here)
Nah, I ain't tell ya wrong, get the paper (Nah)
Been fightin' too long against haters (Fightin')
My attitude, yeah I'm going for the shaders (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Live from the cracks of the concrete (Concrete)
12 try to take a nigga off the street (Right off the street)
Make the gun sound off for Mike Brown (Mike Brown)
Take a nigga life when you face down (Face down)
Hoodie gang strong like Trayvon (Like Trayvon)
Gun by the window like Detroit Red (Yeah)
Bring that shit by the neck of my woods
And bet a nigga ass end up dead
Pig in a blanket, fuck was you thinkin'?
Free that nigga Boosie, runnin' at the police
Left him with a slow leak, right outside VC
Tryna keep a Phantom like DC
Hangout the G like free Meek (Yeah)
Kill a nigga reachin' for a cell phone (Cell phone)
Hurt to tell his mama he ain't comin' home
That's why I stay strapped all summer long
And you know it (Yeah)

Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops (Yeah)
Is it because of my people? (Huh?)
Is it because of my sneakers? (Huh?)
Is it because of my jersey? (Huh?)
It is because that you nervous? (Damn)
You might also like
Black man (Black man)
Running from the law like Pac-Man
Try and throw the RAW all in the trash can (Throw the RAW)
Got smoked by a cop on the dash cam (Nasty)
Mug shot on the news, he a mad man
When all he did was hustle to run the cash in
He feedin' kids in jail if he wasn't crackin' (No)
Too many felonies on my jacket
All of my brothers turn to assassins
We seen too many brothers get put in caskets
Too many young baby mothers and baby daddies
In the graveyard back then
I went from sittin' on clubs to the cashmere
You shoulda seen how I flossed on 'em last year
Two Maybachs and I had a bad year
Young nigga countin' money like a cashier
White man wanna pay me like I'm U-N-O (Lock me up)
Niggas wanna see me at my funeral (Lock me up)
Neither of my own homie wanna do me though (Lock me up)
Layin' on my dog crib like I'm Snoopy though (Not enough)
That's my nigga, I ain't even wanna do it though
If I don't do it, shit I know he gon' do me though
Cause he broke and he trippin' 'bout stupid hoes
But I'm a Don just like motherfuckin' Julio
Black man
Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops (Yeah)
Is it because of my people? (Huh?)
Is it because of my sneakers? (Huh?)
Is it because of my jersey? (Huh?)
It is because that I'm perfect?

Police see I got my hands up
Still wanna kill me, they don't understand us
They be lookin' for a reason just to shoot me
And wanna do me how they do us in the movies
Or how they do it out in Baton Rouge
Or Ferguson, or Florida, or Baltimore, they make excuses
Like I did cause I thought he had a pistol
Or I did it cause I thought he was a Muslim
My message to America, felon or death here
The liquor we die, we just substances left here
First you put us in a small hood
And then you beat us and you treat us like it's all good
And then shoot us and you screw us economically, mentally
Killin' nigga, no penalty, they can do that shit legally
Bet I can make that ass think 'fore you shoot
You kill me, man there gon' be more of some riotin' and lootin'
We say black lives matter, you say all lives
But y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied
Persecuted, executed, one day it gon' be time for retribution
Hope you don't ever see your son in an institution
I know karma is constant and God ain't no nonsense
You doin' wrong just to run shit
One day the time gon' run out for the dumb shit
Ain't no deception, tryna get in Heaven
You gettin' nailed, bet it's on your Mary
And you know what you did for who how much you really care
And what you really felt, he gon' deny the opportunity to unify
With people who look similar to you and I
Cause he don't wanna have a

Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops (Yeah)
Is it because of my people? (Huh?)
Is it because of my sneakers? (Huh?)
Is it because of my jersey? (Huh?)
It is because that you nervous?
Black man, drop top (Drop top)
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops
Is it because of my people?
Is it because of my sneakers?
Is it because of my jersey?
It is because that I'm perfect?12Embed
