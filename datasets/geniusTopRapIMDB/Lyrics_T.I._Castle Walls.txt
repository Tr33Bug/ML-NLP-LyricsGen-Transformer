Castle Walls Lyrics
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently, it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas, he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you
While it surely seem like King's life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favourite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope
So me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Shawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
That slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did you dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
You might also like
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world, it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls9Embed
