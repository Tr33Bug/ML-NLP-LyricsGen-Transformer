Live in the Sky Lyrics
What's happenin', man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that

(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heron, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that

(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?"
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked

(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

Hey man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man
I miss the shit out you, my nigga
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jay-Ru
Jamar Hendrix, what's happenin'?
Also my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga
P$C for life, and death
And my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy
That's real talk man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
Why can't we live in the sky?
