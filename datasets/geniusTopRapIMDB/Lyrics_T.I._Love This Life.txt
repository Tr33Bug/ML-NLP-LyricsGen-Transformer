Love This Life Lyrics
Hey, I know shit get kinda fucked up some times, you know
I know you can get carried away with yourself
But uh, why don't you be real with me
And be real with you at the same time?
You can't get what you get here nowhere else ma
Keep it real now

You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know
Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cos we got mills
Them other niggas barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle popping do it B.I.G
Come get with T.I.P and be balling til you D.I.E
Invisible set bracelets see clearly
Take away your stress, mean that sincerely
Problem solveâ€˜em, never mind that
Girlfriends see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, what the fuck's a prenup? You ain't gotta sign that
You nut up, take half, I'ma make it right back
I'm a motherfucking hustler to the heart, what's the
Sense in leaving me and be back fucking with them busters?
Bentley for your birthday, Goyard purse day
Filled with them stacks you know you gotta love that


Man of respect, on a big jet
With a big dick and a big check
I pop big shit I'm good as it gets
You leave me, where else you think you can get this?
Girl you can get another guy to beat that pussy for you
Them niggas cowards though and I'd take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry, all I need's for you and me to
Have some understanding, have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations, I take in considerations
I'm rough around the edges, don't bow with me and be patient
And you sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing
My heart is RSVP, I've extended an invitation
And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your position's divine, don't believe? Look around
I got a strong mind and a kind heart
With a soft kiss, but I love hard
You might also like

Don't you love this life like I love you?
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Birkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills
Vacationin' in Monaco, Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
A lifestyle so rare
You know you ain't going nowhere
