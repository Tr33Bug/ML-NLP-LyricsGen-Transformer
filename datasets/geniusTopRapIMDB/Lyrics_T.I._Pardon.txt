Pardon Lyrics
June, you're a genius
Hitmaka

Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to takе a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road ragе
Swervin' in an Aston Martin
Well, if I may speak freely, we gon' get a bag if we need it
Bust it down, flip it, repeat it
Suckas be greedy, we was never playin' in the game
If we was, before we lost, we cheated
Hold up, they ain't made a game you can play on me
I just be prayin' for these niggas that they prey on me
They got another thing comin', homie, they gon' see
I got the blessings of an angel every day on me
Okay, church, nigga used to ask me where I'm from
Tell 'em Bankhead, nigga, but the earth my turf
Work, wonder what's up under my shirt
Wonder why I ain't gettin' searched
Nigga, TIP been solid, speak against his name in the hood
And you will get slapped out 'bout it
Had straps out wildin', but moments in the past
Just made me who I am, that's why I don't run from it
Keep it one hunnid', anyone who don't like it, then fuck 'em
Get a little money then double, level
Came a way from sellin' weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin' with me in chinchilla
Road run, Rubber Band Man
Made a hundred mil' off of fifty grand man, well, goddamn
My suggestion is that you follow your dreams in this bitch
Put your heart in this shit, you bound to get rich, no cap
You might also like
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin

I just wore two million worth of jewelry to an interview
I got people askin' me, "What the fuck done got into you?"
I done put it all on the line, I knew that the rent was due
Hard to go and get it, no trippin', it wasn't no handouts
Corner store got hot, we start sellin' 'em out my man house
We ain't never have nothin', stay pullin' bands out
I been runnin' it up and I heard he ran out
Know these pussy niggas wishin' shit would fan out, it won't
"How you make the gun go on safety?" It don't
"You that young turnt nigga, Baby?" For shit, sure
Never in my feelings 'bout a broad, she can hit, bro
Red inside, Rolls truck, call it Big Boat
Heard a nigga say he want smoke
Switch out my clip on my pole, had to add a lil' more
I ain't really up for no arguin'
Nigga said he gon' do what? Bitch, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin

Shut up, sucka nigga, get up
Crazy in your head thinkin' you can get us hit up
Foreign, automotives all on my lawn
Yawn, did this so long, it's gettin' borin'
Tapped into the culture, made a motherfuckin' lifestyle
Shoutout to my niggas doin' trap music right now
And you know we ain't with the hype, million on the mic
Get to switchin' out a queen just 'cause she ain't what we like, ay
I'm a king, done my thing from the green to the white
When you finished with opinions, I got four or five classics
Say I ain't the shit, that nigga must be dippin' acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin', all I know is keep goin'
Start gettin' money, enjoyed it
Started sellin' crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia, that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin' my path, boy, the .40 cal start barkin'
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
I'm a vet at this shit, and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years, I been handlin' my business
Get in my bag, stackin' my pennies
Buyin' everything on the west side of the city
'Cause that's where all the niggas don't play about TIP
So what I care 'bout what you got to say about TIP?
Nigga, beg your pardon

Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin1Embed
