Peanut Butter Jelly Lyrics
We got London on the track

Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
I got money, check the store credit
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in palace, watch it happen
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

Run up that check, give a fuck bout that shit
I guess I go to jail if I want that lil bitch
They kept me with my strap on my own, that lil bitch
I don't answer no questions, want speak with my lawyer
Tell your boss I said where my phone call, that's it
A lot of nigga shit, talkin' you don't ever get paid
Remember me, I've been bout it, dealin' out the 10th grade
Ridin' round in my homeboy Buick
With a tool in the unit
We'd go to school, eat lunch
Cut school, get back to it, nigga
Listen nigga, this the Bankroll Mob
If you can't go hard then you can't come here
Let me make somethin' clear
If you lookin' for a sucker well it ain't none here
Look we got artillery for days, we can spray from here
Hit your ass on the side of the face somewhere
On the side of the road, let you lay somewhere
You might also like
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

Okay, big paper
If I'm hungry, I eat 100 dollars then shit paper
Sick flavor, got the white double mint twin
With me on Simpson, mint Wraither
Swag impeccable, peckin' a heck of them, cases federal
I'm a felon, don't throw it off, I need medical
Oh you regular, terrible, soft, and lame, etcetera
And I don't want one ho nigga, I wanna a plethora
Twenty bricks in the regal
Pullin' up, Ethel Ridge, extended heater
Death threat, I got this shit on
I'm untouchable man I got this shit on
Nigga you die soon as I say okay
My whip? That's strawberry Yoplait
I got a chopper on the charger
You put a little gas in it, that motherfucker blow about 4 days
Niggas broke
And I've been leanin' on Ac' all in this bitch
And I've been smokin' on gas all in this bitch
Pullin' up at the light no tag on my shit
AK hit everybody in the stomach, pussy nigga shit
Bag all day
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

I got the bread
Ya'll bitch'll give me the head
Fuck her on the sofa, not the bed
Hit that lil bitch from the back
And I take out with your pack
And I'm not givin' it back
I done lost all my respect
Don't drink no red, we pour Act
Sippin' on lean, it's so crazy
I ride out that second, I swear I don't know how to act, no

Keep it goin' Energizer bunny, I'm so-so with these carrots
My bitch the baddest, but she not your average
She so, so arrogant, woah
Her titties calcium, me booty calories
And both of 'em squish me, God damn we sandwiches
I do this shit for my momma
Take off with your pack and keep runnin'
I'm not the Birdman but I'm stunnin'
I flip that bitch like a omelet
I've been with ya from the start
I did that shit from my heart
I'm so so so sorry I hurt you
And I see the scar but you know I'm retarded
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
I got money, check the store credit
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in palace, watch it happen

I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

We got London on the track, on the track, on the track, on the track...32Embed
