Rubber Band Man Lyrics
(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubberband man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me Trouble Man, always in trouble, man!
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys all colors, man

Rubberband man, like a one-man band
Treat these niggas like the Apollo and I'm the Sandman
Tote a hundred grand, cannon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick? Well this is the wrong place, man
7-time felon, what I care about a case, man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate so say ya grace, man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back, I say it in his face
I'm a thoroughbred nigga, I don't fake and I don't hate
Check my resume, nigga, my record's impeccable
Anywhere in the A nigga how T.I.P. is highly respectable
And in the M.I.A. nigga, I'm tryna keep it professional
Cause all this tongue rustling finna have me snappin, I'm telling you
From the bottom of the Duval, Cakalacky to New York
And everybody showing me love, that's one to you all
Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas
My LA niggas
(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubber band man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man
(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubber band man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man

Call me trouble man, stayed in some trouble man
Some niggas still hating on shawty, but they some suckers, man!
Got a couple fans that love to do nothing other than
Lick, suck, show 'nuff respect, but still I love 'em, man
Dig it, little pimping got the mind and the muscle
Stay down on his grind, put the crown on the hustle
Ayy, I could show you how to juggle anything and make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store with no trouble
Young Cassius Clay of my day, Marvin Gaye of my time
Tryna stay alive, living how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me, "Take this shit a day at a time"
And told me Friday, died Sunday, Wednesday in the ground
I still smile, 'cause somehow, I know he seeing me now
And so I'm doing all my shows just like he in the crowd
Ay, throw your lighters up for my cousin Toot
Aaliyah, Left Eye, and Jam Master Jay

(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man
(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubber band man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man

Grand Hustle man, more hustles than Hustle Man
"But why the rubber band?" It representing the struggle man!
My folk gonna trap until they come up with another plan
Stack a couple grand to get theyself off they mama land
Gangsters who been serving since you was doing the running man
Went down, did 10, back 'round and rich again
That's why I'm young with the soul of an old man
I'm shell-shocked, get shot, slow your roll, man
Still ride around with the Glock on patrol, man
I ain't robbing, I'm just looking for that dro, man
For my niggas slanging blow, pimping hoes
Rollin' vogues, 24s, let these other niggas know

(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubber band man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man
(Ay, who I'm is?) Rubber band man, wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
(Ay, who I'm is?) Call me trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man9Embed
