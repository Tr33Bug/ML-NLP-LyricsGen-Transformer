That’s All She Wrote Lyrics
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (Yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' life, they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat, and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned (Bah)
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at nigga wishin' they were this hot (Haha)
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
You might also like
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed–wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't buy a soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (That's it!)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (Nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (Bitch), but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Peso, euro, yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish—sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So, I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it, double timin' it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say "K-Mart's" like there's an apostrophe "s" on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg!

And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as they king, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote84Embed
