What You Know Lyrics

Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?

Ayy, don't you know I got kis by the three
When I chirp, shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that? What you know about that?
What you know about that? Hey, I know all about that
Loaded .44 on the low, where the cheese at?
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that? What you know about that?
What you know about that? Hey, I know all about that
See me in your city, sitting pretty, know I'm shining dog (Ayy, ayy)
Riding with a couple Latin broads and a China doll (Ayy!)
And you know how we ball (Ayy!), riding in shiny cars (Ayy!)
Walk in designer malls (Ayy!), buy everything we saw
You know about me, dog (Okay), don't talk about me, dog (Okay)
And if you doubt me, dog (Okay), you better out me, dog (Ohh!)
I'm throwed off slightly, bruh, don't wanna fight me, bruh (Ohh!)
I'm fast as lightning, bruh (Ohh!)
You better use your Nikes, bruh (Geah!)
Know you don't like me 'cause (G-G-Geah!)
Your bitch most likely does (G-G-Geah!)
She see me on them dubs (G-G-Geah!)
In front of every club (What?)
I be on dro, I'm buzzed (Nigga, what?)
Gave every ho a hug (Ayy, nigga, what?)
Niggas don't show me mugs (Ayy, nigga, what?)
'Cause you don't know me, cuz

Ayy, don't you know I got kis by the three
When I chirp, shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that? What you know about that?
What you know about that? Hey, I know all about that
Loaded .44 on the low, where the cheese at?
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that? What you know about that?
(Ayy, what they know about this shit here, man?)
What you know about that? Hey, I know all about that

Candy on the six-four, leather guts, fishbowl (Ayy, ayy)
Fifty on a pinky ring just to make my fist glow (Ayy!)
Young bitches get low (Ayy!) because I get dough (Ayy!)
So what I'm rich, ho? (Ayy!) I still will pull a kick-door
What you talking shit for and gotta run and get folks?
Got you all yelling, I thought you'd pull out a gun and hit four
But you's a scary dude, believed by very few (Okay!)
Just keep it very cool (Okay!) or we will bury you (Ohh!)
See, all that attitude? (Ohh!) Unnecessary, dude (Ohh!)
You never carry tools, not even square, he cube (What?)
You got these people fooled (Nigga, what?)
Who see me on the tube (Ayy, nigga, what?)
Whatever, try the crew (Ayy, nigga what?)
They'll see you on the news

Ayy, don't you know I got kis by the three (Ayy, ayy)
When I chirp, shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at (Ayy, ask 'em)
What you know about that? (Ayy, ask 'em)
What you know about that? (Ayy, ask 'em)
What you know about that? (Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, I know all about that (hey, hey)
Loaded .44 on the low, where the cheese at? (Geah, geah)
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects
Where the G's at (Ayy, ayy, westside, nigga!)
What you know about that? (Ayy, ask 'em)
What you know about that? (Ayy, ask 'em)
What you know about that? (I'm talking to you, homie!)
Hey, I know all about that (Ayy!)
Fresh off the jet to the block
Burning rubber with the top popped (Ayy, ayy)
My partners busting shots
I tell 'em, "Stop, it make the block hot" (Ayy!)
Your label got got (Ayy!) 'cause you are not hot (Ayy!)
I got the top spot (Ayy!), and it will not stop (Ayy, ayy)
Hey, video or not, Doc, we'll bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe
And take it to the chop shop (Ohh!)
Partner, we not y'all (Ohh!), if it may pop off
I'll answer the question (Ohh!)
"Will I get your block knocked off?" (Geah!)
This what it is, bruh (G-G-Geah!)
Look, I will kill, bruh (G-G-Geah!)
I'm in your hood (G-G-Geah!)
If you a gangsta, what you hid for?
Somebody better get bruh 'fore he get sent for
Say you wanna squash it (Ayy, nigga, what?)
What you still talking shit for?

Don't you know I got kis by the three
When I chirp, shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at

Loaded .44 on the low, where the cheese at?
Fresh off the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that? What you know about that?
What you know about that? Hey, I know all about that25Embed
