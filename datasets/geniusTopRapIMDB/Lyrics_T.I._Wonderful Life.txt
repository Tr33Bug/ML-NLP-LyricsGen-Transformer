Wonderful Life Lyrics
1, 2, 3 - ooh yea
Ooh oh-oh...
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is
Hey TIP, lemme holla at ya...
Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter’s eyes
Kickin' it with your sons, trippin', never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn’t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison, TIP? It could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin', you been trippin' ever since I died
Appreciate you missin' me but G, you still alive
I’m lookin' down at you, and sendin' smiles to you
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you?
Told you she would get you, that’s good cuz shawty ride with you
Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he’s spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful, and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg, your life is good to you
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is
Sit down, son...
And listen to me son, and pay attention to me
Seems like I’m the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I ain’t get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it’s painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too
I’m proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn’t much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me, even as a father
Taking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don’t let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it’s a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it’s over with forget it

Damn...
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you (f'real)
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
The hood, today they lost, can tell they don't know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can’t rest and I can’t do shit off my mind, I’m so upset
It wasn’t your time to beat me there, broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, familiy's never forgiving me
I know, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known, owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up
Til we meet in person let’s keep speaking through my verses for life


This is your song...Embed
