Colors of You Lyrics
Been around the world many times
Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
(The space between love and me
Between...)

How you expect to have an ordinary relationship with such an
Extraordinary nigga, yeah there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half-stripper, half-glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book coming to life when I'm
Flipping through the pictures, switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin', now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and up against the cupboard till we...
(Look like turquoise) Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day) Knocking it out without a doubt
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book, look, new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book, look, new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines

(Color of you)
My self expression acquire every color in the spectrum
My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the color, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase, go off the grid for a
Few days, go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity
In a world of respect and I'm trading it like it's currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds, we'll take you higher like you
Smoking the loud while I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears, you can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea
You might also like
(Colors of you)
You don't look like turquoise
You don't look like gold
You don't look like purple
That'll match your hue
'Eyo the world is my coloring book, look, new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines
(Colors of you) Ay, ay
'Eyo the world is my coloring book, look, new discoveries
Every time when I color outside the lines, hey
(Colors of you)
