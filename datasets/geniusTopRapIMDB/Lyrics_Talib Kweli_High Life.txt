High Life Lyrics
This the high life
Call it my life

This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a grudge submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker
Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t one quote and the hate just integrates
You might also like
They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
"Love will fix it" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty’s gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit
The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I’m debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life

High life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I’m living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause I’m living the high life, high life2Embed
