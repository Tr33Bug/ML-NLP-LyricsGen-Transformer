It Only Gets Better LyricsHands in the air (4X)
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 1:Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spit  at you, spit it great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because
(Hook:  Marsha Ambrosius)
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 1: Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta
Trust in God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I’m finding meals, I’m signing deals
I’m the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are

Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 2:  Marsha Ambrosius)
Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I’m hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids up at the school
Life it’s hard, yeah, that’s true
This is what I have to do
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)
Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God what's real I’m spitting
Call 'em Christ by name but he still ain’t rising
Set to my lane but still ain’t listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Memories live, man, and my memories stay alive..
