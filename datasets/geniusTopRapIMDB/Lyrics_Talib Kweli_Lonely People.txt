Lonely People Lyrics
All the lonely people
Yeah, I like to go out to clubs (Hey, hey)
Where do they all come from?
Las Palmas, you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight (Hey, hey)
All the lonely people
Opium down in Miami (Yeah-ah, yeah-ah)
Where do they all belong?
But when I walk in, I look around, and I think
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Hey-yeah-yeah
I look at all the lonely people (Ooh)

Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And he wanna be forgiven
How I know? 'Cause I'm right there wit him, yo, yo
You might also like
All the lonely people (Yeah-ah-ah)
Where do they all come from? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (Ohh-ohh-I)

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Oh, I look at all

Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' "Holla back" and "Nigga what"
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
'Cause it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people' camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin' for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you went into a room, the heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely
That's why you need disguises, well, probably
All the lonely people (Ooh, people)
Where do they all come from? (Yeah-ah-ah-yeah-ah-ah)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (Ohh-ohh-ohh)

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people, ohh
I look at all the lonely people
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I look at all the lonely people, ohh-ooh
Ohh, ohh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where do they come from?
All the lonely people

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

I look at all the lonely peopleEmbed
