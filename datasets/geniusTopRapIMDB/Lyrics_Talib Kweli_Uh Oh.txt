Uh Oh Lyrics
That is great, good for you
Okay get out of the way though
Thank you, excuse me, excuse me

Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, y’know you heard of that
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You know the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know you heard of that
Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don’t get your grey matter punched up
Til you're hunched, tucked, talking like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like, look at her rap skills
E-book in the backpack, the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac, you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep, then learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, use it for burning cardio
Don’t use it with burners, they’ll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder, fuck it, murder
Make it four, insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl, infernal glow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this, the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy’s a {Black Star}, rap star
Jean a rock star, minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft, lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really y’all should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness, say
You might also like
Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, y’know you heard of that
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You know the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know you heard of that

I’m a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan, you never see him coming cause you're faith blind
The mainline, Bloods is waving flags like K’Naan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine
They know they’ll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines, I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I’m spitting game I’m adding on
Rappers going hard, the G.O.A.T., I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivating, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
Growing daily, your chick goin' crazy, yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
We’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog, there ain’t no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I’m a big fan, you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn, it’s the pinnacle, gets no better
I’m boasting, but still stay humble
Never cynical, I’m posting
Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, y’know you heard of that
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You know the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know you heard of that2Embed
