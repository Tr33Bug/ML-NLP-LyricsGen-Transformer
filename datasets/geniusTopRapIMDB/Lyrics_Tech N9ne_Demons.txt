Demons Lyrics
I'm an angel/demon, man
You know what I'm sayin', what makes me a demon is lust a girl crazy and that's why I couldn't keep my wife
You know what I'm sayin', and that's the lust demon livin' within me
And, uh, but my heart love big, you know what I'm sayin', so
I know a lot of demons come to my shows, as well as angels
You know what I'm sayin', a lot of demons

When I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

Yo, it make me wanna drink a lot, go up in the pink with naught
This the reason I ain't at ease and currently on the brink of pop
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon' come break in
It is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friends
It is the reason I bang, it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the 'caine
The reason I'm super-soaking in the pain, and starting to love it
It's wanting to give me way more of it, they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people I'm disgusted
I'm talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me wanna have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up out of people making me mad, mane
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade, with a slight rage
I was Ice Age, another reason Tecca N9na won't have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness, voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march, they making me start sparking other targets
Woke up today I was steaming, 'cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon
You might also like
When I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon

There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

(Three 6 Mafia!)
See there's a demon inside of me, and I'm thinking it's that dope
It's got me doing shit a nigga never even had done befo'
It got me kicking in the door of folks I don't even know
Straight wilding, nine-eleven times a fucking thousand
Buck like public housing, my Glock is so arousing
Make you stand atten-hut the way that bitch be shouting
Something like a scary movie, nigga but I'm scarier
Bury ya, Memphis Ten Black Haven area
Buck nigga, get buck bitch, get with me
And I'mma show you how this Triple 6 will get silly
Psycho, like no other individual
Glock with the red beam to keep you in my visual
Three 6 and Tech N9na wet you like an Aquafina
Desert Eagle, .50 Cal', tell me have you seen her
Pussy juice, still on my shit from this ho I just raped
In her fucking husband's place, shot him in his fucking face
When I was one, and-a two, and-a three, and-a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon

There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)
There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? (Hell no!)
Can I kill it? (Hell no!) Can I kill it? (Hell no!)

Looking like a fool, like something ain't right
That Ecstacy pill will make you feel it
Look at a bitch, girl you gon' get it

All geeked up, wash it down with a beer
Dig it to myself, nigga it's your year

And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon
