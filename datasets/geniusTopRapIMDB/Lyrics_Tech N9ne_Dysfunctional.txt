Dysfunctional Lyrics
First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me, I wanna get dollars, don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way 'cause back in the day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might
Dude's tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, 'cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish, surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded when exploded you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Women be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but canâ€™t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push me, play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoodie
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, 'cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad25Embed
