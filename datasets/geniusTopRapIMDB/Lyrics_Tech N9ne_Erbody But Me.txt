Erbody But Me Lyrics
Okay

Walk right up in the room like fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
Lookin' like it's all good but fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And I really wish a nigga would say fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And you could be just like me say fuck er'body
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Finna go up
Er'body but me say fuck er'body
Okay
K-C-M-O
Born and raised if you ain't get the memo
Slippin' in my city is a N-O
We put down a demo, then go stuffing them hoes in a limo
'Cause they said they serving more jaw then Jay Leno
What they seein' walk through the doors, winners
Haters muggin' us because they hoes, grinners
Sinners better simmer when thinking they want to chin us better remember it ain't nothing but rogue, in us
Steppin' out with Tech N9na, yes sir, weather remains, wetter she came
Next thing you know, mayne, that girl want everything, everything
When it's playing she saying this my shit
That's why they be waiting in line to kiss my grip
Offer true paid dues, I'm not selfish
But you may lose, if I could help it
Step into this Piru made grove wearing the opposite of blue suede shoes, Elvis

Walk right up in the room like fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
Lookin' like it's all good but fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And I really wish a nigga would say fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And you could be just like me say fuck er'body
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Finna go up
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Bout to go up
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Finna go up
Er'body but me
Say fuck er'body
Okay
You might also like
We drinkin'
Why you wonder why your woman winkin'
Trip with us you're headed for extinction
We just bringing brinks in
To buy the bar get everybody drinkin'
People looking salty must be smokin' Jesse Pinkman
Er'body, but me
Lookin' broke and, dusty
That's how your lady look at me, that's why she wanna, cuff me
I'm gonna shine never, rusty
Every year I come back with another one they never gonna, hush me
She wanna get close to touch a strange jam
She say you don't remember me 'cause I just became slim
Ah ye-ye-ye-ye-ye
That's right I know you from, um so and so what's her name 'nem?
They know Tech N9na is always coming hotter than, hell's pit
And I'm steady drinking like I'm a, Celtic
Why they trippin' with me? 'Cause now I'm dipping with she
And I'm gonna give her what she need, pelvis

Walk right up in the room like fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
Lookin' like it's all good but fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And I really wish a nigga would say fuck er'body but me (er'body but me)
And you could be just like me say fuck er'body
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Finna go up
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Bout to go up
Er'body but me
Er'body but me
Finna go up
Er'body but me
Say fuck er'body
