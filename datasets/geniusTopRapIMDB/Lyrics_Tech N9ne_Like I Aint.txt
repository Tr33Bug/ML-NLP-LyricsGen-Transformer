Like I Ainâ€™t Lyrics
Ayy, like I ain't on 1, 2, 3-Pac
Like I ain't finna bust when my homeboy make the fuckin' beat drop
Bustin' a cap in the wack when I'm rappin'
You really need to trust in the fact that I'm back and I'm slappin'
The industry for ducking the cat when he rap with a passion
When I'm in this piece, I crush in a fashion
Like I ain't never ate in this game (Chuh)
Like I ain't never seen or had me some big thangs
Like I ain't been around the world and with so many different girls
And kinky parties that it could lift the spirit of Rick James (Jesus)
Like I ain't a fixture and never knew Twista
And never did music for the Alpha Dog picture
Like I never script the pledge in the scripture
Or had a hit song 'bout my own liquor mixture
Do it like I wasn't a starter that was on the Carter (Weezy)
Wasn't in art of my cousin, the Water (Fizzy)
Nothing was bartered, we're bussin' and touchin' the heart of
People that's lovin' the hardest stuff ain't no charted (Pleasies, chuh)
Like I never got signed (Woah)
Not a one, not a two but three times (Chuh)
Like I never did get the cheddar or see shine
Like it's sleep time for peeps' minds on T9
Like, if these rhymes (What?) really never ever happened (Chuh)
'Til right now, like pow, I got it crackin'
With the pen and pad, without no back end
Tryna stack and get action
And pull the cash in is the way that I'm rappin'
Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the 'Zou
Like I, like I ain't

Toured with the Jay Rock, with the homie K-Dot
Like I ain't never had the allure for the pay slots
Stressin', like I didn't step in the session with the Seven
Never guessin' the effin' cure is to spray thoughts (Brrt)
Like I never had a shot (Pow)
Or a song with the white guy Dre got (Woo)
Like I didn't have L.A. locked
Never went on the set of Ballers with Mr. Baywatch (USO)
Like I didn't meet Trav yet, like I never had assets
Bad with the pen, but never cashed checks
Rappin' like I ain't even close to havin' the bag yet (No)
Like I'm tryna be the best up in this hip-hop (Chuh)
And do a track with the king of Atlanta, T.I.P.-top (Chuh)
Then turn around and go switch it up, and do big rock
Tryna ride all the way up to my homie in Slipknot (Maggot, chuh)
Like I never heard fans yell it
Not The Calm, not The Worst, even Anghellic (Word)
Before they told me that I can't sell it
Before I went to the reunion of fam', Nelly
Like I didn't have this new watch (Chuh)
And it never would tic and never do toc (Chuh)
Like I'm rapping myself into learnin' brew hops
Rappin' like I ain't never did a record with 2Pac

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the Zou
Like I, like I ain't

Skippin' my job, yeah (Yeah), like this is a process
Try'na get from the projects, so I spit like I got next (Woo)
And I trip if you object (Yeah), like I'm itchin' to fly. Tech
Whipping in kitchens with Pyrex (Woo), to the mission that God set (Yes!)
For me, rippin' these quick and will not rest
Like no flippin', Techn9cian is obsessed (Chuh)
Like I didn't know when I was droppin' (Chuh)
Independent music, I wasn't toppin' (Chuh)
And all the bad bitches wasn't jockin'
I rap like I didn't know I'd do a record with Hopsin (Chuh)
They call me Tecca N9na, I'ma shoot this
If you're dissin', you really don't wanna do this
Niggas wanna try me, then you're gonna lose it
I rap like I never did a record with Joyner Lucas (Hungry)
Like I never knew maestros
Like I didn't know Trae was a asshole
Like I didn't have a stash full of cash flow
Rappin' like I am back in the past with my afro
Like I never ever knew Strange
Would put the name Tech N9ne in my shoe strings (Chuh)
Like I didn't know I was spittin' the butane
And I grew fame with the homie Bobby and 2 Chainz
Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold (Yeah)
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the Zou
Like I, like I ain't
