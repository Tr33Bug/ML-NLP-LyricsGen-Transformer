No Reason (The Mosh Pit Song) Lyrics
We are legion
This Tecca Nina in yo' arena
We saw no reason

Yeah, start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit
I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma fuck somebody up (Fuck 'em up)
You gon' need someone to hold you up
What the fuck

My city, stand up
Stoppin' people that got animosity and what
Copying me and the property, poppy, ya jammed up
We're akhis that can bust, don't mock me, the brand's us
Strange Music, the gang shoot this right at the fakers
That came stupid with the claim
You'll get took for your change and name usage
Steppin' to me, link with Atlanta, you losin' definitely
Ready for ruckus, really we reppin' the B (ah, ah)
This the eviction notice, missile him quick then go get
Hitters, consider me and my niggas be sick and roguish
Stop, you ain't ready to brawl, you can't hang
Lock hit you dead in the jaw, you claim Strange
It ain't K, tell Kan City to jam with me
You damn sissy, eat up the object that stands stiffly in my pants with me
Never honor who bringing drama to the Don, if you continue
Not gonna do what I common do, guess what I'ma do
You might also like
Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit
(Let's get to it)

I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one (The wrong one, no)
Times like this I don't know how to have fun (I don't know)
I think I'ma fuck somebody up, fuck 'em up (Gunna)
You gon' need someone to hold you up (Hold you up, huh?)
What the fuck

Look, it's only one option (White), you gon' need a doctor
I ain't talkin' 'bout the one from Compton
Arms, feet, legs all gone like I'm Don Corleone
Hiring James Bond, that's what I'm on
Remain calm but aware that I'm armed and dangerous
See double X's and know that the gang with us
So hang tight, I'm trying to get this right
You think 'cause I wrote a pop hit that I won't pop shit?
The fuck's wrong with you Pop-Tarts?
I pop cherries and popstars, you popsicles is not hard
Popped in on the top charts out the cop car
To remind y'all you just rap, you're not Gods
And I don't care who got bars
Because they don't acknowledge mine, so show me who got scars
Show me the greatest on the stage and the arena
Bet they point they finger up at the Gunner and Tecca N9na
I just think you fuckin' with the wrong one
Times like this I don't know how to have fun
I think I'ma fuck somebody up
You gon' need someone to hold you up
What the fuck

She will not leave a bunch of passes
I just wanna see that ass, yeah
Caribou Lou in my glass, yeah
I start a riot by accident
Somebody's bitch showin' ass again
I should start throwin' some cash again
Pushing the crowd, we harassin' them
If you start makin' me mad, I

Start shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, our shit
For no reason, the hardest
For no reason, start shit
For no reason, mob shit
For no reason, mosh pit
For no reason, mosh pit

We are legion
