On the Bible Lyrics
Niggas in Mizzou ain't changed
Make ya have to let loose thangs
Have you ever seen a MAC-11?
New TEC-9 with the extension
HK, AK-47
Mayday, man down, call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
I felt like they tone said "I'm comin' to get ya"
Well, that's when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily 'cause of your past, you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hands take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune, I'ma get to torchin', like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the N9ne
That's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So I'ma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with Tech, get the rifles
Totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho, you can do this, if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses, never give you the deuces
Nigga, this is Su'Wu biz, ahh!
Let me calm my nerves, I'ma simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated 'cause of a song ya heard from the N9na
I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb
I'm on the verge, no life beyond the surge
When I bomb, ya served, what does one deserve?
But a head stompin', now put ya teeth on the curb, nigga!?
Have you ever seen a MAC-11?
New TEC-9 with the extension
HK, AK-47
Mayday, man down, call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings

Ayy, fuck all that goin' back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem, what he really wanna do?
If you know like I know, then you know, true
And niggas make songs but they really don't do
What they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
He afraid, I'll lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe you ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I'll kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns? Shot 'em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low, all my niggas headed for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF?
That's your business nigga, none of mine
I know Young Gotti 'bout what he rap 'bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just 'cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like disco, then a nigga went and showed me
Guess what I'm tryna say is, nigga, I don't know you
And futhermore, pussy nigga, I don't want to
Have you ever seen a MAC-11?
New TEC-9 with the extension
HK, AK-47
Mayday, man down, call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings

Haahahahahaha!
Man, we just killed a small village man
You know what I'm sayin'?
This hip-hop, aha! Love this shit30Embed
