Slow to Me Lyrics
"Dumb it down. No gun-it sound."
If I took that advice, it wouldn't be nice, I'd be plummet-bound
So I'm 'bout to clown like Kinko—distinct flow
That'll shrink yo' remains of yo' pee-brain people if you think slow
(Hit the staccato flow)
Listen and follow me, this how it ought to be
Audibly, quality, call it the K.O.D it be modesty, but if Sickology's
Hot as me, spit no apology
(Keep going)
Flipping bidiness, it is not a free policy
If I spit it then it gotta be dollars, we
Up and get it I be fucking livid if you keep Donnie's economy
(Double time)
Not too many wanted me to spit it with the syllables
A nigga that be critical, the pinnacle and givin' that original
A killa with the trigga flow and really wanna get the billion in it low
(Play the bongo)
If you don't wanna speed it up, I'm gonna eat it up
Everybody see I'm formidable
I'm coming to heat it up, I gotta beat it up
When I get the booty, she comin' to get it from a real negro
Beyond bomb, the women need pom-poms
When I get to rippin' they want to get little Don Don
To give up the John John before we get to sippin' the Chandon
Free my nigga Ron Ron, for real
Back to the nigga with the fast flow, havin' the cash though
'Cause if anybody, got it, I'm on the mash fo'
And I bet I'm gonna beat 'em 'cause they ass slow, yep
But they never get it 'til you spit it slow
KC niggas did this flow in '94
But they say they understand me when I chop my lyrics though
Nigga, this ain't choppin', I'm a show you how we chop 'n' go!
(Ready, go!)

All I wanna do is get the bitches thinkin' I can really do the cunnilingus and I'm gonna bring it
I can do whatever they want, I'm really good with the tongue
I tell 'em—"That's slow to me." (Yeah)
So when I do the flippin', don't be lookin' at me stupid, I'mma kill it, I'mma nuke it
I'mma step up the poppin', I got the rappin' to cap it up
I'mma say—"That's a motherfuckin' flow to me."
(Come on)
All I wanna do is get the bitches thinkin' I can really do the cunnilingus and I'm gonna bring it

(Come on)
(Ah-huh!)

Time's up (Time's up), when the clock is tickin'
GODS is spittin' flow, do you got to listen? No, no
With your hinds up (Hinds up), do I got to kick it? Well, no
But you mind'll visit, knee to elbow, 'cause your rhyme designed us to find this, just live with it
(How you know?)
We was choppin' like this when we first got it poppin' and people was dissin' it (And people was dissin' it)
Now you got the masses formed full from our passion, your asses they kissin' it (They kissing yo' ass)
It ain't in vogue to indulge, you let yo' pen spill the info (Yup)
And I've been told that I've been cold since they invented Nintendo
(Give 'em a lil' bit)
Well I hit it to make them sit down, bitches, they wanna get down, give me a little mid-dle
(More)
Gotta be quicker than that, slicker than that, and she like the way you lick her, put your dick on the map
(Pull it out)
I'm with the nigga with the chin like a billy goat, tellin' me syllables, edible, I got eat 'em like a vegetable
And be the next, yes, best to blow, hopefully next for the checks to flow (Oh!)
X and Os to the bozos from ghettos that get hoes and get over 'em, and dancin' kiddos
Bless the souls of the spittin'-written middlemen, tryna get the vittles from they demos that they peddlin'
If you get it, you got it right, interview, write it right, maybe you'll take a flight
Overseas, it seems so exquisite, hoes, they love it when the tongue roll, yup
You might also like
But they never get it 'til you spit it slow

What, you can't understand me?
Goddamn, I can spit this too bad
I guess I gotta give 'em a news flash
Dude, you dupe-ass dude rap-duelers are douchebags
'Cause every rapper that's on the radio sound the same
And it's troublin' me, I be like, "Who's that?"
Then they came to abuse trap music and you wack!
Like they on the same level as me and can't see the huge gap
Between us, I'm too fast, my lyrics just flew past
I'm a thousand kilometers up ahead of the others
Shit I'm writing so over your head that it hovers
And this is for anybody that ever said fuck us
Let me slow it up a little bit and maybe they'll love it
These rappers these days be like
"If I could rap like this I might get radio play! (Get radio play!)"
But just 'cause you sound like you crackin' with autotune, that shit don't make it okay!
Fuck that! Stealing creativity—don't give it a go
Tryna kill like Bus-a-Bus, then I'll gimme some more
Tongue flick fast like Raven-Symoné, make her lick on the lady pussy, makin' her moan, maybe I'm wrong
To me your bars ain't hard and your song too slow
You will never get to have this charm logo
Goddamn, we a three-man band
Tech gave 'em the bongos, I give 'em a guitar solo like
Youuu tryna pretend that I ain't
Better than 98 percent of these emcees but any minute I annihilate
In a heartbeat sooo, many will sleep when I wake
Fuck a magazine, the shit that you write, your internet site
'Cause all the shitty records you post up, I hate
'Cause that shit sound slow to me
Yeah
Hahahaha, Strange Music, baby!
Truly elite shit! Hahahaha!
I mean, if you can't keep up
I don't know what to tell you, it's slow to me
Haha, and if it's too fast for you
Chop and screw that shit, or something11Embed
