Unfair Lyrics
And the road gets harder with flow spits
'Cause we represent that Kansas city, MO shit
Double doses, Tech Kalikosis
But ran into a duo that's ferocious
Some of the best two, kill you, no rescue
They say that you gotta spit hot 16's before you step through
And they say everybody, nigga, even Tech do
Now we gotta explain our journey to the Ces Cru

I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme Mecca, because I'm Tecca
And this mind left ya down at the bottom because N9ne's better
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess; bind yessir, sever decay 'em, I'ma define pressure
I'ma spit it for bidig roars and not a critic whore!
Hit ignore, I got acidic core! Thidis war, you're nada when it pours!
Wanna pla-ay every da-ay, sta-ay for the wa-ay that I spra-ay
Sa-ay? You got the pa-ay? That's ya-ay or na-ay?
Bumblebee tuna, grrr
Don't be smelling like it if you're under me, rumors
Will begin about you from hung-r-y pooner's!
Hopin', wishin', prayin' when you're gone it'd be sooner!
When I'm dead I'ma get up in the head of the nigga that set it up pickin' the lead up, then I wet 'em up look like a predator
I'ma dead 'em and let it puss, skip the peace it ain't no humble we Luna
Moon stricken, rednecks sayin' "Who them coons rippin'"
(Boom!) Pick 'em off
Take 'em off to my land in my van a lotta room, getting in in
When I catch my flow try to wake up your style
But you fucked up like, "Uh-oh, I'ma make up for it now"
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair

Who are these dudes? We never lettin' in any fools, you know the rules
Kristopher, egotistical, narcissistic wit' cha!
If they sit on my throne then we tell 'em to get up and move and make us some room
I heard of these guys, murderous when it comes to scripture
Ubiquitous and Godemis, they Gods to us, we Gods to them
So we meet right in the middle, chewed the fat and fried up a little
And it's unfair, we got their hands in the air
And you can’t even get a show
No one cares that your freestyle so rare
But don't nobody can't nobody know
And it's easy for them physical favors
Why y'all just spend all your paper
Breezes bend over the table, tattoo symbols of my label
Driving and trafficking rhymes, tongues sharp as African knives
We what's happenin' to your wives while you're at nine to fives
You might as well stop rappin'
'Cause it's not happening if I stop laughin'
'Cause it's too hard to impress us, just blatant disregard
The Four Horsemen of course we forced to be coarse when
You talkin' taller when y'all getting the short end!
You might also like
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair

It's unfair to me, nothing is what it appears to be
Killin' off any and everything
Comin' and threatening somethin' that's dear to me
If'n you feelin' the fear then flee
Fi fo fee fum, what a fuck up!
I'm retarded with a clover, I guess you can call it dumb luck
When I'm rappin', out of habit I'm adamant gettin' adam
But I would rather, hit a madam with a Magnum and split her atoms
Tryna fathom the famine that will diminish the anger
Got a place set at the table, we eating spinach with Strangers
Sippin' Caribou Lou
Spilling the sickest shit ever I tell 'em but who woulda knew it?
I’m one of two in the crew, with a knife in my pocket and one in my shoe
Surrounded by haters so what I'ma do?
Thinkin' I gotta devise a game plan
Get a ticket to kick it with Krizz and N9na
So I guessin' I’m headed to Strangeland!
And my main man, woulda told me to murk 'em
Doin' the sin indeed, I'ma catch a couple more
Then I’m formin' a human centipede
Pause, I'm aware that they hatin', look it, they gotta diss
Who the fuck is fuckin' with Tech, Kali, Ubi and Godemis?
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity
Beware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody— of this clarity
We bare that we share, swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nare, any spared caring is bare-ly there
It's unfair

It's unfair to be, doin' motherfuckin' charity
You can pay a fuckin' fare for me
Or really there ain't nothin' there for me, move carefully
I swear that we, fly as a parakeet, high as a Cherokee
In my rhyme I spoke like Jeremy feel my fire, my smoke, my kerosene
We-we-we don’t want no drama, we-we don’t want no trouble
We-we can keep it peaceful if y-y'all can keep it humble
I-I really don’t know what he come fo'
But his name is the same as a gun yo
Strangeland is a place that I seen in a dream
Since I was runnin' 'round in my Umbro
And you heard it direct from my mouthpiece
Tech scouted me out, then found me
Turn out we the perfect strangers, Larry Appleton and Balki
I was out east, when the text came in
With Tech sayin' what is 'bout to be
Before you fuck me on the dough, know that everybody 'round here lookin' out for me
Now that we got that in the air, I can feel the change in the atmosphere
My crew been living in limbo, apparently all this rappin' has trapped us here
And after years they hearin' we lost inside the dream not necessarily
I won’t let this rap thing bury me, I'ma let these bat wings carry me
