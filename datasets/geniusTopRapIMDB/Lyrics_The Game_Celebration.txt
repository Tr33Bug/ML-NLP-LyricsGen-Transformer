Celebration Lyrics[Produced by SAP]

[Intro: Tyga & Lil Wayne]
Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside
Young Mula, baby!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
[Verse 1: The Game]
Nigga blowin' on that ayo, breakin’ down them trees
I’m out the door with that dro and them keys
Scoopin' up Chris and I’m hittin' the freeway
Yeah, got a whole zip of that purp'
Got a couple hoes home with no clothes on
Get they roll on, let's twerk
Now we hotboxin' that Ghost, Ace all in that door
Ray Bans in my face, never know when my eyes low
Smoke good, fuck good, eat good, steakhouse
She said Backwoods, kill swishers, you eat, take out
Yeah, but I love fuckin' them redbones
She country thick and that hair long
That pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong
Her momma tall so her legs long
She went to college and got her masters
Now she bringin' that bread home, roll up

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Put the purp' in the blunt
Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
Put the purp' in the blunt, yeah
Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, yeah
We having a celebration, love to stay high, woah, oh
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, oh

Yeah, it’s a celebration, all on the pole, they doin' the dance
Anticipatin', I’m feelin' your body
Hopin' that you would just give me a chance
Goddamn, babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and yo ass up and I'm the one that's tippin' the most
Tonight, on the Westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best fuckin night of your life
No lie, no lie
Me and you together, girl, I’m celebratin' you tonight

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uh, yeah, I’m blown, no cigarillo, 'rillo
Love when I'm mellow, get on my level, 101 karats in my bezel
I’m on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble
Soon as I ask shawty her number, fasho
Yeah, I get it, then I'm gone, then I hit it like bone, bone
Now you fuckin' up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait when daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothin' on
I’m talkin' no th-thong, thong, thong (Haha)
Yeah, she throwin' that ass back
Hard as a bat, sit on my lap
Fuckin' with me, ain't nothin' better than that
That’s a fact, that's a fact?
Don’t act Hollywood 'cause I don’t act
'Bout my business but I don’t slack
This my celebration rap, so
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, yeah
We having a celebration, love to stay high

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch, I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I’m goin' at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches 'cause they takin' pay cuts
Man, somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns, no registration
Yeah, now gon' light that weed up
I’m Trukfit tee’d up, hoes down, B's up, Tunechi
[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa, Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt, yeah, haha (Young Moolah, baby!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, yeah
We having a celebration, love to stay high, woah, oh
We having a celebration, love to stay high, woo, hoo
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, oh33Embed
