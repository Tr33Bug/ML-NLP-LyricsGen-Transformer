I Donâ€™t Like (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: The Game & Chris Brown]
Stepped off of that G6
Hit the club on that G shit
You see the belt, that's a G, bitch
And I'm 'bout to kill Chief Keef shit
Just killed my nigga Meek shit
Then I killed my nigga French shit
Got a French bitch, no friendship
And she givin' my dick a French kiss (Yeah)
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Arm hangin' out the window
Of that black Ghost with them chrome pipes
Tell them niggas it's gon' be a long night
Bitches wanna chill, we gon' need some more ice (Ayy)
Shout out to John Wall, man, that nigga nice (Ayy)
Club leanin', nigga, we gon' need some more Sprite
Real nigga in these Ray-Bans
Fuck the judge, we don't take stands
Tape Feds, we don't shake hands
Put a gap in your mouth, Strahan (Ayy)
Hundred racks in these cargos
Push the button, these cars go (Ayy)
Six cradle that 'Lago
Six spades, black card ho
Got homies out in Chicago
With that full clip on that bullshit
Dang nigga, that's Rozay
Movin' packs on 'em in MJs (Ayy)
I got a thick bitch with a thin waist
Got a condo where somethin' slim stay (Ayy)
Got a Rolex Presidente
Got black diamonds, Kunta Kinte
Hot boy like Turk and them
Hot wheels, we swervin' them
Next year we gettin' Deron Williams
Gon' do LeBron like Dirk and them (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A fuck nigga that's that shit I don't like
They throwin' bottles, I'm throwin' models
Just 'cause I give a bitch long pipe
Doin' shows on the soccer field, that's dome right
I be singin', he be singin' so it's on sight
But hol' up, I ain't give a nigga no green light
This head up, my bread up
One on one, what you scared, bruh?
Huh, matter fact take care, bruh, you a pussy nigga
My nigga Tunechi, yeah, that nigga nice
Shout out to Nicki, man, that ass tight
Them eyebrows, man, them shits is yikes
OVO you overdose
Screamin' YOLO, no I live twice
Hahahaha, sorry, hahahaYou might also like8Embed
