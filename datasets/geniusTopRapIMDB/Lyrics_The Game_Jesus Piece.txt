Jesus Piece Lyrics[Verse 1: The Game]
Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that Bimmer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip-hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain
[Chorus: The Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)

[Verse 2: The Game]
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)

[Verse 3: Common]
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for our sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light
Can't deny my Jesus piece thatâ€™s so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A convo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow
[Chorus: The Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)14Embed
