Just Another Day Lyrics[Produced by Dr. Dre & Ron "Neff-U" Feemster]
[Intro]
It's motherfuckin' Game time!

[Verse: Game]
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it? That's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, "Bitch pass the safe! Compton"
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker
Compton! They killin' in this motherfucker
They grillin' in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker
No chains, no rings, this my home
Nigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin' like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin' on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it
[Outro: Asia Bryant]
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watchin', but I don't know why
Feel the fire burnin', it touches the sky
Feel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by
'Cause it's just another day in ComptonYou might also like20Embed
