Oh I Lyrics[Intro]
Bongo by the way

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh, my
You keep that to yourself
Oh, my
You don't trust no one else
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
Met her backstage at a Tiller show
She said I got a reputation, I'm that nigga though
She tryna play hard to get, but I'ma get it though
She say she ain't that type of girl, she sendin' pictures though
She get naked on the Snap 'cause it disappear
I seen that pussy for a sec' and I say, "Bring it here"
See the way that I'ma fuck you, you ain't ever did
I'ma fuck you everywhere and baby I ain't ever scared
Are you prepared to sit in the club with thugs?
I'm hopin' you there 'cause all that we got is trust
You got friends, they don't fuck with me like that
So in return, I don't fuck with 'em right back
I could have fucked one, I could have fucked two
But I'm only fuckin' you, what you goin' through?
Now you mad, textin' in all caps
Like I just didn't put my kids on your back
[Chorus: Jeremih & Sevyn Streeter]
Oh, my
You keep that to yourself
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh, I
You don't trust no one else
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm so gone off your love, I'm so gone
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (aw yeah)
I'm so gone off your love and you know
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (I'm so gone)
I got drunk off your love and throwed up (bleh)
Pour my heart inside your double cup
Out the park when the first batter up
I got scars from her nails when we fuck (let's go, ayy)
I wanna see your boobs, throwin' you some Jerry beads
Black diamonds in your chain, you a Merry kid
Chrome Heart clear lenses when you lurkin'
Eighty thousand dollar bag, you a Birkin
Workin', 800 in a bag, you ain't worth it
Heard you dropped out of school, was you workin'? (She workin')
No climax from your man? He ain't worth it
Hundred racks on purses, she's mine
You might also like[Chorus: Jeremih & Sevyn Streeter]
Oh, my
You keep that to yourself
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh, my
You don't want no one else
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Hell yes
Her body talkin' to a nigga, say less
I'm fuckin' up her weave, need a hair net
I'ma put your body on bed rest
Late nights, took her out to Maestro's
She can get the lobster for the backstroke
You know how to love it when I ask though
Make a nigga feel good that it's the last stroke

[Chorus: Jeremih & Sevyn Streeter]
Oh, my
You keep that to yourself
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh, my
You don't want no one else
The way you do it, baby
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
