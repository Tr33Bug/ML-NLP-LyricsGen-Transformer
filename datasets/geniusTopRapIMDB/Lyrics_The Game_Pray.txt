Pray Lyrics[Verse 1: The Game]
She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medell√≠n
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, "Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent"
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her?
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
[Interlude: The Game & JMSN]
(When I wake up every day) Even though she doubted me
(I thank the Lord that we are safe) Even though she doubted me
(Again, yeah) Even though she doubted me
That's why you should pray for me
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids
Girl, you can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me, gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'
So let's

[Chorus: The Game & J. Cole]
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Bow your head
(Pray) Cole

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Good girl at heart, I remember you well, I remember you well
Got a husband and kid, but I flirt
Hope you do a little dirt cause I'm diggin' you still
That's real, but nah, you don't text back
And deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back, year go by, I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back
Damn, well what changed then?
She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what?
You ain't been home lately, you ain't heard that nigga?
Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo, she burned that nigga
(She burned that nigga) Say what? She burned that nigga
(She burned that nigga) Say what? She burned that nigga
Dawg, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid
All cause a bitch burned that nigga
Now dawg, that's real ass shit
That's word around the ville ass shit
Did you strap up? Did you the strap up?
Please tell me that you strapped up nigga
We could kill that bitch if you want to
I'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules
Damn, while I'm sittin' here blessed
She at the crib all alone and she stressed, so nigga I

Amen, ooh
