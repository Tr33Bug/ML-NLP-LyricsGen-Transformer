Red Nation Lyrics[Verse 1: The Game]
Throw your muthafucking Cincinnati hats in the sky, nigga don’t ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max ’95's
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches 'til the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Nah forget it, Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judas’ eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”
She chose Doc, first day I pulled dude a side
Like it's Aftermath for life and all I do is ride
Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it’s Red Nation
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found
Blood, I’m a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin’ blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Verse 2: The Game]
Niggas’ll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole
Live and die for this shit, word to 2Pac Shakur’s halo
One blood, plural, nigga I’m spending Euros
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I’m up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin’ stupid
Get thrown in the backwoods, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous, pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas, nigga we rollin’ cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I’m Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That’s my Chi-lingo, yeah I’m bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga, Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found
Blood, I’m a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin’ blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Verse 3: The Game]
Russia got a red flag, US got red stripes
Last train to Paris, round the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era, test me
Louisville slugger, Yogi Berra in my new era
Got that natty on, tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin’ with a .38 Magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin’
On a hill like Lauren her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at? Roll up the weed son
So many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I’m out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got in some red bottoms
And all these hatin’ ass niggas want me dead
Cause I’m Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, Red
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found
Blood, I’m a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin’ blood in the air, leave blood on the ground26Embed
