Ryda Lyrics[Verse 1: The Game]
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da
Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da-da
Keep the pistol on the side-ide-ide
In the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la
She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek
'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep
Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
I always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard
You know I parade on the side of you, baby
Yeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang
[Verse 3: The Game]
Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine
Bricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game
40 in the sti-dash, fuck around and be roadkill
With the top down feelin like

[Chorus: The Game & Dej Loaf]
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida

[Verse 4: Dej Loaf]
No whip now we in the Wraith, road rage
Keep it gangsta pricy, one of them cold things
Wit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya
Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em

[Verse 5: The Game]
Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off, but I don't need it, tell me what I need

[Verse 6: Dej Loaf]
You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drop ass for you
Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah
Eat the pussy like la-la-laaaa

Why you gotta tell a nigga bid'ness?
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you til the helicopter come

[Chorus: The Game & Dej Loaf]
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida

[Verse 8: The Game & (Dej Loaf)]
One look and I got her
Hittin' corners in my Impala (my ambitionz of a rida)
Slidin down that pole for a dollar, nada
Tell that girl holla (my ambitionz of a rida)
I done brought the thug life out her
Got her stuffin bricks in that Prada (my ambitionz of a rida)
And she love when I'm inside her
And can't nobody divide us

[Chorus: The Game & Dej Loaf]
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
