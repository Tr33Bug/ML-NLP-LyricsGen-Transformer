Scared Now Lyrics[Chorus: The Game]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll
Jesus piece and it's solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós
Who the fuck scared now?
Who the fuck scared now?
[Verse 1: The Game]
Chased that nigga down, put him on WorldStar
Bitch nigga got away in his girl car
Put that pussy on the net like a porn star
Another weenie with bread, he a corn dog
Put three holes in his head like a bowlin' ball
I'm out the gutta switchin' lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds 'cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the Murder Dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the Desert Eagle and
I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn
Specialize in the murder game
Documentary shit, back to Hurricane
Now tell a nigga

[Chorus: The Game]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll
Jesus piece and it's solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós
Who the fuck scared now?

I'm the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat, I clap niggas
This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped, nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat, nigga
What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie, dawg?
I ain't no snitch but if I did, it ain't no biggie, dawg
'Cause that's Biggie, dawg
All this comin' out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as bein' 50's dawg
But I got tired of being 50's dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebratin', label on my dick hard
Interscope asking, would I take 50's call?
"Hello? Put up ten mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas"
G-Unit!

[Chorus: The Game & Meek Mill]
Who the fuck scared now? (Scared now)
Look who the fuck dead now (Dead now)
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga (Shotty, nigga)
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga (Yo)
Gangstas, this is how we roll (How we roll)
Jesus piece and it's solid gold (Solid gold)
Versace polo and a pound of dro (Pound of dro)
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós (Adiós)
Who the fuck scared now? (Huh?)
(Who the fuck scared now?)
Who the fuck scared now?
(Yeah, Meek Milly)
[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All these niggas claimin' they O.G.s, my young boys'll murder them
Cold shooters that's sixteen and they ain't even never heard of them
I slide through, I get a bird to them
And they drive through and they servin' them
These niggas talkin' that beef shit, I put bread on it, no burger bun
We walk up in this bitch like, "What?"
Rollie on my wrist light up
Told these niggas, "Can't do it like us"
Cîroc boy and I do it like Puff
With a hundred bottles, a hundred models
No Twitter, we ain't come to follow
Straight shots and no Moscato
I fuck them hoes, don't give a fuck 'bout 'em
Now tell me who's scared now? (Now)
Shots fired, man down (Down)
Dead bodies get found (Found)
That chopper clip spits rounds (Blaghh)
And real niggas get murdered (Murdered)
Top dogs get it first (First)
He came to me in that Benz (Benz)
And he left from here in a hearse
Woah!

[Chorus: The Game]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll
Jesus piece and it's solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós
Who the fuck scared now?
Who the fuck scared now?
