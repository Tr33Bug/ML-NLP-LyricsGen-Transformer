Start From Scratch Lyrics[Intro: The Game]
Aight, the fuck are you lookin at, self?
You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

[Verse 1: The Game]
If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie, if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

[Verse 2: The Game]
Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I would've told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would've told V to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've changed a couple of lines when I wrote "Soldier"
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin' three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source sucking Benzino's dick
Tryin' to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back16Embed
