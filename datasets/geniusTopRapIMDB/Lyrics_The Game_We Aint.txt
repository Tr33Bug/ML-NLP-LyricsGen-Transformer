TranslationsРусскийWe Ain’t Lyrics[Intro: Eminem]
Hahahah, ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength of Aftermath
Straight out the mothafuckin' streets of Compton
Put your hands together, for Game, bitch! Hahahaha
Yeah! Yeah, mothafuckas!
Compton's back on the mothafuckin' map
Aftermath in that ass, bitch
Game, let's go

[Verse 1: The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
Then talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this
So they callin' us
[Chorus: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Only Dre can judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame, bitch
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face, which
Way do you wanna face when your brain's hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting
Too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case then
We ain't going!

We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 3: The Game]
Lo, get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 Mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is in it, body armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it, take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For telling me it's hot, when it's not and you got
What you got from them rocks, on the block, you just stopped
Telling Dre you got shot with a Glock, that don't fade me
I'm crazy, why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady?
I don't care if the radio don't play me, I say
What I say when I feel like I'm feeling today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
So I'm gone, bitch
[Chorus: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Outro: The Game]
Oh, G-shit homie
Told you knock my respect
Shut your ass up
Aftermath motherfucker, haha
Game, Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, G-Unit
