Wouldn’t Get Far Lyrics[Intro]
For you baby, I'd find you
For you baby, I'd find you
For you baby, I'd find you

[Verse 1: The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that (Far), how you get that (Far)
And all these new video bitches tryin' to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha
[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed
(It would be just a waste of time)
But you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
Did I have under my belt, like boxers?
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two, nigga, that's mad nuts
Game, you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me?
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo?
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'?
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio, yo
You might also like[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your mouth closed
(It would be just a waste of time)
But you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 3: The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short 'do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop-top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyoncé from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow
[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed
(It would be just a waste of time)
But you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Outro: The Game]
God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch
That was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in MY video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah
Floatin away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah22Embed
