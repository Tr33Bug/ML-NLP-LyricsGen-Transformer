19,999 Lyrics[Hook]
19,999 bitches (Bitches)
I fucked 19,999 (Bitches)
I'm on you, Wilt
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
If I fuck one more
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
Wilt Chamberlain, ho

[Verse 1]
I met your momma, at  a pool party
All the nasty little things she would do for me
If I told you, you probably wouldn't feel me though
But your momma was in the "Cocktales" video
More hoes than your favorite MC
If you find a motherfucker that's hatin' on me
It's about some pussy
'Cause I won't stop pimpin'
Real player with a whole lot of women
Lil sis just left with me
Ex-girlfriends is my specialty
She do doin' things you would never believe
I fucked her so good will she ever leave?
$hort Dog, I'm a rock star
Two bitches in the bed, and I'm rock hard
When TMZ had me runnin' from the cop car
I had four naked bitches at the spot, boy
[Hook]
19,999 bitches (Bitches)
I fucked 19,999 (Bitches)
I'm on you, Wilt
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
If I fuck one more
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
Wilt Chamberlain, ho

[Verse 2]
You say I'm lyin', I say you hatin'
It's a fact, there's no debatin'
The shit happened, it's done
If you don't know your daddy
Then you might be my son
Your momma been to All-Star Weekend
Super Bowl Sunday, a fight or the Freaknik?
Spring break, Girls Gone Wild
Ask Maury, are you my child? (Are you my child?)
No, I'm not the father
Yeah, I fucked her, but never caught her
20 years later, I did it to her daughter
Fucked her in the car that you bought her
You couldn't be a better player than me
Not even if you fucked everyday of the week
I know you think you got it like that, repeat
Wilt Chamberlain, ain't got shit on me, bitch

If I fuck one more
20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches, 20,000 bitches
Wilt Chamberlain, ho

[Verse 3]
Remember when you seen me out in Detroit?
You were Reedy and a whole bunch of D boys
Surrounded by all that pearl
I know one of them hoes had to be your girl
At the derby in Kentucky
I had rich white women wantin' to fuck me
And I party hard on Mardi Gras
Ten bitches every night, I did it all
I did Ashleys, Keishas, Ericas
And it them was only hoes in America (In America)
I had more in London, a few in France
I didn't want to leave when I flew to Japan
I got bitches for all ethnicities
Still callin', sayin' how they're missin' me
But they know, ain't no change in him
AKA Wilt Chamberlain
