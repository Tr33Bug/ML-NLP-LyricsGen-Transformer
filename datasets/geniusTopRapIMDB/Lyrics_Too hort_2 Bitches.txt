2 Bitches Lyrics[Chorus]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and write a rhyme
Call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find"

[Verse 1]
I took two bitches to a hotel
I told 'em both, "You know I won't tell"
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
You gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy, girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin' big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you, so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you "look around, who you wanna fuck?"
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin' on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
But now it's time to fuck
[Chorus]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
And then I hit the studio and write a rhyme
I call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find"

[Verse 2]
When we got to my room, she started actin' nervous
Sat down and said, "Let's order room service"
I said, "Bitch, what are you smokin'?
A big fat dick coming from East Oakland"
I stuck it in her mouth, she started moanin'
I said "Hang up, get off my telephone, bitch"
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town, started freaking them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fucked 'em for a while, then I kick back and watched
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck, I'm a player
Been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm paying hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad 'cause you can't afford it

[Chorus]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and write a rhyme
I call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find"

Them bitches kissed twenty minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, lil' mama on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent twenty more minutes licking each other's breasts
Two titty-sucking hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin' on a fat one, layin' in the cut
After seeing this shit, I ain't wanna fuck
I wanted to see how long they can keep goin'
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was getting my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fucking them sluts 'til the sun came up
Nut in both they mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog, baby, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fucking your freak, nigga

[Chorus]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fucking two bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and write a rhyme
I call it "Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find", sing it

[Outro]
Pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin two bitches at the same time
Fucking two bitches at the same time
Let 'em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps ain't hard to find, nigga
Bitch
Two bitches
Two of 'emEmbed
