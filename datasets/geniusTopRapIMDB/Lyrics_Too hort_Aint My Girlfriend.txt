That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch (Bitch, oh yeah)

Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed (Pissed)
I know she's stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, whoa (Me too)
[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]

Nigga, that's my bitch (Ooh yeah)
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick

If I call that bitch (If I call that bitch)
I know I got you mad as fuck but pimp, don't trip (Don't trip)
That's still my bitch

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I seen the homie last night on some fly shit
Had the nerve to introduce me to my bitch
His main bitch is my side bitch
She stayed cool, actin' like the shy chick
I played it cool too, you know I didn't say nothin'
'Cause not a lot of people know that me and her be fuckin'
She sent a text, talkin' 'bout, "I see you player"
I see you too, hangin' out with a square
But that's the type I like
Spend the night but she's not my wife
I fuck her good, but I'm not her man
To tell the truth, I just hit it when I can

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch (Bitch, oh yeah)
And I can have her any time I want, she love this dick (Yeah, haha)
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed (Pissed)
I know she's stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, whoa (Me too)
Bitch

She wants usin' money you ain't talkin' 'bout none (Huh)
Show me a bad bitch, I'll show you nigga, tired of fuckin' (Haa)

Three bottles Cîroc ('Roc)
Three models to pop (Pop)

Pimpin' is a sport ('Port, skrt)
Pullin' up with $hort ($hort)

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
See all my bitches is bad, so she know ain't no problem
Know when he ain't around, prolly when she gon' call me
I know she come to play, she chase me state to state
Swear these niggas be jealous, that's a female's trait
She hit me on the phone, say she be home alone
Off Hennessy and Patron, tweetin' 'bout my cologne
I be in New York, fuckin' her to Too $hort
Hit that pussy so good, said she need new pork

[Verse 4: Joyner Lucas]
You don't even got what I be giving (Yeah)
The truth is you could never hit the spots that I be hittin' (True)
I know she love when I be on top when I be in it
Even when we finish, you should hear the props that I be getting (Yeah)
I pull up, and hit it out front (Yeah) and then I dip when I'm done (Woo)
Even if y'all were married, I still could hit when I want (Savage)
Every time that she near me, I'm still gon' get what I want (Yup)
Break up your happy family and tell you, "Look what I've done"
I've gotten dirtier now, she gotten flirtier now (Joyner)
She wrote her name on my dick, I'm putting words in her mouth
When Joyner Lucas in town, there's lots to worry about (Yeah)
Yeah, that's my bitch if you ain't heard in a while

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ain't my girlfriend (That ain't my girlfriend)
That's my old bitch (Ow, oh yeah)
And I can have her any time I want (That's my bitch, nigga)
She love this dick  (Yeah)
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed (Pissed)
I know she's stayin' with you, but that's our bitch (Me too)
Whoa, ohh

That ain't mine, no
That ain't mine, no
