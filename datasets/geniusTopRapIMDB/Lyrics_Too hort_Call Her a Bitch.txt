Call Her a Bitch Lyrics[Too $hort]
One thing's for sure...
You will get called a bitch... bitch
So motherfuckin' fast - bitch
Short Dog's in the house... beotch!

What's up bitch, you the cut up bitch
Fuck somethin' bitch, suck somethin' bitch
Look out bitch, watch out bitch
Yeah I fucked you bitch then got out, bitch
Catch out bitch, fuck that shit
Motherfucker gettin' mad, fuck that bitch
So bitch, pay me bitch
You can love me bitch, you can hate me bitch
Straight up bitch, save a bitch
Then pay a bitch, I don't play that bitch
Cause a bitch is known to get outta line
And a bitch don't understand, I'm on the grind
You lil' bitch, I'm all about the paper
When I leave bitch tell 'em all about a player
Go on bitch, c'mon bitch
Run home bitch, get front on bitch
That's right bitch, fuck off bitch
You get off bitch when you suck all them dicks
Get cut off bitch when I come home bitch
Shit ain't right? Get the fuck on bitch
Speak up bitch, say what bitch
Wanna pull me down, I'mma stay up bitch
So what bitch, do what you wanna do
A nigga like me don't want nothin' with you
I want a bitch, a real ass bitch
You can feel that bitch when she kill that grip
Hundred dollar bills bitch, I'mma still get a grip
And I won't feel shit when I get a new bitch
Lil' bitch, back up bitch
When I say you fine don't act a bitch
I'll slap a bitch, get smacked up bitch
Wanna get in my way when I stack up chips?
[Hook]
I'll call her a beotch!...
Beotch!...
Call her a beotch!...
Beotch!...

You know what?
A bitch is a once-a-month funky cock bleedin'
Bitch fell in love but she won't stop cheatin'
Real dumb with low self esteem
Fuck a nigga she just met and won't be able to see him
Later on when she wanna get fucked some more
I said "Bitch, why you such a stupid ho?"
You lil' bitch, you never could fuck with this
And every bitch that don't like it, she can suck my dick
20 years later, still settin' it off
Still talkin' bad 'bout them pregnant dogs
They ask me "Short Dog, why you talk so bad?"
Bitch disrespect me, get off in her ass
I'm pullin' ho cards (time to learn a lesson real quick)
Ask me, "What's the definition of a bitch?"
A real bitch - she gon' know she one
Suck the dick, drink the nut, and say she owe me one
Damn bitch, you that bitch, can you do that bitch?
Move back bitch, say who that bitch... I don't know you ho
I don't sniff cocaine, I don't want no blow
Bitch you a dummie - bitch, junkie
Bitch, funky bitch, punkass bitch
Jump out bitch, get the fuck out bitch, get cussed out bitch
Cause a bitch is known to get on my nerves
And a bitch don't really know when I'm on the swerve
I'm like "Bitch, miss me", "Bitch don't kiss me"
"Bitch, just lick me bitch"
You's a bitch, knew it when I heard the beat
Bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me
I told you ten times, all she gon' get is pimp lines
I'm Short Dog -

I'll call her a beotch!...
Beotch!...
Call her a beotch!...
Beotch!...Embed
