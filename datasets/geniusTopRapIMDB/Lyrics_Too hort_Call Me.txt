[Verse 1: Too $hort]
My plane touches down at eleven forty-five
I'm coming through, warn you, bout to show you why
I got the game from the pimps and players
You gonna feel me, baby when I get there
I'm a give you what you want so I could get what I need
We can get hella freaky while we smoke some weed
We don't need champagne, fuck the gin and juice
These nigga's know what $hort Dawg and Lil' Kim can do
Imagination is a understatement
Anything you can think of we could make it
Big money, hit records, watch us get reckless
We butt-naked, we never sexless
And when I get there, you know it's time to fuck
Cause all night long ain't long enough
To come up, it's just us
You wanna know something it's a big dick tight pussy thang
Make us both cum

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Everybody know the Queen getting down and dirty
Drive you crazy like the 730, it ain't a secret
Rumors they could keep it
You know there's only one ghetto Queen with a guillotine
Real bitch that carry gats by the spleen, na mean
Some bitch is on the other line, answer that
If it's a booty call, cancel that
You want pure satisfaction, I'mma handle that
All I need is a candle and a porno channel
Lubricate the top, now I'm starting to sweat
Peel my Gucci sheets back so they don't get wet, now check it
Adjust your phone volume, Lil' Kim is shore ta bring the nuts out ya
Imagine me sucking blood out ya
Like a hickey, I love the phone quickie
I slip myself a mickey, now that's the proper set off
You could reach out and touch me MCI style
Kim and $hort fucking Cali Bedstuy style
Tell me what you want, I'll tell you what I need
You could fuck me til I bleed, ooh $hort I'm bout to OG
(And I like it)

[Verse 3]
[Too $hort]
You say it's cool to fuck baby, just open up

[Lil' Kim]
Well since you showed up, what's the hold up

[Too $hort]
The blunts ain't rolled up, let's mix sex with the weed smell

[Lil' Kim]
Then ride me nigga like you do them V-12's
I'll be your SLK and you can drop my top

[Too $hort]
And I'll be all up in the cock from midnight to six o'clock
The way you suck dick you off the heez-ay

[Lil' Kim]
Get off your kneez-ay, they say you are what you eat baby

[Too $hort]
This ain't no 69 it's more like a 138
Everytime we have sex it's like watching dirty tapes
You're my personal, private porno star
You wanna see us fuck, buy the tape at the corner store
Queen Bee getting stung by Too $heezee
I'm smoking indo, buzzing with the breezee
I'll teach you all about the nigga's from the O-A-K
We take the money and the pussy cause we sho' don't play
And I like it

[Hook: Both]

(Yeah) Wish I could show you how much
(I know you could, mmmmm)
