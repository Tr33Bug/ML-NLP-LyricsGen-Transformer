Get In Where You Fit In LyricsWhat happened to that other rapper y'all used to fuck with?
Man, we ain't fucking with that fake motherfucker MC Uh, Whatever
That motherfucker name is, man we got a real crew, we got
Motherfuckers over here rapping for real, eating pussy on records and
Shit, that shit ain't what's happening, we got some real shit
Trying to be like $hort motherfucker, you know what I'm saying?
Dangerous Music got some mack shit for your ass, boy
Fuck him up, $hort

[Too $hort]
Get in where you fit in, fool
You was a mark up at the high school
Now you're hardcore like CB4
Biting, what you wanna be me for?
It's your life, you wish it was a Too $hort rap
But you gots no game, and your bass ain't fat
You need to quit, rapping just ain't your place
So back on the grind and don't catch no case
Bitches, that's what you always be
Like the other young bitches that try to get with me
I run all up in it but this ain't no race
I pull it out and shoot it right in her face
You probably wine her and dine her
And get jealous when you can't find her
You're nothing but a mark
I bet you get your ass kicked hanging at the park, bitch!
You'd better watch your back
Before you get jacked by a nigga with a gat
Cause Life is Too $hort, I'm In the House like that
Shorty the Pimp, was Born to Mack
And I don't stop rapping, one thing I never do
Is stop making this funky-ass shit to ride to
And other rap crews can see
Dangerous Crew got the funky beats
And when I see ya, and act like I don't know ya
I'm like Missouri, cause I can show ya
Why is my shit so funky it stanks?
Pee Wee, Shorty B, and Ant Banks
You outta pocket trying to hang with my crew
You might of just learned, but it ain't nothing new
What happened to your funk, did you lose it?
Or did you get juked by Dangerous Music?
We stole all your money, and all your songs
Done you like a ho and then sent your ass home
One punk came and went
Had to fire the ho, but I'm still a pimp
(MC) Lawrence (The fake gangsta)
Would've never been shit without the Bad-Ass Banksta (The little punk)
Now he's gonna play on out (Like a mark)
Had to put his fat foot in his mouth (Little bitch)
Quick to say "I'm sorry" when you're funny
Y'all can have him, cause Dangerous don't want him
He'll tell a lie almost every other minute
I'm like Bennett, I ain't in it
Go on with your reject rap attack
You'll get more from a prize in a Cracker Jack
And since Banks said he can't have no more funk (Hell naw)
Get in where you fit in, punk
It's what life is all about...
Did that get him, did that get it? (Yeah, you got him)
Wait, it's the end? (Bitch-ass nigga)
You like that shit? (Hell yeah) Damn, you like that, nigga!
You a fool (Tore his ass up!) Banks you a fool for that!
(Fuck that nigga) (Goddamn!)

Man, fuck that punk-ass nigga, man trying to fuck with the Dangerous
Crew, nigga, you can't hang with this shit, nigga, we got niggas
Way tighter than you man,you old wanna be me asshole nigga, come with
Some real niggas from East Oakland, nigga

[Rappin' Ron]
I'm a Bad-N-Fluenz, so keep your fucking kids away from me
Cause the motherfucking turf is the place to be
Where hella niggas get shot at
So you'd better pop back, or your ass getting dropped, black
Cause niggas lay you on your back fast
So you'd better grab a gat and pop a cap in they black ass
And let loose the whole clip
And let these motherfuckers know that you ain't taking no shit
I mean you gotta be a nut, fool
And you can't give a fuck, you can cut nigga, fuck school
Because that shit don't even last long
Get a key from an OG and get your fucking cash on
And if a nigga got some grip, get your gank on
But if a nigga popping lip, get your bank on
Don't ever go out like another sucker
You gotta show everybody that you the baddest motherfucker
Show them niggas you the biggest boss
And ain't no slipping stopping the tripping just popping
A clip and breaking them niggas off
Cause see life ain't nothing but just riches to me
Getting high with my partners and bitches to see
Yep, that's what life is all about
You eating the cunt and she sucking your dick and you
Fucking that bitch and kicking that bitch up out
I ain't a model, and I don't play the fucking role
Don't be shit when you're old, nigga fuck a goal
You wanna be somebody, I tell your ass you can't
You little bad motherfucker, go on and hit the dank
That's how it is in the Oaktown
These motherfuckers didn't know? Well these motherfuckers know now
And don't be jealous and mad we doing shit
Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm from the Bad-N-Fluenz clique

You wanna follow in my footsteps, well put on your gangsta hat
Burn the sack, and don't be ashamed to mack
I'm bout to tell you how a true player has to be
The shit comes naturally, so hoes quit asking me
I never listened and used to cuss in back of the church
?Bracking the Max? is my birth, packing a gat on the turf
Ready to drop any sucker on contact
You can't keep me calm, black, so pass me the bomb sack
And watch me extend with a grin to another place
I live on the edge and the Feds and the brothers space
But ain't no stopping this fool, I'm on a rampage
Breaks out in a damn rage, so don't try to stand, break
Sit in the range, you'll get maimed, I don't fight fair
Strike with a mic, in a psyche is a nightmare
And I'm always using my dick cause I'm slick with a fly bitch
And Rappin' ass Ron is my psychopath sidekick
Two hardhead niggas, yeah we advocate violence
Talking shit to the world cause we don't have to stay silent
Steady searching for a bad plan, thinking like a mad man
Your crew think they tight, but when I come they a sad clan
So fuck it, I'm always causing ruckus
Whoever wanna disagree then grab my dick and suck it
Diddley is always doing shit, distructive and I ruin shit
You stepping, pack your weapon fucking with the Bad-N-Fluenz clique
[Rappin' Ron]
Fuck it, it's just another nigga dead
I pulled the trigger and I figure lead, that's when the nigga bled
Bloodshed is what I see in the nighttime
Strange and deranged, I ain't in my right mind
I can't relate, I'm stuck in a dream state
A psychopath, and Diddley Dog is my teammate
And see we are closer, than Fred and Barney Rubble
So step to Bad-N-Fluenz and you know you in double trouble
Motherfucker, we the Bad-N-Fluenz clique
Some lunatics, and we known to ruin shit
A terrorist, I ain't never been a role model
Nigga I grab the fucking 40 and down the whole bottle
And I don't even like fucking with no alcohol
But I'll snatch a joint, and get smoked out for y'all
Getting lit, never having a fit
On the avenue, having brew, grabbing my dick
And if your clique talking shit, it's your clique I'm a terrorize
The nine to your spine, now your ass is paralyzed
I'm dangerous, and I ain't even mad yet
I drop with couch and watch you bounce like a bad check
Cause I'm a mack that's from 8900, bitch
Rappin' Ron and Diddley Dog and Bad-N-Fluenz ruling shit

[Diddley Dog]
Fool don't understand all the shit that goes on up in this nigga's head
From the hood come if you would but you might end up dead
See these sick-ass Oakland streets done turned me out
Surviving and making cash is what it's about
Some people ask me why commit crimes to earn my scratch
But I'm black and I'm trapped and I can't turn back
I was raised as a cruel kid
Because the streets taught me more than these fake-ass schools did
I tried the education system but I dropped it
So now I'm in the goddamn game and can't stop it
And I'm a motherfucking threat to authority
Make the police sweat when they check this wreckless minority
You want more of me, well come to Oakland, that's where I be at
Selling dope with my folks, come close and see how we act
Hard niggas addicted to dirty money, fast cars, and fine hoes
On the drink every day like winos
And sometimes I be slipping up off the blunt
So I packs a pump for the punks who wanna try for their stunt
Cause I would never tell a ho how I make my green
I cut my cream on the un[derground] so I can't be seen
And then I bump up on the block and knock after knock
Watch the cop jock as I create a be a hot spot
Pushing slugs just to make it
I'm in the game and it's real and a nigga can't fake it
I know it's sad what I'm doing
But I don't give a fuck, I'm Ant Diddley Dog and I'm a Bad-N-Fluenz

Nigga you think you got the shit in?
You gotta get in where you fit in, bitch
Motherfucker, you outta pocket, punk-ass bitch
Swoll-ass motherfucker, you can't fuck with the crew, nigga
You need to get in where you fit in
You stupid-ass bitch1Embed
