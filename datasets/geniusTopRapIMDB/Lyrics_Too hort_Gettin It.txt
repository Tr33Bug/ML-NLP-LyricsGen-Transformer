Gettinâ€™ It Lyrics[Intro: Too $hort]
That's right, album number ten, Short Dawg's in the house
It's gettin close to the end y'all
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
In your ear for a minute, quit complainin'
'Bout how you can't spend it 'cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get your mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You should be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnnie Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, 'Hell nah I didn't pop him'
Get your kids in school so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dog's in the House, I know you ain't trippin'
'Cause Life is Too $hort, you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think, you got to read between the lines
'Cause life ain't long for a young black man
Tryin' to make money doing all he can
Sellin' dope, don't ya hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on bottom
A flock a top notches, oh yes, we got 'em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
[Refrain]
Get your money, mayne
Get yours

[Chorus (x4)]
You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good

[Refrain]
Get your money, mayne
Get yours
You should be gettin' it

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I know you tired of bein' broke, just hangin' out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set yourself some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin'
'Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin'
(So what are you sayin', Todd?)
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
'Cause I'm one in a million, black men risin'
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise 'em
Spend my money in the 'hood, I know it's all good
And you should do the same, I told you peep the game
From Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand 'cause I know I can
I keep goin' and goin' but I'm not the pink bunny
Instead of beatin' on the drum, I never stop thinking money
I'm gettin' all I can, if you don't, ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich, I can't be fake, I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep makin' these funky sounds
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro (x2)]
I earned my respect in the street
The ghetto's been good to me
I'm never going to turn my back
The true and living so I gots to kick the facts

[Chorus]4Embed
