Girl (Cocaine) Lyrics[Intro:]
Girl, Girl, Girl
That's your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe

[Verse 1:]
I come from the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
'Cause a basehead never sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine Cocaine, is that your rap?
Every day and night it's coming back
C-O-C-A-I-N-E
The rich man's high is what it used to be
But things looking different in '85
Cocaine, cocaine is that your high?
Since age thirteen, what have I seen?
A lotta baseheads, straight coke fiends
Snorting, puffing, that's the life
But it's all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked out with no more rocks
Baseheads buy, coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man, ain't too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
He's got a lotta dope, but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a '84 Benz, repossessed
[Hook:]
Girl, that's your life (Don't do it)
Girl smoking that glass pipe (Don't do it)

[Verse 2:]
Fresh young tender, only fifteen
Walking on a strip, just wanna be seen
Never touched coke a day in her life
But now that girl's gotta have her pipe
'Cause she met a man, his name was Jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in a joint all crunched up
And now every day she takes a puff

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now you're kicking back thinking 'bout your dream
But it never comes true 'cause you're just a coke fiend
You asked your woman 'What's the prob?'
She said 'It's you 'cause you don't do your job'
Used to make good love from the start
But now the coke did damage to your private parts
You might also like[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale, exhale, you don't care
Coke smoke only, no fresh air
You can't even talk, you don't wanna listen
You and your buddy on a cocaine mission
Three days straight, where's your mind?
It's gone out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until you're broke
Just smoke that coke until you croak
And it would be, I can't lie
No good loss if you should die
'Cause your life is wrecked, your girl was checked
She chose on me and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base, she's just like you

[Hook:]

[Verse 5:]
You saved your money for a year-and-a-half
You're so damn stupid, you make me laugh
Bought a car co-signed by Daddy
A 1980 Fleetwood Caddy
You drove that car every place
Until that day when you first based
Look at it now, the real big wheeler
Sold that Caddy to a big coke dealer
[Hook:]

[Verse 6:]
When you base coke, until you're broke
Where I come from, we call you smoked
S-M-O-K-E-D
To smoke more coke is all you need
You say coke is it, it's all that counts
It's got more ounce to the bounce
It put your life in a state of shock
Got you singing to yourself "I'm the king of rock"

[Hook:]

[Verse 7:]
Rocks made you, and now you simp
Seven hookers and one down pimp
If you never based, in the first place
There's no way you could pimp today
'Cause it got you sprung, and you said 'Look
I gotta have money 'cause I am hooked'
None of your girls would ever quit
'Cause you used game to get a hit
You're the best basehead to ever live
You always take and you never give
You got your girls hooked too
And that is why right now you're through
They took your house, car and gold
And you got life with no parole
Smooth locked down, without a doubt
You killed two hookers when they smoked you out

[Hook:]

[Verse 8:]
You say don't knock it, until you try it
It cost too much, I'll never buy it
So I won't try it, and you should knock it
You always have coke in your pocket
Wherever you go, in this world
It's not just you, it's you and that girl
You love Snow White, she's your life
Smoking that coke in a glass pipe

[Hook:]

[Verse 9:]
You needed some money and your girl came through
Now you're gonna smoke for a hour or two
But that's not you, that's what you thought
Fake base rocks is what you bought
From some young brother, on some street
One sick basehead just got beat
Got his rocks and rushed them home
Put it on the pipe and they just phoned
One sick basehead lost all hope
Thought he bought coke and just bought soap
Got his gun and who got shot
Some young punk at the base rock spot
Standing out there, all alone
One basehead, his mind was gone
He had to shoot 'cause someone got
One basehead with a fake base rock

[Hook:]

[Verse 10:]
It's the C-O-C-A-I-N-E
The rich man's high is what it used to be
But things looking different in '85
Cocaine, cocaine, the whole world's high
Wherever I go, in any town, you know cocaine is all around
Right now today, in '85
You better stop smoking while you're still alive

[Outro:]
Girl, that's your life
Girl, smoking that glass pipe
That's your life
Smoke that glass pipe
That's your life
Just smoke that glass pipe
