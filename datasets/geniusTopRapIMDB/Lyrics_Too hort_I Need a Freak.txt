I Need a Freak LyricsIn these times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To take us from the rain
Jealousy
A little greed
I've been thinking
Of what I need

I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, exclusively
So that she only comes and satisfies me
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, every day and every night (Help me out!)
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak with long, long hair
A super freak in underwear

I need a freak, hear what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day
I need a freak, so I can swerve
I need a super freak, to calm my nerves

Now every day is the same, I go get me a freak
Take her to my house 'til we hit the sheets
Got a saltwater fish tank built in the wall
Phat Jacuzzi tub, sitting in marble
Freaks can't resist the way it's laid
I spit the game and I got paid
Say Short, what you doing with all that stack
Bitch seen all four walls had plaques
She go on and drop them draws
Don't take too long, she can't stop the law
Street player, Short Dogg baby is a
Kyptonite, smoked out crazy nigga
I slip some crip on the freak (bitch)
She started licking on my feet
Up to my ears, back down to here
I need a freak every day and that's real
You might also likeI need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak every day and every night
Man, they ain't hearin' what I'm sayin', man

They say the freaks come out at night
You on my mind, you outta sight
If I don't see ya tonight it ain't on
I'll take my other little young bitch home
Niggas like me know just what to do
Me and homie want to fuck with you and your girl
Teach you about the new world
Spit the game like old school perms and curls
Get naked and do thang that girl
Keep it right there I got one in the chamber
I aim it at your face and then squeeze the trigga
Can you hang with a freaky ass nigga
She took it all, had a ball
She got nothing but a party y'all
So all you squares and player haters don't sleep
I need a freak

I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak every day and every night
I need a freak with long, long hair
A super freak in underwear
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, hear what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day

Short Dogg's in the house
Yeah, that's right
Players will be players baby
All dogs must chase the cat
Famous words
We going to get off into this X-rated shit
Ant Banks, can I flip the script?
If you break the beat down I'm going to come back, watch
So break it down, watch
We're going to break it down old school style
This is the old school type right?
Short Dogg's in the house representing East Oakland, West Coast
This a West Coast thang, bitch!
I need a motherfuckin' bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
So we're going to call this part two
It's called "I Need A Bitch"

I need a bitch to hold me tight
I need a bitch to suck my dick every night (every night)
I need a bitch, need to get paid
I need a bitch, tonight Short Dogg's gettin' laid (that's right)
I need a bitch, y'all hear me talkin'
I need a bitch, 'cause a real pimp can't be walkin'
I need a bitch, I really do
I want a nasty ass bitch that acts like you, bitch!1Embed
