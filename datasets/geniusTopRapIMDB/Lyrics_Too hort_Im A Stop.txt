Iâ€™m A Stop Lyrics[Chorus: Devin The Dude]
I'mma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya don't stop calling me
Every hour on the hour, motherfucker can't ya tell ya bother me
I'm smoking, drinking, making ma pussy, not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute, I finna fuck with a few of these hores

[Verse 1: Too Short]
I met this bitch, her name was Lucy
She's a Twitter stalking, Facebook groupie
She loves dogs so I nicknamed her Poop
One day she wants me and the next day it's Snoop
She keeps posting pics
Cause Lucy, she love to stroke them dicks
She got that "feel good" energy
And a whole lot of nasty memories
I never should have did, what I did with the bitch
Cause now, I can't get rid of the bitch
She's throwing up my phone sending texts and e-mails
All about her dreams of having sex with females
Come swapping in a threesome?
But that ain't what I want, that's what she wants
I keep telling her to leave me alone
Bitch won't stop calling ma phone, bitch
[Chorus: Devin The Dude]
I'mma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya don't stop calling me
Every hour on the hour, motherfucker can't ya tell ya bother me
I'm smoking, drinking, making ma pussy, not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute, I finna fuck with a few of these hores


[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I should have never fucked that freaky bitch
Now I be on some geeky shit
She keep calling, and calling
Man that bitch is a stalker
First I want my ass licked, then I need my toes licked
Soon as the bitch think she done she done I come up with some more shit
I can't have a square bitch
No I need a rare bitch
No gag reflex, no ring, no marriage
I'm super, yeah I'm Superman, see me I need a Supergirl
Go super low and give a nigga some super fellatio
And if I'm soft it's her fault
It's her job to get me hard
My dicks the bishop, it help a bitch find God
Church, Keep it rainin' on my hoes
And tailor shit on my back everywhere I go
That paper keep it flowing in
There she go again
Look bitch, you working my last nerves
I have to go to therapy, I can not longer fuck with you
What you and I had was a flash, shawty I've had enough of you

I'mma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya don't stop calling me
Every hour on the hour, motherfucker can't ya tell ya bother me

So just leave me alone for a minute, I finna fuck with a few of these hores

[Verse 3: Twista]
When you looking at her body you gon wanna up get with her because the bitch a banger
Big swag, a socialite, easily clickin' with strangers
Never really know her when you get to meet her cause she was so thick and you thinking she was the bomb first
Ask what she do, she say she do promo for concerts
But she don't wanna listen, gotta be at every party I'm at
Running and rubbing yo buddy all on the rack, why you all over a motherfucker like that?
All these flaws make a nigga pause with the words
Got the draws but now I'm feeling like I'm fucking with two other birds
For the urge, got a ... but I can't get out, so shoot me
Now the bitch all on the internet stalking me, that's what I get for fucking with a groupie
All I could do is smoke a Lucy
Bitch, how does she know?
But all I know:
Betta be the binnest if you fucking with her, cause she could be a ho
Nah, let me put it in retrospect
Reminiscin' with shocka, go back up time and intercept yo sex
Now what you all in the my window with my two do' fo'?
Mama you get on my nerves, I thought you know I ain't fucking you no' mo'
[Chorus: Devin The Dude]
I'mma stop putting my thing up in ya bitch if ya don't stop calling me
Every hour on the hour, motherfucker can't ya tell ya bother me
I'm smoking, drinking, making ma pussy, not necessarily yours
So just leave me alone for a minute, I finna fuck with a few of these hores


[Bridge: Devin The Dude]
I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it
I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it
I know you miss this dick
I know you really miss it miss
You wanna hug it, wanna rub it, wanna kiss it1Embed
