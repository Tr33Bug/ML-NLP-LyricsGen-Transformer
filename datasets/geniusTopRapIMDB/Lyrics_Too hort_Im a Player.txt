Iâ€™m a Player Lyrics[Hook: x2]
And we sure do like to play
I'm a player, and I'm playing just to play

[Verse 1:]
You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I'll be a player for life, so where's my wife?
Probably at the rehab stuck on the pipe
'Cause she must be smoking and I'm not joking
Too Short baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch and wouldn't give you joint
Bitches ain't shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed while I spit this rap
And tell you 'bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gettin' freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap, well that's a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want and how you want it, fool
'Cause I was fucking ugly hoes back in high school
I used to fuck young-ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tell a story 'bout rags to riches
'Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' for years and ain't fell off yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top Caddy
Throw a peace sign and say 'Hey, pimp daddy!'
'Cause I never would front on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your two sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch
Short Dog in the house with some player shit...
[Hook: x4]

[Verse 2:]
All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin' lover tell me how do ya feel
When you front to the homies how you grind 'em
Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got one girlfriend and see her every night
Come around her partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said 6:22
Cut to the house and said 'Baby, I love you'
Can't act like a mack like playboy Sho'
And the rest of the macks in the streets of the O, bitch!
Comin' up we learned how to break these hoes
And when you're through gettin' yours then you shake these hoes
And when you're older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's every day, workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before, I see it again
Young tender saying 'Short, would you be my man'

[Hook: x4]

[Interlude/Bridge: Ant Banks]
Yeeeah, there's a lot of fake players out there
Talkin' bad about Ant Banks, you know what I'm sayin'
But I ain't trippin tho
Short Dog, what you do about them player haters?
You might also like[Verse 3:]
Tryna stay away from Kris Kross imitators
Put ya in a cross 'cause they're really just haters
I thought you knew, Short Dog is a player
Born to mack, and got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean-ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack, I'm hookin' hoes like crack
I be a monkey on your back, bitch
Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you all on my dick
And even though I can't fuck you every day
That's cause I got another bitch around the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight
I really don't care
'Cause I'm a player...
