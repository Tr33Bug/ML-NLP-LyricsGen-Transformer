Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches (Erick Sermon Remix) LyricsYeah that's right
We gonna flash back
To 1983
I'ma show you niggas how I was spittin' this pimp game
Before most of you niggas even started rappin'
1983
Too $hort
Word for word
Like this baby
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's okay if she got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling right
Do the same damn thing every day of my life
Cause every morning you know I get
A good blowjob from a real fine bitch
Strokin', smokin', sir Too $hort
Thinking about the day before
30 minutes after I rolled out
I pulled a freak took her to my house
She was hella young with a lot of butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy I couldn't pass
A light-skined freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
Today my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself "I must need glasses"
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and me homie just wanna be tuff
Freak two bitches then switch'em up
It was 3:35 the strip was lit
Every two blocks I saw a different bitch
Waiting on the bus some was walking
Me and my homie just started talking
I said "Homie she looks good"
He said "That ass is flat as wood"
I said "What about baby in the black"
And he said "$hort she's all back"

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cause bitches all over wanna get fucked
I just need one with a lot of butt
Me and my homie rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie "I hate to say
All the bitches with ass stayed home today"
And he said "$hort what now?"
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind

Bitches, Bitches, Bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

We hit the B-town like Oakland players
I knew it bitches was everywere
The first one had tities so fat
But that don't work her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
Talked about the bitch like a muthafuckin' fool
I said "Beyotch
I know I'm capin'
Where's your ass baby, what happened?"
She turned around caped back on me
Said "Fuck you nigga, where's your teeth?"
I damn near fell jumping out the car
But I slapped that bitch and slapped her hard
My homie said "$hort, we gots to cut"
But I was spankin' that bitch on her big flat butt
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said "Baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with the long long hair"
Baby came over from across the street
Standing on the corner talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cause I didn't even notice that she had a flat ass
Sheit!
And I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O'
I told that bitch "I changed my mind"
She looked at me and she said "Why"
I said "I'm Sir Too $hort the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and your flat booty"
In the Berkley town what did we find
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The invasion (Beyotch) is on

That's that old school
'83
Still pimpin' baby
$hort dog
You know I can't stay away from this gameEmbed
