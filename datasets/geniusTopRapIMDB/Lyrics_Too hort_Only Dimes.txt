Only Dimes Lyrics[Intro: The-Dream]
Eh, eh, eh

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Looking for Tati, Sienna, Adina, Savannah
Looking for Roxy, Shaquita
If you in The Bay, I'll come meet ya
If you in The A, I need ya
I'm a fiend for Anita
Looking for the bad, and the baddest
On a Monday, like we in Magic, hey
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Every big film needs a supporting cast
She know she ain't the one but she supporting that
Room service bottles, I'ma order that
She got a bomb ass pearl but it's more than that
She knows what it is and she play her role
Every girl's not built for it, it takes a toll
She hops on top and she take control
And it's between us, she won't tell a soul
Our secret, it's how we keep it
Not everybody's business who I sleep with
Poppin' Dom P, I ain't drinking cheap shit
It's G and Too Short, every bar gotta bleep it
Album 25, it's The Pimp Tape
Asked the OG, "How long did this take?"
He said, "It's an Oakland thang"
Then he sparked another one, just, just smokin', mayne

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Looking for Tati, Sienna, Adina, Savannah
Looking for Roxy, Shaquita
If you in The Bay, I'll come meet ya
If you in The A, I need ya
I'm a fiend for Anita
Looking for the bad, and the baddest
On a Monday, like we in Magic, hey
You might also like[Verse 2: Too $hort]
She's on my line, and that's good to know
And she's a bad one, so that's good for $hort
She's ready, and I'm wit' it
Got the Uber on the way, I'll be there in a minute
We can hit the bar and have a few drinks
Get in the zone, tell me what you think
About my lifestyle, it's quite wild
I like to use Magnums, no Lifestyle
I hope I don't scare you with how I'm living
I'm all around the world with beautiful women
I can't help that, I'm a player
And if you still on my line, hit me later
Then we can chill all the time, anywhere
Make a lot of noise, let 'em know when we here
Pulling on your hair, slap you on the rear
You see me with my other girl, you don't care

[Chorus: The Dream]
Looking for Tati, Sienna, Adina, Savannah
Looking for Roxy, Shaquita
If you in The Bay, I'll come meet ya
If you in The A, I need ya
I'm a fiend for Anita
Looking for the bad, and the baddest
On a Monday, like we in Magic, hey
[Outro: The-Dream]
The kind of girl I only fuck with: dimes
And I'm tryin' to fuck all the time
Are you a freak, shorty? What's your sign?
I bet you I could make you mine
First, I'ma put you on that D'Uss√©
And then I'ma front up in that pussy
Girl, I need you on my line
I only fuck with dimes2Embed
