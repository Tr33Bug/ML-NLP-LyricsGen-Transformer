Rhymes LyricsWithout a doubt I'm coming back and if you don't know
Call me S-I-R T double O
I like to say these rhymes, I do it all the time
I make my own damn beat now all the money is mine
I carry big fat wads, I treat my girls like gods
Ask 'em "who do they love?" and they all say "Todd"
I'm just an M.C. rapper and nothin' else
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
Could you be like me? I rap my nonstop rhymes
You will never hear pause when I say these lines
I go on and on, I'm sir Too Short
Just what you've been lookin' for
Like PCP or cooked cocaine
DJ universe got you sprung in the game
We make money, hear my rap from coast to coast
From host to host, I hear that toast:
"Too Short, love the way you make that hit
Here's to you, keep rhymin' and boy don't quit"
I say this is how it goes when I say my rap
Most times when I rhyme wouldn't be like that
Cause the way I write rhymes you will comprehend
I keep rappin' to the very end
And if you call me fake I'll say so what?
Got you standin' and noddin' like you just shot up
So boy straightin' up I'm still rappin'
Comin' at you fresh. Do you know what happened?
I'm sayin' rhymes messin' with your mind
I didn't want your girl cause she really ain't fine
I took her to a motel couldn't have been the hotel
It costs me 20 dollars but I did it so well
She had to tell your sister, your sister told you
Now the whole damn town calls me playboy too
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they don't stop
I'm lookin' at an empty page about to fill it up
I write only the truth, speak only to you
So if I tell you to say somethin' then you know what to do
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they never stop
I live in California, drive a drop top
Roll by the beach, look at the freaks
Jump in my car, do it every week
DJ's who know call me Mister Short
All you wanna be mothers get no child support
I'm Too Short baby gettin' rich
Get on the mic and then say... Like left to right
Right to left girl stealin' your heart is like petty theft
Like 10 to 9, 3 to 2
I'll always be one up on you
Like nightfall makes the sun go down
CRAZY RACK laid the beat changed your life around
From the sea to the mountains the mountains to the sea
All you're gonna do is wanna rock this beat
It's so rough so tough when I talk this stuff
When I get on the mic I can't get enough
I'm the rapper of the season, fresh and recent
All my raps are smooth undecent
I'm that rapper known place to place
For the hardest rap with the hardest bass
You see I rap all the time, that's the point
When I walk in the place , just jam the joint
Singin' old Too Short's on the microphone
The beat's so fresh can't leave me alone
You see I rap so cool I will not shout
I keep comin' so hard I might knock you out
If you're battlin' Short that's the chance you take
So you better come fresh and don't be fake
All you weak MC's with your weak drum beats
Tellin' all your people you can hang with me
Count 1 to 10 count 10 to 20 and I'll just keep on makin' money
Life is Too Short I don't stop
I'm hooked on money like a junkie on top
I got to make it every day, I won't go broke
Ask me am I rich and I'll say "no"
I'm your homeboy Too Short back again
Puttin' Oakland on the map my rap will never end
I'd like to send a special thanks to the dangerous crew
For believin' in me when they thought I was through
I got rhymes, I keep 'em comin'
I'm on the mic, I won't stop rappin' till it comes out right
And when it's beatin' I'll just say "let's roll"
I make another record and buy some gold
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
I'm like a one man crew, you see I don't need help
I get the job done so all you fake rappers, MC's, rap masters
Give it up leave that rappin' to me
Realizin' young buck you can't rock that beat
I rap on the mic and you'll believe
Nothin' ain't kickin' like the BIG OLD C
It's just one hard rapper spittin' a rap
Not 3 or 4 sucka's or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack I'll cash a check
Walkin' 'round like a fool livin' up to his rep
I'll tell you life ain't long
What you waitin' for?
