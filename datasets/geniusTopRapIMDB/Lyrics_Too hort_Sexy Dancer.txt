Sexy Dancer Lyrics[Intro: Too $hort & Legado 7]
Legado 7, Too $hort
That's right
We in this bitch
Where it at?
Where the ladies at?
I need all the ladies to the dance floor

[Chorus: Legado 7]
This sexy lady wants me
And I feel the same
Billetes pa' que halen
Gonna make it rain
Kush tonite what we puffin'?
Tirando billetes, que nadie nos pare
I love this sexy dancer
Lo mueve bien
[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I love these sexy girls
Shakin' hips, bouncin' curls
I just wanna kiss you, baby
Wish you could be my mystery lady
Hit the club, dance all night
Fall in love, and spend my life
With you, my se√±orita
Early in the morning, that's when I need her
Next to me, makin' love
It's too good, I can't say enough
About the way you wake me up
It's like the first time every day we fuck
The best place on earth
Anywhere I'm at, when I'm next to her
So much fun, the way you make me laugh
Then you get on the dance floor and shake that ass

[Chorus: Legado 7]
This sexy lady wants me
And I feel the same
Billetes pa' que halen
Gonna make it rain
Kush tonite what we puffin'?
Tirando billetes, que nadie nos pare
I love this sexy dancer
Lo mueve bien

That's what I love
I just can't get enough
I know y'all feelin' me, though
Mexican or Filipino
Puerto Rican salsa dancer
Makin' love while she talkin' Spanish
These other girls don't matter
You see the baddest bitch, point at her
Shake that ass so fast
And if you ain't got no ass
Keep shakin' that thang, too
You want 'em all, I don't blame you
'Cause I'm in love with every race
Different flavors, different taste
Don't question me if you know the answer
I love my sexy dancer

[Chorus: Legado 7]
This sexy lady wants me
And I feel the same
Billetes pa' que halen
Gonna make it rain
Kush tonite what we puffin'?
Tirando billetes, que nadie nos pare
I love this sexy dancer
Lo mueve bien
[Bridge: Legado 7]
Su culote gigante me gusta ver
Irando feria en grande
Lloviendo billetes y viejas a madre

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Baddest bitch in the club
You tryin' to get fucked up
If you see her, point at her
These other girls don't matter
'Cause she's badder, no complaints
You think she's hatin', no she ain't
There ain't no competition
Her on top, that's my position
When I'm inside it, I'm excited
I put her on top and let her ride it
She twerkin' on my thang
My sexy girl from Spain
I'm just sayin', I love every race
Different flavors, different taste
Don't question me if you know the answer
I love my sexy dancer

[Chorus: Legado 7]
This sexy lady wants me
And I feel the same
Billetes pa' que halen
Gonna make it rain
Kush tonite what we puffin'?
Tirando billetes, que nadie nos pare
I love this sexy dancer
Lo mueve bien
