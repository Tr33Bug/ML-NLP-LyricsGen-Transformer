We Do This Lyrics[MC Breed talking]
Hey check this out Short, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah you down here in Oakland, you know what I'm saying?
And I'm all up in Michigan, you know what I'm talking about? I need
To get up on my pimpin', you know what I'm talking 'bout? I need to be
A player nowadays you know what I'm saying? Niggas need to know how
To play these hoes you know what I'm saying? On the strength, why don't you put me up on that pimpin' shit?

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good ho niggas sure better keep her
'Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin' knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin' what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin' this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Then pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm 'bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch
[MC Breed and (Too Short) talking]
Like that Short? Uhh, can't take shorts just 'cause your name Short
Matter fact I'ma quit taking shorts man
(Spit a little game to em Breed)

[Verse 2: MC Breed]
Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten?
If she ain't Lickin' up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday ho, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin' if she ain't licking me up
I'm givin' her to Short, 'cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin' my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin' her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin' she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost 'cause, yellin' pause when they drop the draws
It's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin' nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin' but a causality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin' time
She's just an every day, don't wanna catch her fuckin' mine
Bitch ain't mine, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this

Short I know you ain't done explaining, you know what I'm saying?
Pimpin' is an all American sport, you know what I'm saying? A lotta
People and got that down pat yet but uh why don't you explain it out for em

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin' pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
'Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin' in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin', I'm gone fuck the ho harder
Just havin' fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And every day in between I will do these things, I don't stop bitch

[Mc Breed talking]
Hahahaha, that nigga Short, uh uh yeah uh
[Verse 4: MC Breed]
I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12-inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone
So I look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown
Yeah you hangin' out with me tonight
Every things alright, but a nigga wanna fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin' for ya

[Verse 5: Father Dom]
I'm droppin' lines like a motherfuckin' pimp at this shit
I'm gettin' hoes out they clothes 'cause I'm good at this shit
They callin' me the pussy jammer 'cause I'm breakin' hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin' back at no cost
Never slackin', just mackin', money stackin' that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin' it wild but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough, this how we do this

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
I'm fingerfuckin' with my diamonds
Now peep a nigga climbin' the charts
Ain't no fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Indeed, my momma raised me as a G from birth
I be a hustler mothafucka 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males, that gotta slang yayo
'Cause it's a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin' drugs and high
Conversation with these bitches on my mobile, always in control and never let these bitches know you, and even though
I'm gettin' high, a thug nigga gettin' by
Catchin' bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All-day, I puff a blunt and parlay
And sometimes if we party
Getting my dick licked twice, and death to a trick's life
We can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
Made them punk police buy my Coupe
This is how we do this1Embed
