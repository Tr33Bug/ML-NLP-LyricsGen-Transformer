Come On Lyrics[Verse 1: Stori]
I just, I just wanna live in all lanes
I just want a bubble bath, Jacuzzi on a plane
Sip champagne, bathe in Rozay
Half a cup of OG’s waiting on me all damn day
I’mma sing if I want to, spit if I want to
Shit, I'mma slap a fuckin’ bitch if I want to, want to
They think they know me, uh, they think they know me, uh
But I don't let 'em get too close
Nah we ain't homies
Back up off me, back up off me
Unless you gon' break a couple racks up off me
Wanna get all in my ear with your shit
Even have your girl screaming "that's my bitch"
I just wanna, I just wanna handle my biz
I just wanna, I just wanna get up out the bricks, oh
Oh that's right I did, uh
That girl I'm it, uh
She slim and thick at the same damn time, yeah he call that slick
[Bridge: Stori] (x2)
You know that's what's up, I stay true to this
Cocky as fuck, I ain't new to this

[Hook: Stori & Treach] (x2)
Come on baby (come on baby)
C-come on baby, (come on baby)
Let me show you what I'm all about
Let me show you what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Verse 2: Stori]
I'm takin' other peoples paper every day
That's how we be in Jersey, and that's word to my city
Place of Latifah, Lauryn, [?] and the Fugees
You need to get out of my face if you watchin' [?]
That's F to the R to the O to the N to the TING remains
My verse is effortless, poison it's like it's [?]
I'm a specialist, high on every list
Once you get a taste you gonna have to mess with this

[Verse 3: Treach]
New monopoly, other people's property, probably
The [?] taker, shaker [?] never [?]
I believe in a new spitter, hitter
Chose truth for real for real
Pick 'em up in a Scoop DeVille
[??] venom spitter
Triple OG trigger, yeah you know me nigga
The T to the R to the EA CH [?]
Fuck 'em from the freeway, (fuck you)
I pass the torch for a blunt ofcourse
If you got my back, hit the front with force
We bring the ra ra, yeah I know
[??], coming like a Rhino
I whiling for my broads
Dialling for some blood
30 [?], California love
There ain't no alarming me or harming me
Time to break it down now, army with harmony
