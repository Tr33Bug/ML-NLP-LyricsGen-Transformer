Pocket Full of Miracles LyricsIntro

CHORUS
I've got a pocket full of miracles (physical miracle)
And with my pocket full of miracles (lyrical miracle)
But there's that pocket full of miracles (medical miracle)
And here's my pocket full of miracles (A pocket full of this, a pocket full of that)

VERSE 1
I got a pocket full of stuff chocolate full of nuts
When a damsels in distress I don't let her down I lift her up
Pick her up and place her on a snatch sniper
She open scoping' I open lotion she opens wide
Cause I got that somethin' that'll make a married momma wanna mingle
Act singlе and feel a little extra tingle
Extra spеcial, triple X, X marks the spot though
(I've got a pocket full of...) X 'n' hydro
I get the muscles popping had that ass flushin' condoms
After that we'll hit the mall you know my hustle's hoppin'
There's two mays to treat 'em better or leave 'em
Love 'em so much be ready to two-way a threesome
I got a pocket full of rockets and act right
I'm rollin' ready to finish where we left off last night
I do the cabin stabbin' I don't bone no boogers
I got a pocket full of magnums go and grab 'em sugar
CHORUS

VERSE 2
Say hello to the cheeba hitter rehash for quitters
Wine is fine but fuckin' liquor is quicker nigga
Slaughter the snitchin' when I order the kitchen
Picture a whore at at quarter to 9 or quarter to 8 and you caught a conniption
Love to order hustle and grind and takin' offers
Got no time for the well running dry and lookin' for water
9/11 couldn't fade us Bush makes the world hate us
Next time they build towers better build them bitches bow legged
My technique ain't techno it's tech nine
Snitches I'll give you a Columbian necktie for next time
Hey ho, ho hey bout to get the trip a trippin'
If a ho tells me a ??? then smack the ho for snitchin'
I done smacked too many CEOS and weary rhymers
Now these labels are fridget hard and scared to sign us
If you wasn't interested shouldn't have the meeting
Fuck snakes it's gats if we ain't signed by the weekend

CHORUS

VERSE 3
I'm talkin' about people in the ghetto that make you use the metal
Tryin' to put the test on god keep your vest on
You know the name glad to meet ya if I ain't stealin' ya
You know the game glad to teach ya, blow the ceiling through
Throw the flames have you see through that's what villians do
Call me novocaine and anesthesia cause I ain't feeling you
We get played we get even leave the heathens grieving
My team's so mean they should have highlights on ESPN
Every mic I touch I've sworn I've torn it, I've put my balls on it
Jersey bullshit, we on it
Jealousy and envy will get you nowhere
A bullet through your hairline leave you with no hair
Stuck like cactus full metal jacket
In the Guinness book for crooks for world's fastest ass kicks
Oh he made it but he ain't the gladdest
Cause he's a vegetable like greens, peas and carrots
