Tall Midget Lyrics[Hook]
Industry rule number 100 is funny
Tall midgets get short money

[Verse 1]
Don't bite the hand that feed you, that's exciting fire
Should've done Celebrity Ghost Stories for all my ghostwriting
I can't fire the owner cause it's me and my DJ
Give a grown man time-out, I'm out, buy my swag on eBay
Cash, I get it, grab it, feel the punishment from the savage
Legend, lyrical lord, they call you Uncle Adlib
Harlem shake shook up for real, you so breezy
Starving for press that's why when he went and wiggled his wee-wee
My back-up plan is fuck a back-up man, I'm back
Need to call my nigga Busta buy Spliff Star off his contract
Never last, you joke, better dip the yolk
I'm everlasting, bro, your ghetto pass revoked
Chorus
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Stop bitching, stop tripping, stop riffing
I'm not listening, stop listening, stop sniffing
You outta my army, can't harm me or alarm me
Fuck your fat ass, you're a bagel away from Barney
You wack rapper, backstabber, so greedy
I'll make it so damn they'll never see your wack ass on TV
Eat me, time to find your own zone, watch your tone
Naughty year was niggas throwing you a bone, holmes
I hate the leach lurking off of what I built, cause I'm real
Now I'm doing side-deals that I feel
Many of your dudes love the ending, the grove
It's the ending of you mr. Winnie The Pooh
Chorus
