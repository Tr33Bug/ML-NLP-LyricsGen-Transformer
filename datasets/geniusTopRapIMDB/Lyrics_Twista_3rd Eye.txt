3rd Eye Lyrics[Verse 1: Twista]
See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure you're off the right block
Still I'mma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop, but only if I know you I don't mean to blow you with the statement
But I don't be fuckin' with these niggas, and that's why they be hatin'
Cause I stay in the zone, I be alone, so excuse me if I'm wrong
I'm off a kush, and when the T.H.C. affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet, violence, silence
All the critic's when I spit it I'mma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit I'm a beast
Balling like I'm Uncle Pauly and all of the above we go in the club incognito with the snub
East, be the direction that I'm prayin in
But I'm a Midwest nigga
Mean with a verse, something fly- I am seen with it first
So they can say "Where you get that nigga?"
The essence of my vocabulary's exquisite when I enter into a realm, taking me to the helm
Of lyricism, you gonna be callin' me majesty, callin' a tragedy that you gotta see on film
So I salute and advise you not to shoot, you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Sub-par, So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
I can turn these happy homes and these fake MC's into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries, cook em til they done, whoop em til they wump, put a funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me
[Bridge]
Don't play with me, I'mma make a hater pray to me
God cause I'm hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat, don't step, I am a descendent of Imhotep, yes, Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on a brink, I be smokin' up the stink, so before somebody thinks
See how my style'll get ugly as Michael Spinks  , when I rap about the Sphinx, instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you 'bout your third eye

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Type of shit I make a bird swim, fish fly
Fuck it, touch the sky on the first try
Man a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the fe came up and told me, Now is she bold g?
But in my mouth is where the gold be, cause I be playin' her like Goldy
Ab-Soul I know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ
I never sleep, you getting cozy
I made it out the jungle, I should write a book about Mowgli
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I hit you with a Sig, but I'd rather smoke up on a stogie
God MC, you could say I'm holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely
Solo (Soulo), but Top Dawg is a army
Flow AT and T nigga 4 g's
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley, Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed
Easily Eazy-E without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid, A angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me, him, her, and you
Money in the safe in case there's a lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want?
