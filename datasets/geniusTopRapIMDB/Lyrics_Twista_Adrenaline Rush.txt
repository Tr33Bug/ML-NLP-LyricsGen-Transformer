Adrenaline Rush Lyrics[Intro]
What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?

[Verse 1: Yung Buk]
I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
In the pain from these here motherfuckin' verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and usin' autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)
I’m hitting it with an expert kick
And burst 'til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin' the curtains bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')
I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga, and I'm off my square
High got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit
[Twista]
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge?
I’m charged up like Scarface gettin' shot up on the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin'
To go into thangs like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm finna steal
To get the kickin' shit
For niggas and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust
'Cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' heads bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked
My eyes red, puffed
From smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westside'll let the shit go on
And ride when the trigga bust

[Hook: Twista & Yung Buk]
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition's chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition's chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger click up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick
I'm ready to start shit
Started buryin' some heads like an ostrich
Unload the whole cartridge
And throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What I've accomplished
Yung Buk's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
Then set out on a journey, too astonished to stomp this
Worshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get 'em charged
What's the real reason?
All you haters tried to murder me, so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin'
I'ma keep comin' because I'm still breathin'
And y'all can't trace me
I'm burying my victims in the wall like Gacy, too lyrical
And since the snip of my umbilical, these flows been critical
My music is miracle, it's like I'm biblical
Kill like I'm nuttier than Buddy Love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove
And start the truck up
And speed the fuck up
Getaway, smokin' the blunt up
Adrenaline pumpin' veins, erupt, I'm pumped up
[Yung Buk]
And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggas that's gon' die
'Bout 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama)
We too much for the industrialist to fuck with this
On the brink of fuckin' up some shit
Dismantle, deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
(What niggas got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you
Then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo' curtains fool
From killin' the verses fool
I be one of the worstest, dude
(You the who?)
I'm the worstest
Look about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo' purpose
Bitch you hurtin'

[Hook: Twista & Yung Buk]
