Badunkadunk Lyrics[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Badunkadunk - all in your face when you're at the club
Badunkadunk - slide down the pole for the dirty dub
Badunkadunk - look at your ass girl, it's so much fun
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ, I need a hundred ones
Badunkadunk - What!
Badunkadunk - Drop your
Badunkadunk - all that
Badunkadunk - bounce your
Badunkadunk - big fat
Badunkadunk - I love your
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ I need a hundred ones!
[Verse One: Twista]
Oh shit!
Damn shorty! Look at the motherfucking fatty!
Come to daddy
Tell me what I've got to do to get you licking in my custom Caddy
Never want to let you get up out the ride
When I first took a look my mouth was wide
Look at titty's with them little, bitty shorts
You got on with the thighs hanging out the side
When you work it you gon' hurt these other bitches. (That's right)
Turning me on with the way you're strutting
Even though you only walking
It be still looking like you shouldn't do that shit in public
I can tell it now from what I see you're working with
You ain't even got to ask for the blunt
Booty so fat
Gap so nice you can see the ass from the front
You fitting to hurt me how you twerk that thing
You get me heated when you pop it, baby!
Fell in love when you came up in the club
With the whole bottle of Mo', don't pop it, baby!
I know you got up in a rump shaker contest
Let us see what you can do
Sip a little something while you bounce that ass
Girl, you got to badunkadunk!

[Verse Two: Twista]
Now put that ass in Burberry for the Bentley
Now go and put on the bikini for the Lamborghini
Now let me see you in a thong for the big Brougham
And when you shake it for the dollar, holler when you see me
Now I don't want to see no fatty full of rigor mortis
Go ahead and jiggle it for the one with money in his hands
Go and get up off the stage with your thick ass
And come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over, come and get this dust
Got a player thinking that we fitting to cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty got a little junk in the trunk
Look at how she make one butt cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move
Then work both sides and clap that ass
Remember them times
When you met two shorty's and you really want the cutey
But you let her slide
Cause the other girl with her got a big old donkey booty
Now shorty think she fine
Only if she really knew the truth
I ain't gon' lie girl, twerk them thighs
I'm in love with your big badunkadunk
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Badunkadunk - all in your face when you're at the club
Badunkadunk - slide down the pole for the dirty dub
Badunkadunk - look at your ass girl, it's so much fun
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ, I need a hundred ones
Badunkadunk - What!
Badunkadunk - Drop your
Badunkadunk - all that
Badunkadunk - bounce your
Badunkadunk - big fat
Badunkadunk - I love your
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ I need a hundred ones!

[Verse Three: Twista]
Can you make it go wobbly wobbly?
Come on and follow me, take you on a bodily odyssey
And uh, if you let it go jiggly jiggly
Making it wiggly baby you can never get rid of me
And uh, twerk something!
Oh yeah! Bet the booty's softer then a teddy bear
So fat I could barely stare
Girl the derriere's kind of scary there
Come and drop it for the nigga named Twista
Come and pop for me like a pistol
Got badunkadunks from my mob
And I got badunkadunks for Jazze Phizzle
Girl you deserve respect
You look so good girl I commend you!
The hottest thing on the menu
When I'm off up in the strip club I like when you
Strut that thing, floss that ass
Work it all the way down to the floor
Climb to the top, shake it upside down
Slide down the motherfucking pole
Work that crowd, give a lap dance
Shake it like it's one eighty proof
Take all the ballers up in VIP
Girl go and work your badunkadunk

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Badunkadunk - all in your face when you're at the club
Badunkadunk - slide down the pole for the dirty dub
Badunkadunk - look at your ass girl, it's so much fun
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ, I need a hundred ones
Badunkadunk - What!
Badunkadunk - Drop your
Badunkadunk - all that
Badunkadunk - bounce your
Badunkadunk - big fat
Badunkadunk - I love your
Badunkadunk - I tell the DJ I need a hundred ones!
