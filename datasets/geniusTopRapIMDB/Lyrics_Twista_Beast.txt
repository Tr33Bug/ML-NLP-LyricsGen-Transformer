Beast Lyrics[Hook: Twista]
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Travellin' dimensions from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

[Verse 1]
Fendi, Prada, Enny
Inter-quantum physics
Alien and I done heard about the bitches on the Earth
So I think I’mma visit
Niggas coming at me acting like they hard
Yelling fuck me, fuck you, too
Don’t get it twisted when I spit it scientific
‘Cause the niggas that's with us do shoot
New coupe
Think you’re messing with a dupe, fool, fool
Dark matter aka melanin
Outer space black power, Zulu!
Yelling out like Louie, yelling out moo-boo
Yelling out like Wayne, yelling out soo-woo
‘Cause I’mma wreck them
And I’m coming from a whole other spectrum
Tryna throw me in the flames, take away my name
Kick me out the game but I ain’t gon' let ‘em
It’s a fascination with the science of creation
I am God, look at how the way shit go
Take it to a whole 'nother motherfucking level
When I say I made that ho
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Travellin' dimensions from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Travellin' dimensions from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

[Verse 2]
In the beginning there was "Adam", A-T-O-M
I am the Higgs Boson, meaning that I was there way before him
I kick logic, science
Astrological when I be spitting you a verse
Feel like you prob'ly fucking with me, you the first
But in a parallel universe!
All up in my face
Oh, you think you something?
Atom's an almost empty space
So nigga, you ain’t nothing
Telling everybody that’s it’s on, we can spray
I know that ain’t you
The cells in your body got their own DNA
I know that ain’t you...
With my adrenaline and venom I can turn 'em into a
Minimal amount of matter when in murder mode
Screwface, I am the Omnipotent of verbal evolution
Coming with some shit you’ve never heard before
Like genes, chromosomes, theories of existence
Ain't no tellin' where I take ya
Bio photons turning on codons
Activating divine nature!

Travellin' dimensions from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Travellin' dimensions from another planet
But I spit that fly shit, though
That shit go, damn, that shit blow
Put me in a laboratory, I’mma cook, that’s how shit go

Niggas coming at me
That’s how shit go
Niggas coming at me
That’s how shit go6Embed
