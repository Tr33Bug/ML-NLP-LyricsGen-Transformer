Death Before Dishonor Lyrics[Intro]
Always ever, all days, death bef-

[Hook]
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up

[Verse 1]
It's like "Uh, ah!"
Muthafucka can't fight the feelin', the way I'mma fuck him
Have an orgasm and before the morgue has him killed him as if a four-five bucked him
Talk about a man being scared
I done killed him, he dead in his tomb, still shakin’
Hit him in his body, and his head
Now he found up in heaven, with the wound still achin'
I wonder, if his voice still breakin'
Better be 'cause I readily
Hit him with gats and styles, that's heavily
Armed and dangerous and deadly
Them ahead of me receive two holes like a letter ‘B’
Better you instead of me
Break our peace, can increase your chances
To delete your advances
If it’s faint, I can paint this piece on canvas
With a paint brush that a nigga can't trust
Like a god, so I can't rush, won't crush
If you ever heard about a crew that can't bust, then muthafucka it ain't us, don’t touch
A mic or a gun, if you ain't gonna use it, do it
Claimin’ your weapons and TEC
And you gonna be ejecting fluid, prove it
Cause no matter who it -
Is, K-Town and Westside’ll leave a bitch sheddin’ tears
The young kill everyday, the old itchin’ to kill, ‘cause they ain't left nigga, dead in years
Shoot him dead in his {head}
This style of flow, is a verbal Calico, make a chest ripple
They get a call from the sky, if they all don’t die, better leave the rest crippled
[Hook]
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up

[Verse 2]
Life is priceless, if you try to take mine, leavin’ muthafuckaz cold, as a crisis
With a technique as old as Isis, and mics as my control devices
Or, do I gotta get off into some nigga shit? Show the bigger dick , with a thicker clique
That'd be hazardous, if I let the trigger click, you don’t benefit, if a nigga get
Off on the rage, even if it’s just a little bit, so go’on with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress, then get it off your chest, and we can take it to the middle, bitch and go on
Get it on, and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin’ niggas outdone, cut up
Bullets hard to see a muthafucka outrun, just because he let his mouth run, shut up
And sit back if you know what's good for you, I can still overthrow you
I don’t give a fuck about the fact, that the hood know you, don’t make a nigga have to show you
That I’mma die, before I let you make an ass of me, snap as if you took a blast at me, and cause tragedy
That was how it was, that was how it is, and that's the way it has to be, (always ever, all day, death be...)

Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static

[Verse 3]
It's like "Uh, ah!"
Sit back and let the shit I say marinate
I pull the stage curtain back like Norman Bates, performin’ hate
Smokin’ on some reefer, preparin’ fate
It's a constant scuffle for us
White boys with the shit, hittin’ licks in the hustle for us
My nigga lucky, made him bleed for months
If you proceed to bust, if you a different type of breed from us
So petty niggas, y’all need to hush
Two straight to you brain’ll mean pain’s inflicted
Even if it ain't thangz, a joint point-blank range, ’til my brain is wicked
Ain't even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryna push product
And ain't servin’ the right kind, ain't strivin’ to write rhymes
But I’mma straighten yo’ life-line
Through the pipeline of a vocal combustion, plus I’m with killers
Jaw stealers, flow builder rushin’ parties, bloody body, chillers
Pretty casket fillers
'Cause these niggas here got their shit together
We campaign the Creator's Way
It don’t gotta be on, but then again, whatever!
[Hook]
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, that’s when I'mma have to fuck you up3Embed
