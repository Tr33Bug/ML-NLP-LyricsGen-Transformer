Dreams Lyrics[Chorus: Vicky]
Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)

[Verse 1: Mayz]
Damn, I'm trippin' cause I never really felt like this
To me women used to be only fuck foxes
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss
I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean
I wanna make you my queen
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend
Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen
Like a private boat as we float down stream
Yeah I already know you done heard this before
But the way you make me feel is real
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do
Got me head over heels, so tell me what's the deal, baby
Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied
Unless you're on my side to the end of time
I can tell you think I'm lying
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real
[Chorus: Vicky]
Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)

[Verse 2: Liffy Stokes]
From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight
Wearin' black and white in some brand new Mike's
Draped in ice, attitude nice
You the type of woman that I need in my life
To add a little spice, cook a nigga steak and rice
I can see us one day man and wife
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child
Plus a marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin' me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe
But this way's got the best of me
On everything, I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of "what's his name"
And let me in your world
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month
Bae, only time can reveal a dream
You might also like[Chorus: Vicky]
Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)

[Verse 3: Twista]
Baby I'll drink your bath water by the pint
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh
I ain't sayin' I'm never lovin' em and I ain't studderin'(or maybe stuntin') but shit
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on the ninth
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true to none, but you the one
I helplessly succumb, lovin' you more than everything
But my dollars spendin and smokin' sticky up through the lungs
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck
In the city, no hear my pretty Go
Quick to break a fifty for, put you on my video
Young and witty ho, the only fe' I feelin' pretty for
I don't know what I was frontin' on
But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone
My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader
I promise I won't hurt you baby
Don't feel the heatseaker cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall
Get you the finest things like diamond rings
Even though my mind is strange, I'm tryin' to change
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me grind the pain
No lyin, no games, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut
Cause I just sold you a dream ho, like ya girlie did to my homie
You're how I spit it [fast] we're fuckin her up
A sucker for love, a sucker for love
[Chorus: Vicky]
Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)1Embed
