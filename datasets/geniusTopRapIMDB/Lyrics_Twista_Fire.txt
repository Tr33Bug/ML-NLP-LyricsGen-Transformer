Fire Lyrics[Verse 1: Twista]
Now I know it's been a long time
Since a muthafucka' done made a good song about reefa'
And who better for you to handle this
Than the T, the number 1 analyst on the cannabis sativa
Go and get a pillow and a cigarillo if I know what's the killa'
I'm gonna roll one up jo'
Open the Backwood up, trippin' on me 'cuz I was sloppy
I better get fucked up though
I be smokin' four different kinds of kush
It's the best of me especially the Purple and the OG
But ya'll might call it the Granddad
Better savor it and take a pull slowly
Eye lids low, ain't no doubt about it that somebody's gon' peep me
Go 'head and ride I think Ima' chill, because I'm kinda sleepy
Me and my niggas in my crew would get into it, now we be at odds hardly
Cuz' we smokin' on the ounce of the Ganja, that Bob Marley
Me-a rock to the Reggae music whenever me-feelin' spliff workin'
Kill off any rude boy, if you take away my herb that's a Earth's sin
[Chorus: Twista]
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
Puffin on that dro (puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
Puffin on that dro (puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)

[Verse 2: Twista]
Blow Kush wit' Ball and M.J.G
Smoke Haze, I used to with Sigel
Freeway put me on to the Backwoods
And Bleek introduced me to Diesel
And Snoop turned me on to the Chronic
Smokin' it I was feelin' bionic
Lookin' at me rollin' the blunt
And I'm huffin' and puffin'
I can't get enough of this stuff and I'm losin' my logic
You could smell it all on my follicles
And Ima' follow you cuz' of the 'Dro
But if it ain't I call a audible
I be gettin' nothin' but love cuz' I be smokin the bud
Juss' lookin' like us from a High Times article
Particles I be grindin' up into Hash
I put some on yo' blunt if you come up with the stash
So take it to the head as a gift from coupe
But if I share wit' a bitch Ima' be fuckin' her ass
Stay havin' sessions and my ends is plenty
So when I'm smokin' my friends is wit' me
Make 'em feel a slow breeze
Cuz' I blow trees like the Windy City
Lemme' call up the weed man
Cuz' if I hear he got new shit we on it
Me and you could hook up and go get a ounce
And I got two-fifty on it
You might also like
[Chorus: Twista]
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
Puffin on that dro (puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
And the puffin on that dro (and the puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
Im extra blowed, top flo' in the double tree in the Chi-Town
Where I'm smokin' this Kush shit back to back
Got me rippin' track to track
Like Webbie say "Where that real at?"
That one-hit and you feel that
I know I'm a dog I done smoked that Train Wreck I ain't done yet
Ima' smoke 'till I hurt my.. chest
On the East Coast they feed me mayne
Put me wit' the Diesel mayne
Got me in New York eatin' everythang
Even try the Jamaican Kush, stick to the bag
Put my whole trick on his ass
Don't like to brag but I smoke
Choke on the best of the best
I be higher than giraffe pussy when I'm up in the West
I'm talkin' tired, I'm so high
Man, I done smoked that piss cat
Smell good lemme' hit that
That's why Micheal Phelps did that
[Chorus: Twista]
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
And the puffin on that dro (and the puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
And the puffin on that dro (and puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)3Embed
