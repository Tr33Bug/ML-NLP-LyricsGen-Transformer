Frum Da Tip of My Tongue Lyrics[ Lyrics taken from CD-Booklet ]
[Verse 1: Twista]
Droppin' a flow like this be breakin' the suckers
And rippin' the rhythm and showin' I'm bringin' the feel of my tongue
And be makin' em manifest that I be rockin' the young
Flowin' this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin' the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin' em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin' complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin' up from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over that'll be stung
[Hook]
(How was the rhyme brung?)
Frum the tip of my tung (7X)
(How was the rhyme brung?)
Frum among the tip of my tung

[Verse 2: Twista]
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin' the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin', but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin' this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin'
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
Flowin' this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by
When I'mma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee
Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T
Steppin' and then I'mma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee
Rockin' and me stylin', rockin' and me stylin', wildin'
Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco
Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in em like a photo
Funky, funky, funky stylin', wildin'
I'mma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar
Flowin' a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin' em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah

[Verse 3: Twista]
Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick I throw in a blister of a body
Breakin' em up so quick that I can even bruise hair
Rhythm will rock blocks and funky track drops
Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearin' this
Do I hear a 'knock-knock who's there'?
Twista breakin' 'em off in a magical rhythmus manifestation of a lyrical racin'
Chasin suckers that my funky rhythm elects
Wrote this, quote this, notice how I wreck
My funky hocus pocus broke his neck
