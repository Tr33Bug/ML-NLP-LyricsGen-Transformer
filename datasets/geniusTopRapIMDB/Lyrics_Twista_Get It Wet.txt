Get It Wet Lyrics[Verse 1: Twista]
Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Magnificent ways to light your life up like an arsonist
Put my heart in this
Ticklin' you funny but when we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
Hope that you stayin' alone
I'm into givin' pleasure echoin' rhythms of my manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong, I'm too grown for games
Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin' I'm strong 'cause you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same
Boldly and bodily fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with
Fuck whoever you was gon' leave with
I'm who you should see shit
I found us some love like Adam and Eve shit
Who you should be with, your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets and your arms
And see, so don't be alarmed
If I make you feel good all over
'Cause I was strapping the bomb
That's 'cause I'm gonna be on
Even though niggas in the hood is all soldiers
You still'll suffer the consequences defenseless
Thinkin' about becomin' my wife
If I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
'Cause I be huggin' you like I'm huggin' the mic
Plus I'm the one that's rubbin' you right
And able to stick my tongue off in your navel and lick 'til you drop
Even though I like to stick to twat
I'm realizin' there's a variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm into learnin' you so pick the spot
I'll get pleasure too but let me hush and make the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet
But don't actin' like its a crime 'cause it hasn't been committed yet
But baby won't you let me get it what? Get it wet
[Chorus: Twista and (Victoria Johnson)]
(Get it wet)
Gimme some Tang and Alizé
Let me tickle your body, after the party we can pleasure
Will you come on, let me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate you body with honey and lick it up, stick it up
After release and let it 'rupt, is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind
What's up? Am I deserving your love?
Just 'cause we up in the club
Don't think you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only one that I be thinkin' of
Gimme a hug, you got me sprung in love

[Verse 2: Ms. Kane]
Last time I heard you was playing with emotions and po' pimpin'
All up in the clubs smokin' doves fuckin' hella women
Now negro, what's your steelo you want to get with me though
Then add up them zeros and lo-dos
You ain't no 'bout them weed needs, (huh?)
Pussy feeds (what?) lex keys (damn!) for Mrs. Kane
See a half is for my mommy, fuck Tommy
He ain't tryin to ask naughty
Smooth head got you right in the bed
You need another lover like you need a hole in the head
Instead of all this talkin' let your tongue do the walkin' on down this clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild hundreds bitch
Ain't that some shit?
Guaranteed to get you wet, simple kiss from petite lips
It won't take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come and take a little glimpse of the sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse, on the freak shit
What you know about this slick clit
Send you in a thang when you feel this
Bitch, far from a virgin and sip a Burbon get the derb
And leave you hurtin' for certain
Steady splurgin' when I'm servin', get you wetter than a Persian
The X-rated version
I'm urgin' but I ain't thinkin' you can get it yet
But if you good in a minute you can get it what? Get it wet

[Verse 3: Twista]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Got to be more careful don't hurt 'em girl, you sexy when you mad
Then nigga come hurt me baby wet me with a splash
Aggressive loving I've never had
As I enter the scene with bedroom eyes, Obsession cologne on, Nautica robe on
Flamin' up, trippin' while stanky roll on
Herringbone on gettin' my pose on to the dome strong
Take a sip of liquor, I'm on bone
Huggin you like I ain't seen you in so long,  what's up girl?
I execute my unique approach who I be the most
Willin' to learn and try to be like I got some experience
If you need a coach or we can ride tonight
And kick it like the homies, who? Me and only you
Smoke Bs up like a cigarette 'till I can only see a silhouette
And even though you won't admit it yet
I can tell what time you eventually'll wanna let me get it what?
Get it wet
[Chorus: Twista and (Victoria Johnson)]
(Get it wet)
Gimme some Tang and Alizé
Let me tickle your body, after the party we can pleasure
Will you come on, let me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate you body with honey and lick it up, stick it up
After release and let it 'rupt, is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind
What's up? Am I deserving your love?
Just 'cause we up in the club
Don't think you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only one that I be thinkin' of
Gimme a hug, you got me sprung in love2Embed
