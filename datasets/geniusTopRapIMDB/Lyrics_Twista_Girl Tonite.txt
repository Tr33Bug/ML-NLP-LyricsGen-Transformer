Girl Tonite Lyrics[Intro: Jim Jonsin & Trey Songz]
Yeah, uh, it's your boy Jim Jonsin in this
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Ay baby

[Hook: Twista & Trey Songz]
When I touch her she like, oh, when I hug her, oh-oh
When I rub her she like, oh, when we cut it's like, oh-oh
Then she got me sayin', "Girl, tonight"
When I touch her she like, oh, when I hug her, oh-oh
When I rub her she like, oh, when we cut it's like, oh
Then she got me sayin', "Girl, tonight"
[Verse 1: Twista & (Trey Songz)]
It's getting late, lil mama, we been in the club too long
Let me take you out to my home, tell me what a nigga gotta do to get you out that thong
When are you gon' really make up ya mind shorty? See Twista work that steel
Now can I get up in it from behind shorty, show you what I'm workin' with
Come on, let me take you to the penthouse suite
Pull out some old school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat
Now shorty come in, show me you can take it boo
(Lemmme fuck you first now girl)
Show me what you can do
(Come and fuck me reverse now, girl)
Doing things that'll get you gone, when we on the couch I can make you moan
Eat you up when we in the kitchen, let you get on top when we by the stove
When she told me to do it faster, that's when I dug deeper
Now every time I see her, I gots to freak her 'cause

[Hook: Twista & Trey Songz]
When I touch her she like, oh, when I hug her, oh-oh
When I rub her she like, oh, when we cut it's like, oh-oh
Then she got me sayin', "Girl, tonight"
When I touch her she like, oh, when I hug her, oh-oh
When I rub her she like, oh, when we cut it's like, oh
Then she got me sayin', "Girl, tonight, yeah"


[Verse 2: Twista & Trey Songz]
Make her feel like she popped the pill, got her feelin' ecstasy
Took her to the bedroom, about to make her an Overnight Celebrity
I finna get up in the sack and I hope you ready for me girl
Finna hit it from the back, while I'm bumpin' "Ready for the World"
I want you to hold me, while I'm kissin' all over ya body slowly
Give it to you like a O.G, in and out
In, out, show me how you work them walls
Up, down, show me how you work them jaws
And in the bed when the faucet run, you will catch that drain
That's why I love gettin' freaky with you 'cause you's a nasty thang
Shorty, please, let's ride
In, out, show me how you work them walls
Up, down

When I touch her she like, oh, when I hug her, oh-oh
When I rub her she like, oh, when we cut it's like, oh

[Bridge: Twista & (Trey Songz)]
Hit it to that Joceci, hit it to that Jagged Edge
Hit it to that New Edition, get you get that cool it boo
(Don't you worry 'bout a damn thang no)
See how I do it, to it when I sip some do it to it fluid
Hit it to some Isley Brothers, hit it to some Sade
Hit it to some R. Kelly, and hit it to some Marvin Gaye
(Don't you worry 'bout a damn thang no)
When I touch her she like
See how I do it to it, gotta sip that fluid

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Said, don't you worry bout a damn thing
No, no, no, no, no, no, girl
When I hug her, when I love her
When I touch her she like ooh4Embed
