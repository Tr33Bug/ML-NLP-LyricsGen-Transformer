Hope Ft. Faith Evans Lyrics[Verse 1: Twista]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride, And I (I wish)
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on!!!
Let's HOPE!
[Chorus (Faith Evans)]
Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful! Hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

[VERSE 2 (Twista)]
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac' that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2*, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's HOPE

Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful!

[VERSE 3 (Twista)]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King "Why can't we all just get along"
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE
[Chorus (Faith Evans) X2]
Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,(let it take you away)
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay. (i know it ain't easy)
Cause we hopeful!2Embed
