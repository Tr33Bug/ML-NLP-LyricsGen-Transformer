Kill Us All Lyrics[Intro]
Here I am motherfuckers, thought I was gone, huh?
Oh, y'all just gonna take my shit and run with it, huh?
Oh I gotta get you, I got to get you, my adrenaline still pumpin'
Kamikaze style, I feel like, I feel like
I feel like

[Verse: 1]
Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters
Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist
Bloody tears in my eyes
Hit the switch making sure any motherfucker in the vicinity blow away and die
Kill 'em off with an explosion, get up bitches
Kamikaze on you hoes, I'm the sacrificial lamb
Feelin' fury flow out of every follicle in my body
While you decompose, die with a blunt of dro in yo hand
I'm uppin' the itchy for fuckin' with Twista
If you fuckin' with me, come and bet fifty
'Cause it won't be an issue
Got some nuts to come get me
Then boy you gon' get the picture for flamin' my swisher
The hollows penetrate through your tissue
Fuck your fit up with your blood
As I hear the cries of yo homies screamin' revenge
Got no mercy on them either
Go to war with the intentions to annihilate everything you stand for with the death of myself 'cause I'm a believer
The blessings of sacrifice
The messenger who cometh after the Christ
Next one to glisten after ice
Fuckin' with me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life
My brother you can't bring harm with guns, I'm armed with bombs
Fuck all that shit you carry I got your obituary
A motherfuckin' phenomenon, 'cause I'ma come
'Til they put all of us in a cemetery
[Hook]
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

[Verse: 2]
Go to war like I'm untouchable
Yellin' out bloody murder while I'm bustin' you (bustin' you)
Two deadly fingers squeezing twin triggers steady touchin' you
Screamin' like a demon like I'm finger fuckin' you (fuckin' you)
Just put my body in a room with the enemy and I got a grenade
I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch
Pop seventeen sins out the gun clip
Smoking dro so fire I was on ten after one bligg
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin' more blood than a 2000 dracula
Slip the clip in the automatic and get to bustin'
Horrific hollows while you prayin' to Jesus of Nazareth
A seven day theory like Makaveli, flowin' on a track that's scary
With a MAC in the back of the pelle
Spectacular
How could you dare me knowin' I'm already willing to die
I'm comin' back after they bury me
It's time for your confessions, I be the priest
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder
As I start to massacre men with a verbal recital that's colder
Deaths coming closer
As you let kamikaze enter yo body
Careful or you'll die standing vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you
You might also like[Hook]
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us1Embed
