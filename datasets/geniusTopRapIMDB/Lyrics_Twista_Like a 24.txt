[Verse 1: Twista]
Now I could tell from back in the days when we was shawtys in the hood
Dat you was gone grow up to be thick as hell and lookin good
Now you 21 and them thighs, ain't no crunk
Lookin fine as hell like a penny junk up in the trunk
Make a nigga get (Get) what you want
Put dat ass on dubs
Feel it when you get the party crunk
Feel it when you twirk it in the club
Feel it when you get down on the floor
Love when you get down on the low
Feel I wanna jack dat ass wanna bump and get that ho, get that ho
Baby, I just got some 24's and I love to watch 'em spin (Spin)
So let me see you make dat ass roll like my rims
Spinnin' like Omega Jones
Pop dat booty for my squad
Work dat fatty, throw it hard, roll it like a Lowenhart

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You already know hoes down pimps up
When pimpin' step up in the house put ya bitch up
I got a remi bottle instead of a pimp cup
It shine like a summer day when my wrist up
She wanna wave now cuz my nigga Twista
Dissed her then bounced wit her sister
I tell her keep her head down and her hips up
You can keep dat pussy, I'mma tear dem pretty lips up
Let dat ass roll like 24's on a big truck
And ya G-string, let it bounce when da beat bang
Make it drop like dem cars in a G thang
Pull up ya skirt and work it like da hook keep sangin'
[Chorus: Twista]

[Verse 3: Liffy Stokes]
Come on shorty, make dat ass pop
Drop it like a rag top
Shake it likes it's bongo
Stir it up like credit rock
I got a pocket full of tens and dubs
I'm up in the club, drunk as fuck, stuck, lookin' for love
They lookin for dust
And I got dem in gods we trust
A lil game, a lil fame
I'll have em pilin in the church bus
Puffin' da juan dro straight up to the condo
Open the bus doors, head up to the 12th floor
It's bout to crack now, layin' on my back now
She shook one cheek at a time, then dropped it back down
I'm goin through a game
I never knew they name
All I know is when she got low a nigga lost it man

[Verse 4: Twista]
You got my thang on swole, back dat ass up
Girl you got my thang on swole, now make dat ass drop
You got my thang on swole, make dat ass bounce
Girl you got my thang on swole, now make dat ass prompt
Break somethin', shake somethin'
Work somethin', twirk somethin'
Break somethin', shake somethin'
Work somethin', twirk somethin'
Break it, shake it, work it, twirk it
Break it, shake it, work it, twirk it
Break it, shake it, work it, twirk it
Break it, shake it, work it, twirk it
Shawty, lemme see you make the left side move (Side move)
Now let me see you make the right side move (Side move)
Now let me see you make both sides move (Sides move)
Now baby bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

[Chorus: Twista]
Make dat ass roll like a 24 (24)
Lemme see you make dat ass roll like a 24 (24)
Shawty, make dat ass roll like some 24's (24)
Lemme see you make dat ass roll like a 24 (24)
I can make my ass roll like a 24 (24)
I can make my ass roll like a 24 (24)
I can make my ass roll like some 24's (24's)
I can make my ass roll like a 24 (24)

Now drop it (Now drop it) to the floor
Spin it like some stop and go
Drop it (Drop it) to the floor
Spin it like some stop and go
Roll like a 24 (24)
Lemme see you make dat ass roll like a 24 (24)3Embed
