Make a Movie Lyrics[Intro: Twista]
Twista, T-Pain
Lets make a movie baby

[Verse 1: Twista]
Twist got cars, big swagger
I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride
On a journey with the one that you call daddy
Who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon' do something romantic and different
I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when it's in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my H2 up to your H3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So don't be acting like I'm trippin' with a strange ambition
Recording you while you loving me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me
Filming me licking until you say "Cut"
Ready for any footage you wanna get
Ain't gotta call nobody else because
I do my own stunts
Its the X rated version of a box office hit
I see you ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Baby we don't need no script for this
I'mma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie, yeah
Starring you and me, yeah
Baby we don't need no actresses
Let me see what I'm working with, I'mma break your back with this
Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie, yeah
Starring you and me, yeah, yeah, girl

[Verse 2: Twista]
Shawty we gonna make a movie
Got me loving it when I'm feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol
Cause it do some thing to me
She look better than any chick in my perimeter
Sexy; I wish I could film every bit of her
Kiss her neck down to her stomach and then I'mma
Tell her we could be in a personal cinema?
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then
Cause I wanna see how it's coming out and going in
Let you see such a freak in me; I hope this never leak on TMZ
This is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis
I'm yo director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress
Especially when I'm shooting you on a mattress
Shawty straight to the top that's where we headed
And I'mma see my name in the credits
And be the shit if you let it
See somethin' that you not really feeling
Then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sippin' on patron platinum
She knew about the rapping
But didn't know I'd be on acting
Our personal reality show
So there, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)
