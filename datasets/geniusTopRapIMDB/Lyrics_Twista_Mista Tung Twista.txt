Mista Tung Twista Lyrics[Music Video Intro: Twista]
Watch the lyrical flow
Oh! This dope rhythm I throw
Be pump pump pumping 'em up
And I'm ready be bringing 'em up at the height
With this funky tempo I throw, I know
Gotta be stopping the dope hypeness
Stop anyone then I'm bend 'em my lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue
Believe it that I'm hung among
The style I be throwin'
Is takin' em out of the sucker, deliver the lyrical-ism
And scopin' 'em up into a prison
And givin' a lyrical foe thatâ€™ll fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My tongue twista is deaf
First let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic
I'm out to be marvelous
Screamin' and breakin' 'em up
And then makin' 'em breaking the sweat
I be makin' 'em jump and then sit up
And live with this style I be kickin', I'm pumpin' the rhythm
And rocking the palm of the lyrics up under the side
I'm making 'em like I'm a fool
'Cause rhythm I'm bringing into the mic
I'm only give 'em a concept
[Intro: Tyrone Chilifoot]
Heeeey
What's happenin', y'all?
This is Tyrone Chilifoot down with the funky Tung Twista, baby
Three minutes of straight stupid
Straight ignant dope funky stuff for ya, baby
So turn up your radio and get down to the Tung Twista
Kick it gee

[Verse 1: Tung Twista]
Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the Mista Tung Twista
Pumpin' a rhythm, a lyrical styler
My tongue'll be flingin' a funky pile of
Lyrical rhymes that's breakin' 'em off in the mind
I be flowin' 'em, holy I'm
Kickin' the funk of Islam
My lyricals slippin' 'em like petroleum, slowly I'm
Pumpin' the flow of the lyric
I'm breakin' em off with the radical texture
I'm one brother you could never get next ta
Flex your style
I'm gonna give 'em a lyrical pump of the rhythm of Cav
And crackin' 'em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin' 'em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try and wreck
I spark the light over a head and be wakin' 'em up
And then cause a fly effect
I insist ya, lay with the path of my rhythm
And follow me like a scripture
Flowin' this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin' a dent and be leavin' the tracks bent
Steppin' is the lyrical black gent, my Nubian accent
Breakin' 'em up and then makin' 'em take in the smell of my funk
I be kickin' up in 'em and then I'ma give 'em a lick of my
Lyrical lollypop, I'mna bring 'em up into my doctrine
Rock then the rhythm'll makin' the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh
I'm makin' 'em follow the path of a God
And my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin' is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't diss the Tung Twista
Leavin' the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister
Then I'ma let it be known that it's the way that I throw
That's makin' the funk of the lyrical glow
And how I tell it, yo Cav is kickin' a funkedelic flow
And oh my fist'll swing at the rhythm of suckers
Then I'm gonna give 'em a tongue blister
It's the Mista Tung Twista

[Verse 2: Tung Twista]
My tongue is spinnin'
I follow with Allah
And the Father be stoppin' the Cavalier from sinnin'
The lyrical rhythm beginnin' and then in the endin'
I ratatattat tactics, givin' 'em black kicks
Flow of the lyric I'm pumpin' and rappin' 'em up is dope as a crack fix
Wack? It's - funky, I'm greater
Never to step at the lyrical dictator, a state of
Shock is what I put a sucker into, then to mentally
Go with the smell I be stylin', gee, funky is what the scent'll be
Harmin' this? Uh-uh, the Cavalier's kickin' my charm in this
Simply because I'm in this, I'm as dope as a pharmacist
Calmin' this? Hype as a rattle be shakin' and rippin' the rhythm
And breakin' up into a sweat, I be workin' the lyrical servin a sucker
So never come near a lyricist Cavalier - ah
Rock the flow of the lyrical rhythm be shinin' like a mirror
Hear a sucker step at the Twist'
Ya gotta be goin' like this to beat me
The funk of the lyric'll flow from me like peepee
You caught a work of my tongue as I be flowin' like water
Crackin' 'em up with a flow of the sort of slaughter I oughta
To be embracin' Nubian nation, race you
Takin' my tongue you're tastin' a quick pace
And facin' lyrical wastin', Tung'll be cut like Jason, racin'
Tung Twista rock, your lip'll lock
My tongue'll be makin' a tick tick or tick tock to Nubian hip-hop
Flip-flopped a flow when I wrote this
Kickin' and makin' some hocus pocus, focus
Tongue'll be flippin' just like this I'm a locus
Givin' a diagnosis for Twisterosis
Crackin' a mouth and them makin' 'em ache
I'ma put 'em up into a coma
You're sniffin' a dope aroma
I'm blendin'
I'm able to break up a sucker that you might send in
The funk of the lyrical rhythm beginnin'
Spinnin' the suckers around like a dollar
Be makin' 'em holler kickin' the funk of a lyrical scholar
I pray to Allah, I'm makin' this funky like I'm a hobo
Throw better than bolo, ya thinkin' that he can battle my solo
I just say oh no 'cause that's a no-no
When I be smellin' the funk of my flow, jo
I'm pumpin' this up and then breakin' this in with a lyrical
Then say haha, take titles then say ta-ta
I'm rippin' and rock 'em then rockin' a rhythm
And ring in my tongue I'ma bend 'em
And flow with a lyric it's steppin' inside 'em
And get with the funk I be pumpin' up in 'em with this and it's the
Yeah - Tung Twista
[Interlude: Tyrone Chilifoot]
Oooooweee
Haa-haa
Boy, if that ain't bad my name ain't Lewis Tyrone Chilifoot, baby
Haa-haa
But we finna [?] the Boogieman [?]
Go head, get 'em

[Verse 3: Tung Twista]
The Boogieman was speaking, he said: what's up Mista Twista
Don't you know that Nubians ain't never supposed to whisper
Talkin' behind my back is makin' it seem like it's a rumor
So tell me face to face when you will decide to come to Juma
Don't say your name backwards because you don't like Cav
Played to the left by def and I'm gonna eff up the right half
The sucker descendant of Canaan, I'ma let my pizzazz wreck
I'm speakin' this to the devil that calls his self an Aztec
You ain't a Puerto-Rican, know what I'm speakin'
Islam you're seekin'
You might as well open the doors of a church and become a deacon
Don't step to me, speakin' the pep to me about what your rep'll be
Crept to me because I let them see that you had leprosy
Them suckers that be dissin' me I simply just insist ya
Stop steppin' against the Mista Tung Twista

[Outro: Tyrone Chilifoot]
He-heeey
Now that was bad, baby
But if you think that was somethin'
Wait 'till you hear the album
He-he-hey
I like to give a shout to my son, Tyler Witfoot
And get out to Eric the Wiz
Cavalier, of course Cavalier, it's his album
Ha-ha, [?]
My man, I'ma tell 'ya
Kooley
And the DJ Cut
And the whole entire hip-hop nation
We Audi 5000
Take the mic, y'all
Ha-haa
