Misunderstood Lyrics[Intro: Yung Buk]
The F scale is used to describe the intensity of tornadoes or twisters, and the damage they cause
Categories F0 through F4 describe damage ranging from light to devastating
However, category F5 describes total damage
Framed homes are lifted from their foundations
And carried hundreds of miles to disintegrate
Automobiles fly through the air like missiles, trees are debunked
Reinforced concrete structures are destroyed, incredible phenomenon
And a whole lot of fucked up shit will occur, for example

[Verse 1: Yung Buk]
Yeah... of course...
Okay, okay
It's safe to say that I walk a fine line between good and evil
This is a fine time
For me to be trying to explain what's going on inside my mind
Nigga, I don't see no, other kind of solution
To let these problems loose
Therapeutic, the music is sort of a masseuse
To massage my mental so I won't lose it
Sometimes I can't help myself, myself got a mind of its own
Buk cannot accept this Jeff
And then Jeff want Buk to die and be gone
Both supposed to be occupyin' the same time, and the same space
But no, just me goin' out of my sane mind
[Verse 2: Twista]
They don't really know how I feel
What the fuck is wrong with the muh'fucka
Twista is the nigga off of a pill
Is he off of wet? Is he off of syrup?
Something deep with Formula 44 of Benadryl?
'Cause a nigga finna kill
Misunderstood 'cause I'm passin' whatever disaster
It's not 'cause I'm blasphemous
I leave a nigga body bloody like
Passions of Christ with a mask and a knife
Go blast with the mic
If His prophecy the first shall be last
Then I am the future, you are a primitive
Morph-ism, a scorpion, these shoes are venomous
The new artillerist
And you don't really wanna start from Genesis
And you don't really wanna spark the nemesis
Get loose if it's a crucifix, I put you on it for murder boy
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

[Verse 3: Yung Buk]
Yeah, all those that relate then you can feel my pain
Tryna walk straight away from the hatred
That I hold deep down inside, quiet
I wait, I never talk shit about a nigga biz
'Cause a nigga's his, and besides that
I ain't no fuckin' kid, you bitch
You really know it coulda done and been some shit
There could have been a minutes
That's we really could of plenty through
But all of this bitchin' cleanin' shit
Seven-hundred million in the plastic
I just consider it all as destiny
Manifestin' itself, no fin' to shit
Steppin' over holes, watching my steps
You don't know what I been through bitch
You might also like[Verse 4: Twista]
Yet I get money like I'm Pitbull, rich
Then when I hear an instrumental, I get into it
Feel a mental glitch
Then I gotta cut a motherfucker like a Ginsu bitch
After that I'm nothing be held to love
Especially if I feel with Beelzebub
Instead of the Holy Divine, I be outta my mind
And I would detail a thug

[Chorus: Twista & (Yung Buk)]
(I'm a misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Kurt Cobain
An expert on pain, you fear it, I got lyrics
And a pistol that'll hurt your brain
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Tyler Durden
I can fuck a nigga up as [?] my body with flames
And never feel the fire hurt me
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
Like I would be only black ain't walk too weak
What I do for the hood is for the good, O.G. swag nigga
Don't talk when I speak
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
King Neal, Willy Lloyd, and Angelo Roberts
When it come to a flow, you think your man go hard
But shit, this man'll go harder
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
[Verse 5: Twista]
I'm about to fuck shit up
Got me rippin' through your body like a natural disaster
Moving like a torpedo with the speed and the vengeance of a killer
If you looking for a murderer, I'm the master motherfucker
I'm about to tear shit up
With heat from a thermometer
Go get your momma to pay for the burial
I'm an astonishing, inter-planetary
Devouring everything from Earth to Andromeda, they feelin' me
'Cause I'm about to fuck shit up
Like Freddy after Jason with a fascination for a laceration
And congratulations for eradication
Because I know ain't no vaccination for decapitation
At a rapper pacing, I'm about to tear shit up
Because I take hits with that purple like I am a Viking
Call me lyrical-ution
I run with a mob of wolves like I am a lycan
Some off the top, some I am writin'
And if you ain't strapped, iron, we fightin'
Can't rock by me, runnin' through the middle of the field
With that white like I am a titan
Niggas never know what Twista be on
Low key nigga fuckin' with a bitch from the hood
I insist that I talk to the psycho psychiatrist
'Cause I'm misunderstood

[Verse 6: Yung Buk]
Doctor I'm problematic, tryna withdraw from always lawlessly Resolvin' all of my static 'cause I know God is calling me
But not to come home yet
Basically about the own set
Of blessings from the seeds that I've sown
Some yet might not be up on yet
But any anyhow niggas tryna pin me down
With bullshit I'll try to keep it moving
Until they fuck up and I distribute the blaow!
'Cause I'm bound by law, pure Chicago crown by the bosses
On Scuva Streets my project window down town office
All I want is my music, my money, my muh'fuckin'
Shit to be viewed among the elite, not to sleep I was thuggin'
I'm just a good nigga, up to no good nigga
Suburbs to the hood I wish you fuckin' would nigga

[Chorus: Twista & (Yung Buk)]
(I'm a misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Kurt Cobain
An expert on pain, you fear it, I got lyrics
And a pistol that'll hurt your brain
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Tyler Durden
I can fuck a nigga up as [?] my body with flames
And never feel the fire hurt me
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
Like I would be only black ain't walk too weak
What I do for the hood is for the good, O.G. swag nigga
Don't talk when I speak
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
King Neal, Willy Lloyd, and Angelo Roberts
When it come to a flow, you think your man go hard
But shit, this man'll go harder
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)1Embed
