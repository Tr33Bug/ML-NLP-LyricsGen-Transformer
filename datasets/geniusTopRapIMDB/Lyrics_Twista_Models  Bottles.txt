Models & Bottles Lyrics[Hook: Jeremih]
Drinks up in the air
To the sky, ain't tellin' what going on tonight
Drinks up in the air
For the realest nigga livin' tonight
Damn keys, they goin'
They won't turn up
Know all them bad bitches, they love me
Well them drinks is on us
They all can't help it
Models, actresses and bottles
Bro, chillin' with my niggas
Models, actresses and bottles
[Verse 1: Twista]
It's a celebration bitches
Throw 'em up if you're a mission
Put your hands in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
You went from rags to riches and I get it cause you on
Partyin' like you ain't never had nothin'
Middle fingers in the sky for the haters
You ain't never really been up on my level so don't try to holla
When you see me ridin' out of Vegas, whew
Cause I be poppin' the bottles because I'll be able
Just look at my table
There's nothin' but models and nothin' but dollars
Lookin' at momma
She wanna holla, she wanna follow, she wanna swallow, whew
After the fee fee
I got insta plans, she wanna see me
I gain insta fans when I be me
I'm on Instagram in a GT
What? That's right
I'mma fuck with her for the night
I don't give a fuck what you like
I'm up in the club but I'm right
Let her know that we are the family
We on the pedigree, we are celebrities
And you know I'm smokin' weed and I'm ready
Like I be at the Grammys, the party is heavy
And I got the fetti
And I'm off a Xanny and she got the panties

Drinks up in the air
To the sky, ain't tellin' what going on tonight
Drinks up in the air
For the realest nigga livin' tonight
Damn keys, they goin'
They won't turn up
Know all them bad bitches, they love me
Well them drinks is on us
They all can't help it
Models, actresses and bottles
Bro, chillin' with my niggas
Models, actresses and bottles

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Okay I walk up in the club, I be fresh to death
All black, dressed to kill
Bumpin' on my hip? Baby that's the steel
Bitches so I keep that concealed
And that .45 got a lotta kickback
When it go click-clack
Make a nigga get back
Shawty in the red dress, make her ass clap
Take her to the back cause I'm tryna hit that
Lil chick wanna be a model, ay
Took her to the back, made her swallow
And I just bought 20 bottles
The Ros√© got me goin' full throttle
She know a young nigga got a check, check, check
Condos sittin' on my neck, neck, neck
25 racks sittin' in my right pocket
Some tight jeans, Bibby can't dress like that
[Bridge]
Wherever we go, hoes follow
I go be with killers and robbers
.40, filled up them hollows
We gon' clap like Apollo
On and on, can't help it
All of these bitches, I share 'em
All of my niggas is thugs

[Hook: Jeremih]

Well them drinks is on us
They all can't help it
Models, actresses and bottles
Bro, chillin' with my niggas
