Next to You Lyrics[Intro: Twista]
Yeah
Twista
What up?
(I wanna get next to you)
Jeremih
Tell her
Uhuh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna get next to you
Tonight I got my Christian Dior's on
On my new Spider from Zone
I got a couple dollars and yeah
I just gotta, I just gotta
Text her what she on
And she text back "I'm alone"
Yeah, you know ain't no questions baby
I wanna get next to you
[Verse 1: Twista]
What's up lil' mama? Could you tell me your name?
I'm in all white, cocaine, so flame
Is what I'm smoking on when I
Think about it when I'm looking at your body when I see you cause I really wanna come close
So fly and I want you the most
Let's have a toast, drinks on me
Summertime, drop top, wintertime, minks on me
Too cold, I'm hoping that really want me cause I
Be at you cause wanna get next to you
In the back of the Phantom, or the club in VIP or at the bar
When I see you I feel like I'm looking at a star, up to par
Just so fly
Having dreams of you being mine, cause I'm just so high
Telling all my boys that you chose me and left yo' guy
Magnificent situation, I'm so glad that I bumped you
Intense, let me close up this tense distance between us two
Cause I don't wanna go hard like I wanna have sex with you
I'ma take my time and let you know (I wanna get next to you)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna get next to you
Tonight I got my Christian Dior's on
On my new Spider from Zone
I got a couple dollars and yeah
I just gotta, I just gotta
Text her what she on
And she text back "I'm alone"
Yeah, you know ain't no questions baby
I wanna get next to you

I think you sexy, ain't no need for the faking
Could you tell me, is this seat taken? If it ain't then can I sit down?
Compliment her like a gentleman because I know that there's fly shit there
All the time in the back of my mind I wanna say "that's my shit there"
With the swag of a diva, hot but not too flamboyant
Wishing I could communicate with her through clairvoyance
Telepathy and I could really tell her what I feel about her when I have a thought
Pretty skin and your lips look so soft, don't talk, shhh, be quiet
Could you tell what I be thinking about when you see my eyes?
They say I'm looking at you like prey
And I'm a lion and I'm finna make a move
Cause I really wanna see her on my arm a lot
Tryna be her friend, I'ma become so close I'll be her confidant
But, play hard to get and tell me why don't I just go
Well I think you are the shit so (I wanna get next to you)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna get next to you
Tonight I got my Christian Dior's on
On my new Spider from Zone
I got a couple dollars and yeah
I just gotta, I just gotta
Text her what she on
And she text back "I'm alone"
Yeah, you know ain't no questions baby
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
[Outro: Jeremih & Twista]
And when you call me
That's right
And I'm gon make sure I'll be on my way next to you baby
I wanna get next to you
Wanna be close to you baby
I  wanna get next to you1Embed
