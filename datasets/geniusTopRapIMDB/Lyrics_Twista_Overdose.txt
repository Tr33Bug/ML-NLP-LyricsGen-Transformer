Overdose Lyrics[Intro]
Shit, niggas got me higher than a motherfucker off up in here, man
Damn, the fuck y'all get this weed from
Motherfucker overdose or some shit off this shit, god damn
Check this shit out, though

[Verse 1: Twista]
Now pussy player haters say that I'm too raw with it
But y'all thinking 'cause I be talking shit
Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell
Fuck what the punks are talking 'bout
I want to get up with that big baller bitch
Plus niggas feeling what I'm on as well
Blunts got my mind in the zone
The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pelle's
True to the shine on his bone
Somebody beating up the block on fresh rider rims
If it's me, hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome
Crying on the phone
Ho thinking I'm in love with her
'Cause she took me shopping and had me trying on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed 'cause she firing up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick
Off of some illy shit
Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split
And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips
And MAC 10s, I lit the B from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing, shit, nigga, what's happening?
The sess got me tripping off the drums and guns, ready for action
Duck and swing or either up a thang
Try to be tougher, bang, scuff and hang
Suffer pain, left deranged then you's a bogus muh'fucker, man
Since the B struck a vein, I'm too strange
For muh'fuckers to compete with
I'm on some infra-red heat shit
With a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit
Well, if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick
'Til she's seasick; blocking niggas out like an eclipse
When smoking them devils put your hands together
Like you know the host
'Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist
Leaving niggas comatose from my overdose
[Hook: Twista]
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me B's just so they can hang

[Verse 2: Twista]
Can you figure out the cause and effect
Niggas coming on your set
Thugs coming out they drawers with a TEC
Victim bleeding from the neck
Shirts is getting wet, shorties yelling threats
Looking for the one who called for the deck
Now they airing out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs, leaving niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a Glock
Searching for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawling for rocks
Going all in the socks of the recently deceased
From what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind being increased by inner beef
With some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf
I'm snapping hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but can't annihilate him
Picking up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still jumping 'cause adrenaline pumping is a motherfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered by bud-lovers, making sure every one of you ho studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two Glocks
You would still die or you'll get too hot
'Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop
Hypes is tricking on you
Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks
'Cause when my tool click you'll pop
Can't this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous
Making musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazareth
Yet disastrous, smoking on halves and hash, fuck if it's cancerous
Bust ass simply because I mastered this
It's hard to breathe, I'm busting like an A-Bomb
'Cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve
It's hard to stay calm thinking about the bitches that I'm finna bone
Hitting my enemies and competition up with lethal blows
That's damaging, flows that's callous and we're leaving
Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panicking
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handling
Now it's possible motherfuckers could start vanishing
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty and stinking from stress
And flowing over notes; them studs thinking they can get close
I know I got you tripping off the shit
A nigga said off a overdose

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me B's just so they can hang

[Verse 3: Twista]
C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties
That's full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me in case we get in some static
And gotta start leaking blood from stud skinnies
So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It can't be nickel or soft the way it's choking me
Potency'll have me rocking mics
And giving your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hooking the law
You're looking in awe, took what you saw
Got the B's, pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to biting and formulating some shit you called your own
But take it to the rehab 'cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you ain't cold enough
Tripping out like you can't control the stuff
Lacking rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
Get a swisher and roll this up
If you think I'm speaking too bold, what's up
I ain't even on no ho shit, plus the mob is so thick
I'm the type of nigga you shouldn't want to get up close to
And take a smoke with
If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick
I be tweaking with speaking, releasing energy to show I know the ropes
'Cause when it comes to this rap shit
Niggas will choke 'til I'm ghost
While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test, give me some Buddha bless
I'll show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy
Alright, T, god damn slow it up, man
Motherfuckers' done felt you, man, we can go to the next shit
God damn, man, you stopping motherfuckers and shit
Man, I'm trying to get my zone on
Let niggas hear what the fuck I'm doing man
I mean, you done zoned man, let's go to the next cut baby
Man, fuck that shit1Embed
