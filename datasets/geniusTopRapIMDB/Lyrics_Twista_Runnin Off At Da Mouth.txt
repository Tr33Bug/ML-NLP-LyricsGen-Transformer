[Verse 1: Sinister Def]
Runnin'
My lyrics are cunnin', vocabulary is stunnin', son of a gun and
I'm ranking at one, making it fun and taking my gun and loading
Exploding, causing harm, popping and dropping a bomb
Breaking it down like Imam, so be calm, 'cause see, I'm
The capable, no mistakable, making the unbreakable breakable
Able to hook 'em like cable 'cause Sinister Def ain't stable
No deceiving and weaving a web, I be leaving a stain in your brain and busting your vein
Picking and kicking a style I be licking and shaking and baking and making it rain
Simple and plain, I smoke 'em like hickory dickory dock, it's time to clock
So brothers I mop, the bigger they drop, so stop, Tung Twista, pop
[Verse 2: Tung Twista]
Gotta be that it be lyrical hip-hop
Rocking a rhythm, I'mma stop-drop, I'm gonna give 'em a pop
Flowing this up and breaking the suckers up off of the mic and then rip it to shreds
I be kicking and making the people come off in a rage
And my lyrical magic I'm making and moving, I label this funky
Oh, this dope rhythm I throw be pump-pump-pumping 'em up in the mind
And be bringing 'em up into hypeness
This funky tempo I throw, I know that I be slapping the dope hypeness up in 'em
And then I'mma bend 'em a lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue, be leaving 'em hung among
This style I be throwing to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism and scoping 'em in a prism
And giving a lyrical flow that'll fizz 'em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def, first, let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic of mine I be mopping and sweeping
And breakin' 'em up and then makin' 'em break in a sweat
I be makin' 'em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kicking and popping the rhythm I'm rocking and pumping
The lyrics I put up inside 'em be making 'em rock
And a flow of the rhythm I'm bringing into the mic
I'm gonna give 'em a concept, never let a con step
To what I be giving the crowd that be making 'em hype and then leaving a con swept
Breaking the suckers up into chunks, I be leaving 'em sinking deeper than south
I'm gonna twist this up funky, T.T. be runnin' off at the mouth
(Indeed)

Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth

[Verse 3: Sinister Def]
Listen to the tongue twist, twisting is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible, tragical, mystical, magical, wreck in a second
The ladies I'm checking and trickin'
You think that I'm sickenin', hoes be kickin' in when I stick it in
I got the enemy jumping like Jiminy like it was ten of me
Try to be friend of me, sucking my simile
If I'm ill, then give me the remedy
I'm baking like Daxon, waxin', giving 'em facts just like a lawyer
'Cause Sinister Def be runnin' off at the mouth like Latoya
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
Come again
[Verse 4: Tung Twista]
Here I be coming, a radical phenomenon fillimeter
Be making a magical matter be that I be
Ratatattat come flow with my tongue energy, I
Crush them, them can't overcome the power to hum
And then breaking the minimum competitor, G
Miracle metamorphosis is breaking 'em off in this
Lyrical matter becoming a rhythmous venomous pop quiz
I'm rocking this as of his and cracking 'em up with a plop fizz
Lyrical wiz, never a wannabe, gonna be ripping 'em up into particles
Then I'mma come in the pitiful puppet's mind
Seeking a rhythm and you shall find
Rocking the funk of the rhythm, me stamina cramming 'em up in a T-line
Be di-vine, me lyrical purrrrfection, a funky feline
Capping a crowd with the mic and then making 'em mangle
Pumping a fist, they tangle
Lyrics so funky even Bojangles
Leaving angels, spinnin' my tongue
And if you never coming to cheer me, I say cheerio, hero
Me rhythm will float like a boat, let's see how he flow
My freedom of speech I'mma reach up against your lyrical flowing, a styler
Jamming and dropping a rhythm and popping 'em up with the funk of a wilder
Holy sorcerer oughta come get with the funk of a slow solo
Bolo wanna throw but I show that a funky pro go, still wanna flow? Oh no
Slo-ow, oh-oh, I step when sending men deeper than south
Lyrical Sinister Def and T.T., we be G running off the mouth

[Hook]
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth1Embed
