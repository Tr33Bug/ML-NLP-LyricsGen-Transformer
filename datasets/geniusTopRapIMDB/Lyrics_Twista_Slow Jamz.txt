Slow Jamz Lyrics[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Are you going to be, say that you're gonna be

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She say she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton, will definitely set this party off right
Yes it well, oh yes it will
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yes it will, it definitely will! You know what I told her?
I told her to "Drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie, like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She say she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton, will definitely set this party off right
Yes it well, oh yes it will
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
And it's good, it's all good, it's beautiful, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can preferably find that I'm a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Isleys
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of "Roll It Slow"
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me, Chi ride

[Verse 3: Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that, then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I, take you to my home
We can get it on, disconnect the phone
Trying to get you gone, I'mma make you moan
And I'll do it (Well well well well)32Embed
