So Sexy Lyrics[Intro: R. Kelly]
Uhh, uhh (Uh-huh) uhh
Yeah, this is for all the sexy ladies out there (Uh)
Walkin' around downtown
Shoppin' at the malls (Yeah) yeah

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Ladies! (You're so sexy) So sexy!
Uhh, you got the Gucci purses
(Perfect for me) Yeah, and I like you

Your hair is did, yeah, I see you
[Verse 1: Twista]
My ladies that be steady sippin Cris'
Always lookin nice, put some ice on they belly or they wrist
Girls that be thick off in they thigh, I wanna kick it in the Chi
They gon' be fuckin with some Kelly and the Twist'
Baby now look, model girls, Gucci and Prada girls
And all the ghetto divas in the hood
Women that be steady stackin' ends, rollin' Lexus or Benz with rims
And know how to keep it lookin' good
Workin' with ya fine thick ass
Somebody gon' snatch you so I gotta make you mine quick fast
See I come and pass, I don't really wanna wonder
So I gotta put her numbers in my Sidekick fast
Rollin with ya mob, workin' hard, gettin' money, pullin' capers
If I ain't got papers, you will bring me some beans home
Supervisor givin' orders on the job
But you still lookin' good with them skin-tight jeans on
Lookin' hot in them heels, I think I want that
Come and back it up to the bottom of my throwback
When you rollin' yo' rims, clickin' like a Kodak
When I drive, I wanna smoke, she'll roll that
Miss mobstress rollin' with the hardest
Holdin' it down like a female Joe Pesci
And I wanna make her a made woman
I hope she gon' let me, 'cause she looks so sexy

Me and my clique was rollin' thick on 24's on a dirty lick
Met a chick, lookin' fine and her measures was
36-24-36, come here shorty
Ain't no reason to be scared of us
Lovin' how you do your own thang
And how you smokin' on your own flame
Lookin' finer than a girl that be groovin' on Soul Train
I tried to to hit her with some cold game
I hope she (Feel me) try to holla at a shorty
Get a better vibe with her while I'm sippin' on my (Henny)
I wanna kiss her on her body
But I gotta make her holla while I'm givin' her (The D)
Gotta really love a girl, they know how to kick it
But she know she gotta make that (Money)
Goin shoppin' for the minks and the leather
But come back and bounce that ass (For me)
My East coast girls, that's what's up
Tell my Southside shorty we can get it crunk
My Cali girl make it bounce like a six-fo'
My Chi girl bust down niggas straight buck
When I see up all the girls that get down for hers
I gotta get up wit her if she gon' let me
Career woman with some goals, fuck the broke-ass hoes
Baby girl 'cause you look so sexy
