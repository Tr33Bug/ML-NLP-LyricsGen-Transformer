Still Feels So Good Lyrics[Intro]
This goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that player ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood
And it feels so good

[Verse 1: Twista]
One morning I
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick
Feeling fucked up, flicked out, freaked on
Thinking about my new truck with the deep dish
Meaning deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome
After a massage and a menage, we got in the shower
Let water trickle down the brack of the cack of they booty
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom
One put on prada, one put on Ludi, I put on Gucci
Duty calls, I'm about to hit the scene and ball
But before I leave I spray on some Issey Miyaki
Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak
So I can sip some while I split one
Chronicle enter ever follicle of my body
Calming down every molecule, making sure I don't trip none
Hit one
Hop in the ride, come and kick it with me
So I can take you through the so-and-so hundred block
And show you how my people be kicking it in the windy city
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch
While we sit on leather gripping wood
Where the hustlers got packs and the G's got stacks
And the pimps got 'Lacks, rolling through the hood
And it feels so good
[Hook: Jazze Pha]
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good

[Verse 2: Twista]
Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twenty's, flip twenty one's
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours
Mega balling, new clothes
Momma got a new store, TV screens, hundred-forty spokes
And we finna roll, right off madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus
Sipping Henny rolling reckless, feeling so motherfucking good I could roll my vehicle to Texas
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sippers
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words thicker
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand
When it come to spitting rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfucking man
Get the love, when I hit the club gotta begin, it's the weekend and the DJ bumping tattoos
Track move like some southern black blues, or like the coupe that got cruise
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap dude
Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood
You could go around the block or travel the whole world, when you come back it's still your hood
And it feels so good
You might also like[Hook: Jazze Pha]
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good

[Twista]
I spit some game wit the intellect, to the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Come and take over the world with me girl, if you good I might can see if I can be your manager
Get your career on track and your life on point and I'll show you how your taxes go
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, smocking on some fire, galactic dro
I know it's good when you smoke that fire, puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick
Cop yourself a motherfucking Bently car, cop yourself a motherfucking Bently crib
Pop that ass, throw that dick, twork that thing, bust that nut
Drop that top, turn the bass up, put you a chameleon paint on the truck
Get iced up, bumping Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rolling smooth up in K-Town
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues, if you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the tre-pound
Take the time to kick with your home girls and feel your nuts
Keep on hating on the L, big family we gon' steady come up and imma still smoke good
And it feels so good

[Hook x2: Jazze Pha]
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good
[Outro]
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some1Embed
