Sunshine Lyrics[Intro: Bill Withers]
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

[Verse 1: Twista]
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
Y-yeah, keep my mind on my
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin' on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin' I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi' on Spre's with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block and dodgin' the one time
Peep how we movin' them rocks
And the pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve 16 ounces for 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla, nigga, best not be stalkin'
I gots to get them bigger figures, fuck what you talkin'
I represent the niggas ballin' with jewelry full of sickles
Down to the niggas chasin' million, the dream servin' nickels
And I know one day, I'm gon' come up
And when you see me, don't hate that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'caine
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get some money, mayn
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

[Verse 2: Twista]
A hustler's definition is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
I got a clip full of hollows, money-makin's my motto
Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle 'til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin' a record label, flippin' words
My nigga flippin' buildings better than he was flippin' birds
I got the mentality and the motive, I'm on a mission
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans and follow procedures
Into the 600, blunted with a pocket, full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up
Love when I get that gig, get a crib
Get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin', if I'm sleepin', paper products
Soon as I get up, it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money, mayn
You might also like[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

[Verse 3: Twista]
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I can't legally make a lot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it ain't no work, we do a stick-up and whip up a concoction
Might leave you face down in the dirt
Because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money, mayn

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
When I wake up in the morning, love, ohh-ohh-ohh
And the sunlight hurts my eyes, ohh-ohh ohhh
And something without warning, love, ohh-ohh-ohh
Bears heavy on my mind

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day4Embed
