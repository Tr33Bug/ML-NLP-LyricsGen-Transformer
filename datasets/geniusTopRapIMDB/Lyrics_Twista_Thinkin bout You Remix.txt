Thinkin bout You (Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn’t rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don’t shed tears, but, boy, they pour when I'm thinkin' 'bout you

(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you (You know, know, know)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

[Verse: 2 Twista]
(Twista the Remix)
Beautiful black woman can you accept me?
I'm hoping you never forget me
Touch you wrong I never let my hands let me
Feelings for you as deep as my ancestry
Lookin' at you black as an Egyptian statue
Elegant in stature; got cha; all in my mental
When I feel the energy every memory I still try and capture
Rapture. Beautiful goddess but modest and almost astonishes everybody else that I let you escape my physical
Form and to be especially cause you were warm I was hoping that we would make a commitment that was biblical
Pivotal situation put us in critical consequences
I feel like it was all senseless. Now my pain ,when I'm feelin' all defenseless
Cause I shoulda worked harder for you up in the trenches I'm a be Frank;
Ocean's I think about it comparison when I measure-in the depth of our love
They'll be nothin' above
Sadder than purple rain memory's got me cryin' like a dove
Well do you ever think about it, or did you really forget
I don't think I forgot an hour, What you'd use to look like stepping out the shower
Super sexy when you in a position of power
Spiritual essence of what a real woman is
Let's get in a time machine, I call it music
Hoping I can jog every memory you get subliminal takin' you back forever the way I use it
How I tell the DJ spin it thoughts about you are usually infinite You on my mind is always authentic
When I think about you I be all up in it

Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don’t like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don’t love you, I just thought you were cute
That’s why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don’t get to fly it, though
I’m lyin’ down thinkin’ ’bout you

(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
(You know, know, know)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won’t ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We’ll go down this road
‘Til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)5Embed
