Wetter Lyrics[Intro: Erika Shevon]
I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy? Daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy? Daddy
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee

[Verse 1: Twista]
Now, now, now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, mack daddy with a ho up in the backseat
With a '97 pimp flow, got a feelin
When you smokin when I flip it to a Trax beat
Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter yo' atmosphere
As you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I can't believe that yo' momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul, you need a modelin role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin
From the bottom to the top of the pole, cause you can pop in control
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin it
It's makin me say "What I gotta do to get with that?"
When it come to makin it rain I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin that monkey I can get it wet
You want some media baby you need a better man
He cover politics, I'mma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'mma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin 5000 Ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration, you the champion, here's the fetti confetti
C'mon and get drunk with the money hauler
[Chorus: Erika Shevon]
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee

[Verse 2: Twista]
But when I'm not for the feminine (feminine)
And everybody that proceed with the hatred I'mma teach 'em a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline (adrenaline)
Cause that's the way I receive immunization against the recession
I got the muscle off of my hustle-and-flow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo' money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a lil' bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways
Then I'mma have to beat it up but first I'mma play wit'chu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin and fakin on me baby
Cause I know it take the right touch
I ain't stoppin 'til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin 'til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion (ohh)
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin
Now when I touch your body you catchin convulsions (uh-huh)
That's when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you
You might also like[Chorus: Erika Shevon]
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee

[Outro: Erika Shevon]
I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy? Daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy? Daddy
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee12Embed
