Yo Body Lyrics[Intro: Johnny P]
Now when I touch on yo body babe
And when I grab on yo body babe
When I feel on yo body babe
I say ooh, oooh, oooh (Hell yeah)

[Verse 1 ?]
Can I re-introduce myself
For the city of the Chi, West side ain't it mayne?
Put some flame to the maryjane
Down with the same thang
With main in the left lane, peep game
Put the duck in the ash tray, got on the freeway
Sprayed a lil cologne on the car seats
Then I gotta up wit big d and six freaks
They was thick as hell, you understand me?
I was sipping on Patron about to fade out
Got up wit lil ma, had the whole lick layed out
Put the gucci on the doorseat
Countin some mo gee's, the dice game damn near broke me
So I'm callin fo mo gees's and putting a pound of weed and four b's
My thumper and my door keys
Walked up like she know me I gotta keep it moving
Cause she prolly be the police
So i, got turned tough told her to meet me in the range rove
We ain't gettin money so I gotta go and change clothes
Bumped out wit the same hoes tonight we in the hotel
Cause I got it in the mainfloor
All them looking good, but I wanna hit the main fo
What you think I'm spittin game for?
Cause I talk alotta spots andale, andale, andale, cha cha
[Chorus: Johnny P]
I gotta beg for yo body
Gurl I need yo body
I see you wit my body
Every time I see yo body
I say ooh ooh
If you was a car, girl you'd be a phantom
Yo ass and yo titties
Ain't no tellin if I had them what I'd do
What i'd do, what id do

[Verse 2 ?]
I was chose in this game
To be a cold mothafucka with the fe's and the lad's
Now let the roof all down
While I'm gettin good ol' head smoking trees in the back
You see the mix with the jewels and the stacks
Dont try to pull it, I got goons wit the gats
My money long like a python
Makes yo bitch say fuck it, Imma roll wit the mack
B-low gettin all that dough, B-low gon pimp them hoes
B-low gettin all that show, and my meat gon touch the floor
Mothafucka, get on ?SPIt ROW?
Like I said you already know: P-O P-I-M-P

[Chorus: Johnny P]
I gotta beg for yo body
Gurl I need yo body
I see you wit my body
Every time I see yo body
I say ooh ooh
If you was a car, girl you'd be a phantom
Yo ass and yo titties
Ain't no tellin if I had them what I'd do
What i'd do, what id do

Gurl, you got a banging body like a Bugatti
She got work like a cooking pot (oh!)
She got legs like a potential hit (yes!)
And a frame like a working car
But who the one the women looking spectacular fo'?
Who the one that got the bump in the back of the truck?
Who the one that saw the body wit the booty of a Maserati
While I'm in the party way back in the club
You be kinda reminding me of my gee princess
So I gotta say majesty when I say that
And when I see the way the fatty looking from way back
You be kinda reminding me of a Maybach
You be the type I know I mite kiss
And if I flow it right I know I'm so righteous
And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like the twist;
You gotta flow li-li-li-li like this
So now ima go to the back
Get a cup fill it up wit the drink when I mack on a ho
Triple it up when I get up, I'm on a cut
'cause I be Twist and I'ma kick that spectacular flow
How I spit you know it got the glory
Though it's kinda gory when I come out of the lavatory, lets ride
Ain't no fucking wit the Twista, J.P, Do or Die
You are now wit the Category F5
[Chorus: Johnny P]
I gotta beg for yo body
Gurl I need yo body
I see you wit my body
Every time I see yo body
I say ooh ooh
If you was a car, girl you'd be a phantom
Yo ass and yo titties
Ain't no tellin if I had them what I'd do
What i'd do, what id do

[Outro: Johnny P]
Now when I touch on yo body babe
And when I grab on yo body babe
I say, oooh, oooh (Hell yeah)Embed
