Beef Lyrics
Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when the working folks can't find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies can't find moms
Cause they in a pine box, or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the summer jam for Hot 9-7
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you defendant
Beef: It come with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
To tell you that she pregnant, by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home but you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
You're trying not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicure handout like, "Pay me nigga!"
Or I'm telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangsta ain't doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what ya'll call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happening every day
And it's realer than them songs you gave to Kayslay
This has been a real niggas P.S.A
From Mos Def pretty flaco
