Classic Freestyle Lyrics
Slim, brown skin I be
Standin' 5'10" I be
Rockin' it when I be in your vicinity
Raw style synergy
Recognize symmetry
Comps try to injure me
Broke 'em down chemically
Ain't the number ten MC talkin' 'bout how been I be
Styled it like Kennedy
Late like a ten-to-three
When I say, when I be, girl say "ven aqu√≠"
'Cause this tend to be..
Way out like Tennessee
Take me to a place called the BK
Without pause or delay
Get run like Penn Relay
Don't deal with he-say-she-say
Ain't workin' for no cheap pay
The Mos Def beat play
This what the streets say
Hey, Mr. DJ, play that devil Mo'Gain
That jam got me open!
This how the break get broken
From front, front, side to side, middle to back
Never the wack, I come from Bedstuy, black!
From Louis A-V-E to be exact!
Brooklyn! Where you at!?You might also like3Embed
