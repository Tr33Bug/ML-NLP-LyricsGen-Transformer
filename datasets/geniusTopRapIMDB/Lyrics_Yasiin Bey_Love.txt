Love Lyrics
They say that goodness in life belongs to those who believe:
So, I believe. Yes

I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish
My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness?
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
(Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love)
Yes, yes, y'all, and we don't stop because
You might also like
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme

I got love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e, I emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
(Love, Love) The M-O-S D-E-Finitely

Check it out, y'all (Uh), feel me out, y'all (Say what)
Feel me out, y'all (yeah), hear me out, y'all (Get down)
Check me, out, y'all (Uh, get down, get down)
Feel me out, y'all (Down, down), check it out, y'all
Now hear out (Bounce), y'all
Check me out, y'all (Uh), feel me out, y'all (All around the world)
Check me out, y'all, feel me out, y'all
Feel me out, y'all (Hear me bounce, y'all, get down)
Check me out, y'all, check it out, y'all
My folks said they was in love when they made me
I take the love they made me with to make rhymes and beats
(Can you feel?) The raw deal is all-wheel driven (right)
Contemplate the essence of beats, rhymes and livin'
Speech align with the rhythm (right), designed with the rhythm
Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm
I shine with the rhythm, the Black Star Galactica
You're big number fatin', we ancient like the abacus
After us, I see most proceed to be trees
Sprouting leaves, givin' breeze to the we who believe
I M.C., which means I Must Cultivate the Earth
Straight back, straight facts, heartbeats and hard work
I be the "Funky Drummer" to soften the hard Earth
(Amin) Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
(Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene, and on out to Queens
Uptown To Boogie-down, yo, just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 6-3 (right)
I'm reaching a height that you said cannot be
I'm bringing a light which you said we can't see
Saw the new day comin', it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning; bright, true and living
Ever-changing but sustaining magnificent
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Because...

I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme

I got love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e, to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
Love, l-o-v-e to emcee
Get love, l-o-v-e and I be
(Love, Love) The M-O-S D-E-Finitely
