Oh No! Lyrics
Yeah, one for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great, incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you wanna keep pace
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name, say my name...
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and paved my game
My own two raise my flame, 'cause dickridin' ain't my thang!
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now, I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kids better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin' — as usual, some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day, or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' "Lord Jesus!"
Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's gotta be botherin' y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Pour your pride on the rocks, and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do-or-die stay rumblin' and bubblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East Coast's on your neck, and you ain't shruggin' it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin' off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Gettin' spanked when it's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back do'
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the East to West Coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays/esés
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's, thus, what I vent is just... (Uh!)
What you lust to vent, it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah! Pharoahe Monch'll do ya!
Maintain the same frame of mind — screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here
MCs just come on 'round!
You're the next contestants on "Catch-A-Beat-Down"!
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap — we got it on lock, man, stop that!
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that!
Pharoahe's flows blows shows like Afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg go
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
