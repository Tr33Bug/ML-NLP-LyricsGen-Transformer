Pistola Lyrics
Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'Cause I know you know that I know you know that love is danger

Criminal minded, gangster of love
Charms in your arms, your gun is wild warm
Worn, bang bang, shoot 'em up
Tips in your clip, click-clack, use 'em up
Bad intentions and a very good shot
X marks the spot where you cross the heart
Candlelight vigil on my memory block
Commemorate the date where the bomb got dropped
Love, study war no more
Put your weapon away, quit collecting the slain
She said "You right, I don't wanna fight
I just like the fire and the flashing...lights"
Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'Cause I know you know that I know you know that love is danger

If you are to fall in love
Then where should you stand to begin with?
And when the falling's done
How bad should you plan to get injured?
And if you land on your feet
Do it count as a fall or a jump?
And do it feel like a fall
When the hands that pushed you were holding you up?
Close encounter, got you wide open
Heartache got your boom-box going
Music and vocals, lonely and soulful
You're back at the scene where your sweet dreams sold you

Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
Cause I know, you know that, I know, you know what love is

Cowboys and girls, oh baby
I remember...when we used to play
Cowboys and girls, oh baby
I remember...when we used to play
Cowboys and girls, oh baby
I remember...when we used to play
Cowboys and girls...
Shoot 'em up, bang bang...
Cowboys and girls
Shoot 'em up, bang bang...
We at the movies, and you're a star...
Get down!2Embed
