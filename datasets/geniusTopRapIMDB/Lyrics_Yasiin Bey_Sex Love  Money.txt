Sex, Love & Money Lyrics
Sex, love and money, fun
Brooklyn, sex, love, and money
Get up, come, danger
You are now rockin' with the best
Black Dante exclusive, fire in the dark
Fire in the dark, ghetto let this spark

Freaky black beauty with the party pal
Where you work it out got me fiendin'
Bam, I hit the G ready for the street
Heavy, ghetto sweet breezing through the evening
Bam, I'm on the lounge path for the warm blast
Got the John Shaft cocked back and loaded
Bam, I beat it, word john, body awesome
Is the way that you come that got me goin'
Bam, I'm on the back streets rollin'
I'm playin back all the magic moments
Don't front, you know I got ya, know I got ya
You sneaky freaky, but I know about ya, know about ya
You straight dope, I can't do without ya, go without ya
Lay back and relax you mind, I'm 'bout to
Double the doses in half the time
Ha, master physical, mastermind
You play it quiet but in private that ass is mine
We body rockin' the last of time
And then we, we body rockin' the last of time
And then we, body rockin' the last of time
And then we, her body rockin' huh, her body rockin'
Now shell on one deep it ain't nobody steppin'
Honey shell on ten deep it ain't nobody steppin'
Thousand shell or hundred deep, I'm there the body rockin', come on
I wanna show you in my ghetto miss I'm a star
I wanna show you love, I just can't help myself
I wanna show you in my ghetto miss I'm a star
I wanna show you love, I just can't help myself
Whoooa...whaaa ohh whaaa
Freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky black
Freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky black
Freaky freaky black, freaky freaky black
Sex love and money, fun
Brooklyn, Sex love and money --come
Fun-- temperature's risin'

Freaky black beauty pretty purse and blouse
The way you twerk it out got me leanin' --bam
I hit the streets easy in my seat
Lighting on my feet breezy like the evening --bam
I'm on the lunch pack feel the warm blast
Boogie Bohn Shaft cocked and loaded --bam
Top and bottom, body awesome
Is the way that you come that got me goin' --bam
I'm on the back roads rollin', rollin'
I'm playin back all the magic moments, don't front
She know I got'cha, know I got'cha
You sneaky freaky, but I know about'cha, know about'cha
You goog hurricane, go without'cha, go without'cha
Lay back and relax you mind
I'm bout to, double the doses in half the time, huh
Master physical, mastermind
You play it quiet but in private a-ha a-ha, huh
We body rockin the last of time
And then we, we body rockin the last of time
And then we, we body rockin the last of time
And then we, the body rockin huh, the body rockin huh
The body rockin huh, the body rockin huh, the body rockin huh
The body rockin says, DON'T STOP THE BODY ROCK
