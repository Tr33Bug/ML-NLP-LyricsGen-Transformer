Sunshine Lyrics
(Let the sun shine)
Yeah, yeah, it's a brand new day, y'all (Let the sunshine in)
Turn me up in the top a little bit, dawg
I want you to know, I want you to hear this one (The sun's shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen!

I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock way above the game
To be point blank witchu — motherfuck the game!
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dawg, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not the dude
Grown man business, I am not in school
Put your hand down, youngin, this is not for you
On my J-O with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day 0
I'm on time like a Roley or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low
(Let the sun shine)
Standin' in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude
Black people, let's move (The sun's shinin')
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes
We on top-a top-a, shotta, shotta
Check it out!

Slim nigga that cast a big shadow
Cherokee Red that shoot the long arrow
Got mo' skill, mo' aim, and mo' ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, "Hail Mary, full of grace..."
Niggas come in and shoot up the place, and make you pull up your face
The deck, I'ma pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State, where it ain't no escape
247, 718, and that's like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the States, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off, then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro-ball, not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
You might also like
(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understandin' me straight? (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt! Excellence
It's what it is, it's what it is, and that's what it is, you see?
(The sun's shinin')
Ha! Fire!!

'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn — it don't matter if ya holler or whisper
You comin' through clear, 'cause I'm right here witcha
Ain't gotta edit your slang — I got it, I get ya
Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Y'all gon' feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walked a thousand paces of life ahead of the game
By the time that you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move wrong
(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on, 'cause I'm molto strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Make it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song
Don't give a fuck about what brand you are (The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me, y'all?
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand if you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all
Be good to your families, dawg
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody need family, dawg
Raise your hand, you understand me, pah
That's what it is, that's my man
Family of my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those still in the struggle
Assata, Mumia, Sundiata, my man Jamil
(Let the sun shine)
Life is real
To all the real soldiers, black people (Let the sunshine in)
We family y'all (The sun's shinin')
Let it be bright..9Embed
