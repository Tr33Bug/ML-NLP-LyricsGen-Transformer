Supermagic Lyrics
"You're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution
A time where there's got to be a change
People in power have misused it
And now there has to be a change
And a better world has to be built
And the only way is going to be built is with extreme methods
And I for one will join in with anyone
Don't care what color you are!
As long as you want to change this miserable condition
That exists on this earth
Thank you."
Bismillah hir rahman ir rahim
Let's...go!

Ecstatic, ecstatic

Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, Brooklyn we keep 'em open
The heavens expand, the stars advance, feel the boogieman

Mojo hand healing power like bang
Snap, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Great name, greater than all your riches
Yah Dante Flaco Bey that's the business
Repeat, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Strong magic that bust all your wishes
Cherokee Chief rock upon cha rock it don't stop
And let's get

Yes
You're now rockin' with the Def
Lararara
Oh oh, Oh Oh
It's like heartbeat, you make me feel
So...REAL
