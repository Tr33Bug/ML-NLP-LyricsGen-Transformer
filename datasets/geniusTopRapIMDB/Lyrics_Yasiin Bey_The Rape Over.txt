The Rape Over Lyrics
C'mon
Boogie man business

Listen
Old white men is runnin' this rap shit
Corporate forces runnin' this rap shit
Some tall Israeli is runnin' this rap shit
We poke out our asses for a chance to cash in
Cocaine, is runnin' this rap shit
Dro, 'gnac and E-pills is runnin' this rap shit
The rape over, turn your face over nigga
No god in disguise, it's me, game over
Hey lil souljahs is you ready for war?
But don't ask what you're fighting for
Just hope that you survived the gunfight, the drama, the stress
You get in the line of fire, we get the big ass cheques
You gettin your choice of pimp, make your choice and fall in
This is ho stroll B I, take that cock in your behind, biatch
Hit the streets and perform for us
Hold hard and bring it on to us, fucker
I let you sip cups of Army, get a Mercedes
And kick back and let you pay me, my Mack is crazy
I leave the, knife and fist fight filled with glamour
Yeah, take a picture with this platinum-plated sledgehammer
We over-do it, add the fire and explosion to it
We sow confusion, we run rap music

MTV, is runnin' this rap shit
Viacom is runnin' this rap shit
AOL and Time Warner runnin' this rap shit
We poke out our asses for a chance to cash in
Cocaine, is runnin' this rap shit
Hennessey, is runnin' this rap shit
Quasi-homosexuals is runnin' this rap shit
Watch out we run the world
