Twilite Speedball Lyrics
Have fun y'all
Have fun y'all

The city breathing all down your neck
Bad news and good dope special effects
And reality's teeth
Bright, black, sinking in deep
Who ain't shy of the pain?
Who ain't shy if the pleasure just the same?
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win so I'm not here to play
Have fun (Get it, get it)
Don't stop
Ecstatic
Fantastic
Wild
People

Bad news and good dope
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Duro o dolce, fast or slow?
Yay, no?
It's OK you can have it your way love
It ain't all good but baby I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good how are you?

10% Condition, 90% response
Survival mathematics, the number man psalm
Old dads drop the jewels so pure
When the times get raw, there's something I recall
Sometimes I don't remember it at all
And it gets stormed by the weather with no umbrella
Sky release pressure and the ground get wetter
My outfit f'd up
Could'a looked fresher
But guess what?
The hell with parade day rain
Tsunami and sunshine, a vomit is the same
Life is a game I heard the homie say
Well I came to win

Get it get it
Bey!
Get it get it
Brooklyn
Get it get it
Ecstatic
Don't Stop
E'day
Speedball

Bad news and good dope
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Duro o dulce, fast or slow?
Yay, no?
It's OK you can have it your way love
Nasty times, but baby I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good

Er'yday
Every day
Having a good time
Every day
Having a good time
Every day
Having a good time every day
Bey!
Having a good time every day
That's cool, let me hear itEmbed
