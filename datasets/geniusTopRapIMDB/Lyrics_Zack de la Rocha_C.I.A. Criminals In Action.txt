C.I.A. (Criminals In Action) Lyrics
Yea yea yea yea yea!
KRS-1 coming through
Big Zack, Last Emperor
WOOP WOOP!
Ha ha
That's the sound of EMS
Ha ha
Last Emperor, KRS
Ha ha
Big Zack you know the rest
Now we gonna come down like this now, hold tight all crew
LISTEN!!
This voice shatters the calm of the day, like an alarm
To wake up bright anew, and take up arms
Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war
Cause the toxic rock imports, gettin' on your door
C.I.A. I see ya later, cause your time is coming soon
I flip the shit like Pacino and it's your Dog Day Afternoon
Attica Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a
My alphabet will slash that neck and flip you, automatica'
Dramatic like Ali Shaheed Muhammed brought the vibe
I bring the sun at Red Dawn upon the thoughts of Frantz Fanon
So stand at attention, devil dirge
You'll never survive choosin' sides against the wretched of the Earth
The infiltrator, tribe intoxicator, people incarcerator
Liberation movement annihilator
We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fail
We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail
We got the truth daddy, Last Emperor, KRS and
History manifested, tomorrow next lesson
YOU CLAIM I'M SELLING CRACK, BUT YOU BE DOIN' THAT
 You, claim, you claim, you, you claim, claim
You claim I'm selling crack but you be doin' that
 You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock
YOU CLAIM I'M SELLING CRACK, BUT YOU BE DOIN' THAT
 So get that flashlight out of my face
 You, you, you claim I'm selling crack but you be doin' that
The Last Emperor, KRS-One, and Big Zack
You might also like
As free market capitalism and technology expands
The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland
So it takes bands to, demand the, government provide answers
When Lady Liberty has me Bewitched like Samantha
And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer
To all my Black Magic romancers and acid rain dancers
Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza
We fear no man and throw jams
That attack counterintelligence programs
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan (hah!)
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians
Now what the hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to Zealots
I saw an Iron Curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsin
Whirlwind, tornadoes, in the rain forest if you say so (whosssshhh)
KRS and The Last Emperor like the Green Hornet and Kato
Zach de la Rocha brings the enraged flow, but all three drop science
And become the most powerful alliance since NATO

YOU CLAIM I'M SELLING CRACK, BUT YOU BE DOIN' THAT
 You claim I'm selling crack but you be doin' that
YOU CLAIM I'M SELLING CRACK, BUT YOU BE DOIN' THAT
 You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock
 You claim I'm selling crack but you be doin' that
 So get that flashlight out of my face
YOU CLAIM I'M SELLING CRACK, BUT YOU BE DOIN' THAT
The Last Emperor, KRS-One, and Big Zack
Need I say the C.I.A. be Criminals In Action
Cocaine crack unpackin', high surveillance trackin'
Prominant blacks and whites givin' orders for mass slaughters
I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters
When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine
I was like Noah, now they lower cause the whole cold war is over
Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbin' it
All the assault and batterin' in the name of intelligence gatherin'?
Now it's karma you battlin', a losin' fight
I chose the mic to recite ignite light in the night, aight?
We should beat em, President Clinton should delete em
It's not hard, the C.I.A. simply has no more job
Oh my Goddess, mother, you can fix this
We rock over mixes not six six sixes
Yo this is, the message, to all that can hear it
If you got secret information now's the time to share it
Call your Congresswoman, your senator, your mayor
It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the players
Rearrangin', see times are definitely changin' G
They used to tap the phone, now they tapping while you paging me
It's crazy B, yet it's plain to see, who the enemy
Who's left the NRA, The ATF, the AMA
Okay, okay, it's all irrelevant, cause in the new millennium
There'll be no Central Intelligence

Uh, yea, uh, yea
Throw your hands up
You know whassup kid, throw your hands up
Ha hah yeah, hah hah, yeah5Embed
