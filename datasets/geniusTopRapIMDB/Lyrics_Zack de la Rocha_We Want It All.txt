We Want It All LyricsThere they are now
The master of law
Throwing flowers on a casket of our broken dreams
Most thieves are silent
But these ones scream
These ones scream
We want it all
We want it all
I heard you talkin' my friend
I think you lost your mind
That somebody's listenin'
And then biding their time
Somebody's watchin'
Cause we wouldn't fight
For someone else's war
Could you hold on a second
For a second someone's at my door
Screaming hate is love
And fiction is fact
Honesty is deceit
That silence is security
And war is peace
'Cause we want it all
We want it allYou might also like1Embed
