New York City
You are now rockin
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 745
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I dont want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me
If I didnt smell so good would you still hug me
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
I get out and peel a nigga cap chill and drive
Im askin questions to find out how you feel inside
If I aint rap cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends youre feelin me
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back
Now we could have a little drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like I know you like that  Like that 
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin
Do you believe me when I tell you you the one Im lovin
Are you mad cause Im askin you 21 questions
Are you my soulmate Cause if so girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams
Im starin at you tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile
Ill treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasnt me
Would you believe me or up and leave me
How deep is our bond if thats all it takes for you to be gone
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up Ill do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Could you love me in a Bentley
Could you love me on a bus
Ill ask twentyone questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley
Could you love me on a bus
Ill ask twentyone questions and they all about us
