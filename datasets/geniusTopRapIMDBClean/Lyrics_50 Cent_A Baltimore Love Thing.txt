She loves me she loves me not  Yeah 
She loves me not
The fiends need me I aint around they bones ache
Detox rehab cold sweats watch them shake
Im not that genie in a bottle Im in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met I thought youd never doubt me
Now you tryna leave me you never live without me
Girl Im missing you come and see me soon
Tie your arm up put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to your arm princess stick it in relapse
Im back bitchdont ever try that again
All the shit I did for you I made you feel good
We have a love thing you treatin this like its just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch I wont forget what you did
If you give birth Ill already be in love with your kids
Listen I dont give a damn if your ass starts smokin
But we have a bond that is not to be broken
We got a love thing girl you tried to leave me
But you need me can you see youre addicted to me
We got a love thing I can take you higher girl
Fucking with me you can be all you can be
We got a love thing girl you tried to leave me

After that first night she fall in love then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing

I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you but to me this aint new

But you need me can you see youre addicted to me
We got a love thing I can take you higher girl
Fucking with me you can be all you can be  I love you 
I got you barefooted on glass chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch you sit there and listen to em
Over and over you hurt me my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up when you down they got nothing to say
But when you call up I come running I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down they crowned you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy Ill make you feel good I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
Theres more to life than laughter what brought us together was fate
And well be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that Ima do whatever it takes
We got a love thing girl you tried to leave me
But you need me can you see youre addicted to me
We got a love thing I can take you higher girl
Fucking with me you can be all you can be
We got a love thing girl you tried to leave me
But you need me can you see youre addicted to me
We got a love thing I can take you higher girl
Fucking with me you can be all you can be
