GGGGGUnit  GUnit 
Ha ha
Its easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 dont back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside Westside I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an OG
You ask about me the young boy dont back down
Any living thing that cannot coexist with the kid
Must cease existing little nigga now listen
Your mami your papi that bitch you chasin
Your little dirty ass kids Ill fucking erase em
Your success is not enough you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
Yous a Pop Tart sweetheart you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars but you cant buy respect in the hood
Maybe Im so disrespectful cause to me youre a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood you have no history
Never poked nothing never popped nothing nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha pussy
Its easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 dont back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside Westside I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an OG
You ask about me the young boy dont back down
The rap game is all fucked up now what are we gonna do now
How we gonna eat man 50 back around
Thats Ja little punk ass thinking out loud
Southside til I die thats just how I get down
Im back in the game shawty to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster

All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
Its been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah Crack Child
Them niggas dead they just suck they no good
I aint never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
Im back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying 50 we feeling you mane
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone outta my throne
Im New York Citys own bad guy
Its easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 dont back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside Westside I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an OG
You ask about me the young boy dont back down
I aint gonna tell nobody you pussy

Ive been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to The 50 Cent Show
