Best Friend  Remix  Lyrics
Ohhhh oooh  Yeah Its my tape man  Whoa
Whoa oooh oooh oooh  Listen to my tape 
Ive waited yeah  WOO 
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Can I be your best friend if you promise youll be mine
Girl promise youll be mine 
They say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
First we get the talkin then we get the touchin
If we get past the phone games well be fuckin
I kiss like the french then put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
Im no fool I know money cant buy me love  Ha Ha 
You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
Thats why Im here standin by your side cause you always come through for me
So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me
Glad you took your time and now Im satisfied thats why I want you all to me
Cause if you were my best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me baby 
Can I be your best friend I promise boy youll be mine
Oooh baby be mine 
I said hes just a friend baby its not pretend
Either he is or he aint my man I said hes just a friend
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Can I be your best friend if you promise youll be mine
Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
While you in your bubble bath Ill come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Theres a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
Im a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate come on
Im not afraid to explore my body  oooh gimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD baby that sexual healin
You tried to sing to me youre never on the key but you do it just to appease me
I rather spend my time wastin time with you oooh wee you make it so easy
Cause if you were my best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round all the time 
Can I be your best friend I promise boy you will be mine
Please baby be mine yeah 
I said hes just a friend  Oh Oooh 
Baby its not pretend  No baby 
Either he is or he aint my man I said hes just a friend
We been better than friends for a long time
Aint no need to pretend youll always be mine
We been better than friends for a long time
Aint no flippin and fakin youll always be mine
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Can I be your best friend if you promise youll be mine
Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
