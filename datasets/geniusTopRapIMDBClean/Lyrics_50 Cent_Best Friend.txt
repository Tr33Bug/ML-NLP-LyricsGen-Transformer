Yeah Its my tape man listen to my tape
Ive waited

Time went by
But all I could do is cry
Silly silly 
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend
If you promise youll be mine  Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend

Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
First we get to talkin then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games well be fuckin
I kiss like the french do I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
Im no fool I know money cant buy me love
But Im a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose theres a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you aint sure when Im talkin I dont tell you no lies
But theres things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I dont say what Im thinkin it dont mean that Im shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me thats why Im so fly
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend
If you promise youll be mine  Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh  now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend
If you promise youll be mine  Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
While you in your bubble bath Ill come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Thats the swagger you come with when you come from New York
Im a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest I feel like Im the best
If theres a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
Im as ghetto as it gets girl you know thats right
I aint got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
Fore you end up bein round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you I mean closer than close
I get into you after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you mentally long before
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend
If you promise youll be mine  Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh  now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend I want you round all the time
I want you round me all the time 
Girl Ill be your best friend
If you promise youll be mine  Girl promise youll be mine 
Please say hes just a friend  Uh huh 
Now girl lets not pretend  Come on 
Either he is or he aint your man  Ha Ha 
Please say hes just a friend
If I was your best friend
