They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights city life I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I never took a straight path nowhere lifes full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises I live I learn
Im from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
Its hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie I grew up in hell a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
Pure snow bag it then watch it go
Occupational options get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it man in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow my James Bond bounce
That 007 that 62 on my count
Im a undercover liar I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her baby I love it
Youre my inspiration youre my motivation
Youre the reason that Im moving it with no hesitation
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights city life I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves Im from the school
Of hard knocks shots pop bodies drop
Graveyard pick a block cause niggas want your spots
Im trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip stuff em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
Im supposed to lose watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word balls and my instinct
Im trying to make it we already made it my friends think
We already on top I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions game changing mission
Big risks big wins equal bigger living
Perfect position watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights city life I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
