Gee willikers Gatman they got me surrounded
Im on my way
I got a GatMan if theres a problem Ima solve it
A nigga movin around with a bigass revolver
And a  bat man 
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady Ill leave you dearly departed
This aint Batman Robin Cagney or Lacey
Its 50 Cent and Shady the worst baby
Put your hands on my peoples Ill react crazy
Put a hole through your front and your back maybe
But go head you try me
Ill have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride B
You fuck with me youll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder Id major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts  woo 
So you take the good with the bad I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back hollow tip in the chamber danger
Angerll change ya and make you aim that and squeeze
I got a GatMan if theres a problem Ima solve it
A nigga movin around with a bigass revolver
And a  bat man 
Motherfucker you retarded
You touch 50 Ill leave you dearly departed
Were walking away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said were walking away did you hear me
You oughta be thankful that we aint beefin
Were still breathing and just leave it at  THAT 
Cause if me and 50 and GUnit hop back in that BATmobile
It aint gonna be no more rap its gonna be  BRRAT 
Retaliation itll be like them Muslim Shiia  ATTACKS 
Somewhere along the line its like me and 50 made a  PACT 
Hes got my back I got his back  BACK 
Its almost like were kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like were conjoined at the hip this is unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable some shitll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and Zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There aint gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and Ill gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentioning me
Or the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50
Or DTwizzie Obie and just let it be
Or well be  knock knock  with a


GatMan if theres a problem Ima solve it
A nigga movin around with a bigass revolver
And a  bat man 
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady Ill leave you dearly departed
Nigga you get it twisted you gon get your wig splitted
I dont give a fuck I dont care if police know I did it
Man I hustle I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme you plot it you can count me in Im with it
You cross me you gon make a cemetery visit
Thats gangsta you know me I talk cause I live it
Shell cases drop when that chopper chop way up the block
Get hit with copper tops when the drama pop the llama pop
And it wont stop you can run call the cops
This aint new niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game perfect aim
You feel the flame up against your brain
Man its so hot Ill make you wish it rained
I got a GatMan if theres a problem Ima solve it
A nigga movin around with a bigass revolver
And a  bat man 
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady Ill leave you dearly departed
