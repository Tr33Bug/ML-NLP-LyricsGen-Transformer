Ghetto Quran  Forgive Me  Lyrics
Uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh Southside
Now what yall niggas know about the dirty South
One time
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again  And again and again 
Yo when you hear talk of the Southside you hear talk of the Team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers Ima break it down iller
See Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember he used to push the bulletproof BM uhhuh
His hairll get you seasick I sat back and peeped shit
They rolled with EZ Wider then they aint get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth all I ever did was sell crack I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I aint believe that pa he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4runner the Z the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise dont be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise L got shot in the neck then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans turned around and gave em more bricks
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again  And again and again 


That first verse is just a dose of the shit that Im on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghettos Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood I started learning
Lifes a bitch with a pretty face but she burning
Man Ima get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like countrycurly head Prince and TahTah
Popo under pressure too they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Types to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like Im fantasizing but son Im dead serious
Montana was no dummy brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass he politic like the Asians
Feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again  And again and again 
Yo rest in peace to Rich and Ron money what they was about yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly Duckie Corley Ronnie Bumps and Chick shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But aint been in the game all their life so dont know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I aint rich by twentysix Ill be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much boozell leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game they lose
Im forgetting Lefty and Jazz Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Luc Mel son Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster at Benihanas
Heard Chico stopped boxing and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch Bob Dre Black Will
If the flow dont kill you the MAC will
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again  And again and again
