Hate It or Love It  GUnit Remix  Lyrics
Yeah lets take em back
Uhhuh
Comin up I was confused my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate Id carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya GGGG for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And Im raps MVP
Dont make me remind yall what happened in DC
This nigga aint Gotti he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouthtomouth
Hahaha
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginnin to the end losers lose winners win
This is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same
How many of them boys is witcha
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
Im walking with a snub cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club til they coughin on the rug
Aint never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an RIP shirt in my coat
Now Im speedin reminiscin
Holdin my weed in never listen
If I see him Imma lift em
And maybe thatll even the score
But if not itll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deucedeuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God Im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know Im still nice with my cook game
Look man its a hood thang thats why Im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey Im still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put em in my fofive
And I aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
