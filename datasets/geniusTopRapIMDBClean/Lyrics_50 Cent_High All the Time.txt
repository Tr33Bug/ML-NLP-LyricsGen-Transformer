Hey you wanna hit this shit
Its that green tongue Cali bud
I dont need Dom Perignon I dont need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz I dont need shit
Nigga Im high all the time  I smoke that good shit

Give me some dro purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter Ill spark shit
And stay high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
Im high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Every time I roll up niggas holla Roll up
Then I tell em hold up you aint getting money
You aint smoking in my Benzo 20 inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef man you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up stabbed up shot up
Every time I pop up a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice I holla get em girls Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22s
Stash box Xbox laptop fax machine phone
Bulletproof this bitch and Im gone
2003 Suburban swerving too many sips of Henny
The Ds sick they searched the whip and they cant find the semis
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
I dont need Dom Perignon I dont need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz I dont need shit
Nigga Im high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
I stay high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Give me some dro purple haze and some chocolate

And stay high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
Im high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It aint because I be high  I be high I be high 
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It aint because I be high  I be high I be high 
But I twist that lye lyelyelye
I get high as I wanna nigga
Go against me for sure yous a goner nigga
I dont smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me tell me you love me dont stare at me man
Id hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me when you see me
If you real my nigga you know how to holla GUnit
Theres no competition its just me
50 Cent motherfucker Im hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne
I dont need Dom Perignon I dont need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz I dont need shit
Nigga Im high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
I stay high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Give me some dro purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter Ill spark shit
And stay high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
Im high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Now who you know besides me
Who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You dont want me to be your kids role model
Ill teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth deucedeuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he ODog
My team they depend on me when its crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like its lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga Go ahead get gully
See if I wont leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so aint shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature man fuck your money
I aint hurting Im aight nigga Im doing good
I aint got to write rhymes I got bricks in the hood
I dont need Dom Perignon I dont need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz I dont need shit
Nigga Im high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
I stay high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
Give me some dro purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter Ill spark shit
And stay high all the time  I smoke that good shit 
Im high all the time  Man Im on some hood shit 
GUnit are you ready GUnit are you ready

Nigga ready or not here I come come come
