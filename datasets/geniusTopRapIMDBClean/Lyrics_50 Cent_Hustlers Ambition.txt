So I can use you for your energy
You know its real shit feel this
America got a thing for this gangster shit they love me
Black Chukkas black skully leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramos shit Im a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my treyeight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in New Jack I holla Cancel that bitch
Look at me this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low the NARCs dont know
Im the weatherman I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back watch it turn to dope watch it go out the do
O after O you know
Homie Im just triple beam dreaming niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life the fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you cant see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you  Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you  Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle 
Yeah I dont know shit about gymnastics I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave niggas cant fuck with me
Man my cods call me Chef Boyar50
Check my logic smokers dont like seeds in they weed shit
Send me them seeds Ill grow them what they need
Them aint Chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And Im selling them for 500 a pop goddamn it
I sell anything Im a hustler I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious hypnotic it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot Id be that potent product
Now get a load of me flashy far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you  Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you  Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle 
Its the Hustlers Ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin
The drama means nothing its part of the game
Catch me in the coup switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he aint got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointing at me Look at Niggaraci  hello
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you  Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you  Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle  Hustle
