Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Yeah respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal an infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler and Kochll tear half of your ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twentyone shots off at the same time yeah
Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Yeah where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me Ill fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme nigga 50 dont back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line boy Ima air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what thats bout
Nigga I know you aint mad I done came up
And if you are fuck you cause I aint change up
The OGs wanna talk but I dont know these niggas
And I aint did no business with em I dont owe these niggas
A minute of my time I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the worlds mine yeh


Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aiming at your head man
Before you know it life is flashing reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead mane
I done been there I done copped that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and reroute that
Youll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so
Oh dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want to nigga but I will if I got to
Kill if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around
