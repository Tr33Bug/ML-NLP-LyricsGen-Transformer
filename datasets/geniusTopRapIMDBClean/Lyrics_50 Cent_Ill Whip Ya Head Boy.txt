Oh she dont know it Damn okay well wait

With a gun to her head sayin daddy come home

In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin you
And the nine will jam right in my hand
Ill whip your head boy you know I will
Ill whip your head boy with the back of the steel
Ill whip your head boy your cap could get peeled
