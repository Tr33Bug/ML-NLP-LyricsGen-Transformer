Ill whip your head boy your ass could get killed
Ill whip your head boy you know I will

Even though she cause the drama you love your baby momma
I hit her with the llama to get this cake
Give us the coke the cash the combo to the safe
Oh she dont know it Damn okay well wait
I play with your kid on the couch while your bitch on the phone
With a gun to her head sayin daddy come home
You was rollin poppin bubbly didnt think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin you
And the nine will jam right in my hand
Ill whip your head boy you know I will
Ill whip your head boy with the back of the steel
Ill whip your head boy your cap could get peeled
Ill whip your head boy your ass could get killed
