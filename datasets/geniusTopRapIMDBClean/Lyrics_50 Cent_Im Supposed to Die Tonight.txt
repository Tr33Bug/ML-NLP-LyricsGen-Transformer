Ahha man Ayy you know where them niggas be at right
Take me to em
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin like this shit okay  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im gonna ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK loaded
Im gonna ride tonight
We smokin  Uhhuh  straight locn lockin loadin
Somebody gon die tonight
This is not new I been in this position before
Grandma crib niggas outside of her door
Different day same shit old MAC new clip
32 hollowtips gloves no rubber grip
Im a boss but niggas never show no respect
I catch em slippin Ill have em tonguekissin my TEC
Go on come test me pussy boy dont try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Dont be stupid find out who you fuckin with son
Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
Its elementary life is but a dream
You know row row your boat your blood forms a stream
After you get hit you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Dont know if Im Gods child or Im Satans angel
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin like this shit okay  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im gonna ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK loaded
Im gonna ride tonight
We smokin straight locn lockin loadin
Somebody gon die tonight
In 2002 if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said Damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall I understand it all
But me Im a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are Ima have to blast me a nigga
Im on that Kevlar vest shit that Wild Wild West shit
Theres 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard I make motherfuckers wan kill me
Every projects in every hood I go they feel me
Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real B
I dont talk that rich shit but nigga Im filthy
When I come out to play and my mob aint with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy frontin on mell shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left my knife in my right hand
Yeah
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin like this shit okay  Bap bap bap bap bap bap 
Im gonna ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK loaded
Im gonna ride tonight
We smokin straight locn lockin loadin
Somebody gon die tonight
