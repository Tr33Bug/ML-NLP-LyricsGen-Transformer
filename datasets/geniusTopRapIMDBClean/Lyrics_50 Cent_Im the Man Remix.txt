Im the Man  Remix  Lyrics
I came in the world cryin and fussin
Nigga we aint have nothin
Every ghetto I know the same
We tryna make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin
I dont wanna hear it keep walkin
Ima put the powder in the pot
Whip it til Im pullin off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once Im on I aint never gon stop
Bitch Im on I aint never gon stop
Im the man Im the man Im the man
Im the man Im the man Im the man
Ayy came in the game gettin money
Flippin chickens whip it gettin money
Niggas get to playin with the money
Clique bang for the money shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come up gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a hoe
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 Os
Looky here bitch Im Aokay
Shawty wanna fuck with me
Strippin yeah the jiggy nigga
Later she gon hit my line
We aint gon waste no time
She suckin and we fuckin like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the TV
We gettin it on then Im gone
Its the type of shit that a nigga be on
Too much on my mind right now

Lookin for me sucker then I need to be found right now

Or fuck around and die right now

But you love playin games with the corny shit
Messin with a nigga only bought it cause I want it
You love to see a nigga at the bottom
You tried to come up you dont keep it on the low

Look at mommy shake it Ima call her she gon hit my line fall in love every time
But if I dont pay she gon leave me never had a real reason all I get is bits and pieces
