Lifes on the Line  Ja Rule Diss  Lyrics
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me but thats okay
Cause I dont like yall anyway
Man I dont like yall anyway
Fuck all yall
I let my watch talk for me my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me BOW What up homie
Them bitches who dont know me they wanna blow me
Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me
I came in the rap humble I dont give a fuck now
Ill serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown  Uhhuh uhhuh 
Coke price go up capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib Im nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me they dont even stash tracs
They keep em on em right there in they ass crack  Yeah 
When I dont like a nigga I dont pretend to
Ill have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look I aint going nowhere so get used to me
OGs look at me and see Im what they used to be
Im that nigga that sold coke the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice went broke and sold soap
The thug that pop shit the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga aint in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words I make a blind man see  Woo 
Scream Murda I dont believe you
Murda fuck around and leave you
Murda I dont believe you
Murda murda your lifes on the line
Yall niggas dont want no part of me
Yall tryna figure out how yall started me
You gon make me catch you on a late night
Pop shots with the fifth then slide off in the six
Im not a marksman while sparking so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think Im handsome
I hate to hear He say she say shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
Its no coincidence niggas who fuck with me get shot up  Blat 
Do it Cali style drive by and tear your block up
You soft duke you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they like Damn 50 really spit it on em
You heard that shit Yeah 50 really shitted on em
Beefyou dont want none so dont start none
Youre just a small player in this gameplay your part son
Scream Murda I dont believe you
Murda fuck around and leave you
Murda I dont believe you
Murda murda your lifes on the line
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme  Uhhuh uhhuh 
Thats why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes  Yeah 
Leave it to them and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash pa
See em in the five with stock rims I just laugh pa  Hahaha 
I catch stunts when I aint trying I aint lying
I sip Dom P til I spit up keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line I get you hit up  Woo 
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say
You get carried away you can get shot and carried away
Now heres a list of MCs that could kill you in eight bars
50 um JayZ and Nas
Ima say this shit now and never again
We aint buddies we aint partners and we damn sure aint friends
The games you playingyou get killed like that
Acting like you all hardyou aint built like that
See me when you see me nigga WHAT
Scream Murda I dont believe you
Murda fuck around and leave you
Murda I dont believe you
Murda murda your lifes on the line
Yall niggas dont want no parts of me
You tryna figure out how yall started me
You gon make me catch you on a late night
Pop shots with the fifth then slide off in the six
