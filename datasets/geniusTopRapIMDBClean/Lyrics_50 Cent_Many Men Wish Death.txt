TranslationsMany Men  Wish Death  Lyrics
Man we gotta go get somethin to eat
Man Im hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man damn
Whats takin homie so long son
50 calm down he coming
nine gunshots 
Ahh ohh What the fuck
Ah son pull off pull off
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I cant see
Im tryin to be what Im destined to be
And niggas tryin to take my life away  Cmon 
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin with me
My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now man these pussy niggas puttin money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme somethin special happened every time
Im the greatest somethin like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me


Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin life behind bars
I dont say Only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crookedass crackers will give my blackass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Every night I talk to God but he dont say nothin back
I know he protectin me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pullin TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I aint gon spell it out for you mufuckas all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
Hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fuckin breathin
Many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death pon me
