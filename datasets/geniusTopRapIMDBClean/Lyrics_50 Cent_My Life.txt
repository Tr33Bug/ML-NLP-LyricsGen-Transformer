My yeah yeah mmm
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try yeah
Yeah 03 I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man their emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on they turned around and spit
Right in my face so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear em it may sound like its some other shit
Cause Im not writin anymore they not makin hits
Im far from perfect theres so many lessons I done learned
If moneys evil look at all the evil I done earned
Im doin what Im supposed to
Im a writer Im a fighter entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer watch me maneuverwhats it to ya
The track I lace it its better than basic
This is my recovery my comeback kid
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try yeah


While you were sippin your own KoolAid gettin your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin shed sharpenin my machete
Sippin on some of that revenge juice gettin my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spageteven
I think you fuckin meatballs keep on just forgettin
Thought he was finished motherfucker its only the beginnin
Hes buggin again hes straight thuggin fuck who hes offendin  Yeah 
Hell rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of em then plug them motherfuckersineach
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fuckin see
Thatll teach you to go voicin your cocksuckin opinion to me
I done put my blood my sweat and my tears in this shit fuck lettin
Up Youre gonna end up regrettin you ever betted against me
Feels like Ima snap any minute
Yeah its happenin again
And Im thinkin about just sayin Motherfuck everybody thats up in this bitch but 50
Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
Im trapped so all I do is rap
But every time I rap Im more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess its bubble wrap  Haha 
Its like a vicious cycle my lifes in a crisis
Christ how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did
Feels like Im goin psycho again  Ch ch ch ch 
And I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery kid
Cause Im runnin in circles with
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try yeah
I havent been this fuckin confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me maybe
Maybe Im supposed to go crazy
Maybe Ill do it 3 am in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer Michael Myers
Im on fire like a lighter
Try to say this aint classic get yo ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots its tragic
Its sad its never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it respect it this a gift Godgiven
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin thing livin
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try yeah  Yeah yeah yeah
