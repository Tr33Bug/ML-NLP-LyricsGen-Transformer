I woke up this morning thinkin bout the old me
When I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
Im getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
Thats probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow the Doc is just rocking the same drum
Fuck the past though I aint forgot where I came from
I got the club rocking uh
I got your girl jocking uh
Me and Fif still in this bitch bitch
We goin the distance with you party people come on
Party people say party people say
Ayy its a new day its a new day
World is getting ready everybody ready yeah
For a new day for a new day celebrate and say
AAAAAAAAyy

AAAAAAAAyy
Now you can get your knees on the church floor pray it get better
Or push the dough on the liquor store and see where it get ya
But me I got to be on top
I said me I got to be on top
I got the street on lock
Im on automatic pilot aint nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty aint fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride I dont hide I dump to get em off of me
Im a leader look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air Im from the bottom
Soon as I spot em I get to drop em and I got em
I count my peace and reddot em
Its dinner time when the nine come out
Its off with the chain off with the ring
Move bang off with ya brain


Party people say party people say
Ayy its a new day its a new day
World is getting ready everybody ready yeah
For a new day for a new day celebrate and say
AAAAAAAAyy
AAAAAAAAyy
AAAAAAAAyy

Marks on the wall
Its now or never at all
Im gonna give it my all  Oh oh 
Whether I rise or fall  Oh oh 
True story I said Id get rich or die trying
I did it good luck sucker trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music music my first love
We paper chasing Im always coming in first cause
Im built for it see Im better under pressure
I react like a maniac when Im coming to get ya
I got to win Em watch and Dre watch and my son watchin
Fuck that losing aint an option
Im sharp Im on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
Im back on my Agame
Im focused for me this is just another victory
Except that Im stronger than an ox now mentally
Party people say party people say
Ayy its a new day its a new day
World is getting ready everybody ready yeah
For a new day for a new day celebrate and say
