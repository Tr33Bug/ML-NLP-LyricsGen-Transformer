Outta Control  Remix  Lyrics
Its the Infamous Mobb MOBB  ha ha 
We cant be touched nigga cant you see  GUnit 
You do you man cause me Im gon do my thing you know I do my thing
Imma get my drink on and party like its ok
Trust me man its ok bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house theyre like Oh no
50 got em locin again they open again
Got em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting doing my two step fronting
Now Imma tell you what Em told me homey
Just lose the parental discretions advised this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me as I proceed to break it down
Its always off the chain man when Im around
I play the block bumping it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping cause Im sick with flow
You know its sold out like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man thats for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club everybody show me love lets go
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty lets get into it
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey lets get into it
You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause Im thirsty
I need that grind in my system P on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But in any event keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents into them dollars the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I dont say nothin let me see you swallow
In my crib got the coed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise Im starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden lets go


You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty lets get into it
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey lets get into it
You already know how it go I bang I shine
I play I stay Im going for mine
Im young Im black Im rich and yes
Im ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
Im cool Im calm you looking real stressed
Im strapped Im armed kid hold your head
Im known for gat popping when I got problems
I dont run I just gun you all up
But we aint come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you dont go off and tell nobody
I go down low Im lying Im trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get em in the bed sheets
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty lets get into it
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey lets get into it
