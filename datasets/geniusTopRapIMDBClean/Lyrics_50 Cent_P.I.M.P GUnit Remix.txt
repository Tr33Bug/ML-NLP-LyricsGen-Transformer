PIMP  GUnit Remix  Lyrics
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP
Now shorty she in the club she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci that Fendi that Prada
That BCBG Burberry Dolce  Gabbana
Shes feeding fools fantasies they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style she like my smile she like the way I talk
She from the country think she like me cause Im from New York
I aint that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
Im that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit the track catch a date and come pay the kid
Look baby this is simple you cant see
You fuckin with me you fuckin with a PIMP
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP

We keep it pimpin in the South you know how it go  dirty dirty 
We drive oldschool white walls with mink floors

Handcuff her if you love her or your girl coming with me
When your neck and wrist glow she already should know
That money make the world go round so lets get mo

You got pimp potential you mightcould be one GUNIT
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP
In Hollywood they say theres no business like show business
In the hood they say theres no business like ho business
They say I talk a lil fast but if you listen a lil faster
I aint got to slow down for you to catch up bitch
