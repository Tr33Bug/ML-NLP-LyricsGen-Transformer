PIMP Lyrics
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP  Now shawty 
Now shawty she in the club she dancin for dollars
She got a thang for that Gucci that Fendi that Prada
That BCBG Burberry Dolce  Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style she like my smile she like the way I talk
She from the country think she like me cause Im from New York
I aint that nigga tryna holla cause I want some head
Im that nigga tryna holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track catch a date and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple you cant see
You fuckin with me you fuckin with a PIMP
I dont know what you heard about me  Woo 
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me  Me 
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP


Im bout my money you see girl you can holla at me
If you fuckin with me Im a PIMP
Not what you see on TV no Cadillac no greasy
Head full of hair bitch Im a PIMP
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a PIMP
Roll in the Benz with me you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V Im a PIMP
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone Im the one you should call
Ill be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve em they big or they small
That other nigga you be with aint bout shit
Im your friend your father and confidant bitch
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP
I dont know what you heard about me
But a bitch cant get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac no perms you cant see
That Im a motherfuckin PIMP  Now shawty
