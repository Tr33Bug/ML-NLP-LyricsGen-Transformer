Hey Em you know youre my favorite white boy right
Hahaha  I owe you for this one
I been patiently waitin for a track to explode on  Yeah 
You can stunt if you want and yo assll get rolled on  Its 50 
And it feels like my flows been hot for so long  Yeah 
If you thinkin Ima fuckin fall off youre so wrong  Its 50 
Im innocent in my head like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sit and politic with passengers from 911  Yeah 
The Lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined  Uhhuh 
Shit I aint even got to try to shine  Woo 
Gods the seamstress that tailorfitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book look niggas is shook
50 fear no man warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand writin lines knowin The Sourcell quote it
When I die theyll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world Im similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phonell stop ringin again
These industry niggas aint friends they know how to pretend
I been patiently waitin for a track to explode on  Yeah 
You can stunt if you want and yo assll get rolled on  Its 50 
And it feels like my flows been hot for so long  Yeah

If you thinkin Ima fuckin fall off youre so wrong  Its 50 
Youve been patiently waitin to make it through all the hatin
Debatin whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table they operatin to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think theyre crazy but they aint crazy lets face it shit basically
Theyre just playin sick they aint shit they aint sayin shitspray em 50
A to the K get in the way Ill bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem you stayin with me
Dont let me lose you Im not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message Am I gettin through to you
You know whats comin You motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top what the fuck do you got
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see whod die for the spot
You put your life in this nothin like survivin a shot
Yall know what time it is soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children  Woo  its nuclear showers
Theres nothin spookier youre now about to witness the power of fuckin 50

Snoop said this in 94 We dont love them hoes

Niggas wearin flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes motherfucker
