Oh yeah
Look at you you lil dirty ass nigga you aint shit
Ouuh
Bongo By The Way
They used to tell me that I wouldnt be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up get your bitch in drop top we roll out
Yall niggas aint shit
They all act like they aint know bet they know now
Im up nigga
If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to
When you come up how I came up lifes not gentle
See that tear in my mama eye that meant the rent due
I prayed on it God didnt say nothing back
Saw that cocaine you had we turned it to crack
Had a couple grams of diesel we was just tryna make it
A brown sheepskin on niggas was tryna take it
You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber
Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama
Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah nah
If niggas want problems Im sayin this no problem
I catch em on the late night and dearly depart em
Look back
Look where we started from
Its all the beginning
They aint tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When its 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when
They used to tell me that I wouldnt be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up get your bitch in drop top we roll out
Yall niggas aint shit
They all act like they aint know bet they know now
Im up nigga
I remember all the shit you said to me cause it hurt me
Then it helped me cause then I was down to do the dirt
See the knots in my pockets boy I go the cash route
I see you with your skinny jeans punk with your ass out
And I got all kind of money now
Look what you made me
Got a different type of temper man a nigga get crazy
My AP look like I done dipped it in water hard
Like me when I done dipped in your daughter  GOD 
From playin with Hot Wheels to collecting cars
That shit in the duPont REGISTRYs in my yard
Somehow the bullshit shifted
Now the motherfuckers calling me gifted
And I be like
Look back
Look where we started from
Its all the beginning
They aint tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When its 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when
They used to tell me that I wouldnt be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up get your bitch in drop top we roll out
Yall niggas aint shit
They all act like they aint know bet they know now
Im up nigga
