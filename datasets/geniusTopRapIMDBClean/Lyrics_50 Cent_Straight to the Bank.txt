When Im out in NY boy its blunts and Phillies
When Im out in LA boy its wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up raise it up for that gangsta shit
Im in my Lambo maggot my fo fo faggot
Doors lift up Im like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on homie Id hate too
My Teflon on boy my government issue
Ill hit your vertebrae bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie you a bitch you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo fifths and bananas on the Ks
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill Em got paid
When I made sixty mill Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill Jimmy got paid
I aint even gotta rap now life is made
Said I aint even gotta rap Im filthy mane
Im laughing straight to the bank with this
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank cant hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and Os
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the EPass fuck the toll
No more platinum Im wearing gold
Im internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough its never enough though
Shit I need mo new shit out the sto
Baby blue was old fresh off the flo
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in fuck the law
Im oh so raw Im hot Im sure
Im like the coolest motherfucker around the globe boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
Im the general salute me soldier
Im laughing straight to the bank with this
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
Now work it out now shorty work it out
I wanna see you break it down
Now back it up now you know what Im about
Its like a bank job Im in and Im out
Now work it out now work it out work it out
Now work it out now work it out work it out
