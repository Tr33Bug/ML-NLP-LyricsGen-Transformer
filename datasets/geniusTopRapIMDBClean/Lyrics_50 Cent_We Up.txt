Corporate acquisitions accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions Moulin Rouge religion

Penalized every ho nigga that had a scheme  What else 
Guns in your video get you locked in the bing

Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up  Whoa 
Charity work parking tickets and no charges  Oh 
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father
When he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible oh yeah God got me
Made my second million dollars bought a chopper and binocular
Im scared this shit dont happen to everybody
Im on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck or jump on her single

Im in her mouth like I knew I could have kids KDot
We on now we pullin off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling down the top

Seat back music bumpin niggas leanin
Bullseye thats what we came for
The bread now a nigga run the game boy
I shouldve sent the broad to report whats in the yard
Aloof livin I came up so hard
No pain no gain its embedded in the brain
Im in it for the grip motherfuck the fame
We on now we pullin off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling down the top
Shines on stuntin and Im pullin out a knot
Strapped with the Glock wont pull it out a lot
But front Ill make it pop

Round the world tourin the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign its a Taurus
Dont make it slam on you like Amare
MZone Rida Gang end the story
Oops thats your baby my bad Im sorry
