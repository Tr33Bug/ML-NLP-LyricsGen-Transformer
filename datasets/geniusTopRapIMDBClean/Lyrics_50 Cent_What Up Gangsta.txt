GUnit  Bo  we in here  Bo 
We could get the drama popping we dont care  Bo Bo Bo 
Its going down  Bo  cause Im around  Bo 
50 Cent you know how I gets down down
What up blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta
What up blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah thats a semiauto in a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing the DA might wanna play in court
But Ill hunt a duck nigga down like its a sport
Front on me Ill cut you gunbutt you or buck you
You getting money I cant get nothin with ya then fuck ya
Im not the type to get knocked for DWI
Im the type thatll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas they bump my shit them they know me
I grew up around some niggas thats not my homies
Hundred Gs I stash it  What  the MAC I blast it  Yeah 
Ds come we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flows been mastered the ice I flash it
Jux me Ill have your mama picking out your casket bastard
Im on the next level Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal hotter than a tea kettle
Blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta
What up blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta


We dont play that
We dont play that
We dont play that  GUnit 
We dont play around
I sit back twist the best bud burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit can they hear my hunger
When the fifth kick duck quick it sound like thunder
In December Ill make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
Im like Patti LaBelle homie Im on my own
Where I lay my hats my home Im a rolling stone
Cross my path Ill crush ya thinking I wont touch ya
Ill have your ass using a wheelchair cane or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas
What up blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta
What up blood  What 
What up cuz  What 
What up blood  What 
What up gangsta
