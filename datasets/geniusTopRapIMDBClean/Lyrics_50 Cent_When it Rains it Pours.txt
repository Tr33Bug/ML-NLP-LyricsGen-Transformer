Yeah its 50
One shot one kill whats the deal
Yeah whats the deal
Listen lil homie when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up thats when it rains it pours
End up wet up thats when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours
Aint nothin changed niggas doin the same ol shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol clips
In the projects niggas fuck with the same ol chicks
And somehow they still think they games so sick
Now from the rip niggas know Im bout my grip
I dont trick man I barely even feed a bitch
She say Im stingy I say I dont need you bitch
Go head leave see if I chase you shit
Tell yo mammy I catch her in the streets Ima get her
She know Im on parole why she call police on a nigga
She just mad cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some I say Hell naw
I was tellin the lil homies all about this shit
To keep yo mind on yo money
And dont trust no bitch
Ke Ke hit high notes when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat so niggas treat her the same
This is real
Lil homie when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up thats when it rains it pours
End up wet up thats when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours


Blood stains on my stoop when Akbar got shot
When homicide outside nigga Im not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
Its money down now yeah but damn its hot
Theyll love to catch a nigga on a direct sale
They say tell us who caught the body or you goin to jail
Look if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say whats happenin to the captain
And whats up to the sarge
Fuck bein in a cage man that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk drinkin wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggas tryin to bet a few bucks
Hopin they number come out they can have em some luck
Two Ace to the deuce and stumbled off mad
Lost his reup money man thats all he had
Magazine from the store so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck
Lil homie when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up thats when it rains it pours
End up wet up thats when it rains it pours
It usually goes down over money and whores
But lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours
Gun shots police sirens and helicopters going off
While it thunders and rains
