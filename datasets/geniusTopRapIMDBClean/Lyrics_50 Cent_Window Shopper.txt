They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off

Tell her Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game

Before somethin get stolen stolen stolen
