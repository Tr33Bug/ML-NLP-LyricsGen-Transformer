They told me to come clever
Whatever he dont make its on you
So I be who I be and do what I gotta do
Im one of the few the proud and the pimpest
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this
As if you didnt know its Thorough from that Suave Camp  Ugh 
Best vamp champ or get licked like a mail stamp
Amps and beats techniques is what I come with
Gangsters and pimps and ballers is who I fuck with
Fuck nobodys safe when I see demons in the mirror
Wicked as fuck feeling like a murderin killer
Witness Im on the defense like Johnny Coch
Now give up your things mister before this Glock hit the proper spot
Blocks on phones they wont leave they homes peeping through cracks
Cause blacks be coming back from all that past crap
Strap on your bulletproof vest and combat boots
Its NiggaNigga Day  Ugh  and this time we gon bomb on you
Babyblue eyes disguise thats wise
Made me lose my ninefive got myself a fourfive Im
Aiming spraying not playing with their vertebraes
These the murder days
So many niggas must come wicked we done heard of ways
I see one two niggas actin live
Three seconds pass fore I blast with my fourfive
Six shots seven cops just to take 8Ball
Nine witnesses reported all the shit they recalled
Everlasting blasting niggas running fast when buckin
Got em ducking putting suckers in the past tense
I be the holder of the gat therefore I shall not run
A psychic couldnt see such a feature for my mamas son
Nigga breathtaker the overweight trouble maker
Fake trick breaker Tennessee earthquaker
Shaking grounds when Im walking smoking fat onion
I get lit then beat the shit out of Paul Bunyan
Fighting Clash of the Titans on your dial
Im gettin blitzed stickin on medusa doggystyle
Word G you heard me the wicked bitch served me
Now Im playing soccer gotta kick her to the curb G
But shes not with it put a spell on the fat mack
I hate smacking hoes but I cant help but to go back
I sound like a fiend every time is the last time
Could this be reality or all in my mind
UgH  Spill nines like fluid do it like some Gs
They know me from Colombian streets to Portuguese  Nigga how you figure 
I got more scratch than fleas I got more gats than these
Highpowered sour niggas steady slinging crack to fiends
At ease take a look at some black Gs
Scoping the president take over residence like black kings
Stack Gs with phat keys
Rats ease on your properties popping me for my black cheese
I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itching  Bup 
Visions of killing and then the strap start spitting hitting
The prez plottin payback on the devil
A rebel and a mason is what you snakes facing  Nigga 
Chasing traders with my data cause a hater should be caught
And peep game when its being taught
Ought to picture this a boss lyricist
Seeing niggas taking shots and them same niggas getting hit
Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti  Ugh 
Hitting her like hobbies  Hobbies  killing everybody  Body 
Lift my head grip the bed and I check the time
Its all a dream I seen in my fucking mind
Two hundred eighty pounds of hay
Every damn day I have to test a
Twentyfive lighters on my dresser yessir
Breakfast being served by a ho that look like Jeannie
She grants my every wish and keeps a tightass bikini
Teenytiny as a Barbie Doll summer set
She all up in my house but I still aint hit that pussy yet
I gives props to my butler cause he know
That I know on the downlow hes a chiefin muhfucker for you
Now as I flips through my calendar I spots a winner
Involved with three more freaky hoes wanna have dinner
But I cant do it cause my schedule just too tight
I just phoned Quincy Jonessaid he needs my help tonight
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps
Them players with them limps and make a song called We Are the Pimps
I calls Ball Ball calls the crew
We met up at the Penthouse and Paris Round 2
Do you know the code to the fence
If you dont then move on cause you aint got no home in this residence
Its evident that Im daydreaming high all the time
Every last line all in my mind
