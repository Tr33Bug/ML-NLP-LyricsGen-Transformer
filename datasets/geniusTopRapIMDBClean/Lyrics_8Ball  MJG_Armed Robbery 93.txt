MJG 
Now I was clicking out my barrel just to see if it was loaded
Checking out its bullets to make sure it wont explode this
Hand around of the handle of my snubnosed steel
I must be for real in the procedure for a kill
Stood around the corner while I cased out the bank
Busted in the door and stuck the guard wit a shank
Ran up to the counter pulled the gun out wit the quickness
Shot the bank teller so it wouldnt be a witness
Fled out the door with the money in my left hand
Steel in my right hand running like a wild man
Ran to the hideaway knowing they was after me
Burned out my id stole a jeep Cherokee
Couldnt be late for my trip to Jamaica
Heading to the river scheming up on how to take a
Boat from a victim rush right up and stick him
With a sharp object making sure that I get him
Pulled up to the river scene nervous as a lunatic
Jumped out of the vehicle and spotted me a boat quick
Jumped on with the gun saw the owner break and run
Shot him in the back with the gat like in Vietnam
Quickly making waves in the river as I bailed fast
Got about a mile in the boat ran out of gas
Oh no Joe the cops cant get me
Ill never be wanted for armed robbery
Eightball 
On the other side of town
Moving quickly rolling swiftly in the hoopty ride
Loading up the nine cause there just my be a homicide
MJG know the plan so the shit is on
By the time 50 come well be through and gone
Got to the area stop then took a glance
Puttin on my ski mask stuffing the gat in my pants
Wells Fargo right on time now its time for the crime
Do the crime waste no time then Im going to get mine
Waited for the door to open shot the first trick I saw
Then shot the other fool I aint thinking bout no law
Jumped in the truck put the pedal to the metal
Then fired up a square man doing about 110
Looking in my rearview 50 everywhere
Messing up my plans with them helicopters in the air
Headed for the airport wait I see a road block
Hit the gas even harder fool I aint gonna stop
Crash through the road block they aint gonna get me yet
JSmooth waiting at the airport in a private jet
Jumped out of the truck with fast pigs right behind my ass
Running trying to shoot my nine holding bags full of cash
Jumped on the jet now we set to hit the runway
Took to the air yea I got away scottfree
Fired up a Mac j pigs didnt catch me
Countin all my money from a strong armed robbery
MJG 
You think its over but it aint
Cause I cant get caught by authority
The camera at the bank got me ganked so they know its me
Reached for artillery put the shank in my mouth
Dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out
Swam like a fish greeted land with a kiss
Did I hit or did I miss well it goes like this
I put the money in the spot
Took the clothes that I got
Tied them up in the bag same place I put the mask
Changed clothes in between spot A and spot C
The designated area we call spot B
See I cant be broke so I come up with a plan
Demand money soon as they hand it over
Get up and jet  the set
The longer you stay the quicker you get arrested
MJG tested his strategy
Wit a slick armed robbery
Eightball 
Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica
Thinking about why I took the money for the sake of
Me living poor and wishing to be richer
And just like Picasso I had to paint a picture
Of people dying rapidly trying to imprison me
Just because I took a little money in a robbery
Landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads
Smoking on the ganja messing with my head
The feds came behind me hit me with a billy club
I fell to the ground turned around pumping slugs
Jumped up quick ditched the gun as I ran away
Ran to the hills where I hid for a few days
No Im not the one that they will catch soon
Bought me a palace in the hills wit a hundred rooms
I got the money got the women got the BUD
I plead guilty to armed robbery
