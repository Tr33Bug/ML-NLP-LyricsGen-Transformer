Ive come to break you off proper
Swish swasher through the washer
On fire 360 degrees around the dryer
Im tighter the vicegrippers cut you like clippers
Your game plan loose as house slippers how you figure
Your small heart with your big nuts got you pumped up
You fucked up when you bucked up you out of luck duck
You aint my best friend yous another foe
And bitch you aint my main thing you that other hoe
So let me flip the script hit the clip
Pop it in take a trip straight through reality
Cause you dont know the half of the
Shit that I could do to you or what Im going to
Play me up too close and Ill be showing you
Knowing you really cant hang with my flavor
But you wants to approach me with misbehavior
I gots my ammo my gun  we can run we can fight
I could end your life tonight or we could do this shit right
I aint wrong Im kickin it back on the phone with Mrs Jones
She lets me know the time when her husband leaves home
Well its on I know he pays the cost to be the boss
But if he makes it home early Ima have to break him off

All respects to the west big ups to the east
Southside represent blowing up like yeast
On these techniques I speak in each flow
Broke em off something proper when I stepped through the door
Give me the mic so I can hype this shit
Cold blooded like a snake so you better watch your bitch
I admit no nigga cant fade
Kill em kill em dead like Raid
Fetch her stretch her then bring me some competition
Listen to my hallucinated mental vision
Smoke a fat sack we see distant feedback
Then commence to attack TMix track
Leave a trail of broke mics and lovesick hoes
Thick hoes who want dick after every show
But Im a real nigga break a bitch college scholar
MJ fucking G break em off something proper
I bust through steel like its plastic
Strangle your ass to death with elastics
Trunk your damn body in a basket and drag it
Damn to the motherfucking river to give a
Fish a good meal from a  type kill
Its the man with his hand on the gun
Sun beaming straight down on my chrome
Dome all in the way of my infrared
Motherfucking dot on your hard ass head
Youre scared I know you dont really want to show it
You bluffed for too long now you dont want to blow it
I know its hard even concrete crumbles
Buts thats the way you came thats the way you gotta go
Therell be no trick busta double crosses
Call me the  in the 
MJG has now spoken
Your underminded strategy is broken stop hoping
Break it up break it up break em off proper
Break it down break it down break em off proper
Break it up break it up break em off proper

Its that nigga from the southside  8Ball
Much game true hustler mack as long as the gray wall
Tennessee  Memphis Tennessee precisely
Southern brothers gotta break yo ass off politely
Fuck a zag I need a blunt from my bag
Cut em fill em stick em take a drag  then go 
At a marshmallow fellow  tried to check
In a sec turned to OJ and cut a nigga neck
But back to reality actually
The fact would be naturally
Its hard for MCs to see me
Concrete like the street under my feet
Spittin space age pimpin over hyped beats
White sheets and ink record what I think
Chief and hay getting blinked til my eyes turn pink
Gangsta Gangsta like Cube and EazyE
This the wild west nigga  strapped is the way to be
911 aint quicker than my fournickel
So you better not forget your vest
It costs to be the boss in the land of the lost
Sucker free properly breaking niggas off
Break it up break it up break em off proper
Break it down break it down break em off proper
Break it up break it up break em off proper
Break it down break it down break em off proper
