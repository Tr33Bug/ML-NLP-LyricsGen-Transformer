Whats the deal
Whats up with a nigga 8ball up in this
Yeah for real
Historic hits nigga like Alis fist
Rock the world
Get freaked by a different bunch hot little girls
Speed it up and let a real nigga see what ya got lil girl
Got a lil dough got something to blow
You wanna get like that gimmie head in the Benz I love a chick that suck dick like that
Dirty southern gritty
Bouncin through yo city
2000 rocketship sittin on some chrome 20s
Chopin collar poppin platinum droppin
Space Age 4 Eva means that we will not be stoppin  Yeah Yeah 
Eightball MJG DJ Quik collaboration across the nation
Hittin licks shawty me and my niggas so official with it
Poetic pimpin aint no playin when we step up in it
Like this go all out nigga dont be scared to bust
Futuristic what you need to do is catch up with us
Bounce Bounce
Man get up on you feet and help me get it
Crunk Crunk
Everybody up in here let me see ya
Bounce Bounce
If a nigga trippin we gone make them heaters
Buck Buck
Dime pieces let me see you make that ass
Bounce Bounce
Im a kill with the mic
Before I get buck with the gun
1972 was the birth
Tell a nigga was the worst
You cant fuck with the one
Nigga take ya foot out ya mouth
Get ya ass off the couch
MJG bringin the heat when Quik droppin this beat
I know they call it rap but Imma rock this beat
Breakin em off with dope seeds
The nigga with the most of this
Coast to coast to hit
Roll the shit Broke the shit
Kept smokin
Then put it down on tape again
I got a fifth of Hen
Fifth of Gin
A fifth for now
And a fifth for then
Takin my time
Take it down shot for shot
You aint got Congac its not the spine
I got a stack of hoes
Matter a fact a nigga smackin hoes
Straight up mack them hoes
If you a platinum ho You gotta keep workin the bitch
Dont stop and relax them hoes
A lot of niggas be claimin to pimp
And a whole lot of pimpin what a nigga be talkin about
But when a bitch tell a nigga to spend some money
The mothafuckas still be walkin em out
Takin em home givin em cheese beggin em please
Talkin about hell take my kis big trick
See I was born to pimp for this shit
MJG equipped for this shit
Aint no niggas in here found time
Fake ass niggas is scared of my rhyme
Pimp tight break a bitch quick
Futuristic niggas take shit


PIMP unified MJG and Q gone try
See me gettin down with Ball in the lopes with a bomb full of smoke
Rappin niggas aint no joke
So me to the front of the boards
With an MP and piano chords
Gettin back to my evil ways
Lick him 3 times he gone pay
Sidetrack forgot your point
Its a 10 to 4 bet that you aint gonna forget that
Get your peeps up off my cheese
Put your money in the pot go squeeze
See the bright red dice just die
Shoot a whole meal I might just try
18 thou with the jewelry on the floor
When I hit a lick dont flex no more
Gamblin scramblin tryin to get up out the hood
Nothin but scavengers and the bettin aint good
Show me where its sunny at where its funny at
Hoes with the polished toes Im a money cat
Tip toe blow walkin on a rift raft
Put that shit back in ya pocket I dont sniff that
Im lookin for the bud and the brew
And some X with a broad with some thug in her jewels
Got Sex  6 uniforms all on my back
I was gone chill to they didnt peep that
Had to be something else to make them irate
Give a nigga a minute let me clean the slate
No I aint have sex with ya wife
No I aint make threats on ya life
Bitch help me get my mind off this shit with an ounce
I dont wanna see you I wanna feel you
