Eightball will come out hard with the gangsta lean
Gold smile for the women that be jockin the green
Im a pimpster not a trick on a stroll
Ya gotta pimp that thang and keep a trick on hold
Stay on top of the world wit a gun in ya hand
Take control of a woman and fear no man
It be hard for me to see a day without cash
If you got it and I dont Ill blast your ass
With the quickness Because a pimp dont play
I got to work on my game and think of ways to get payed
Born in the Mound down deep in the South
With the brothers with the curls and gold teeth in they mouth
In the Cheverolet Impalas with the Cragars and Vogues
Four deep with the yak smokin fat mac indo
Fall up in the club with the pimps baton
Got a Tec in my pants ya step to me and its on
Got a family in Memphis got a gang in Texas
TMoney in the Jag and JB in the Lexus
Flex this pimp tight mind in the studio
Or
Im comin out hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out Hard
Hard out Hard out
Hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out hard
Hard out Hard out
MJG description a brotha
And one who tends to always keep his business undercover
But still I wind up in the middle of a click
Some I heard he heard she heard
Should I continue to listen to the rumors the garbage
Trick I aint barring this sucka lets start this rumble
Swing trick you missed I hit tumble into the sleeper
Now you feeling weaker
Man dont step when you think you got backup
Looking for some help but ya boys just slacked up
Punked out backed out
Way low headin to the front do
Sneaking out real slow
How ya feel now
Whats wrong whats the matter
Mama never told you not to play with those rappers
MJG got loose in the 9 deuce
But for the 9 tre the pimps dont play way
Imma stay true
Some of yall goin trade
Some of yall Imma like
Some of yall Imma hate
But see Im in it to win it
Not in it for a part
And its considered a job for me to come out damn hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out Hard
Hard out Hard out
Hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out hard
Hard out Hard out
I gotta come out hard as hell just like the life I lead
Cool feed on the next brothas greed
JSmooth cuttin up lil Hank gettin buck
Killers be shootin up suckas with no gut
Im scoping big bucks looking for the payoff
Living like a pimpster taking everyday off
Riding through the hood with my homies gettin smoked out
Fall up in the mall on a ho stroll loked out
Cool calm and collective comin out hard
MJG count it down
1 2 3 points I gotta get across
1 dont
2 make me
3 go off
Suckas gettin stuck up in a phase
Tryin to amaze somebody else but they find that it dont pay
Im gonna keep droppin tracks smokin fatmack hay
In the ash tray 3 quarts put away
Gat on the table cause Imma able Imma keep it
Right up on the shelf where I know that I can reach it
My mind is a weapon cause Im smart from the start
MJG pimps dont play from the 9 tre 
Comin out hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out Hard
Hard out Hard out
Hard
Hard out Hard out
Comin out hard
Hard out Hard out
