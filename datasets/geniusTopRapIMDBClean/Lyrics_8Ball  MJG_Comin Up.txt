A hot day in August 1991
Me and MJ walkin talkin in the hot sun
OTS was home then Listen To The Lyrics
Me and MJ made the shit
101 played the shit
Sellin tapes straight from my hand to your hand
Pump didnt give us none
So we had to take them
Make him respect a nigga check the nigga constantly
Busta where my cheese at
Before I have to get the gat
Every record store and stereo supply shop
Sellin me but Im not collectin a salary
What else to do except say fuck this whole rap shit
Find a hustle in the streets and try to flip shit
All in the next nigga hood slangin packs on the bus
People askin me Mane dont you rap
No shame had to get to A to B to make the CHDoubleESE
Comin up
1992 stackin dues not royalties
Cause we was told they was used for utilities
Not one single dime not one check
And we was here from the whole business aspect
A lot of fame came with some decent record sales
But at the same time we was catchin plenty hell
Cause we could tell that the record deal was goin sour
But over everything we did he had full power
With no money in my hands only fans
Stayin true takin stance helped me to pursue my fans
Pen and paper
I kept keepin
Reefer chiefin
Beepers wasnt beepin
Money we was needin
Me and Ball constantly havin arguments with our manager
Tryin to damage a
Good career fool is amateur
Damn its a cryin shame
To take too much
8Ball  MJG broke free
For the come up
930 in the morning me and MJ on the phone
8 oclock the same day we was outta here and gone
TMoney and JB set the tickets up we picked em up
Hit the studio ready to make the megabucks
Seein kis and Gs and hangin with the hustlers
Real niggas with Glocks eliminatin bustas
In the process we made Comin Out Hard
Thats when my real nigga J went behind bars
Every day flyin state to state the shit was great
Eatin steak and lobster like motherfuckin mobsters
Mettin women that Ill probably never meet again
Smilin faces on the outside looking in
Im on the outside lookin in
I coulda been another one take
Mystery that went with history just like a trend
Then I would lose all hope if I dont shout
But its too many players in my motherfuckin court
Prepare to blow the fuck outta the rap game
Cause we aint droppin vocals soundin like the next mane
Watchin out for new friends hangin out with true friends
Splurgin with some loose ends ridin in a new Benz
1995 pure dope uncut super nuts
Much hard from the start from the hips out the gut
Much skills Ima flex on the next tape
Showin off aint no way in hell Ima fail
While Im comin up
