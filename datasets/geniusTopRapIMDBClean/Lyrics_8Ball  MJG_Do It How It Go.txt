Nigga I told him yall gotta know how to do it mane
You gotta do that shit how it go nigga
Im just a Tennessee nigga straight from Orange Mound
Gangster walking trying to stack my cheese and put it down
The world aint ready for the drama that we bringing
The shit that we be saying cause they dont know the meaning
I was lost mane and aint nobody found me yet
Im royalty but them bitches aint crowned me yet
I told em once hard times aint no hurting from me
Im 8Ball nigga now look out for MJG
Up in your shit mane thinking about sticking the flag in
Phony ass tricks be flossing and braggin
Bout bitches they done fucked and places they have been
You get it cause they know when you hit it you cash in
Nigga dont be telling me you that you staying above the bitch
When all the time dumb and you secretly love the bitch
Them drugs and shit
That must affected yall strongly
I got one woman and dont no bitch own me
Boys want to be men but act like hos
Hos want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo
Dont trip cause a nigga like me dont fold
Get it how you live nigga
Do it how it go


Big shot nigga boss on my own commission
Space age pimpin take you to another dimension
Fast living on the Audubon headed for death
A nigga aint gon have shit if I dont get it myself
Stone face to a nigga think he know about me
Im the fat one the skinny nigga MJG
Flipping with Charlie Hustle when Im in Northern Cali
Blegit got that sticky green choke a nigga salad
Split one roll it up spark it up
Hold it for a second then bark it up
8Ball known to rock a nigga world slanging verses
Leaving niggas and they bitches face down riding hearses
No mercy how it come to me and thats how I be giving it
Hard is how Im living bitch and thats why I be writing it
Rob a mother fucker mass murder dope slangin
Straight pimp gaming keeping hos entertainin
Boys want to be men but act like hos
But then hos want to be men and wear boys clothes
We cream of the crop
Certified finest ones
When did we drop
Nineteen Ninetyone
And what did we see
We saw ourselves doing this shit
And what did we know
Niggas going try to ruin this shit
Im riding with God
Protected by an untouchable squad
You rushing me hard
Im bout to pull this buzz in your yard
And make a command and dance all over your grass
Suave House niggas ran all over your ass
You broke and you mad
Found out your wife a ho and you sad
Crying and shit like a bitch give him a rag
Not for his eyes he need them for his panties and shit
Faggot sitting down to piss instead of standing and shit
Trip Im a pimp type nigaroll
Slash gigolo
Ask me how I do it
How you do it
How it go nigga
Boys want to be men but act like hos
Hos want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo
Dont trip cause a nigga like me dont fold
Get it how you live nigga
Do it how it go
