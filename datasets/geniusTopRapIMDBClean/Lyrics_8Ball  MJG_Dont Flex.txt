Space Age
Chorus 2X
Dont flex baby
I wanna see you toucha toes in that dress baby
Bounce it up and down like we having sex baby
Give me the head and you can give them tricks the rest baby
And nuthin less baby
Eightball 
Eightball let me grip the mic and rip the track
Freaky hoes let me see you shaking what you got
Trick niggas buy them hoes a drank to keep em cool
And Im gone be with them niggas drinking yak ackin a fool
Fulla hay fuck security cuz we dont give a fuck
At the bar drinking shots looking at them hoes strut
Up and down side to side for a nigga like a foe
Young hoes at the club ready to pack they shit and go
Dont trip baby
After the club you can jump off in my whip baby
And let a nigga get a sample of them lips baby
And we gone keep it on the hush
You can hit me on the hip but dont be blowin a nigga up
9 11 all the time damn tell me what you need
Hold on let me click over MJ what you see
MJG 
I see a stout thang
Were bout to leave a hump off in yo couch mayn
One look at this bitcha make yo mouth hang open
Freak what you looking at
A true pimp I seen it in her camp
Full time party lifer dance floora
Dopemans bitch average club goer
Shake it baby til your Gstrang break loose
Im watchin now gone make them hoes hate you
Shes a cover girl under bed cover fuck yo red brother
And yo black brother and yo dead brother she aint scared brother
Big thick juicy body molaty
Got mo butt than she got body
Shes a gogetter pro switch hitter
But only in the dark
So parking lot competition is hard
I aint chasing
And if I stay around aint cause Im waiting  Uhn 
Now get along girl get bout your straighten
Chorus 2X
Eightball 
We make it hot
We came to make it hotta than Nevada
Big balling G slanging Suave House product
In the lab like a chemist cooking weighing up and cutting
Trinity to the MPC making dope pushing buttons
Organized Noise
Them country ATL boys
Got it locked up and sewed up and keep it rocked up
Glocked up
Doing the southside like Lil Key Key
Tricks talking shit gone see my hollow tips in 3D
But we didnt come to see no jealous ass niggas
We came to keep the party hype and drank up all the liquor
And fuck with the gold diggers them free drink sippers
Cause them gone be the ones in the room pulling zippers
With they teeth mind blow by the presidential suite
Waking up talking bout they wanna go and eat
Hit the dho baby
You aint got to go home but yo ass got to go baby
And that for sho baby

Chorus 2X
MJG 
I saw yo naked ass
Peekin out the curtain of yo mini shirt
Shadow of yo pussy close behind
Telling me MJG
Run with me through fields of flowers
We can fuck for hours
Come and she you anytime
You say no
How you gone say that when you dress say yes
A saddle on yo chest I expect nothing less
Than nuts on yo neck dick on yo chin
Just like we done then last time lets do it again
It looks as if to me you got some handles bout yourself
But everything you struggle to reach is up on the shelf
In homes of pimps who done done it
Some play around with your mind we run it
Gin sippers Orange Mound Tennessee nigga
We deliver all up and down the Mississippi river
Fuck a check bitch
No ID no income and dividends
Aint got nothing but space now fill it in
Chorus 3X
