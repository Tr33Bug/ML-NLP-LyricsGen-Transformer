Dont make dont make 
Me kill me kill 
No muthafuckin body in here in here 
Ima shoot ima shoot 
Three shots three shots 
Somebody done made me hot me hot 
Dont make dont make 
Me kill me kill 
No muthafuckin body in here in here 
Ima shoot ima shoot 
Three shots three shots 
Somebody done made me hot me hot 
You got me fucked up we shoot guns and hit targets
Meat market chop haters up who start shit
MJG rippin holes in body gaurds
Outta line polices and boys who think they body hard
And when the party started I thought we was all chillin
I figured that everybody be leavin here all livin
You standin to close partna you askin too much baby
You need to get way from round me before our clique goin crazy
Yeah mane these niggas comin round talkin bout
They hot but they not fuckin with fat boy and MJ
Nigga we the truth holla at a playa man
Streets are the booth we poppin at you hatas man
Soft ass niggas make they chin hit the floor
Off bran niggas take they cheese and they hoe
Mafio  mafio  Niggas know  niggas know 
When them real live gs hit the door  hit the door 
I got a 22 not much bigger than my finger
A winchester pistol grip pump thats a head ringer
A two shot derringer not little millinater
A big 40 Glock just call me the gun slanger
Some AK spray to kill the front line
One houndred and thirty dead from squeezin off one time
All you muthafuckin niggas that yappin that fly lip
Let it rip dont slip Im workin with fly clips


We fifty deep and every nigga with me got they ice on
Hood niggas thatll brake your face like Roy Jones
Crushin bones when its on we aint never scared
Them Memphis boys be so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members them niggas dont leave no witness
They all love a gangsta that shit be so addictive
When we pull up they know who we are by the car
We blowin big and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar
Take your vest off Im blowin your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase Ill follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin tires out dont try to ride now
What happend to the bass in your voice you just cryin now
Thought you was a man you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin for ya and boy its time now
To blow the whole shit out the right side of your head man
Aint no way for retaliation when yousa dead man
Not a scared man we keep it out the frame
We stayin away from lames and run the whole game
I do it like G you aint fuckin with me
Eightball MJG we reppin for Tennesee
With murder and homicide and daily niggas die
And daily niggas ride aint no need to reason why its
Money and the power the weak they get devoured
Them boys that disrespect with bullets they get showered
gunshots
