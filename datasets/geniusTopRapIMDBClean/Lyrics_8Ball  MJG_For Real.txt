When hard times seem to find you  yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you  yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to  yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due  yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
See it aint nothin but the real
Niggas gettin killed for the materialistic
Hoes on the hunt for a quick trick
Aint shit shakin but the leaves in them trees
Yo motherfuckin knees and my goddamn car keys
I know it aint really shit to it but to do it
But trying  I usually go through it
But so we do it like a mack in fact I keep my cool
You ask me who my master is I say my gun rules
It choose only to make moves with a certain pack
The real pack cause them bustas try to hold you back
In fact I could name a few but I aint gon waste
No precious time talkin about them on my precious tape
Pussy suckain disguise undercover
Fake brothastryin to come between another
Just like a wedge and some wood
Tryin to put a split in your shit slick busta up to no good
As I kick back smoke a beedi with the needy
Societys gettin greedy aint no future in your peace treaty
They try to label every rapper in the industry
Especially if he speaks of Hennessy and independency
If youre real
When hard times seem to find you  yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you  yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to  yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due  yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
Who am I
Its 8Bizzal
Do you recall
Mr Big Mr Big
In your trunk splittin wigs
Mane thats the same time I could recollect
Young trick in my face asking me if I claim sets
And heres this other fool with dreads growin from his head
He tryin to tell me bout some shit Farrakhan said
I try to listen cause 8ball aint the one to knock it
But I cant hear over the echo from my empty pocket
Instead of sweating me fool sweat Chuck D
Cause I been true to playa shit since 83
Southern funkadelic preacher Im here to reach ya
Dont be so prejudiced and let my holy words teach ya
I never rap about sets cause I aint been through that
Even though a nigga did dirt and packed straps
I dont do what you do and you dont see what I see
Therefore we could not be the same do you feel me
I come from Tennessee and love drinkin Hennessy
Peace to KRS but heres my philosophy
I got the remedy four seconds after now
Yo my nig tell em who you is


Who am I
MJG Pimp Tight
Knock on wood twice pour the drinks dim the lights
What I say is every day POetry
The REAL same shit that I sell
Hell you gon do yo thang Im gon do mine
Fine Im gon sip some wine
You might find some other way to pass your time
It aint bout where you from its bout what you do
And doin wrong gon make clues so trouble gon stick to you
True blue pimp shit is hard to break
But playa hatin bustas put the icin on the cake
Hate to see they own homies with a few ends
And still wonder why they cant get no dividends
A man aint who he say he is
If he gotta give false information bout what he had and how he live
And dont shit but the truth set you free
So trick stop all that lyin get those shackles way from me
He who tells the first lie gets the first smack
A chain react on the mack flossin fake facts
A freaky naked hoe  makes no record deal
Perpetrators get for real
When hard times seem to find you  yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you  yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to  yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due  yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
See in my past I thought it was all in my mind
But in time I came to find people are blind
To the fact I dont give a fuck about your thoughts
Motherfuck the radio and fuck the magazine talk
Walk with the playa down the highway of what I say
Hear what I say is just another way to make me paid
Instead of gettin sprayed or runnin from police
I am in the studio smoked out bustin rhymes
And jealous hoes male and female
Been givin a nigga hell now that I am 
Jealous of the fact that my mack is not an act
Instead of packin gats Im strapped with my DATs
And all my homies slang dope for a livin
Or livin in a prison cause they couldnt fade the system
I miss them but still I gots to get up on my 
Im on a mission so the future wont see me in prison
Niggas come to me with demos of they poetry
I try to listen cause I used to be that nigga G
Now do you feel me
I hope you feel these
Words from Iz8Bizall for real
When hard times seem to find you  yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you  yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to  yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due  yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
