Anyway it doesnt matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do Im here to do it
How about you
Our age fiveyearsold
We were young bucks
Scrubbin each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter sing you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa some vicious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
Time of nightway 
Gigantic factor from the
Carquinez Bridge team
Some had it all though  All though 
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
Green machine 
Three different lunch pails
I had a gocart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
That aint even cool  That aint cool 
I used to be conned racked and fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin up in my pad
Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they cant stop me from strivin
Suckas be shakin salt
All in his game falsifyin
Some fools be gettin crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether its morphine or cocaine
Doja or dog food
That have these marks betrayin macks
Fuckin off my high breakin rules
You got ya Ps mixed up
You aint no pimp
Yous a phony
I spit for major mints
While you make tapes for ya homies
And then you work up the nerve
To speak foul words
The perpetrators be instigators
Thats why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga


I trust no man
Cause man will let you down every time
Thats why I take it upon myself to thank God in every rhyme
Cause Ive seen better times
And Ive seen worse days
When some of my socalled friends
Wasnt around when I aint have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
Cause righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
Thats why I drop to my knees
And ask God to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know
By the time morning comes I can see the light
And then Im thanking God once again for making everything all right
He made it tight and now Im back up on the scene
Countin greens
Straight from Htown to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot open up shop
We bout to make it hot
Stop
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin
Friend or foe
Oh friend or foe 
You just will never know
No you never know 
Who can you trust in a world thats oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Everywhere I go go go go 
Friend or foe
Oh friend or foe 
You just will never know
Oh no you never know 
Listen
Im tryin to tell you my nigga to watch ya back
And trust few
Cause aint no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no doubt its rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
See let me explain myself and clear up the point Im tryin to make
Dont want no bustas around me
Playa hatin or actin fake
Dont ever be wantin nobody to get too close
I dont know if its effects of from the marijuana that got me noid and trippin
See nowadays the nigga be rollin thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone
See my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didnt have shit to roll
Maybe they will maybe they wont
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone its guaranteed that theyll help you
See what Im sayin listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin faces replaces friends when people receive ends
Now all of a sudden Im actin funny cause my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin at my mommas home
But Im not tellin a nigga nothin you dont already know
Personal or business you got to watch who you friends is
Im thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin be my crutch
Holdin me up helpin me out
Makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep
Who do I turn to when I be low on my cash
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass
Who is my friends who is my foes
Who do I ask when I want to know
Somethin about somethin but I dont know nothin
My ignorance keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when Im in need of a ride
In somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just too far
Where can I get a loan where can I use the phone
Whos gonna give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live
When will I drive a Beemer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
Will I forever be payin my dues will I forever be singing the blues
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
Know what I mean
When I be needin some justification
Stuck in the fuckin same location
Who is the friend that is helpin me
Who is the busta thats hurtin me
Who can I trust
Will you be there when the goin is tough
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust
Who wanna share my load when its too heavy to carry
Or will I go crazy pullin the load alone
Constantly gettin my hustle on
When will I finally see kinda suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friends thick and the thin
And who in the fuck is the foe
Friend or foe
Oh friend or foe 
You just will never know
Who can you trust in a world thats oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe
Oh friend or foe 
You just will never know
Friend or foe
Oh friend or foe 
You just will never know
Who can you trust in a world thats oh so cold
Playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe
Friend or foe 
You just will never know
