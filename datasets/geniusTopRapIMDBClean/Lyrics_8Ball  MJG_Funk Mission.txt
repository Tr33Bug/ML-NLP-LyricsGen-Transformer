Dont get high off your own supply
Used to be my best homie now I cant even trust ya
Musta got turned out by a busta
Smokin fine reefer wasnt enough so
You graduated now you stuff your nose with that white ho
Niggas beginning to think powdered lips make em hip
Look at the other fiends recognize where you slipped
Cause I remember the times we was smokin bud and drinkin wine
Now all of a sudden out of nowhere you sniffin lines
And Im able to say through all my pains and all my pressures
I kept my nose closed workin to keep my shit together
And why in the fuck you need a sniffin friend
To sniff shit with yo ass cause yo ass got conned in
Think again cause even if Im having problems
Experimenting with other drugs aint gon help me solve em
I tried fry and what in the fuck did it do for me
Not a damn thing now that fry shit is history
Somebodys walkin around dont even know they own name
A couple of years later youll be doing the same thing
I got love for the ones who had love from the jump
But go and tell my brothers fight the funk
Look at ya trying to be like super fly you fucked up
Now your world is a plastic bag of white dust
Sucka busta dont come round me with that
Real niggas use crack to make they pockets fat
We dont need no more zombies walkin dead amongst us
And fake brothas who corrupt the mind of our youngsters
Cocaine one way or another leaves the permanent scars
A life of drug abuse or worse a life  behind bars
To some its not a easy choice but it aint hard for me
Fuck that white bitch cause I dont never wanna be
Somewhere trying to make up some kinda lie to say
Why this mothafuckin nose bleed wont go away
You got a fat piece of toilet paper stuck up in your nose pipe
You cant smell shit cause you been snorting through the whole night
I aint tryin to say that Im better than the next man
I understand anyone can do what they know they can
But you cant if you constantly looking for a way out
Stay out my path I aint tryin to put the hand out
I lay out truth in stone so you can get deeper into the shit Im sayin
While my tape is playin need to listen up
Excuses you keep using who you foolin
Nobody but yourself cause that  cocaine rulin
Now whos in fuckin charge of your decisions
As long as you continue to fuck around with funk mission
Do you remember back in the day when niggas used to say
Dont get high off your own supply and make that pay
Paper cheese fetti chips grip flo stacks loot green whatever you want to call that shit
Now on the serious tip for real heres what Ive been thinkin
Our world is fucked up and it aint just for one reason
Babys come into this world hooked on drugs with aids
Hypocrites use religion just to get paid
But in my neighborhood I seen somethin hella drastic
It was tragic it left a victim in a casket
Let me take ya back to sometime in the 70s
When old heads used the snow like we smoke weed
That shit was cool then but now lets take another look
Insteada powder packs now you need yo shit cooked
Them cool niggas that used to kick a fro and wear them stacks
He that nigga today starving tryin to buy some crack
Now some people say that all drugs is bad drugs
And in they eyes Im a junkie cause I smoke bud
And so then God please forgive me for I have sinned
And forgive those who lived for the funk
