Hid behind the garbage can waited for the manager
He looked kind of shady I dont think that he can handle a
Nigga thats ready to pull a teflon in his left arm
If he steps on he gon really do himself harm
Keepin calm snatch the cheese from his hand
Thinkin about a getaway route I jacked him for a van
Jumped into the thang slammed the door hit the gas
Now I get this feelin someones lookin at my ass
Looked into the rear it was his prejudiceass wife
Balled up on the seats cryin Please dont take my life
I grabbed her by her hair  Hush bitch dont speak
And doin about 110 then released her into the streets
Im pushin a van I made my move toward Motel 6
To rob a trick who had got himself hooked up with a bitch
Who had only one intention  to pinch him was bein paid
The bitch went down with me and the buster was gettin played
My mind started thinkin the bitch is only for gankin
The shit started stankin as soon as I started drankin
The first spirit told me to pay her and let her go
The devil told me How in the fuck can you trust a ho
My hands started shakin and mentally I was breakin
My hunger for the thrill of a kill begun achin
Im takin all the money proceedin to bust a rapin
Swiss army knife tight on the wrist and I started tapin
Her mouth up pullin the couch up and gushing
A knife held to her neck through the back of the seat cushion
Im takin the loot then breakin her loose from the scenery
Checkin my tracks constantly watchin my back
What does it mean to be
Totally paranoid thinkin my past gonna catch up with my ass
Livin my life so fast people wonderin how do I usually last
Dont question me unless you down on my level
So you can understand about the
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
Clappin in my undercover bucket chiefin hay
Thinkin about the fat lick a nigga hit fore yesterday
Now finally the horrors of my hustle will not haunt me
No more will I have to jack these niggas
And leave them bodies in the street
Driftin to another place halfway through my blunt
A whole Ninqun and a fifth of gin to get shit crunk
No dirt on my mind until I seen him
100000 Benz with goldtone rims
I said no more will I ever take another mans shit
Until I seen that Rolex when he hit that cigarette
Instinctively I start to follow him and make my scheme
At the same time wonderin why do I do these things
Could there be a force stronger than our ones we know
Unconsciously controllin things we do and how shit go
Now Im reachin for my Glock my only true love
Hopin this time I dont even have to use her
At the same time this nigga felt like eatin Taco Bell
At the same time he did not know he bout to catch hell
Pulled up on the lot a bit fast Im a little anxious
Ready to get my serve on like a motherfuckin waitress
He mustve noticed me then balled out the lot fast
But I cant let him pass with them outofstate tags
I hit the gas to the floor and made them dogs holler
Tinted windows hidin me inside my 78 Impala
Now Im twisted angry blood boilin like some coffee
Hearin voices that go Let him go and dont be foolish
But theres a louder voice drownin out my good intentions
Screamin yellin forcin me to complete my mission
Listen temptation put me in this situation
But somethin good is the reason for my hesitation
In the end I took his car his jewels and his life
The devil made me do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it do it
