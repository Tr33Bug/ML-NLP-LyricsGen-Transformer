Just like candy  candy 
Just like candy
Its the same feeling  looks good to me 
Im creepin low in a flip flop drop
Top Stang leanin to the left gold Daytons on that thang
Im the MJG pimp tight
Put it to the floor 50 swang a right
And the peanut butta guts is a must
Drop it in the shop take em out wrap em up
And the ten clear coats to make it shine
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times
With my gas tank full drank a bull
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull
Me a young stout woman sumpin pretty
Nice round hips with them wellshaped titties
As the sun goes down Im gettin dirty
Fall up in Pressure World get cleaned in a hurry
In my 77 Chevy ass tight
Pull off cuttin rubber disappearin in the night
Chorus 
Just like candy  candy 
Just like candy
Its the same feeling  looks good to me 
10 oclock in the morning as 8 got up
Chiefin hay with some KoolAid in my favorite cup
Comb my hair get my grill right so I can feel tight
Heavy starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes
As I strike out the door to my Superb
Parked by the curb candycoated bird
The sun got my candy lookin good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street
Hit the horn but no stallin keep ballin
4 oclock Sunday I gotta hit the mall and
Fall in full of them green trees
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King
Fools all in the way with that Econospray
Need to take a few classes learn about molasses
Pressure got me beamed Im talkin on the phone
Tellin Penny thats the way to do it baby represent ya home
Chorus 
Just like candy  candy 
Just like candy  It takes over me 
Its the same feeling  looks good to me 


My candycoated paint will bring flavors to your mind
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin game
Lying sayin he go and get the same thang
If you aint ridin wood and leather your ride aint hittin
A plain dashboard crushed velvet got you itchin
9995 thirtyday paint jobs
Got niggas ridin round lookin like a junk yard
You need to put a check with a check with a check
Stack up on your grip get your shit sprayed wet
See most of these new paint jobs theyll do
But if it aint candy then the job aint true
Its reserved for them ballaz who make that cheese
It aint candy if it didnt cost a couple of Gs
On your Jeep your truck your Chevy or your Lexus
5th wheel and the grill like them playaz do in Texas
My folks gettin sideways in Vallejo
Ballaz in Memphis slammin shut the Cadillac doors
Full of ink so blinked I could fly
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die
Descending my mind goes back into reality
To some having candy paint is just a fantasy
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain
Big Ball tellin you its all about the candy mane
Chorus  x5
Just like candy  candy 
Just like candy
Its the same feeling  looks good to me
