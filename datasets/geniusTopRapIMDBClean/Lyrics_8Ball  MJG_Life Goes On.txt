Now Ive been up Ive been down Ive been in Ive been out
I was loved I was hated bitch niggas tried to cross me out
Nigga Ive been on Ive been off
Ive been a worker Ive been a boss
Out of all the shit Ive ever been Ive never been soft
Ive been broke Ive been rich
And a nigga aint never been no snitch
Im a fat black nigga but I never had a problem gettin no bitch
But Ive been stranded Ive been alone
Had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them young niggas
Keep that dumb shit away from my door
Ive been cheated and Ive been robbed
Niggas dont give a fuck who you are
Niggas dont give a fuck bout your status
Niggas dont give a fuck if you a star
You got all the latest guns you got 80 niggas with you
But if niggas wanna hit ya best believe theyll getcha

I done seen it all saw boys ball then fall down and crawl
One day knockin down the mall next day tryna sell it all
These streets so wild just one call
Can have you locked down by them laws
One nigga snitch make up some shit
Conspiracy have you behind them walls
Game so foul not just crack
A nigga out here tryna sell yall rap
Feel like Im back up in that trap
Im in that studio tryna stack my stacks
Radio only play shit thats wack
They aint tryna hear a nigga spit these facts
So I guess Ill never get me no plaque
But shit Ill quit fore a nigga to do that
Man Im a hustler I dont need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
Ill sell anything that a nigga buyin
Boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back
Life goes on just stay strong Pac told me that huh
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone but life goes on
And so you gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasnt for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever woulda learned how to climb out
Some things you cant be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mils
But what both them got in common
Neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher or practice still
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight MJ tryna live life and do a little good
I played my part but I didnt write the book
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on 
And on and on
Life goes on  Goes on
