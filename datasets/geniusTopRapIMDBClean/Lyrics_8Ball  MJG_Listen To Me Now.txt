Song Listen To Me Now
Verse One
I have no face I have no body I have no heart I have no soul
I dont care if youre young if youre old
Heres my mission Im out to get them those who be slippin
Creepin while they be creepin I be enterin
Into them silently violently thats not me
Quietly youll never know Im in your blood stream
Swimming I been injected now youre infected
And when you find me here it will be worse than you expected
Temptation thats how I get in thats how I got in
Information is what you lackin now Im attackin
Your mind and body functions dont seem to function
Somethin aint how it used to be and its because of me
Killin you coldblooded murderer
The bible told the world I would be here and now Im servin ya
Along with the floods mass destruction and wars
You can listen to me but the choice is yours
Chorus  sample from Goodie Mobs Cell Therapy 
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I shouldve had my jimmy hat strapped on
Listen to me now believe me later on
Theres a message to my madness its more than just a song
Listen to me now believe me later on
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
Listen to me now believe me later on
Im rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
Verse Two
I got no concious killing by the bunches how can I see with no eyes
Unprotected people Im taking em by surprise I despise
Any type of Doctor thinking he can stop a
Epidemic built across the nation cant stop temptation listen
Who in the hell gonna stop you when I get in your mind then
Tell you squash where da girl done been hit the broad from behind Im
All up in the walls of the womb your doom is incognito
You constantly putting your life in my hands thinking you didnt see no
Evidence that made it irrelevant Im hangin out up in the system
On the scene mean stuffed in them jeans is how she gets them
If it was up to me Id get with you all but I really dont pick em
How one by one she lures them in Im the one who tricks them
Your coffin sealer temperature chiller the silent killer
I done sucked up more life twice the sales of Mikes Thriller
If a victim want to be loved gun and will travel
Anywhere with any broad or buster now you in gravel need to
Chorus
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I shoulda told him to put a condom on
Listen to me now believe me later on
Theres a message to my madness its more than just a song man
Listen to me now believe me later on
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
Listen to me now believe me later on
Im rolling through your skin cutting corners in your bones
Verse Three
Lord tell me why was I born in the days of bloodshed
Plagues and neighborhoods full of the walking dead
Poison is cooked and smoked and shot into our veins
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous echo through our brains
Misguided the big picture over the small picture
Thats how the devil makes a man interpretate the scripture
Rotten born dead into a sea of sinners
Young girls are pros before they can become beginners
Booty shakers sellin sex to pay they college tuition
Jealousy send our brothers on straight pistol missions
And in the midst of the drama mama can I save ya
Now you remember all the hell she went through tryin ta raise ya
But its too late for that in this predicament
You shoulda been thinking of this when you was flickin it stickin it
But who am I Just another man running his mouth
Giving you something to think about my time is up Im out
If you aint realized by now the description of the topic here is AIDS
Several amounts of times I will appear on the front page
Never be thinking about the filthy hoes in which Ive laid
Down deep in the dungeons next to the devil is where I stayed
Never be thinking about the backs I rode and what I weighed
Now everything thats important in your life is just a daze
Being a damn fool trying to prove you wasnt afraid
Wasnt intending to do it but yet and still at times you made
Moves within the game that should never have been played
Whether you old or whether it struck you at an early age
No difference between the two cause they both in the same stage
Curiosity killed the cat the cat was standin in front of the gauge
It seems the whole subject keeps the world within a daze
Well this is the fact
That some of these people be thinkin they cant be fazed
Worldwide plague slowly turning into a rage
Up and down side to side heterosex and gays need to
Chorus
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I shouldve had my jimmy hat strapped on
Listen to me now believe me later on
Theres a message to my madness its more than just a song man
Listen to me now believe me later on
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
Listen to me now believe me later on
Im rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
Listen to me now believe me later on
I knew I should have told him to put a condom on
Listen to me now believe me later on
Theres a message to my madness its more than just a song
Listen to me now believe me later on
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
Listen to me now believe me later on
Im rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
