Aint it funny the things we do to get paid
The shit we do to show niggas that we aint afraid
Yeah I got my education on the streets
Doin dirt left a nigga with some muddy feet
Everyday life brings everyday drama
Smokin weed only makes a nigga mind wander
So much I couldve done but I didnt do
A lot of shit a nigga never shouldve went through
Trustin another soul with my fate
Showed me how easily love can turn to pure hate
The road I know I came to a fork in it
Good or bad Im a still be the nigga winnin NOW
But tomorrow aint guaranteed
Maybe I can see the future through my young seeds
Plant it and hope the planet dont damage them
Its a thin line but Ima get mine
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
So much pain drownin my brain I need a paper towel
Wrap it round soak up the strain I feel safer now
Lookin down the road Ive travelledits been a bumpy one
The walls that I stood on was Humpty Dumpty ones
I feel like one of them pieces up in a chess game
On the line defending yours from mine
Im makin moves attached to strings you cant see
If the move seems a little bit awkward it aint me
Now fony people ride your nuts for dolla signs
I bet you drop some cash on the ground theyd holla MINE
You far behind man Im way too ahead I might be gone
Think you had some killers ridin with you youre home alone
Im in the zone meaning space age pimpin new millenium
Holes down deep in the wall I cant get into them
Im friend to them real ass niggas and family members
What you say nigga I owe you something I dont remember


Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
The root of all evil they say
But yet theres so much evil in all our roots
Born in a world of iniquity some knowing some not knowing  Even so weve accomplished so much
But still we have so far to go  Cmon man
Were born hustlers and together well be greater later
Used to die for freedom respect
Now were dying for dope hoes and paper
Im guilty of all that shit and more
Questioning life asking what am I here for
To some that might seem strange but you dig this
Dont get your feelings hurt personal and business
Make em average to acheive pimp trick status
Lame niggas with no nuts end up embarrassed
Compromise and commercialize in the eyes of your niggas
Selling out to get the prize
At the same time my baby cries
Im on a cell phone in another state doing sound checks
Tryin to make my little niggas lives a little better
Than a bulletproof sweater nigga love hurts
Ive been a veteran in this game
I aint trying to be better than
Only as equal as the better man
You can only imagine the ghetto if you aint raised in it
Thats where Im from childhood glory days in it
I wade in it what The waters
Take me on down the stream Im going farther
Its still from coast to coast shore to shore
I stand accused of being a pimp from root to floor
Doin work constantly thinkin bout your family
As soon as you think its time to chill
God damn it be time for another project another dealine
Man were at the end of this rhyme and I done said mine
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
My friend we are one so please hold on
My friend we are one so please hold on
My friend we are one so please hold on
My friend we are one so please hold on
