Mr Big Lyrics
Now I was broke as a muthafucka my life at the end see
My so called friends they had no ends to lend me
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so fuckin hard but the money it never increased
I quit my fuckin job I had no job nigga
Put on the mask get the gloc its time to rob nigga
I hit the streets but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous but my fear wouldnt stop my strollin
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets so I knew I had got bucked
Reachin for my tech some niggas kicked me in my chest
My eyes closed shut and I thought I seen death
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
TMoney walked in and he told me what had happened
I knew him from the hood but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag and I knew that he was bale
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech
He offered me a job said hed front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be
Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
I hit the street slanging yayo then I sold up my block
Sellin 8 sellin deals sellin 20 rocks
Sellin dimes sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack
Some nigga tried to jack me but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches life
Standin on the track my mobile rung and it was T
Hello  Yo Eight be the fuck aroung 3 Aight
I met him at the park he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians and get my ass in
Hit for 30 birds if I live Id get five
I smoked them damn Columbians and then got what was mine
Over time my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger thats when bitches started jockin me
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5O
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope makin a 100 Gs a week
I gained respect Im the biggest playa of all time
Dont ever fuck with me cause Im 
Mr Big

Repeat chorus
Chillin at the club with TMoney and JB
Lil Adrian and Boo and my nigga MJG
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds
Drinkin on this Yak makin my way to the back
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest
With a long black weave and a tight red dress
I started conversatin but she didnt want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up now somethin in the air stank
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser
Stood by the door when it opened niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun Hey nigga pow pow
Then I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in I was laying on the bed
Walked up out the room did I go to jail
Hell no They cant stop me
Long live Mr Big Ho
Repeat chorus
