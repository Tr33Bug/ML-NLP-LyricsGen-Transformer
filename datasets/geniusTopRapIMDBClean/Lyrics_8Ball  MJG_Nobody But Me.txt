It aint no changing me no matter what you claim to see
I can only aim to be MJG
If thangs seem strange to me they cant be the same with me
You know its lame to be somethin that you know is a lie
Hoes want a nigga to try to be somethin that he aint
Right before your eyes livin his life in a fuckin disguise
Follow the pack and wind up dead last  Go on 
Real dummy with your scared ass
In the future aint nobody gonna listen to you
Why  Cause you do whatever to please the crew
Its easy to kiss ass for your wealth or get cash for yourself
I think Ill go with the green cause asses I do not clean
As bad as the shit might seem I got a getright team
Nigga sensing myself and I it aint ever let a day go by
Without reality checks fuck my salary check
That aint the reason why I want respect
But you aint finna distress
I gotta keep a level head fuck what a devil said
Im stayin me MJ fuckin G put your trust in me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
100 ways to die and I done survived 99
99 lives lost and one of them couldve been mine
Blind with my eyes open seein what is killin me
Feelin what is killin me but wantin more constantly
Runnin from temptation but Im much to slow to get away
Gang shootin niggas and bitches fuckin with me everyday
Man if I was lame and couldnt see em from a mile away
Smile on their mug and in their minds nothin but jealousy
Why should I get caught up in that bullshit not concernin me
Yeah I run with Suave and we gone ride til infinity
Lord if I was lyin strike me right here as Im speakin this
Separate the strong from the cowardly and the weak at this
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I see him everyday point shaven and craven
For the money that I be savin and the moves that I be makin
Breakin rules tryin not to be one of them broke fools
Robbin niggas comin from school thinkin that that shit is cool
Served out whether sober playboy I got heataz for ya
Quick to shoot because that indo boosts up my paranoia
I rap the blues cause the blues is what Im livin nigga
Surrounded my animals living and dying by the trigger
Word to me and if that shit dont meet your expectations
Fuck you critics I do this for the underground nation
Slab riders nigga drug traffickers and jackers
Heat packers nigga all my homeboys aint rappers
And I wouldnt say it if it wasnt necessary
All of this is just a test tryin to prepare me
My futures lookin dark and I dont think its gettin brighter
Forever Eightball PimpCaso Poetry writer
Its hard to be something that you didnt start to be
These streets be apart of me until its hard to see
Till the years when its hard to walk gettin old
And its hard to talk Im on a line of chalk
It seems thinner than a line of thread but through all this
Still instead Im real after all
Paper short or tall wife be big and small
And still down to earth Ill still be on the scene
Life like a tv screen but I keep my strength
And Ill keep my hope  Why 
Cause I know they got me under the scope
But if youre lookin at me Look close and your ass will learn
Maybe when you have your turn and take a stand and shit
You might be a man and shit make your own plan and shit
Cause I dont make no moves unless G wanna make that move
Fuck he and she wanna make that move I got a face that blues
When a nigga gotta pay them dues and they lookin at my face like Oooh mayne you broke and shit
But they aint gonna throw me out a rope and shit
Im a drown and choke and shit
And my focus get cloudy with that hocus pocus shit
Ill be the brokest trick
But Im gone be myself pimp type nigga for sho
Once again like I did it before up top or below
Im a keep my feet on the floor and do it in the heat or the snow
Give me a beat and I go off like a champ on your ass
Drop the mic and vamp on your ass stick a stamp on your ass
Send you off to camp on your ass
When I rain Ill dampen your path
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
I cant be nobody but me and thats all I can be
I cant be who you want me to be cause nigga that aint me
