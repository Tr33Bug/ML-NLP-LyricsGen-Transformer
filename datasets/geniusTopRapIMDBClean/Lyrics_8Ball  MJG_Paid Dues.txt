Yeah yeah
Space Age forever
Niggas and hoes better recognize
Eightball  MJG
Been ten toes down in this game
Since we were two young playas in a one horse town
Knee high to a muthafuckin grasshopper
Nigga my lights would have been done got cut off
If my dues werent paid
Its ah skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto aint left me no choices I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead niggas gone I still aint afraid
Aint too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues werent paid
In the middle of doin crime  Ugh 
It never stopped me from writin rhymes
It never stopped me from playin music
God put it in me I had to use it
It was obvious I had to give up the streets for the beats
Not knowin but havin faith on just how long that it would be
Before I made it
Before somebody picked up my tape and played it
With a remark like
Hey played that instrumental you cats got potential
In the process of doing talent shows parties and mix tapes
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates
I can remember in the past closin down at fast foods
Strictly stickin to my dreams but feelin like Id be the last dude
Who can make it in this rap
I thought that they aint gon see me in Memphis
It was like a time they looked over Tennesseee
And didnt know HipHop was in us
To all my vets in the game I got love stay on your toes
Cause back in the days
I use to use your 45 instrumental to do my shows
And look I was 17 when I signed my first contract
And about 18 12 when I signed my worst contract
We hurt from that
And til this day they still distributin our first tape
Before Comin Out Hard now can you feel it
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose
Cause to get to where I am right now I done paid my dues


Its ah skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto aint left me no choices I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead niggas gone I still aint afraid
Aint too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues werent paid
A Cnote for a concert I know that sounds preposterous
Nigga we didnt have a pot to piss
So we got on stage and we rocked the bitch
Fuck the cheese I love to see my niggas in the front row
Get buck wild start a fight the police make a nigga stop the show
Niggas all in the parkin lot bustin shots fuckin with hoes
Box chevy with the spokes and vogues
Niggas didnt know shit about a 20 inch MoMo
Hard head young nigga dont believe that shit til I see that shit
See them heavyweight niggas one day Im gonna be that shit
Ok everybody know everybody done sold dope ran with a gang
Pimp some hoes and snorted a little coke but uhh
Im space ageingand well forever be
Eightball the fat mack and MJ fuckin G
Turn the page from then to now and we still grindin
Small clubs and small towns if they bouncin we find them
Put them on the guest list
Make them pump their fist and get buck to this
Make one of them weed smokin gangsta bitches
Get fucked to this
Expand give all my true fans what they demand
Do my part again and uhhcome out hard again and uhh
Keep space agin and well forever be
Eightball the fat mack and MJ fuckin G
Its ah skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto aint left me no choices I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead niggas gone I still aint afraid
Aint too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues werent paid
