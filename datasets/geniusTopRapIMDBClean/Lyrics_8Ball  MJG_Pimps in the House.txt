1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could it be
The pimps gon rule the nation in 93
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the nic comin on
So open the Crown down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what Im sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggas be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin aint dead yet the pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you aint shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But its time to switch it up unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it complete it and pick it up
Its a book with hard covers thats packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now Im runnin thangs my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game thangs are bound to show
cuz a pimp gotta stroke and a wimp cant flow
And I aint no muthafuckin fall guy but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin aint gone never die
MJG pimp tight
Young black nigga no wife
No children just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose  8Ball Of what 
Of what has been injected and now its on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house
