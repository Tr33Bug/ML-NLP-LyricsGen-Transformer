Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball  MJG in the muthafuckin house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas dont do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what Im sayin
Yeah
It takes a nigga thats hard from the start you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch mack her down then rip her apart
Its all in the game a nigga cant change
If you dont break a bitch then your game is lame mayne
See Im from Tennessee with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go bitches strike up conversations wit me
About the way I talk about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See how I bait em in soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
Im in my Cadillac chillin like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack drinkin on a pint of gnac
I pick up my car phone cause the freak beeped
Its my nigga baby mama but sometimes I creep
Thats just the way it is niggas have to take a chance
When you aint around anybody could be in that ass
But Im just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live to some its hard to swallow
See livin down south aint what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah thats right
We trying to teach all these lames you know
How to do this shit
Cause its really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Now let me explain a pimp a nigga about the MONEY
See a ho break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
Surrounded by all these hoes thats goin and givin me money
Its funny how a ho can make you think she wit ya
When all the time shes just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business bring me the money
Yeah this shit is thick
Ho dont violate bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash grab on his ass write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a manman meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game same ol same to make your pimpin thicker
Slicker the pimpin gets freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich Im coocoo for these tricks
I pimp
Yeah thats right baby I pimp
So uh what you need to do you need to sit dat ass there
And uh right about now Im bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah shit so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Part 2 its all the same G
Trying to school fools on this PIMP
Lesson one First you should pull a bitch fuck her good
Next time tell her no the next time take her dough
Oh you better watch your back too mayne
Cause theres a lot of bitches in the world wit much game
Lesson two Watch that ho dont trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a bitch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson three If you dont tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear that crackin sound
Drown in the tub rubadubdub
Some niggas get pussywhupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes fuck em then drop em fast
I dont understand your plan at all man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah man these niggas a trip you know what Im sayin
But niggas like me I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke em I get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
You know I stay high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Wherever there is a ho theres bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money til he aint got nothin left
Instead of blaming the bitch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldnt be a ho if it wasnt for the tricks
But I suggest we keep em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood there wouldnt be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They cant hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead when nigga you know its alive
Pimpin is misunderstood by those who cant thats why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only makin chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a bitch niggas like me
Pimp
MJfuckinG PIMP
Staying down on this pimpin bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah yeah I get so fuckin high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
