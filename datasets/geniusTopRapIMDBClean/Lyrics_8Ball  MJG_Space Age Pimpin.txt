I want you
I got to have you
But what will this lead to
Will it just be me and you
Tell me you know I want you
Tell me how you feel
Ill be obliged if you step outside
Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger I lasted longer
Than Ive ever lasted your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will what must I do
Would ya kill for me ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me ya if the way you act is true
Who knows fine clothes
Lexus doors youll be closing when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places different faces
Different cases got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG you aint gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P claiming that you aint heard of me
Keeping it real let me know how you feel when we communicate
Well be straight if you express your mind
Instead of preferring her weight some who cant do it
Lose women but nigga like me used to it
Space Age Pimping
New day new age
Every once in awhile this is how we slang our game
New day new age
Nothin is too strong
New day new age
When setting it out is all we straight to do
New day new age
Just me and you just me and you
You and I me and you situation getting sticky
Your mouth is saying no but your bodys saying stick me
Lick me dont be afraid of what your friends say
Rappers get dat ass then be outta here like yesterday
But not tonight you look so tight
It feels so right this indo got me perving
Lets go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby to me youre the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I aint listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chiefin hay with something stout wearing lingerie
Lets hit the tel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
Ill tell you things about me
Then out the blue Ill be carressing you undressing you
You start doing all shit you said youd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you dont do
Yet you do it like a pro and think I dont know
But I do thats why Im here with you and you know this
Slip on the latex and dive in
SWISH
