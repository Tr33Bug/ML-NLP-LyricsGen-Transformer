Im so cold I need a coat in the kitchen
I bust two verses then go into intermission
No way you can revoke my vision
I dont play I make a ho pay a commission
Baby come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggas wish they never spoke while they were spittin
Im so ready Im bout to blow from the tensions
Like surprise you dont even know what you gettin
Im becomin quick cant slow my conditions cant throw my positions I flow with precision
Its a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and mo ammunition
Im MJG and Im so in attention now
See you tryin to creep me for my dough why you trippin
Yous a shipwrecked nigga when ya boat go a missin
Jesse Jackson cant help you with the Hope Coalition
Well Im spreading the news
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
Its not easy to do
I got the streets in my pocket
And if ya hating better stop it
Straight Cadillac Pimpin
Young nigga better listen
If I should die before I wake
Roll me sum up make sho Im straight
Make sho my cup filled up with yac
Make sho my paper come in stacks
I come through like a mack truck rumbling streets
Big Boy hit tracks straight crumbling beats
Rock hard like coke in a pot them fiends
Pay top dollar for the hot product indeed yeah
Turn it up and get addicted to it
And have raw music soon as you listen to it
Jump up like a old fat lady at church
Jump back like a uncut thang at work
Mang hop in and take a ride with a pimp nigga
Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha
Talk slick till I make a chick get the picture
Just a page outta fat boy ghetto adventures
Listen Im a Titan on the mic
Original them weak niggas bite what I write
Oh Lord we going to get it jumpin like revival
Survival Straight from my street bible
These verses I must rip dont slip pimp a bitch
Put on your look best outfit get rich
This here get you out of your seat fo sho
Jump up get crunk like you got the Holy Ghost
Pay yo collection plate be straight dont hate
Four strippers at the gate no shake no plate
Dont hate pay ya weight make a pimp pockets straight
VISA check cash any city any state
Deep Down in the country in the hills makin deals
No exaggeration it is what it is
Come on you aint never heard shit like this
Two pimps spittin game straight out the pulpit
