I saw you walkin in tha club witcha throwback
Witcha hair bent up Witcha flip flops on
Now go head take it off get naked Mix a lil rb over a hard hip hop song
MJ I be the narrator of the song you dance to when you get tips
You go hard even when yo pimp got you
Witcha racoon eyes and yo swole up big lips
Now i be sittin in the front row right before come out of the back room waitin for a strip tease
Can I get me a table dance without all the attitude and the lip please
Can we go into the VIP of the VIP in the back of the back room
Baby you can come with something creative that gonna make me wanna hurry up and try to come back soon
Can you get down and work the pole you know once you come out the stage i wanna see you do it
