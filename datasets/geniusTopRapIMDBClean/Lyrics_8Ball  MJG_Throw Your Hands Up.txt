Bitch I aint got nothing but time
So Imma get out on these cuts and grind
Keep my mind on cloud twentynine
My player ways keep me with plenty dimes
See Ima shine like all six of my gold teeth  Yeah 
When a nigga get through cooking up this OZ  Yeah 
All night on the block til the sun rise  Yeah 
My only friend is a Glock with the fourfive
Four five in the mornin it dont stop
Daydreamin bout flossin a droptop
Woop  Blue lights snap me back to reality  Ugh 
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks aint got shit to do but harass
Searched a nigga and took about a three in cash
I guess thats better than gettin locked up
Or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up huh
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back
And now they wonder why we act how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
I got a maid cooking grits with a outfit so tight
My niggas wanna stay the whole night
Dice game in the kitchen nigga T Lee
Nigga drunk singin sounding like the Bee Gees
Ham sammich in the driveway droptop
Naked women in the den playing hopscotch
Thirty busters in my yard they be long gone
So hit me and Imma keep my phone on
I be out turning corners drinking one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday she hit me ten times
If I diss her itll take a nigga ten lines
MJG standing tall and I wont fold
You can have all the bitches cause I dont hold
Onto any woman like a human handcuff
You got your hair down baby fuck it stand up


Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back
And now they wonder why we act how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
How many flows can I compose I drop this slang like lyrical bows
Stickin out just like an outcast or a thorn from stem of rose
Like nachos the lyrics are crispy crackin when yall bite  Bite 
Been had a Coke and a smile now Im trippin off gnac  Sprite
Yall just might see the skunk guy with a girl who chunkedthighed
Below the MasonDixon line real niggas know what Im talkin about
From Texas Atlanta oh man Alabama Savannah
The deeper the darker the Dirty South is what Im after
No laughter the content of the rhyme may be contagious
The Space Age is pimpin this players comin major
They shot the sucker sprayed you cut your wife and played her
The player the BIG BOI dope boy rhyme maker
Beats rhymes and layers of music right here to please you
And if you hate the Dirty then partne see we dont need you
You know Im talkin bout
OutKast Eightball MJG on yall punk motherfuckers
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back

If anybody out there hear me get your hands up
If anybody out there feel me get your hands up
You wouldnt understand if you stood under it  Ooh 
Its like the more that I talk to you the dumber that I get
The closer that I walk to you the further that we stand  Okay 
Apart distant
Nobody has the upper hand but my bodys resistant
So now throw your phalanges in the ground  Aight 
Im still abound unbelievers stay from hell around
I found negative niggas they only keep you down
Transmitting from Native American burial ground  Ugh 
I carry around  Ugh  the weight of all worlds on my shoulder pads  Ugh 
Im post to blast space invaders up somebodys dad
Serious as AaBbCc
If knowledge be the key then buddy roasted on the porch  Ooh 
And wait for ya momma to get off work so she can roast yo ass
They need to find an open window fast
Word to the motherfucker
Word to the motherfucker
Word to the motherfucker
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back way back
And now they wonder why we act how we act
