Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Uh let me drop it on the one its the fat mack
Dope like an 8Ball thats why people call me that
Some used to call me Mr Big but I had to flip
Now they call me Mr Ruffle cause Im all about my chips
Matter fact you need a jackhammer just to dig me
Orange juice and DT keep a playa tipsy
It only seems like yesterday thinking back
I had to work a job and hustle just to keep a sack
Stuck in Orange Mound ten toes down
Nowhere to go but up Im underground Im so down
But God bless me with this gift of poetry
So with this CD the world could see what I see
Came hard for them bustas on the outside looking in
Made mad ends with some paper and a pen than
Did it again for all of yall
MJG and 8Ball sitting on top of the world

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Keep that animosity that you got against me off your chest
Cause you cant bring me down even if you tried your best
I guess is what I gotsta do
Separate myself from them bustas hang tight with my own crew
Some people hate to see me make it
And any opportunity they get where they can hurt me they gon take it
I hate it but too late it gets rougher
My chrome plated thang blew your cover in the gutter
Of the brothers who dont know me well claim that they do
And persistence turn a lie into the truth aint no use
First of all I believe in God
Im coming out hard
And I can finish anything you can start
Cross your heart
As I keep a tight grip on my tone
Cause when I aint at home its gonna let me know that I aint alone
Im gone mentally speaking
MJG on top of the world diamondsand pearls all that I can see

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Ive seen so much from coast to coast and state to state
Bird slanging ballas and the fakest of the fake
Getting paid getting played getting sprayed in the streets
While me and MJG getting paid freaking beats
Were versatile south style rap ability
I had to catch a plane that took me far from my community
Made a lot of cheese people say I changed
But if you thinking this you never knew me from the gate mane
Much respect to young Gs on the streets banging
And all my niggas who survive day to day swanging
And Ill keep serving all my dope vocally
Cause its survival of the fittest mentally
Ive seen a lot of luxuries fine cars movie stars social bars
Many women fake friends in my face nine ten
Even though I stack dont stand down on my income
I never would forget about the streets that I come from
The drugs the violence not one day of silence
The robbing the shooting mothas prostitutin
The Mound is my home the hood im around
But if you jack me your whole family going down
Your motha your daddy your aunty your cousins
They all going out by the whole dirty dozen
M JG music in the streets scholar
On top of the world tryin to make a dollar

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
