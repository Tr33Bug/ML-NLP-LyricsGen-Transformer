I gots no muthafuckin ends sit and wish for a riot
Knowing its too damn hot outside plus Im tired
My income is hurtin and then some why cant lend some
Gs to a brother making his come up undercover
These hoes they want new clothes to ride on Vogues
And most of the time they be getting chose when they pose
Aint no victory in doing shit for the next bitch of the century
Cant do shit for me but an injury
I be the pimp master outlaster
Outblaster 30 bustas with the outcaster
Hit the masker dont ask a
The identities of the fallen enemies nigga please
Heart of a hustler real done by no bloodstains
Take it how you wanna take it while I break it down mayne
Crews come in twos and threes but they all fold
Enemies of me and MJGs tight flow
Hoes jockin tryna slip into a nigga pocket
Get in the hotel room naked then scream Stop it
Listen Im gonna take it to another level
All you need to do is suck me clean like a Dirt Devil
Shovelpackin bitches wasting my precious time
Pussy creamin simultaneously schemin
What do you see when you see me Ill tell you what
A true player from the South in the house
Do you wanna see  scratching
When it comes to getting rugged this bitch is wicked
Style like none other this bitch can kick it
Southernplayalistic bitch with the meal ticket
Slamming like Hakeem when it comes to this rap thang
Tomboyish ass flow so now you know
Lez Mon been kickin shit since 84
Cause its a big deal like Poppa my shit is proper
And tucked inside the boots I got my shitstopper
Bitches recognize haters realize
Suave House shit is thick sit back and catch some of this pimp shit
As we dips through your muthafuckin hood
The shit is understood give up your goods
Eight tell em what you see when they go fuckin with the crew


We on top of the world bitch I thought you knew
What they know about them Nuckleheadz
Madam break it down for me one time
Ha all I wanna do is be fly toss niggas and stack mail
But in the meantime I gotta post bail
My socalled homies began to realize
The quality up in this G bitch nationwide
When I see you prepare for this player to put the stare on ya
Telephone ya I thinks not
So what you know about that Suave House
Oh we cold like teddy about to turn the fuckin lights out
So lets turn some corners up on that Northside
Southside it sound good up in that D ride
And if I was a nigga Id be on my own dick
Just like a trick or a golddiggin bitch
Swing low sweet chariot off in the Marriott Hotel
But oh well madam macks
Well hittin harder than Vernon
Ask that LEZ what this bitch be earnin
Its me original player OP
Stout woman undresser professor hoe tester inc
Smoking from the cess to the chronic
Throw away your papers real niggas get blunted
Silk tailormade black as a spade with braids
Gator shoes making money hungry hoes choose
Gold smile tongue flowing like the Mississippi
Lyric constructor smoked out like Chris Tucker
What thebusta musta didnt pay attention
Hit rewind and let me take your mind back in time
Remember me little fat cute and chubby
Now Im mean muggin niggas walking round shoving niggas
When I open up my mouth you can hear the South
Packin guns stackin funds fuck selling out
When you see me what do you really see
Screaming like Mike and Janet but you dont hear me
Never no more than the PIMPING since the day
That I stood in the hood I would be strictly down for my dollar
Break a bitch scholar
Hoe give me my cheese fore I snatch you by your collar
Better not holler
Its the nigga with his dick in your throat
Better not tell a lie cause your ass might choke
Im smoking plenty bud drinking gnac and riding candy
Shit to make a bullshit day feel dandy
What do you do when you see straight through a niggas game
Do you hang point blank range to his brain
Will he have a life after death I dont know
He push me like a hoe he gotta go he gotta go
Note the flow when the gun smoke clears it be history
Call Captain Kirk for the unsolved mystery quickly
Tell a muhfucka what you see
Fading out this world peeping up at MJG
That Suave clique is so thick  scratching
