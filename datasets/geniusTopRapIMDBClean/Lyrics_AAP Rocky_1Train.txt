Uh feelin like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my AAP killers get they pistols ready
Send em to the cemetery with obituaries
Dont be scared nigga is you ready
Ive been thinkin bout all the Os in my bank account  What 
X the hoes in my bed is round the same amount  What 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin out huh
Young boy let his gun bang let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
I know one thing  Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard cheffin like Im Boyar
Dee probably sellin D in your local courtyard
Braids like Im ODog my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart any pros that got proached at
With a toetag get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze yall like Doo doo I hate yall
When the beef cooked I ate yall like Mmm mmm
Lets play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold my K hot your 9 cold that bark like K9s on
That banana clip straight from the rip
Ill make that shirt say RIP Im on some shit
If Im not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Dont look in my face I might snap I might choke ya
Spine right out of place give me dap like you posed to
Darts at your posters dark nights like this
I metamorph like Im posed to I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious talkin to my conscience
Gettin deeper in these flows like conches
Im on my convict dont drop bars I drop prisons
Dont sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the isms
The violence and the killin so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ignance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 oclock with Jigga
And Im thinkin bout signin to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like youre only gon end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga wish you the best for real


When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin rapper fuck it
Painter skater musician trailer park dirtditchdiggin
Burgerflippin eat sleep shittin human bein you would be in
Trouble to bodydouble or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in my visions beyond the Hubbles
I huddle with Nubians new beginnin again
You in school at 10 late Radioactives goin gold
And so Great Do I give a flying duck
If Im applyin love to my rhymin plus alignin us
Alabamas climbin upwait No I dont give a
Flying duck nothin but a buckshot chpow
Motherfuck your life pussy bloodclot
Aint never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella showYelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause Im high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin on the sun barefoot with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldnt hit that shit with my worst enemys penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this
Ho Im the meanest
Dick so big its like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous aw shit no off switch
Lawless obnoxious on that suck my cock shit
That is my synopsis ostrichs posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit stop it You not this
Novice regardless heartless and awkward
Cryin tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin chronic bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein honest tell me isnt that ironic
Swiftly I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moons reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin drinkin Henny like Im Kenny Lofton
Outstandin I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin
You see us scramblin sellin Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic uh
You see me comin through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist Ive got the briefcase
The gavel slam Im a free man try not to eat ham
Big KRIT shawty
Spit like my last breath casket rap six deep
Eyes closed the black is back out come the lac with flats
After that bottles I cant pronounce like How you ask for that
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch
All I had was rap when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes a championship win is
The aftermath ask LeBron open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank Ive been in the business of sinkin ships
Chokin niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label Im taxin if you want a hit
Clear fuck your career bitch I was born here
Been a killer 86er nigga thats my born year
Get the fuck from round here thats just my country ways
Suckin on your mommas titty bitchin while I was choppin blade
Grippin grain fuckin hoes candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul how could you ever doubt me
Most rappers hopin the world end so they wont have to drop another album
BB King saw the king in me so why cant you
In order to come up close youll have to dig up Cash and Elvis too
That wasnt no sample nigga 
Muddy water flow Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag poppin benji tags on your wifeys ass  on your wifeys ass 
Thats out of line but in livin color
Im more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers a true artist
