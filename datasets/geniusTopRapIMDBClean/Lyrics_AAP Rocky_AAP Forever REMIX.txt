Ya dig  Gang 
Come fuck with the Mob shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch cause she bi
My ice like the stars I tell that bitch Cover your eyes
Cause fuckin with me you go blind
She losin her mind we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark I kill you you open my blinds
On Yams and thats word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases Im still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Like dominos nigga Geronimos
When its my time to go adis vmonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with pltanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
Im just pimpin like Im supposed
I guess its called livin shit I suppose
Im on my live alone die VLONE
Aint talkin bout spending or buyin clothes
Im bout my business but Im alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I dont overdose
I put AAP on my tat  Woo 
I put New York on the map  Woo 
I put the gang on the flames  Woo 
They gon remember the name
They robbin boys for the chains  Woo 
I got Goyard by the sack  Woo 
I got the boof by the pack  Woo 
I fucked your boo on her back
Gang Gang Them boys not flexing the same
Im done with adjusting to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
Gang Gang I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell em dont fuck with the gang its time to fuck up the whole game
Hmm
Im free as a bird I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized things pan out when its right
In the meantime Ima grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city the one thats surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane got no time dont need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter shes all I need
She got her father as I grow
Hell yeah I did it Im on a roll
Thought Id be up with my nigga no
Im just gettin warmed up lets start the show
Im schoolin these niggas so in the zone and Im rigged to blow
AAP and Cud Life forever though
And Im flossin and bossin these silly hoes
Learned the codes serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that aint had someone on they own
Hang on the words you each have your song
Grab on and hold on wont steer you wrong
Sing along sing along hmm
