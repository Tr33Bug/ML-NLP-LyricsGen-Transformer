Gang Gang Gang
They talkin down on my name dont let em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang AAP boys came with the flame
Gang Gang They talkin down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this aint no regular name
Gang Gang They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans
Gang Gang Them boys not flexin the same
Im done with adjustin to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
Gang Gang I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell em dont fuck with the gang
Its time to fuck up the whole game
Come fuck with the Mob shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch cause she bi
My ice like the stars I tell that bitch Cover your eyes
Cause smokin with me you go blind
She losin her mind we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark I kill you you open my blinds
On Yams and thats word to my moms

A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Like dominos nigga Geronimos
When its my time to go adis vmonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with pltanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
Im just pimpin like Im supposed
I guess its called livin shit I suppose
Im on my live alone die VLONE
Aint talkin bout spending or buyin clothes
Im bout my business but Im alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I dont overdose


I put AAP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon remember the name
They robbin boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back
Gang Gang Them boys not flexing the same
Im done with adjusting to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
Gang Gang I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell em dont fuck with the gang
Its time to fuck up the whole game  Game game game game 
Gang gang
They tryna front on the gang they gon remember my name
True to truth somehow  Gang gang 
But never truly lied at all then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang AAP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
In my dreams Im dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake its kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all then and now
I never meant to hurt you  then and now 
I never meant to lie
