They talkin down on my name dont let em run off with the name

Gang Gang They talkin down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this aint no regular name

Dealing with life and its highs and lows

Im bout my business but Im alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I dont overdose
I put AAP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon remember the name
They robbin boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back
Gang Gang Them boys not flexing the same
Im done with adjusting to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
Gang Gang I tell her come fuck with the gang

Its time to fuck up the whole game  Game game game game

They tryna front on the gang they gon remember my name
True to truth somehow  Gang gang 
But never truly lied at all then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow

But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now
In my dreams Im dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake its kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all then and now
I never meant to hurt you  then and now 
I never meant to lie
