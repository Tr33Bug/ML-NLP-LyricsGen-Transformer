Dont give a fuck about your man
Im just seeing what its hitting for  bitch Im sayin 
How you fronting on the kid though
You should fuck with me girl you know what you need girl
See I got used to livin life up on my own yeah
In search of love and for a wife to call my own yeah
Its all I think about at nights when Im alone yeah
Swear that I cant get no rest in California
Swear that life is just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is well tonight Mrs Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch light this
Light it light it puff it puff it pass it pass it
Moving on to better things Im sure 
Bless sit back and relax one time clear your mind
Cant feed this addiction anymore 
Bout to send me back to my old ways know what Im saying
Moving on to better things Im sure 
Yeah Im just she making mistakes
Cant feed this addiction anymore 
Ive been puffing rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generations thrown on drugs
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane and it figures
Cause here is something you cant understand
How I could just kill a man anyways
Nowadays everybodys stressed yes
Animosity is better off your chest yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed stay fresh
Take a nigga threats but Im up next take debts


Light it light it puff it puff it pass it pass it
Moving on to better things 
Inhale exhale relieve your mind of stress bless
Smoke some one time for your boy AAP
Cant feed this addiction anymore 
Ive been puffing rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generations thrown on drugs
