Canal St Lyrics
Yeah live through the strugglin lifes a every day  Hustle 
I hustle every day in life thinkin back
Takin packs up the block them older niggas said I couldnt  hustle 
Man fuck em niggas Ill be back strapped backpack
Bitch Im flippin work hand in hand I think they call it track  hustle 
Racin laps reup went to waste it pays to make it stack
Face the fact theres always niggas out there tryin to knock the  hustle 
I guess thats why they say we trap dont let niggas hold you back
Im just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black Black man black male
Black ball black opsy black diamonds glistenin
Attract the pigs and all the rats kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux chauffeur pullin up no if ands or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used em once couldnt give a shit damn or fuck about em
Hit Canal Street vintage gold medallion
Smokin blunts in front of public housin
Wildin til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin in the frames
Changed the game and made them say  uhh 
Aint no limits to this shit lifes a flick youre stickin to the script
My life is like a movie they should film me through it
Take a pic be sure to frame the shit forever me was always G
Way before this famous shit yall just pretend to do it
You say you got them guns but Ive never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but Ive never seen you slang
You say you in that game but Ive yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah
You say you got them guns but Ive never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but Ive never seen you slang
You say you in that game but Ive yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah
Rap game like the crack game swear its all the same  hustle 
Whippin soda through the pot watch it bubble
Flexin muscle hit the block I bet I teach you niggas how to  hustle 
Sellin coca on the charts watch it double
Uh takin meetings on my bus this shit my mobile office
Gettin head while at my desk this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy Im flawless fuck pretty Im gorgeous
Your favorite rappers corpses couldnt measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit but yall be talkin bullshit
You say you got them guns but Ive never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but Ive never seen you slang
You say you in that game but Ive yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah
You say you got them guns but Ive never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but Ive never seen you slang
You say you in that game but Ive yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah
