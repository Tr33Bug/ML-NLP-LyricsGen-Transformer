I just I just live
I live day by day fighting demons
I smoked away my brain I think Im going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums I think theyre going numb
Im having stomach pains now Im throwing up
Cause Im a microphone fiend give me the bass
Give me the beat and let me lean tap the vein let it stream
Feel the pain young Martin Luther King with a dream
That one day that my team we can make it with this rappin
Now we swaggin makin money in Manhattan trick whats happenin
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel til my death its in my flesh its in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with Im finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual suck a dick Im disrespectful
You know the kid get it getget sick
Spit clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
Oh thats your girl huh Well I just hit it
Its AAP nigga live with it swag

These evil thoughts they start to drown me

Demons posted all around me I cant beat em all alone
Thinkin bout you thinkin bout you  Add it to your thoughts

Demons posted all around me I cant beat em all alone
