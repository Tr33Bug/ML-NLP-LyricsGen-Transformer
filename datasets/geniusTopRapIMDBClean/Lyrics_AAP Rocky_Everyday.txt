Every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waitin here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go here I go here I go
Off again there he go to another dimension my mind
Body soul imprisoned my eye probably goin ballistic but listen
Im missin a couple of screws they aint never do drillin true
You been sippin away at the truth a double shot of wisdomll do
Do do rollin through hittin switches
Rolling ditches blowin kisses to the bitches holdin biscuits
Whats the business Beat the system
Codefendants blow the sentence go to prison
Go to church and pray the father Lord forgive us  Amen 
And only God can judge me  Yeah 
And he dont like no ugly
I look so fuckin good most dykesll fuck me buddy
Yeah Im a piece of shit I know I plead the fifth
I tell her Holler if ya need some dick
The devotion is gettin hopeless but hold it Im gettin close
As my soul is Im seein ghosts a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions adjustin to the motions
And gettin out all my emotions
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waitin here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go here I go here I go
Uh this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got em bustin out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin that they caused it
Cause the Porsches get em nauseous
Plus I aint even mad yet niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf thats good news
Hood dudes usually dont look like you
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you
Screamin Pimp Squad hold it down
Cant drive bitch Im legally blind bitch
If I live or die its up to me to decide
Shit niggas coppin guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a faade bitch
And Ill be fine justa drinkin my wine bitch
I got the love birds chirpin at the window
But I dont need love no more
Ill be fine sippin wine
Takin time slow
I got the love birds chirpin at the window
But I dont need love no more
Ill be fine sippin wine
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine feelin fine
Waitin here to find the sign
I dont care if I ever know
Here I go here I go here I go
I got the love birds chirpin at the window
But I dont need love no more oh no
Ill be fine sippin wine
Takin time slow
I got the love birds chirpin at the window
But I dont need love no more oh no
Ill be fine sippin wine
Takin time slow
