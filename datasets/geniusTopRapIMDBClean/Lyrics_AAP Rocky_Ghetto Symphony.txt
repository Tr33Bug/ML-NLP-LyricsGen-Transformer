Do just what I tell you  Uh 
Dont come in any closer  Uh 
And no one will get hurt
Cause I dont know how long I can hold my heart in two  Uh 
A rebel I be one day
On that track with Gunplay
Outoutcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andr  Uh 
Beef is on my entre  Yeah 
Gin and juice thats Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way I swear life is like a oneway  Uh 
Pussy on a Sunday  Yeah 
Business on a Monday  Yeah 
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway  Uh 
Come be my fiance
She fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge just sit around and watch her sunbathe  Yeah 
Dinner date for one K  Bitch 
Shopping date for two K  Bitch 
Bougieass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days  Yeah 
Finally got it today  Uh 
Swear to God my mood changed  Uh 
Top off like toupees drop off touch  Bitch 
Yeahyeah my mouth is full of gold and Im a city boy  Yeah 
And my outfit was in Vogue Im a pretty boy  Uh 
Bounce boy Flacko tell em holler at a nigga G  Yeah 
Ridin on my enemies  Yeah 
This my ghetto symphonyny  Uh yeah 
Uh yeah uh yeah 
Uh yeah uh yeah 
Stop
Louder
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Whipwhippin Whitney my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin and lockin up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle she know its dismissal
Spread the news Im official now hop out my foreign vessel  Uh 
Before I get aggressive forget it warready
Already tested tears and blood invested
Til my cardiacs arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that  Uh 
Black magic on the tires only I
Rollrollin down a lonely mile phony smile
Warrants police on me now still tourin
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Dont complain I came to reign from here forward
Still noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports  Uh 


Stop
Louder
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer  Uh 
Since Rocky spit like Andr
Im gon kill em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entre
Eat em like cookies Chips Ahoy
Mm enjoy when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas thatll kill for joy
Either Gunplay runway trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking how fast you could grip a 9
Damn look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin wine
Guess thats why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died
Never
Spittin it like a Beretta nobody do it better nigga
