Aha aha
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy til shit pop off
Lets take it to the basics you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces aint no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it thats just a understatement
Im early to the party but my Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Lifes a mothafucka aint it These other rappers aint us
So tell me what your name is Ima tell it to my stainless
You aim it fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
Its just me myself and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell em to they face they aint no G
Low key niggas mad cause Im smooth puffin Zig Zags
Tell em quit the riff raff bitchin with your bitch ass
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy til shit pop off


Yes Im the shit tell me do it stink
It feel good wakin up to money in the bank
Three model bitches cocaine on the sink
And Im so bout it bout it I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink rollin up that dank blowin on that stank
What you mean Tell me what you drink Im on that kissin pink
You could call me Billy Gates got a crib in every state
Man on the moon got a condo out in space
Open up your legs tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin shit so tell em Tell it to my face
Tell that bitch hop up on my dick rolled up on her quick
In a six told her suck a dick motorboat her tits
Im the shit niggas mad cause Im smooth puffin ZigZags
Tell em quit the riff raff bitchin with your bitch ass
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy til shit pop off
