TranslationsEspañolHell Lyrics
Uh, uh

We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules, I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun, then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swaggin' in philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting, yeah, I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze (Achoo)
There your reasons go, bitch
I got some tissues for your issues, tell 'em blow this
Bitch!
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

Roger, Roger, tell 'em roger that (It will hit you on the head)
It’s the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat (You don’t even gotta hate me now babe)
With the stocking cap, Jason mask on, probably strapped (Just as sheeps get led, ohh)
It’s the Rocky cat, turn my swag on, holla back (You could see where I'm going, ohh)
Throw a dollar at a bidd-itch, tell 'er suck my di-dick
Cause they hatin' on my clid-dick
Cause we made it when we did it, hate it cause they didn’t
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, hoopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin' like a drippin' smoothy, no coaster
The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers
Cuz Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title
For now I’m po-pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

It will hit you on the head
You don’t even gotta hate me now babe
Just as sheeps get led, ohh
You could see where I'm going, ohh
How you gonna feel now? You know what they say
Really you know that we don’t come how we get down
Everyone say "Rocky ahead"
They rollin', do what he said, no they can't get it wrong

Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long45Embed
