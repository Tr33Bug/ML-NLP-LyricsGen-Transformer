Its true I guess I mean wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ignant Really Really
Church bells and choir sounds tell em Quiet down
Bow your head the Most Highs around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me ties and gowns happen now

They ask me why I dont go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs my sister the next stripper
