Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world wont take you serious
When I met you you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin still
Bbang him with the stainless steel
Cause Im making the order
Laugh at the altar pullin a Lord up
Dont get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker nigga the talk of
Town nigga we bossed up
Bounce but when you talk to the Lord
Of course youre forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlems what Im reppin nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause Im down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas Ill ride for my niggas
Ill die for my niggas man fuck them other niggas
Lord please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord
Gettin faded hair gettin braided Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin spades bumpin Jimi Hendrix Purple Haze
A 40 to the face call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy Ill be on my way
But grab the Jimmy so the bitch dont get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga Im a jiggy nigga ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge it can make any problem go away
Talkin Jay talkin Ye that mean you niggas talkin cray
Razor blade across your face I fix my face then walk away
I guess then theres nothin more to say
Trill nigga to the death whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin and pinchin that broad dough
Its a bit different now switchin and flippin that raw flow
Substance get me higher reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water Im preachin to the choir
Long live AAP now bow to your Messiah bitch


Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come gods come Lords
Lords Lords Lords
Oh Lord Toast to the Lords
As we live this day please pray for us
When comes the saints comes the evils brings the Lords
