And Im a man of my word that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late Im a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but who will lean if I fall
But never mind Im fly you know
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
Im the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But its cold how we smashing left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like Flacko where your ass been
Heard you done with fashion now yo ass is acting
Im tripping off the acid now yo ass is looking massive
This aint the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs clique beside me fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
Im all alone though mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin on how I shifted pop culture changed hiphop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pops culture
I be damned if I die sober Ill be sure to visit Pac for ya
And Im a man of my word that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late Im a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but where do I land if I fall
But never mind Im fly you know
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz come again
When my death calls I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior cause its dropping next fall
Dont you short the next ball my closet like the Met ball
She said I just love it when you speak softspoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin
That touch your soul music I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the fathers music hallelujah
Always Strive  Prosper stupid
Even Montell cant tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it


And Im a man of my word that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late Im a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but where do I land if I fall
But never mind Im fly you know
Okay lets get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive get embarrassed it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion Im just laughing off it
I changed rap pushed fashion forward yeah Im that important
You jack my style she jack me off and yall both acting awkward
Jiggling baby nah go ahead bitch
Aint nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you motherfuckers get familiar
Its not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azaleas from Australia trips to Venezuela
Cinderellas under my umbrella for different weather
Ella ella ayy just play it like I didnt tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that Im afraid of is the love word
More power to you more power to you my lovely one
More power to you more power to you my lonely one
More power to you more power to you my lovely one
Whats up bruh That all depends
With friends like you who need friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when its your advice
Oh Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle aint wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy bitch you missed out fomo
I got one child one child
But Im fuckin fuckin fuckin like Im tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
Cause Im a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah
