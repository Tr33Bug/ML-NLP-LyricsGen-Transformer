Kissinâ€™ Pink Lyrics

Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come faded, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded (No more)
She's all that I need
I'm filling your cup up, with Sprite and codeine
She get me so high but, I'm down on my knees
What is it your desire? Your life or that lean?
Wait a minute, cause ain't shit changed, just a different day
This the kinda pain I just couldn't take away
Something like Wayne cause you couldn't feel your face
Is you in it for the feeling or the taste? Wait a minute
What's the motherfuckin' problem? Me and my niggas mob
Throwing up gang signs, fuck a goon and a goblin
Gold grill shining, don't ask me how I got 'em
Styrofoam cups with Jolly Ranchers at the bottom

Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come faded, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded (No more, no more, no more, no more, no more)
Mmm, wait a minute
You might also like
Hey, and now I'm blowing hella smoke
Talking on my cell-a-phone and I got that purple on me
She sipping on my styrofoam cup
Telling me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claiming I'm a Pimp C
Cause I'm sipping Big Moe when I'm on that Screw juice
She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's turtle time, feeling like the world is mi-mine
And I be on my Fergenstein
I stay on my money grind then I'm going outta my mind
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine Guy
And I'm kissing on that pink juice
Sipping on that Pimp juice (She's all that I want)

Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come faded, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded, drinking codeine and (No more)
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and
Every fuckin day straight promethazinin' (She's all that I want)
Fa-Fa-Faded (No more, no more, no more, no more, no more)
Mmm, wait a minute
You can smoke that weed, you can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed, you can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed, you can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed, you can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want, bitch35Embed
