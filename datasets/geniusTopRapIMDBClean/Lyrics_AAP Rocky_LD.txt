I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
Im ridin round with my system bumpin LSD
I look for ways to say I love you
But I aint into makin love songs
Baby Im just rappin to this LSD
She aint a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights LSD  Acid 
I get a feelin its a trippy night
Them other drugs just dont fit me right
Girl I really fuckin want love sex dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes its all a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in feelin that you crave doin love sex dreams
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin of sharin love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin of sharin worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said I really wanna let it go
Ive been gettin fly because the gimmicks so dope
Ive been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
Ive been drinking driving now well never go home
I gon stay in doubt because the weathers so cold oh
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it
Can you feel it


It started in Hollywood
Duh duhduh
Dreamin of sharin love
Duh duhduh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
I look for ways to say I love you
But I aint into makin love songs
Baby Im just rappin to this LSD
