Uh  Uh 
Yeah  Lord Pretty Flacko nigga 
Yeah  Yeah

Whoo  Whoo 
Yeah  Yeah

Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links
Got me reminiscin bout my old day
Three 6 suck a nigga dick no foreplay all day
Boomin out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin turn it down or she finna call the cops
We be plottin on the opps she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A and its okay
They gon take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill poppin seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick sip Cris fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let em know whos really trill
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Dirty fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin our minds
Niggas talk down every now and then
On the side who gave em style nine times out of ten
It was Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye
Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye
I aint never lookin for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin fuck the world never catch me with my pants down
Always been a standup guy Id rather stand out
Raf Simons Stan Smith edition with my bands out
Im the trillest one to do it since Pimp nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me thats a man down
Trick what Pimps up hoes down whoa now
Slow down see they runnin with my old style
Grow foul gold smile you ho now thuggin with my old style
Its a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature uh
Trappin through the speaker peep the beeper ringer uh
Turnin off phones just to reach em gotta beep em
Im a Lord motherfucker better greet him if you see him


Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Dirty fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin our minds
Niggas talk down every now and then
On the side who gave em style nine times out of ten
It was Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye
Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye
