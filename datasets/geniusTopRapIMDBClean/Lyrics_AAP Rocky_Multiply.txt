Doo rag keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers dont sleep take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin like he got a bad back back back
Even in my will keep it real thuggin in my field
Til the day I peel keep it trill anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill aimin bangin steel and slangin krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I aint really fuckin with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I aint really into throwin shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props word to Pac
Were the reason that these niggas gettin throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin gold
Jail pose in the pictures prayin fingers to your nose

Even in my will keep it trill to the day I peel
Even in my will keep it trill to the day I peel
Even in my will keep it trill to the day I
