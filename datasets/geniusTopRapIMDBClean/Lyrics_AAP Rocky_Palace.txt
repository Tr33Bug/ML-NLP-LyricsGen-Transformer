Uh goddamn how real is this
I know them Harlem niggas gon be feeling this
East Coast nigga  Uh  but how trill is this
Still dont give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know them Harlem niggas gon be feeling this
East Coast nigga  Uh  but how trill is this
Still dont give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh
Stone cold love rose gold slugs
I could afford it I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold rolling stone Im a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone I was stoned nigga
Dont remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping Tennessee nigga nah
Influenced by Houston hear it in my music  Yeah 
A trill nigga to the truest show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel cause Im so trill
Two dope boy scales but I sold pills
No deal put her on her feet toenails
Them vampires them bloodsuckers them thirsty killers
We bout it bout it we rowdy rowdy that Percy Miller
For really real we chilly chill dont sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters Im bout to killa Im bout my skrilla
Give me the title then give me the cash fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash stealing my swag niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross her lip gloss slipons get slipped off
My bitch boss Cristal we smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass making it last walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs making em crash took in a section aint giving it back
Fuck the money fuck the fame this is real life
An insight to my trill life Clams
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know the whole world gon be feeling this
East Coast nigga boy how trill is this
Still dont give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know the whole world gon be feeling this
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know the whole world gon be feeling this
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know the whole world gon be feeling this
Uh goddamn how real is this
I know the whole world gon be feeling it
