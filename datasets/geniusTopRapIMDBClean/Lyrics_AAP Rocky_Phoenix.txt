Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies say Im lucified
Baptized in the gutter motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores they be supersized
Good and bad having wars nigga choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures call me Basquiat Picasso
Capo Head Hancho now my followings colossal
Aint no boxer Pacquiao but got the chopper todo caso
Its like you heard God spoke I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle goodnight folks
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
Its a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied still was crucified
Thats why I never judge another nigga
Lifes a bitch but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed sheets no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas wassup with niggas
So my new attitude is like Fuck them niggas
I grew up with niggas but dont fuck with niggas
I dont trust them niggas aint got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla now the whole world fuckin with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm take cover niggas
If I shall ever fall Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zipmeups
Now Im walking on my own yall wish me luck
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
Its all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
Its all part of the plan
