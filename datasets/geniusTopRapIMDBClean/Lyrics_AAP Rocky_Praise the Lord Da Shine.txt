Get it
Text a message I dont know the number
Flexin on these niggas every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots but never hurting numbers
Even then yall dont worry nothin
And Id like to give a shoutout to my niggas with a game plan
And shoutouts to my niggas with escape plans
Uh twenty bands rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded rocket loaded okay lets rock and roll this
Its time to go Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded diamonds glowing chartclimbing on em
Youd think Im jumping out the window how I got em open
Line around the corner line em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when its time to focus
My shades Dior my pants velour
Create explore expand conquer
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take whats mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take whats mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours
Yeah I sold the pack the loose the hard  Yeah 
I listened to X I peeped the bars  Yeah 
The snakes the rats the cats the dogs
The games a trap protect your heart  Yeah 
I waited in line return refine
The new design its time to shine
To shine to shine to shine to shine
I hustle I flex the world is mine
So please believe allow the greaze
These niggas disease dont speak we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate youre lame your loss
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take whats mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take whats mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours


Uh she came I came now whats my name
My chain my pants my pants with the chain
They know its me the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans my braids my mans my babes
My girls my ex my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car thats a flex
Give thanks get fresh praise the Lord then finesse bless
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law

It rains it pours it rains it pours
I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take whats mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours
