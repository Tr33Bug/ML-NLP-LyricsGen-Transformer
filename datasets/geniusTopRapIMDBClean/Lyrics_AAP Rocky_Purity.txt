Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac think my phone tapped
Hold up hold that  Hold on my nigga hold that   Im undone because  thought

Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Facetoface with my demons at a barstool

Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin since September
Last seen her September 16
