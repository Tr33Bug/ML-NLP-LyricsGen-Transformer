TranslationsPortuguêsPurity Lyrics
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull (this what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer (I gotta f-)
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me (this what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind (I gotta f-)
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone
You might also like
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab (I'm undone because)
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) (I'm undone because) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused , (I'm undone because) don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke (I'm undone because)
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like (I'm undone because)
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace
"I'm undone because—"
"I'm undone because—"120Embed
