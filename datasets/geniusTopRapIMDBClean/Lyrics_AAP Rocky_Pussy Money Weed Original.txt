Pussy, Money, Weed (Original) Lyrics
All I think about is life, nights, sippin' on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little arguments in the fist, don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes gettin' pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice
Young nigga cold like he sit on ice
Fuck broke, tryin' to be rich all life
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back
Hoes screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' West side, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all in my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white, but my cock black
Purple drink, got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk somethin'
Bounce on me, bitch, hurt somethin'
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth somethin'
So shawty, she a stunna and daddy, he a runna
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
'Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shakin' it fast and then makin' the stacks
And I'm takin' it back and I'm takin' her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kickin' her out
How 'bout me and you, and you and her
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
So I say

Uh, smokin' out, pourin' up
Purple drink up in my cup
Bitches actin' Hollywood
In my hood they wanna fuck
Purple stuff, yellow tuss
Yellow stuff look like a bus
She look like the type to front
But most likely the type to fuck
Make a buck, catch a nut
This shit be that trill livin'
Show you how the trill get it
Nigga, Pimp C gone, but he still livin'
'Cause I'm still sippin' and my grill's glistenin'
Got me gold grills, shinin' and I'm still tippin'
'Cause I'm still pimpin', but it feel different
'Cause it's trill pimpin', nigga deal with it
That's all a nigga need, that's all a nigga need
Got a bitch up on my shoulder, got another on my sleeve
I said these bitches know my steeze
WV's, weak in the knees
Got them bitches movin' them keys
Rollin' the weed, duckin' them Gs
Got a bad bitch from Belize, another overseas
If she don't wear no weave, then her hair down to her knees
Got my wifeys smokin' trees, my bad bitch on that E
But that pussy, money, weed, shit that's all a nigga need
You might also like
How 'bout me and you, and you and her
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
So I say
