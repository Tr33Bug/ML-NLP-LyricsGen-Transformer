I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight but now they so polite
All I see is fake love smiles and overbites
But Im pimping nigga Dolemite
I remember when I was like ten maybe nine
Ricky had a deucedeuce two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit that made me rhyme
Whats up whats on your mind Hold up Im feeling fine
Locs got me blind thugging like Im EazyE up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess thats why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches aint respect us
On the park bench playing checkers sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down thats four kids but one lived
Left three dead but one split that one miss that one snitched
Thats everyday shit shit we used to that
Add it up do the math with your stupid ass
Dont view me as no conscious cat this aint no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap my macll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture penny nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cookconnect named Sosa Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa hit Daytona fuck the law we soldiers
Im bout it bout it nigga aint shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking bout me
Im so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging bugging showing out in public but you love it
I only got one vision thats for kids in every color religion
That listen we gotta beat the system stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision but we all God children we siblings
You my brother you my kin fuck the color of your skin
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash Ill be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the Lac when I spin
Then its back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that then attack never tax never that that
Max on the ends spend ends I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends just to put a snack up in the fridge
When Im on I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say whats up to me
From ugly to comfortably suddenly
It all changed man it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now Im comfortable
I just only can thank God suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
