Wassup Lyrics
Clams Casino, A$AP (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)

Back once again, sipping Henn', mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin' Benjamins
Spinners spin on them twenty twins, that Mercedes Benz
Dividends made a change of plans, well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush motherfuck' the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sippin' on that codeine
We hustle hard, no sleep, your bitch loose, that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds 'cause that shit is a fa√ßade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second

See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood (Uh), the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
Uh

Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror (Uh)
Clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up (Uh)
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a vent, 40 ounce full of brew

I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)You might also like78Embed
