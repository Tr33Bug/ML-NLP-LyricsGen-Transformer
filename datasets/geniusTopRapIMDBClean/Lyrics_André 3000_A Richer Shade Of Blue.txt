You see all these people out here on this street Eddie
See they got blues
Im talking bout they poor
They broke they hungry thats blues
Well the blues can live in Buckhead too
I know its just a richer shade of blue
But its still blue I can feel it listen
He got everything he want
But everything he need money dont buy
Now if that aint blues Ill say listen oh
They look at you
All they see is dollar sign
Now if that aint blues Ill say listen
A rich shade of blue
Okay okay you snappin you snappin
A rich shade of blue
Well Im just playing what I feel and it sure feels good
A rich shade of blue
I see Ima have to bring you down to Bankhead more often
Cause you goin off
A rich shade of blue
Or we can take it to Buckhead and do it Peachtree style
A rich shade of blue
Everybody fall down sometime yeah just like that
Oh but you gotta get back to the place where they know your face
And they dont mind if you cry sometimes
They listen cause they cry too
Ooh thats right right right
A rich shade of blue
I guess it aint where you from its where you at
A rich shade of blue
Its my birthday and Im having the best worst time of my life
A rich shade of blue
Man we stand out on this corner any longer
You gon make me rich
A rich shade of blue
