1 2 3 4 can I just have a little more
5 6 7 8 9 10 I love you
A B C D can I bring my friends to tea
E F G H I J I love you
Yeah yeah sail the ship
Aha chop the tree
Whoa skip the row
Yeah look at me
All together now together
Black white green red
Can I take my friend to bed
Pink brown yellow orange and blue
I love you
All together now together
Sail the ship
Chop that tree
Skip that row
Everybody look at me look at me
All together now together
