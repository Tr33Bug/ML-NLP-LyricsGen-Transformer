I I I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bed
Oh and you you and your head high
And your tears dry  get on without your guy
And I I I went back to a anew
So far removed from all weve been through
Ohohoh and you and you and you
You tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
Youll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
Id go back to her
And you go back to
You go back to
