Chronomentrophobia  Movie Version  Lyrics
Chronomentrophobia the fear of clocks
The fear of time
Highs the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I aint got tiiiime
Leave me aloone
Aint that much time left
Ive got to funk you now
Chronomentrophobia  x8 
Lord be havin mercy on my soul
Im havin the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien aint got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while yall made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought Id make it this far
Still battlin in this racial war
Tryin to find solutions to the situation Im facin
Only thing thats free is my flow that yall be chasin
Lettin my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Lets stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
Im in it for good
You enter my hood you wont be findin much
Hope that when Im gone yall remember this
What we stood for fuck that fame and that glitz
Its beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin
Revelations getting impatient
Now Im dead
Remember what I said
Im gone
Bow ya heads
