Alright Westley Funkaneers today we go to war

Hello Well lady your instruments whatever
You know what Im talking about
Because we have a big big problem on our hands
And I say before we let this blob take over our city
We funk him outta town

Where it goes no one knows
Maybe underground where its found
But it cant play here no more sing come on
Nuclear waste sloppy joe
Where it goes no one knows
