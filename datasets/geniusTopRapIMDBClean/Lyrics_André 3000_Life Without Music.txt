La la la
Lllife without mmmusics
Like lllife without love
Man if we had no music what would we dance to
What would we sing to
How would them babies learn their ABCs
Oh no
No Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars
No Old McDonald Had A Farm
And birds would have nothing to sing
No Take Me Out To The Ball Game
Life without music
This is terrible
No no no 
Uh we wouldnt even whistle
No no no 
And we wouldnt have a heartbeat
Cause we wouldnt know what a beat was
Life without music
Thats so lame
Life without music 
Man we wouldnt even have no ring tones
Shawty the phone wouldnt even ring
Life without music 
Uh it would just vibrate
At least nobody will be able to download your songs
Life without 
Shes got a point
We gon have to do something bout this
