MeMy  To Bury Your Parents  Lyrics
Me and my mother driving to the grocery store
Me riding shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustling harder rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father driving to the football game
Me riding shotgun my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughing
I was much happier when he was around
When he was around
When he was around
Around
Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my
Me and my
Me and
Me and
Me
