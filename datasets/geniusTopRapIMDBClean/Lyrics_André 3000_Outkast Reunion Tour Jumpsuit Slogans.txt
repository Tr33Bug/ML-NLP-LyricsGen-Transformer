YinYang 
X
FCK 3000
I pray theres a god at the end of all this
Life is short take more baths
Children of the cornbread
Ive never been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call you back
Obviously oblivious
How good a friend are you
Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict
Umm you still on yo pyramid
Across cultures darker people suffer most why
Ok hand over the cure and stop playing
Art or fart
Ive never had fckbook twittr or instgram
Everything is temporary
Ninjas kill me
Breathe
Sloppy wet Poseidon
God or god
I love old people
Loners get lonely too
Narcissistic americans
Thinking deeply about shallow sit
Passionate about compassion
