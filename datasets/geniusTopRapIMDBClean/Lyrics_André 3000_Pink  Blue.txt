 Aaliyah 
Age aint nuthin but a number 
Pretty pink baby blue
Why dont  why dont  you teach me something new
Were all  were all  just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink baby blue
Why dont  why dont  you teach me something new
Were all  were all  just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I dont care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here and actually I think thats funky
In a Claire Huxtable type way 
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And Ill teleport from here to there
You show me how its supposed to be done
Ill make sure you have young fun
Pretty pink baby blue
Why dont  why dont  you teach me something new
Were all  were all  just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink baby blue
Why dont  why dont  you teach me something new
Were all  were all  just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Youre sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
Youve got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
Shes so sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
Oh momma
Youre sophisticated
Make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
Youre so experienced
Got me talkin like a baby
Teach me somethin new
Teach me somethin new
Youre sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You got me talkin like a baby
