And I aint looking for no gifts outta Santa Claus sack
Santa aint real let alone is he black
Catch him coming down my chimney and the Macll go Vrack
You scared  Get a dog get a cat
I bet the cat put the tongue on you rats
Niggas extend their hands put their hands in their lap
Scared to face the man in the mirror Mike Jack
The mere sight of Beans raise the hairs on your back
Niggas talking compared to Sig you wack
Scrap I know you aint wanna talk about that
But since niggas talking lets talk about facts
From the city where its long dark nights here

I could say shit that make B look at you different
And my gangsta wasnt never on trial
But I was I stood up tall no snitching
But the rapper Shawn called the police on me
Cause I was front row at the Blueprint 3

Real rap
See I think I held my tongue long enough
About this whole RocAFella situation
I was the realest thing that happened to the Roc
The Roc was just a rock
I brought the fellas to RocAFella Records
Hot 97 stay proper yall remember
I brought the street cred to that
That thing etched in stone
I fought all them battles me thats who
Jadakiss Nas Dipset
Anybody you wouldve told me to go after
Matter of fact you aint even have to tell me
I front line for that Roc
For that finger guard
For that diamonds that people was throwing up
Id a took a bullet for Roc that day
This aint about a dollar
This aint about me hating on you cuz or anything
Cause I never asked you for a dollar
When I came home from jail
Home out here in the day
When you aint come one day to come see me
Not one picture a letter
I went to the office and asked you
Let me off RocAFella Records out that situation
Cause somebody no man no blame wanted me
And they wanted to give some real money
And you bounced that tennis ball around in your office for a hour
And went back and forth with me and told me you aint wanna let me go
You remember that dont you
You even asked me did I want some money and I told you I dont want your money
But you was in a position to make me get my own money
And you couldnt do that
But Sigel so real
And you will never go to jail again cause you knew I would shoot
If my life was a movie Sigel be the sequel
You aint fit for war
Cause Sigels in the field
Its etched in stone
My gangsta aint never been on trial
But guess what
How 2Pac say I aint mad at ya
I understand everybody cant go
And you are already old
Oh and dont get it fucked up
This aint the green light for everybody to start making diss JayZ records
Nah I still got love for the nigga
This me taking my brother in the yard for 5 minutes
Cause I got a knot in my chest that need to get unloosened
And you got love for a motherfucker dont go away that easy
See many people gonna walk in and out your life
But only real friends leave footprints on your heart dog
But I think yours fading in the sand
And thats real rap
And if me and you dont never talk again dog
And I gotta holla at you via MC on this mic what up
How you say Scream at me
The richest man aint the one with his first dollar dogg
Its the one who still got his first friend
RocAFella for life nigga
Its the Roc
