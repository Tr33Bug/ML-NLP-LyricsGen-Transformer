Beanie  Mack Bitch  Lyrics
You know my name bitch
Uhh yeah hold up
The streets gave me heat and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
Its the rap guerilla that still clapfucker
Yeah guess whos back
Mack bitch  I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks and towns
Move out with small Glocks and pounds  uhhuh 
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
Fuck who watching now the neighbors they in pocket now
Fuck you haters  cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you cant outwit me mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all yall fiends they call me Chef BoyarBeans
Beanie Crocker cook coke proper
Right amount of flour sifting it up
Coke spots running by the hour shifting it up
Graveyard shifts move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids use gats dont rumble
Gorilla niggas going apes in this concrete jungle
Banana clipsll make them monkeys humble
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Yeah but guess who back
Its Mack bitch  uhhuh back in the mix of the scuffle
Im in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Box man Frito Lay for that free dough boxing
You will lay nigga Im not playing
Listen whether I make cash or take cash
Im in the hood eating with my dog like when we break fast
Bs on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit when I skate past bitches shake ass
I sit fourthirty deep in wheels
You bout fourthirty cheap in wheels  small Benz
Look at your small rims small wheel small grill
Big Beans sitting in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly  how you want it You can have it
Drop top stick shift automatic
Back wheels still smoking
64 still rolling 3 wheel motion its ferocious
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Yeah but guess who back


On the low though  shh  the whole city is mine
Im trying to flood the whole city with dimes
Im in the kitchen yeah with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up BULLSHIT
You switched your hustle when the rap game showed up  uhhuh 
While you wasting your time spitting them rhymes
Im getting mine spitting them rhymes plus still pitching them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but Im sicker than nine
Im live with the pound small silencer calming the sound
Stick with the seven strictly Smith with the seven  shit 
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that Im popping for keeps 
Im not getting stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga trying to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIE Yeah but guess who back
