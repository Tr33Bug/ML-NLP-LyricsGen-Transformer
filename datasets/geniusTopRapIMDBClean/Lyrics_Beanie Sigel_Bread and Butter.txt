Darling
Ya know you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention you take my paycheck
Now baby but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know like runnin my car into telephone poles
But I still love you baby I didnt get mad did I
YYymember member when
WWWhen I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
And on the way out
My very best pinstripe caught a nail
I didnt get mad
I was proud because you thought enough of your man
To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand yes it did
Uuh I need you I just need you
Uh
You know I was your bread your butter
And I aint talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasnt countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now why would I play you bitch I made you
Im not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin youre age koo
Naw I aint tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n youre world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor I basically raised you
From squada to Bentleywhippin
Aint have to watch Cribs to see how I was livin
