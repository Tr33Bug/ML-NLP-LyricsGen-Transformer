Niggas in the struggle all out ta get paid

Avoid the cage but you cant avoid the grave
We chapters of the same book just a different page
Niggas in the struggle all out ta get paid
Doin what we gotta do to avoid the raid
Avoid the cage but you cant avoid the grave
When you live by the sword you die by the sword
Ill probably die in the vocal booth spittin out raw
Die on stage rippin down tours
Die from AIDS trickin outatown whores
Die cause I didnt have one in the pipe
Might go out like Raymond went out on his bike
Or die on a death mission two TECs spittin
No vest section from my chest missin
Die cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a reckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin petty
Cause a broke ass nigga tried to say I ass bet em
Die from a shot from a SIG or Glock
From a kid on the block while sittin in the drop
Or die cause I was on aint see em comin
Too late eight shots got my body numbin
Die for fuckin his bitch in his bed
Die cause a nigga thought I snitched to the Feds
Die with a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row sentenced to the chair
Or die cause a nigga pulled his Roscoe out quicker
I was high off vodka hydro or malt liquor
Die cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die cause the cops tricked me to say that man
Die cause I hesitated to spray that man
Die cause I hesitated to pay that man
Die cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die cause I panicked I couldnt keep my cool
Die cause I mixed all them pills with Hennessy
Or die cause them niggas was jel they envied me
Die tryin to steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die cause the door wasnt open it was locked
Die cause the 4 was broken it wouldnt pop
Die cause a nigga wasnt focused on the block
Die cause them niggas thought the coke was in the spot
Die cause another nigga said I said somethin
Die cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin
Die cause a nigga was tryin to get a name
Or die cause it was just my time to feel the flames
Might get sparked might not feel no pain
Might go out like darkskinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots to the heart to the brain
Got all the dough dont know the cost of the game
Young buck didnt wanna come off the chain
Couldnt handle the rock got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac
Id rather go out in the Masjid makin Salat
