Somebodys burnin close to the ground
I been here beforebut I aint gone lay down
Naw naw you suckas I aint gone lay down
Uh aiyoa I walks like a pimp spark wit this mack
Click lock aint a smith you tell from this gat
You fuck around and lose a leg or somethin
I laser somethin Im a predator
Make me Schwarzennegger something
You niggas talkin bout a dolla aint a thing
I got da blocks spoiled keep oils like vavoline
I move work in and out da TriState
No trouble dont supply weight
All bubbles five eights
Yeah Im in and out of state
I touched alot of states
And yeah my plate touched alot steaks
And you crumbs cant supply a cake
And cake dont make crumbs its true
Do da knowledge wait
Im try to school you to some game youngin
But you nuckle head lame youngin
Swear you know the game youngin
Swear we move on the same train youngin
You on a different track
Im the conductor i can switch it back
Yall niggas dont realize 
What it takes to make this doe
Theres no mothafuckin way that I 
Can show you how we roll
Wish yall realized 
What it takes to make this cream
Moves Im makin wit my team
So simple as it seems
Yall niggas fuckin wit that bake and that come back
And always got a story like wait Imma come back
Sometimes you gotta go away to make a come back
And those that know when they go dont even come back
My nails dirty I aint sit on my hands
Scale dirty I aint sit on no grams
Jail worthy work the shit outta zans
Man hustlin all inside of me
I cop a spot pop them numbers like the lottery
Keep my lucky sevens big fours right beside of me
Nights pick six or keep hollows right beside of me
In case them numbers on them balls jump around
I gotta make a call come to town and dumb around
You mufackas betta buckle down
Before I buck you down
Naw nigga we cant knuckle now
We past dat we on another level
Like blast dat body bag casket nother shevel
Yall niggas dont realize 
What it takes to make this doe
Theres no mothafuckin way that I 
Can show you how we roll
Wish yall realized 
What it takes to make this cream
Moves Im makin wit my team
So simple as it seems
I sold it all
I even fucked up niggas on the dice
Bucked them niggas who was nice
Broke em all
You used to pop willies on the block
Now you pop willy on the block
So where da raw
My attitude like the state of Missouri
Can I relate to you story
Niggas naw
You talkin to the wrong one
Nigga Im a strong gun
Walked in this game
But Im in it for the long run
Till the lord come
Im a get it till its all done
Yall niggas dont realize 
What it takes to make this doe
Theres no mothafuckin way that I 
Can show you how we roll
Wish yall realized 
What it takes to make this cream
Moves Im makin wit my team
So simple as it seems
