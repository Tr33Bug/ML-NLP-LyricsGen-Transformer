Ma I think its safe to say
You aint seen a playa lay this way
Or play a game this way
Wit a attitude like
And ya dont stop
Aficionado so fashionable
With a confident swagger international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you dont stop
Hah sicka than your average
Money too long cant stash it
In the closet or the mattress
Paper stretch like elastic
Checks from advances the bank cant cash it
So the price for that never ask it
Just sign my name or pop plastic
Hating ass cops wanna harass em  Uh 
Searching for a Glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast  yes 
Lets get dressed and toast to the occasion
Cops couldnt page em flow so amazing hot like Cajun
You fucking wit the champ
Pop corks on champ like I just took the chip
Nigga took the stand when he coulda took the 5th
Yeah eat a dick wit AIDS on the tip keep my name off ya lips
Not guilty
Ma I think its safe to say
You aint seen a playa lay this way
Or play a game this way
Wit a attitude like
And ya dont stop
Aficionado so fashionable
Wit a confident swagger international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you dont stop


I said Im sicka than your average
Keep three shooters like the Mavericks
Short to the point like Nash is fucking wit a savage
Niggas press they luck get bucked like ashes
Three piece suits linen fabrics
Three quarter croc sharper than a pastor
B Sig bring the light to the masses
Of these rap bastards who gives street passes
One shooting can lead to three caskets
Jump suits state boots at least three stabbings
You softer than a Reebok Classic
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges
I was taught stay low and keep blasting
Po only know questions that was answered
Keep a number on the high price lawyer
Its foul ways nowadays everybody saw ya
Ma I think its safe to say
You aint seen a playa lay this way
Or play a game this way
Wit a attitude like
And ya dont stop
Aficionado so fashionable
Wit a confident swagger international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you dont stop
Now lets toast to the man that when he get out
That he gon do them thangs that he rap about
A true playa Phareal
Haters stay out my face
And know that thing still by my waist
Now lets toast to the man that when he get out
That he gon do them thangs that he rap about
A true playa Phareal
Haters stay out my face
And know that thing still by my waist
Uh once again Im sicker then em all
Niggas see Sig start shitting in they drawers
When I kick in the door
Stop the blood clot crying wipe the piss off the floor
The ape is back my gate is cracked
My jumpsuit and my cuffs is off
Yeah Im back on them bricks
Raise your cups and raise your glass
And lets toast to the boy B Mack yeah Im back in the mix
Ma I think its safe to say
You aint seen a playa lay this way
Or play a game this way
Wit a attitude like
And ya dont stop
Aficionado so fashionable
Wit a confident swagger international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you dont stop
