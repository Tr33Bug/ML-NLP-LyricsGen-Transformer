You cannot be me
ha ha 
Deke what I tell you What I tell you
Look at they face now You cats cannot be me its only one me
Look at they face now Stupid All of them
Im not the second nobody its one me
I told you it was gon happen
You can be that way if you want its me
Now look at they face Look at them crawlin on they knees
Sigel
Why niggas cant never just play they part
Gotta be the first ones that say they talk
Say they said first ones to say they did
Cant never be they self gotta play that kid
You know the same young buck you let touch the coke
And now that he come up he wanna cut your throat
And you gave from the block put em to your neck
Now he givin you a Glock puttin it to your neck
You know that same bitch said dont fuck with him
That nigga no good aint no trust in him
Two days later see her in a truck with him
Two years later now that bitch stuck with twins
That nigga been broke wide now she fuck his friends
Got a lap dance in bars and touch them ends
Time uncovered a veil over peoples plots
And the dumb shit they do to get on top
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wanna be a star dont wanna be who they are
Everybody wants to be a star
Every bitch wanna hop in your car every hater wanna give you scars
Man every fucking day these no flow niggas
Always in my face with they promo niggas
I thought I told yall I dont know Jigga
Im not Beanie Sigel and I dont flow neither
What happened to your keys and dreams of being cracklords
Now its Trinities MPs and trackboards
I switched my hustle to get this cream
Now everybody and they mom wanna spit 16
I got niggas wastin they change to get in this game
Like shit gon change when they get in this game
You think its just rhymes and beats
Man this shits stress time and heat deadlines to meet
Everybody wanna come cry to me come spit they little lines to me
You shouldnt of lied to me naw dog you cant rhyme wit me
Like you tied to me like I dont see what you tryin na be
Stop tryna be a star be who you are
Maybe you will go a little far
Man I aint gon lie I thought all the glitz was gold
And like Jay  I watched the truth unfold 
And now that I got a little time in with this rhymin
I found out everything that shine aint a diamond
Everything that come in a jar aint dro
Aint no use you spittin them bars you cant flow
Aint no use you gettin that R if it dont glow
And aint no use you gettin a car if you cant go
Get out the streets haters will draw you back
Like an automatic weapon thatll pull you back
Load somethin in the brain just to see you snap
I try to maintain but I see they trap
See they plot you can see me not
You can be me not niggas wanna see me popped  see me locked
See me in the block send me shots do anything to be on top
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wanna be a star dont wanna be who they are
Everybody wants to be a star
Every bitch wanna hop in your car every hater wanna give you scars
