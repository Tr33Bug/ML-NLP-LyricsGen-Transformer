My SpideySenses is tinglin
Feel something  Got my radars up 
Dootdoot dootdoot dootdoot dootdoot
Somethin going on I feel funny
Cant tell me nothin different  Different  my nose twitchin  Twitchin 
Intuition setting in like Steve vision  Uh 
I still close my eyes I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind  Mind 
So what I do I still take heed I still listen  Listen 
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism my words still skippin
Through air I know you cant dont wont get it  You square 
You niggas chose to ride that ship sunk with it
Im still afloat
I aint the captain of the yacht but Im on the boat
I aint acting what Im not knowing that I dont
You niggas acting like you will but I know you wont  You wont man 
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your handshake aint matching your smile aha you niggas foul
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
I sit alone in my fourcornered room staring at hammers  Hammers 
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me  Vests on me  two TECs extra clips on me  Clips on me 
I know my mind aint playing tricks on me  Damn 
I aint schiz homie  Homie  aint nobody drop a mick on me  Mick on me 
Its like they trying to plot and sit on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like Mack tighten up your circle before they hurt you
Read they body language  Body language 
Eightyfive percent communication nonverbal
Eightfive percent swear they know you ten percent  You know they story 
Man the other five timell show you just know you
Then pull they strings you the puppet master  Puppet master 
Fuck them other bastards  Man  man watch who you puffin after
Play your cards go against all odds
Shoot for the moon if you miss you still amongst those stars
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air  I aint scared nigga I aint goin nowhere 
I can hear it in your voice  Can you feel it 
I can feel it in the air  Can you feel me 
Can you feel the grim reaper floatin  Can you feel the grim reaper floatin 
Foul preacher quotin
Scriptures from Revelation was talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body gettin stiff  Stiff  soul levitatin  Levitatin 
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that hell ask for me As for my sins
No onell feel his wrath for me
I go through it so you wouldnt do it after me
As for me Im still circling the block before Im parkin
Not bitching Im just still cautious
Same black parka
Same Uzi extra clips still clapping with that same Lorcin
Damn I feel it in the air you not sincere
Nigga it aint an us or we or a Ima thing
Its a goodbad karma thing this a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something honestly
I can feel it in the air  I can feel it I can feel it 
I can feel it in the air  I can feel it yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I can feel it in the air  Ooh yeah 
I can hear it in your voice  Oohooh 
I can feel it in the air  I can yeah 
I can feel it in the air  Yeah yeah 
I can feel it in the air  I can feel it in the air 
I can hear it in your voice  Oohooh 
I can feel it in the air  Oohoohooh 
I can feel it in the air
