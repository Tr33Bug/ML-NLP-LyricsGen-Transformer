Pop up with the gun in ya crib fa the fun of it

Two guns you know desert eagle streetsweepers

Ill smack you in the grill all youll feel is the 45 hard
45 yards of football stitches look yall bitches Black 
Bullets in and out the same spot
Turn you so skinny you get in and out a raindrop
Skinny like a smoker in and out of cain spots
Hook drop dry coke in and out the same pot
Mac with the block could hustle at any cause
Ran through bricks like Nipsey Russel and Lady Ross
Tricky hustle quick to bust you 380 toss
You cant escape hell 357 with 8 shells
38 long six shots
Get ya shit stopped get ya clique got
Get ya strip hot you could get SWAT
