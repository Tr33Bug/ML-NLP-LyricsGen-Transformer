Forgive them for they know not what they do
Forgive me for what I will do
Let me see besides my life nigga I got my wife
Shakur Samir Ama Latif
Maamu Tafiq I got Sia Gina Jalen
And I got Walik I got my mother
My sisters my brother
I got my nephews and all my nieces
Think Im gonna let that just fall to pieces
Gotta keep that glued together
I got no room for error
Absent father gave me my survival skills
So if I gotta rob and steal to provide the meals so be it
Nigga this only a stick up
Dont turn it into an ambulance pick up
Give that shit up
Or feel the wrath from all the nights I suffered
With no supper just Wonder bread and butter
One bed four deep
No heat my little covers
Shivering laying in the piss of my little brother
Motherfucker you got me twisted
Think your little bitchass gonna stop my mission
Leave me with no pot to piss in
Blocks of cheese powder milk is how we stocked the kitchen
Mom out skitzing but aint smoke no crack her addiction
With slots tonk and black jack
My pop up state kept steaks and jack mack
Too young to understand that daddy aint coming back
Being the oldest boy I had to step in his shoes
I skipped class in the Hard Knocks is where I was schooled
Ive been shot by the police harassed by parolees
Fell in a state of depression damn near ODd
Feeling guilty if only I could foresee
That Id be the reason you niggas is drinking codeine
Before Future started sipping on that yellow tuss
I clip your life shorter than that yellow bus
You target put that beam on your back
Me the reason beaver leaned on the ack
Me the reason Philly even on the map
Me the reason your silly ass rap
Me ungrateful motherfuckers
And I tried to give you some game that Jay gave me
To make the transition from the street to the fame
You got a little fame and tried add street to your name
It aint the same
Im battlefield tested wounds all over my body
Where your scars at
Ride for my niggas willing to die
Whats your life like
Feel it in the air
Where them bars at
You aint been through shit you cant record that
The respect I get you cant afford that
You aint been through wars hugging your boys cryin
Might not make it back but you ride You lyin
And that shit you write it dont excite me
I push your shit to the white meat
Dont you ever think youre like me
Im the dad you never had
Whats your problem nigga Im like your father figure
And with that being said daddys here to put the kids to bed
Now get your ass upstairs and I better not hear that TV on
SP chasing niggas with that DC on
And whoever siding with him dying with him
Look him in his eyes right now try with him
When you come to the city youre like cancer
You were damn near in Pampers it was me and The Answer
Your own niggas cant stand you
Cause when you aint around they look like hunger
Ask Young Gunner forgot he got the Bentley damn near a summer
Had copies of keys to where I got my slumber
You shouldve left me asleep
You done woke up a sleeping giant with your arrogant defiance
Younging respect more valuable than money
And Im wellconnected all cross the country
Fuck you think that jet gonna land at
When the whole city strapped up where you stand at
No need to make music ever in my life
Im Muslim Halal wife I just beat you twice
The sad thing is I really fuck with ya
I just feel sorry for whoever stuck with ya
Good luck to ya
Nigga please  younging Im out your league
Im out your field lets be for real
I could keep going but thats overkill
I guess Ill see you when I see you
And when I see you I wouldnt want to be you
Good night
