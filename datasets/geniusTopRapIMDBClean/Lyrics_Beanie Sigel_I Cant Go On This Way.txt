Honor trust respect
Devotion friendship loyalty
Karma team us Roc solid
Devils damn
Wit no union and no benefits no dental plans
I cant eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin
You cant feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga shoes
A lack of greenll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rude
Make a drunk person sing a sober tune
I cant go on this way 
Fuck dat I cant do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift am I defeatin the purpose
Cuz you feel like shit when you miss your sons first shit
But who gon pay the bills supply the meals no surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely
I cant go on this way 
Im stressed out going through it I cant do it
If you put puppies in the oven do that make em biscuits
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen will they eat the kittens
Do you hear me or you listening theres a big difference
Do you catch the lines and the hooks or are you still fishin
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin me cancer
I cant go on this way 
Im stressed out going through it I cant do it
My momma say I got her nerves stressed
Got her waking up in cold sweats
Im hardheaded and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She cant handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son Im tellin ya please dont let me bury ya
I cant go on this way 
Im stressed man Im goin through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on let them niggas surround you shit
And make me feel like young Tinner from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin 
I cant go on this way 
Im stressed out I cant take it no more
Im moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill FIFA jogging
Stagnant running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I dont practice
I still pray Allah forgive me for my actions
Cuz I spit gangsta think Muslim and act Kaffir
I cant go on this way 
I gotta still feel feed my youngns so keep huggin
I cant wait until the rain turn to sunshine
Cuz I hate to spend my life my life my life my life
Stuck in one time Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Cant wait til rain turn to sunshine
Cuz I hate to spend my life my life my life my life
Stuck in the box
I cant go on this way 
Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto Im from the youngest be the ghettoist ones
Tryna make just as much as we could
Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could
Thats why thats why I hate em man
Them crackers aint nothing without paper
They look at us its nothing and uh
I cant go on this way 
Came too far and I aint going backwoods for nothing
I aint being distracted by nothing
Midgetsize to Dikembe I aint backed up from nothing
Ma Im still stressing
It aint the kid its the bills stressing she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib hold me down while Im gone
She hold me down as a kid hold me down while Im grown
I cant go on this way 
I choose not refuse not down on my own
Now off the streets runnin wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nicesize ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills aint getting paid in kids aint situated
I cant go on this way 
Yall better make a decision before us
Cuz the way that we living aint all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas dont like us
Despite them we gon do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing I aint with it
We aint with it 
They can get it all it take is a column
My dogsll be down if the rounds gotta unlit it though
I cant go on this way 
Someday got to forget it though
Consequences for my sentence got to forgive us though
