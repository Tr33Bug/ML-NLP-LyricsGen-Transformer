Ill give you something to talk about
Come around me fronting Ill air you out I go off
I dont shoot shit off dog I gun it down
Walk up on niggas and run em down
Pull a stock out that K throw a hundred rounds
Wont stop til your box lowered underground
Put you in the urn your bones will burn
The rap guerilla the wack rap ringtone killer
Im here to find a nigga equally realer its rare
You can meet me in the square if you dare to come near
I have no morals just a whole lotta piss
And a dick for you bullets and a clip for you
This the ignorance at least it looks that way
When you witness it kill at witnesses
Bury the hatchet matter of fact bury the casket
Kill niggas bury the ratchet
Pick it back up if I have to I used to bump niggas
And pump niggas out for the practice
The shit starter the shit finisher I dont know whats harder
When they release ya or when they sentence ya
The realness back like I promised
Ready to dig a nigga shit like a colonic I go off
I know its them again from last time remember them
They cant believe we back up in the club
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the semi
And you fuck with me Im gon let it off
I go off Off in this bitch like its legal
A nigga move around with the Eagle
I go off We say you get it if we dont believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel I go off
Big Pop of the prop on deck
Versace or LVs on the specks
My Gucc Los light up the ground when I step
Look beat it the kid aint mine I contest
I suggest you aim above neck
The vest cover the chest the pine cover the Heck
ler and Koch I dont rock for the cops
Horse with the stick in the hands of the jock
Everyday gear that I wear on the block
Can you picture me rolling  Can you see clear like Pac 
Who shot ya Who want beef with Big Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you like Chaka Khan Im the don
Make niggas talk through the wire like Kan
A trip to the morgue turn a duck to a dime
You can catch me on my shit stuck to a grind
On a mission tryna turn a buck outta dime
Or in the kitchen tryna turn a fuck outta nine
Nigga listen I earned every buck that was mine
I aint never cry over a fuckin dime dont make me go off
I know its them again from last time remember them
They cant believe we back up in the club
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the semi
And you fuck with me Im gon let it off
I go off Off in this bitch like its legal
A nigga move around with the Eagle
I go off We say you get it if we dont believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel I go off
First gear pop the clutch
Second gear throw it up third gear Im on stuck
Fourth gear Im at Twelve OClock
I know I probably get it in twelve a block
But its price to low some Im scared to cop
Guns a blow and I aint scared to pop
I know niggas upstate doin life in the box
I know niggas upstate doin life with they pops
Its the bully whether you like it or not
The chain cool but you dont look right in a watch
So give it up smooth yeah or the riflell pop
Well get you some shoes probably look nice in the box
Flow smooth light on my feet like Heav D
Money Earnin all day but I aint from Mount V
Just threw a bell on the scale of the tree
I dont know make em two hundred every pea
Without rap I could double on a D
Shitt make it snow in a blizzard like Jeez
You dont know a noone nother like Sige
You dont really wanna see me in the streets dont make me go off
I know its them again from last time remember them
They cant believe we back up in the club
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the semi
And you fuck with me Im gon let it off
I go off Off in this bitch like its legal
A nigga move around with the Eagle
I go off We say you get it if we dont believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel I go off
Ill give you something to talk about I go off
Come around me fronting Ill air you out I go off
