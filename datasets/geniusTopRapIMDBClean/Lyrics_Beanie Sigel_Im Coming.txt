Philadelphia
I dedicate to you this song
Olympick 
Fuck it Im coming
Uh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhmhmm
Somebody got to die
Either this guy or this guy
Either way somebody mama throwing a fish fry
Bigger the beef bigger the clip size
Home Depot trips duct tapes zip ties
Was gonna leave it dead let shit slide
But niggas pushing my fuckit button
I gotta fuck up something
Im thinking churches and hearses
ER trips IV drips and nurses uh
Homicides for purchase but I think I might work this
Cash that check myself though
Vest with the velcro
Clip from the wrist to the elbow
Draco small but the drum cant fit in the belt though
Trench coat still cant tell though
It is what it is but we aint gon dwell though
If shit hit the fan cuz just dont tell though
I respect what hes done New overthrows the old its natural
Ambulance screaming up the block
Shots so loud can barely hear em screaming stop
Vaguely hear somebody screaming cops
Spray the family while they grieving at his plot
On target till I off it
You want me off your head Where that bread nigga cough it
Issue me a ticket or Ill park it
Or I get you fitted for that coffin
Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in
Back on course with no remorse
Like the fat guy from BedStuy kick in doors
Everybody getting on the floor
Everybody in this bitch get it but the whore
Bitch where that bag at
Yeah yeah I love them too but where that tab at
Somebody cashing out or Im blasting out
Talking bout what Aint shit to ration out
You drew that line so Ima cross it
Now lay inbetween them lines when they chalk it
Catch you at the Clearport extra cartridge
Aint no jets departing only death departing
Teterboro with the barrel exercise the plan
Understand you aint never too fly to land
How you goin through your face and your feet
Hogtied broom in your ass you in too deep
Fucking with the crypt keeper grim reaper
You just a tweeter Im the knock in the Devils speaker
Stop this bigger than Omeeka
I wanted you and ITY Latifah
Switch this horror flick double feature
Gee what niggas do for money my brothers keeper
A sucker way out is to steal him
Face said look him in his eyes fore you kill him
Nigga you weak for real
You did that for Meek You shoulda did it for Mills
Bitch you should of did it for real
Got niggas checking under cars fore they get in their wheels
Before I check you up to God better get in your will
You niggas better pick a side fore I get in the field
Aint gon have no pics when Im blicking the steel
Everybody getting fired when Im clicking the drill
Uhhuh Poppa gave out warnings not me
Just another body for mama to ID
You could play a game but not me
All shells no stripes Y3
Heart cross your windpipe cannot breathe
One cannot fight what one cannot see
Yeah and I be there when the smoke clear
Drown in your own blood nigga soak there
I pluck you then rock him I aint no joke yeah
Check out my felonies checkcheck out my felonies
Sell your soul you say your ass what you telling me
Fuckin faggots pussies
Been doing this fuckin rookies
Crush your whole empire Cookies
Why the fuck would you push me
And no more Ruckus Im reckless
What you expected Im coming
Uh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhmhmm
Im coming uhm
