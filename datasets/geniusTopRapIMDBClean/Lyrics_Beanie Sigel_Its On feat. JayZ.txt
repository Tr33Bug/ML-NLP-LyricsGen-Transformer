Its On  feat JayZ  Lyrics Beanie Sigel 
Bare witness to the greatest cant beat us join us
Keep heaters on us with red lasers
Now far warning short shots wont graze ya
We hug corners play blocks like gators
With bundles on serve tres like waiters
Its the life we chose the hustle
Cant stop it cant knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas tryna break tables
Stack chips like Connect 4
While you pricks try and whip tryna stretch more
Charge less for that aint the program
Getcha lessons from the snowman
Like Pilsbury I get the dough man
Ill off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and Im true to my peeps
Gimme a bird and my crew gon eat
Im over the stove like Cuban Linx
Breakin down Cash Money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do  JayZ same song 
Grown man nigga baby who
I send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool propane flow flame you dudes
No names dont claim ya shoes
Once again its on nigga
Sigel hard like corn liquor
I take you out this world like you was born nigga
Buttnaked covered in blood gaspin for air clingin for dear life
Nigga you dead right
JayZ 
Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinklin the world with baby powder
So Fresh and So Clean
Been an OutKast since I was a teen
But I outlast cause I outblast anybody you bring
Young you got it the prophet
I told yall niggas then I showed yall niggas
You Cant Knock It
Dont get carried away you a mute nigga  mute nigga 
Where was you nigga I was doin this here like Mary J
Like Every Day It was true nigga
Beanie Sigel 
They cant question what we do Jigga
JayZ 
Once again its on
Young run through you niggas like a glitch in the computer nigga
Im the shit Imma sewer nigga This is Jay everyday no days off
Ferris Bueler nigga
Beanie Sigel 
B Sig Fred Kruger niggas nightmare ya medulla nigga
You scared Cause I glue with Jigga
He said Sig you that nigga couldnt see his vision
But then he drew the picture like a compository sketch
Said if Sig stay honest Ill deposit you a check
Its a secret society all we ask is trust
No GMoney shit all we gots is us  we all we got 
True indeed yes more better yes
More chedder SP chain jeans and sweaters
Movies cartoons labels etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like Tetris or
Get off the block run south with M Betha
From my block to your block shout out to MExtra
Memphis Bleek Who the fuck  fuck  want  want  what 
None of you niggas
Its B Sig prick Im done with you niggas
Beanie Siegel 
Once again its on
Fuck we aint through with niggas twin towers here to ruin niggas
You couldnt break up the towers with Tom Donivich
Or Osama bombin shit
We slay niggas with Ks we the drama men
Get it right young scrap dont even try it boy  boy 
You rather slide down a razor blade slidin board
Im a livewire hoolahoop barbwire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You cant mute me put the pause on
My gun shoot like fastfowards on
You dress cute when the wars off
What you doin dog you playin wit it
You make ya bed right you layin in it
You keep your share tight you stayin in it
You bringin niggas where ya kids sleep
I sing to niggas while the kids sleep
Rocabye mothafucka
I hope you high mothafucka
Ready to die mothafucka
Who shot ya Separate the weak from State Prop to
Kids squash beef and rep the streets
JayZ 
Once again its on nigga bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya momma bye bye get ready to mourn sista its a
See what you got here is a full blown twista
You nothin but hot air its not fair
The reason while we lead the pack this is a marathon
You start off fast then you wheezin in the back
So even if I slack I got enough leeway to put out The Reason by the Mac
Philadelphia Freeway and Im back without leavin and Im here
But you cant see him I gave you The Blueprint but you cant be him
So no matter what you been told and the records you sold
Deep inside you know that its only one Hov
Young veto voice of the young people
If my life was a movie then Sigel gon be the sequel
We bring it to ya door with Bleek peekin through ya peekhole
And dont get scared nigga alert ya people
Beanie Sigel 
Once again its on
