Bear witness to the greatest cant beat us join us
Keep heaters on us with red lasers
Now fair warning sure shots wont graze ya
We hug corners play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us serve tres like waiters
Its the life we chose to hustle
Cant stop it cant knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas try and break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you pricks try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for that aint the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the dough man
Ill off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and Im true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon eat
Im over the stove like Cuban Links
Breaking down cash money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do
Grown man nigga baby who
Ill send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No names dont claim ya shoes
Once again its on nigga Sigel hard like corn liqour
Ill take you out this world like you was born nigga
Butt naked covered in blood gasping for air
Clinging for dear life nigga you dead right
Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinkling the world with baby powder
So Fresh and So Clean
Been an outcast since I was a teen
But I outlast cuz I outblast anybody you bring
Young you got it the prophet I told yall niggas
Then I showed yall niggas you cant knock it
Dont get carried away you a mule nigga  mule nigga 
Where was you nigga I was doing this here like Mary J

This is Jay everyday no days off Ferris Bueler nigga
BSig Fred Krueger niggas
Nightmare your medulla nigga
You scared cuz I grew with Jigga
He said Sig you that nigga couldnt see his vision
But then he drew the picture like a compository sketch
Yeah Sig stay honest Ill deposit you a check
Theres a secret society all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us
True indeed yes more better yes
More cheddar SP chain jeans and sweaters
Movies cartoons labels etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like Tetris or
Get off the block run south with M Betha

Twin towers here to ruin niggas
You couldnt break up the towers with Tomjanovich
Or Osama bombin shit
We slay niggas wit Ks we the drama men
Get it right young scrap dont even try it boy  boy 
You rather slide down the razor blade slidin board
Im a live wire hula hoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You cant mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fastforwards on
And dress cute when the wars off
What you doing dawg you playing wit it
You make your bed right you laying in it
You keep your shed tight you stayin in it
You bringing niggas where your kids sleep
I sing to niggas while the kids sleep
Rockabye muthafucka

Kids who squash beef and run them streets
Once again its on nigga bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya mama bye bye get ready to mourn sister its a
See what you got heres a full blown twister
You nothing but hot air its not fair
The reason why we lead the pack this is a marathon
You start off fast then you wheezing in the back
So even if I slack I got enough leeway
To put out The Reason by the Mac Philadelphia Freeway
And Im back without leaving Im here but you cant see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you cant be him
So no matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that its only one Hov
Young Vito voice of the young people
If my life is a movie then Sigel be the sequel
We bring it to your door with Bleek peeking through your peek hole
And dont get scared nigga alert ya people
Once again its on
