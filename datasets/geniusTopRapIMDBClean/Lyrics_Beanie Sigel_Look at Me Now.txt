My head was knotty then
Nose snotty then
Sweats no pockets then
Sweatin no problems then
Fats off the potty then
News watched karate then
Muddas playin Double Dutch she was hopscotchin then
Me girl watchin them
Crooked letter I  I 
Humpback tryna hump that yes I  I 
Couldnt play with Cousin Pooh
They thought I was mockin him
Grams said I was devilish
Been knew I was rotten then
School been dropped out
Never really clockin in
Pops been dropped out
Neva really stoppin in
Moms tryna lock me out
Cops tryna lock me in
Damn devilish one with Pelletguns

And put rap to the front

Thats my ghetto holliday
I must say for myself
Im feelin proud today

I dedicate this to the ones that counted me out
And looked at me down
