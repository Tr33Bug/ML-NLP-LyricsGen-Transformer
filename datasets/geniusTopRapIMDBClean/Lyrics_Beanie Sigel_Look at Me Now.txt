Nose snotty then
Sweats no pockets then
Sweatin no problems then
Fats off the potty then
News watched karate then
Muddas playin Double Dutch she was hopscotchin then

Crooked letter I  I 
Humpback tryna hump that yes I  I 
Couldnt play with Cousin Pooh
They thought I was mockin him

Been knew I was rotten then
School been dropped out
Never really clockin in
Pops been dropped out

Moms tryna lock me out
Cops tryna lock me in
