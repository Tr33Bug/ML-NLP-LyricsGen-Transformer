This shit is not a fuckin game
Pac man yall niggas know my name
Itll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man and aint a damn thing change
Even though I got signed Imma still slang thangs
Ayo I cop power pellets  and yall call em bricks 
I make little dots  and yall chop rocks to flip 
Before junior they had me out on a chase
Running from these ghost monsters yall calling the jakes
All I do is stack loot
Run around and eat fruit
And harass these lady cops named Pinky and Sue
My whole life been a maze in a chase
Cant keep still without these monsters on my back invadin my space
I got two hitmen thatll bury you brothers
They rule the underworld
You know em as the Mario brothers
Straight cannons
And wont hesitate to shoot you
And they stay goin to war with that Latin King Koopa
I got a worker named Frogger
When I say jump he leap
A highway boy who be runnin the streets
With that package
Dodgin through traffic thats narrow
And my nigga Donkey Kong bringin weed in by the barrels
Pac man yall niggas know my name
Itll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man and aint a damn thing change
Even though I got signed Imma still slang thangs
I take over blocks section by section
Shake under cover cops and make em change direction
They best bet is to relax and chill
Sonic couldnt catch me Im good at track and field
I might run up in your spot
When Im runnin from the cops
Sling work a dime a dot
A hundred a rock
I give out cooked
Yeah but I only get raw
And I keep a nice stash in case I have a Pitfall
I got a worker named turtle that be movin my snow
He bring straight dough
He just move it too slow
I dont fuck with them crabs I had to blast those boys
I caught them breakin down my rocks like Asteroids
Met Ms Pac told she could go on a mission
But first she got to let me put in Pole Position
I wish I wouldve knew then what I now know sooner
Cause 10 towns later here come Pac Junior
Pac man yall niggas know my name
Itll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man and aint a damn thing change
Even though I got signed Imma still slang thangs
I got drugs for every race color and creed
I sling mushrooms to white boys in Club Centipede
Donkey Kong was gettin money from slinging weed
I dont know why he wanna start a pie factory
We can be partners
Thats murder us connecting
Wit the right blow
And Burger Time doing the cheffin
We can get dough
Cant let the cops catch us
And if it move slow  still stack blocks like Tetris 
Whoever dont wanna get down they stupid
Not the one to jump around these blocks like Qbert
Aint nobody out there making no noise
Wit they own route but that nigga Paperboy
We can take his stuff
He aint tough he a nut
He always letting Dig Dug pump him up
I pull a plug on em niggas if they dont wanna set it
Game over niggas Ill see you next credit
Pac man yall niggas know my name
Itll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man and aint a damn thing change
Even though I got signed Imma still slang thangs
