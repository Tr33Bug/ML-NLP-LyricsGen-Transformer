When hitin licks Im a savage
You hoes is plastic
I got a semi automatic pointed at your ass
Slowin me down gets you blasted
For your chunk Ill trunk your folks
It aint shit for mac to grip the gat and put the pump to work
Call your bluff run in your spot with a detective suit
Got you cuffed bout to show you what this tech will do
You must of thought that we was friendly when we told you we was rappers
We Jackers
We want the money
Thats what we after
We want the package
Under the god damn mattress
And if the brain splatters dont matter
Thats what we practice
Blast the rocket
Knock off your leg
Tear through your forearm
Sit you in a chair make your niggas call you short arm
Pelets in your hand Youll never put shorts on
Aint shit fair when you got to get your war on
So warriors come out and play
Make my mother fuckin day
Yall niggas cotton
Potatoes like Au Gratin

Glove and ski mask it

When Im in the crib for yoour shit and a thick plastic
I got this duct tape stuck in my pocket for one reason
You can stop screamin stop squermin or stop breathin
Cause I didnt come here to stay or play your babysitter
I came here to split your mother fuckin wig nigga
If your block gettin money nigga I want in

Snatch the bag
Bust him in his ass and dash
Un cock the mag

Yo I spit so real so my boys can eat
You got the nerve to have a deal and just noise on beats
Little suburb nigga never saw the streets
Silver spoon ass nigga never drawed your heat

Recognize hottest thing in a booth in here
The Gooch in here
Ay yo its over in here
God damn somebody bring me some juice in here
I used to be a drug dealer
Hangin in the cut sellin dime rocks
Gettin cash to eat with
Punchin a time clock
In the ghetto makin small change
Slingin till the sun up
Got to pay my phone bill focusing on the come up
Got 6 shots numbers strait
Crank bout 38
Big boys trippin on me tryin to nigga hate
This 17 year old Tony Montana type
Aint never did the killin but still Im lovin the drama right
Undercovers pass by thinkin I dont know the truth
Makin niggas these offers they know these niggas cant refuse
Fade To end
