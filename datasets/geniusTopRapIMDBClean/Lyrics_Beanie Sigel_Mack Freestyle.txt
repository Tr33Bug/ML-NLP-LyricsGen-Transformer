Beanie Mack
Rocafella yall
Check
Check
A yo two decades three years and still in order
I done stabbed sticks killed bricks drowned drops of water
Ate a million dollars
Shitted four million quarters
Stuck mothers sisters aunt nieces and daughters
Fuck Taco Bell
I run south of the border
Cop a whole pie and you working wit a quarter
Stay cased up like my man Rhyme Slaughter
Sleep in crack spots on off that water
Yall scrape up for weed money and grub
Me and my man roll in a Benz four dub
On our way to the club
Smoking weed out the jug
While most stay in court trying to plead with the judge
What
Fist and wrist stay glitered up
Don pee sip it up to I spit it up
I fuck bitches who bust checks to flood my neck
Give me rough sex
Huff wet
Bust teks
Feds eyeing like Im imported that shit
I trying to be cased up in court for that shit
I just want to breeze through sported that shit
Laughing at them Point Breeze niggas snorting that shit
Yall niggas would never finish that yall be starting
Never could back up that shit yall be talking
I make you famous
I put your face on milk cartons
Beenie Mack smoother than Jerome on Martin
I keep the silence on the three eighty loughton
Quiets the bus but cant do shit about this sparking
Thats why I get my bodies right before darken
Your dogs aint biting shit just doing a lot of barking
Your squads leaking
Fronting like yall eating
Rent a little car get dress on the weekend
That that Joe shit
You dont know me why you speaking
Cause I shut down blocks and clock like Puerto Ricans
Beenie Mack rap gorilla
Im out for the scrilla
Face it aint no replacement for this killer
