Im just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I dont control the colors
Yo Im ten steps ahead of niggas that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like Mack maintain just grind dog better yourself
So what I do I take heed and pick up the pace
Cant explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
Im like a black rose growin in the concrete crackin the pavement
There that voice go again Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements
Keep thinkin of them hot lines like a physic I cant explain it
Theres no pen when I write it its nothing like it
Goddamn what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh thought I was dumb
But I aint used to use my mind I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Quran and 48 laws they polish my flaws
Im movin niggas like puppets with no strings attached
Its nothin for Beans so you know it aint a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes see through your heart know what you fearin
Pick you apart like you niggas is transparent
I see right through you niggas 
Its like Mack was born with advanced parents
Im like the Sun shinin at night
Imagine it dog I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But Im walkin on air breakin every gravity law
Its nothin like it I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
Its nothin like it
Goddamn shit I cant explain it
Fuck yall niggas
I changed my whole life in about 9 months just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn til they doomed
Try to tell them you can burn young punk without smellin the fumes
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism displayin colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture Im paintin its so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers you cant duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
Im loadin up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise its like jihad with these mags Ima bust ya
Goddamn its nothin like it Im serious
Cant explain how I write it
