Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me
I cant understand why
Thats what they yellin when they grab me
Eyes are swellin cryin tryin to stab me
Once they realize they cant have me
When I leave em try to let em down easy like rhyme
I snatch your heart so easy like Valentine
Cant get caught up in that loop again
Never letting Cupid in
Boo you buggin aint no time to be lovin
Man the grip on my pistol only thing I be huggin
Its mack daddy not your daddy mack
Bitch you got it crisscrossed  scrap 
I aint havin that
I cant have your back
Look how you act when I had your back
Picture me havin that back to back
I pimp proper like shrimplobster
Check out my pimpposture
Even my limp proper mama
I cant help whats runnin down your face
I moved your ass into that furnished place
Like you earned that space
God damn baby you had me
All the twirlies in the caddy used to take it back gladly
We was tighter than Tommy Buns and Keesha
You cleant my guns count my ones bagged the reefer
Shit I thought you was the one  you was my bitch
The one that never snitched
Taught you how to bust a fifth shit
I taught you how to push a whip
Taught you how to suck a dick
Taught you how to fluff a brick
But you got more drama than a Bmama
Got me goin through the motions like C Thomas
With the bullshit he say she say
The bitch is mad cause my jams kick like Eastbay
Mad cause they mans got they kicks on replay
How you drop from celebrity status
Pushin Bent to niggas in celebrity wagons
In them sucka type Jags
Now you fuckin type mad
Oh mommy its so sad
We had it together
You had it whenever
Thats yo bad
You fucked up
It wasnt meant to be
You lucked up
Told me at the end dont trust her
See thats when all the bullshit started
Thats what three me in reverse counterclockwise
In my mind I swore that we would work
But I guess that I was wrong
Ran into a dead end
Unfaithful bitch
You fucked the nigga I was blazin with
Fugazied shit
It wasnt him it was the paper shit
Nowadays its all about the latest shit
That or they favoritecar
Or get paper from ball
Unless your label all that
And you labeled as stars
Makin the millions
Got them bitches willin to do
Whatever it takes
Takin it off or willin to screw
Whoever I bring
Guess its a celebrity thing
But I was never ashamed
I was blessed with the game
