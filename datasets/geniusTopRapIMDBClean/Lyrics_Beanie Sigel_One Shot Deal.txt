Yeah
One shot deal one shot one kill
Hit you with the one shot skill
Bullets lift you up like you poppin on the wheel
Feel I cant die when Im poppin on the pill
So real that it feel keep Cochran on my heels
Who rock the black and back out
Now the MAC back out just bout to blackout
Got the ROC on my back SP on my chain
Shooters on the block slinging Peedi last name
Outta hot pink thangs like Camron Range
The cocaine cowboy at work
I put ya niggas in the dirt for one like Dirt
Concealed hammer wont jam or wont chirp
Catch you on my set get murked
Fresh outta jail ice grill gat to smirk
Bitches on the waves cant surf
ROC without Jay wont work Shit like we aint here
Actin like SP aint here
How yall niggas cant see that clear Clear
Yeah slow all the way down young scrapper
Pump ya brakes real fast before ya crash
Crack ya head on the dash
I put ya body in a cast keep my shotty on blast
Hard heads dont get the picture until they see the flash
You aint ballin you pump faking
Till you found in ya trunk naked
Four pound to ya crown like Where the paper
B Sig cold crook I trap paper like notebook
When the hot water disappear like when coke cook then resurface
Its Sig Berkowitz bitch Im sick
Eat that ass like Dahmer
Sig heat that ass like sauna
Stretch ya body out like recliner
Stretch my middle finger to your honor
Like Fuck the world thats my persona love drama
Drop a building like Osama you vagina
I know you wish you never met me like Carl Thomas
Try to forget me like Alzheimers
Fuckin with a vet be all problems
Im not about the threats B Im all promise
Before The Truth the position in the booth
As a young scrap I was vicious as a youth
Kept a gat moving pigeons in the Coupe
You was strapped then positioned on the stoop
Stay strapped put my pistol on shoot
Mac take ya Juice like Bishop on the roof
I had ya pissing in ya trunk like Carruth
Bullets hit ya chest like a blunt rolled loose
Im that corn liquor nigga 100 proof
I bring the storm all you niggas lace ya boots
Better yet pull out ya strings make a noose
Hang yaself heres a deuce deuce bang yaself like Cheddar Bob
Im in the hood like STtall catCrooked LetterI
SPCO nigga yes I
Yes I
Matta fact
Yeah Yeah
Bring it back
Bring it back me Doc Americas blunted
Not from there but Im Philly Most Wanted
Drop and roll when my biscuit boil
Talk is greasy toungue with Crisco oil
Streets is mine check my flow online
At wwcutaniggacom
Bricks two on the hip reach for the sky
You and ya Burberry suit is buried alive
On top of the Empire dare me to dive
Weeeeeee  There I go no parachute
Jackass like Knoxville hot as Cancun
Chest hairs is baboon Redman rip the show
I be the raw in ya bitches nose
She be goin to the bathroom sniffing blow
Like Funk Doc the shit my man a joke
I know I be strapped with a double 44
And a Slim Jim to open ya Cadillac door
In the Bricks you hear them guns  RatatatBOOM 
Any nigga get Xed out like TicTacToe
Any bitch that know Redman goin the distance
We aint tryin to get fucked for instance
When you bust baby gon light the insence
Pass me the rag hop back in the Jag
I stole out the showroom with the pricetag
I wrote this rhyme off 25 blunt drags
Hear that sound leave a block hunchback
Gilla House understand prick
We aint gon stop till we RICH BITCH
Holla back Redman Beanie Sigel
Gilla House
