I roll a bat crack a dutch have a sizzip
Get introduced to this drink that I sizzip
Promethazine with codeine thats my twizzist
It might lean me to the left or make me izzitch
ProMeth with the Tuss some like the mizzix
Cording to they fixes and how they wanna dizzip
But be careful it aint your ordinary liquid
First time you sip it you might get addicted
Matter fact I know you gon get addicted
Cause its so sweet like licorice plus its good for your sickness
I used to watch my uncle sip it
Going through his act in my grandmothers kitchen
Head in his lap grandma bitchin
Pocket full of scratch plus scratchin and itchin
Back when they sip Broma and smoked cheeba
Took Doors and Fours and chewed ceebas
This one is for my real mudmixers
Who get screwed up my thick juice sippers
Shout out to my man Lil Flip
Big Mo Project Pat and the whole 36
Yea I know about them Texas boys
Who keep a liter in the cup and a heater in the tuck
Think a Xanax and indo sack make me slack
Cocktailed or Ved up get swisscheesed up
Please dont blow my high  blow my high 
When Im sippin that purple rain
Said dont blow my high blow my high
When Im sippin that purple rain
I know it may sound crazy keeps me lazy
Way back in 94 Screw still had his gate up
He called over to his house and he poured me an 8 up
I asked him what it was he said Bun get your weight up
This is lean them white folks call it promethazine
Shit but we gon call it drink dog cause thats what we be doin to it
Now take this Big Red and pour about a 2 into it
I said 2s and 8s that the fuck is you trippin on
He said man thats an ounce of the cough syrup that you sippin on
So shit I poured it I sipped it then I tipped some mo
I fired up a green monster and I hit that ho
Started relaxin shit and to my surprise
I was noddin off looking at the back of my eyes
They tried to wake me up but shit I just kept yawnin
I fell out in my chair and woke up there the next mornin
God Bless my nigga cause since then I been spoiled
On my white mud a cup of Texas Tea that Oil

   Bun B 
I roll a bat crack a dutch have a sizzip
Get introduced to this leaf in my splizzif
No stem no seeds no stizzicks
The ultimate experience like Jimi Hendrix
I like to roll up cowboy tradition
Or burn a peace pipe and cyphe like the Injuns
Or burn a big spliff Bob Marley Style
Buffalo Soldier Rastafari style
We smokes on pizurp  we sips on syzurp 
Get it by the 8 by the pint  or by the Quzart 
Some might take a Vic or a Zan or a pizzurk
Whatever you can stand floats your boat  make ya twizurp 
Yes I fucks wit ya if you smoke on green  or sip on lean 
Yea whatever clique or team  strip or scene 
Nigga burn your spliff one time
Say Beans swing your big body Benz and Ill swing mine
