Put Ya Hands Up  Jadakiss Diss  Lyrics
The empire strikes back mother fuckers
Lenny S
DJ Envy holla at ya boy
Bang bang Sigel street gang
Early
Ayo they coming at my head HOV
My blood pressure is building
The headphones is on fire this time around Bleek
About to squeeze the juice out of this nigga
Yo
Fuck the speculation talk over
Nigga dig this Im bout to sun kiss like the soda
And make Jay to the mwah
Put his lips on his nine and really kiss the game goodbye
You bout to really make me hurt you kiss
Spitting candy bars this nigga sweeter than a Hersheys kiss
Got the heat Im bout to work the fifth
Resin off that purple shit
The reverend got to get a hearse for kiss
You broke
Talkin bout you rocked ya self out
When I see you gon really wish you knocked ya self out
Want it with Sig need the whole Lox to help out
Its just me I dont need the Roc to help out
I could tell why Styles say he the ghost of this shit
I could tell in ya style he write most of ya shit
Ya name mwah nigga most of you bitch
Got me pissed
Cant put ya dick in your dirt
But you pussy so ima fuck you when Im lifting ya skirt
We could spit it or gun it out
Four fifth or M1 it out
Tell me nigga how you wanna route
You still living in the basement of ya mother house
I tried to have a little patience but its running out
Probably need blood in ya mouth
Knock ya brains out
Let the doc remind you what a thug is about
And Im talking to Jada
And any yall muhfuckin haters who like him wanna put down paper
Tell em meet me at any arena
Bring his nina
Ill spark him up starch him leave him stiff like the cleaners
Niggas got hidden agendas
We got gats hidden in engines
A pocket in the coupe for the pigeons
Let the SK rifle ya chest
Give ya long mwah goodnight and aint no life after death
Ayo P probably handle this nigga
Ill rock ya bells like L I aint Canibus Nigga
Yeah recess over for you playground niggas
Wouldnt shoot up a ladder slide down a board
Fuck ya monkey ass bars when Im swinging this four
Cant duck when I land shots
Get buried in a sandbox
Sharks in the water cant swim in the pool
No snacks after school and my stomach is full
Gotta bring it to him hard as shit
Ill kick his ball over the fence to let the nigga know who yard is this
Whats funny Jason really think you grimey too
And everybody likes you better in that shiny suite
So no matter where you go ima spot you
Double R tee and a baldy ima pop you
My pump make you lift up
Tech make you do a 360
Got gats that the government got
Muhfucka is you thuggin or not
Empire strikes back 
Na fuck it I dont wanna stop
My gun will pop his afella tell me who you wanna rock
And I could show you how grimey dun
I cuff ya ass
Strip ya ass
Whip ya ass
Till ya mommy come
I got the mask and the techs and the tommy guns
Leave it up to Hov to X out Tommy Bunds
We could bet what you owe Puff and double ya debt
Double that quadruple the threat
Now look what you made me do brains blew
My team of the marine blue six coupe
Skeeted out
Heated out
Weeded out
Haze and hydro
On our way to YO
And that tinted shit rented shit
Extended shit
You cheesecake niggas My dogs get they spinach dipped
In angel dust
Come through and tame ya pups
Think its a game till ya brains get touched
Yeah nigga lets clash the crews
Attitude like Noah gats in twos
I got a hundred niggas hundred Ks
Rain on you for a hundred nights hundred days
Fuck a million man march
Let a million men spark
Got a million men with heart
Yeah nigga fuck the peace
Muhfucka cant duck the beast
What made this stupid ass nigga wanna fuck with Sig
Cmon dog this another verse
I know that funeral home got a stash reverend got another hearse
Whoa
