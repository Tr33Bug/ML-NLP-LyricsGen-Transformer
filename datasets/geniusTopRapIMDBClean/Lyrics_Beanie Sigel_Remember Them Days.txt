Yeah uh its all good now
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Its all good now
We out the hood now
We out the hood now
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Its all good now NU
Who thought wed see the day when wed kick our feet up
Lay back exhale put the heat up
No stress no scale no jail could keep us
Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord that life aint easy
The only ones moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies who live in autos its crazy
Keep it in the dark Imma speak it from the heart
Remember dem days
Livin all days in doubt
Remember dem days
Thinking theres no way out
Remember dem days
Not knowing which way to route
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Remember dem days
All of us under the covers
Remember dem days
Heating up the house with the oven
Remember dem days
Thinking that life aint love us come on
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Remember kids who run the block
You never thought they would get harmed
Only time our block got wet was when the sprinklers were on
Think about that time dawg that wasnt long
Now that we got kids think when we was born
Coming up in my hood was hard
Every day my mom cooked with lard
Fucked up I couldnt feed myself
Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I cant believe myself
Thats not a joke
Man I was dealt these cards and I played dem out
Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbors house
To get lights fuck Max on the latest routes
Used to close my eyes try to fade it out
Dumb niggas in the hood think I made it out
Man that showed me just where they mental at
And tell me half of these cats aint been through jack
Remember dem days
Livin all days in doubt
Remember dem days
Thinking theres no way out
Remember dem days
Not knowing which way to route
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Remember dem days
All the bluffs under the covers
Remember dem days
Heating up the house with the oven
Remember dem days
Thinking that life aint love us come on
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Yo every day I think Deke and Rola
From introducing me to Dame and Hovah
Ever since that day I met Jay
Man I knew my pain was over
They let me in this game its over
Mom I know I put you through hell
But now Im gonna order you heaven
No more temporary layoffs like Florida Evans
Aint no good times about dat there
Your boy rhyme now its fine now
We out dat there
Fuck that Access card
Imma work extra hard
To turn that into a platinum express car
You can have sweet dreams at night
Your boy aint out there with dem toys and them fiends at night
All dem cracks and the gats left that life alone
Its the tracks and the raps and the microphone
Wish yall would fuck that up now
Shit its all good now
We out the hood now
Remember dem days
Livin all days in doubt
Remember dem days
Thinking theres no way out
Remember dem days
Not knowing which way to route
Its all good now
We out the hood now
Remember dem days
All the bluffs under the covers
Remember dem days
Heating up the house with the oven
Remember dem days
Thinking that life aint love us come on
Its all good now
We out the hood now
