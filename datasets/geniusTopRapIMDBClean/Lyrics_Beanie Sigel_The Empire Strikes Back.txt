The empire strikes back mother fuckers

My blood pressure is building
The headphones is on fire this time around Bleek
About to squeeze the juice out of this nigga
Yo

Nigga dig this Im bout to Sunkist like the soda
And make Jay to the mwah
Put his lips on his nine and really kiss the game goodbye
You bout to really make me hurt you kiss
Spitting candy bars this nigga sweeter than a Hersheys kiss
Got the heat Im bout to work the fifth
Resin off that purple shit
The reverend got to get a hearse for kiss
You broke
Talkin bout you rocked ya self out
When I see you gon really wish you knocked ya self out
Want it with Sig Need the whole Lox to help out

Ayo peep how I handle this nigga
Ill rock your bells like L I aint Canibus nigga
Yeah recess over for you playground niggas
Wouldnt shoot up a ladder slide down a bar
Fuck ya monkey ass bars when Im swinging this four
Cant duck when I land shots
Get buried in a sandbox
Sharks in the water cant swim in the pool
No snacks after school and my stomach is full
Gotta bring it to him hard as shit
Ill kick his ball over the fence to let the nigga know
Who yard is this
Whats funny Jason really think you grimey too
And everybody likes you better in that shiny suite
So no matter where you go Ima spot you
Double R tee and a baldie Ima pop you
