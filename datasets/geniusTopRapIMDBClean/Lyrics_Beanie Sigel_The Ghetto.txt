Darkness falls when the cold air hits the ghetto streets
Many are called by few are chosen
Whos to say that when life will deal you the deck of cards
Will you have on your poker face
The hood is desolate
Block dark as its ever been
Young and strong off rock and tying the heroin
And when they fix aint around larceny settles in
Thats when the ground opens up and coffins shuffled in
Aint nobody getting money
They just getting by
Trying to suppress their poverty by getting high
Some search the bottle for what they cant find in God
An empty stomach and a gun equals homicide
Some take the day in stride praying that the night will change
Grandma searching for the answers in her Bible page
Aint nothing worse on a ears than a crying mother
Seeing her baby dying stretched in a ghetto gutter
Murders ruled out they say its self suicide
Smoking dicks drying to drift to the other side
They say hes in a better place where hell feel no pain
Youll soon know the truth when they dig your grave
Out my window I see poverty  out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this Ghetto  just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo
This fucking recession got everybody stuck broke
This shit depressing everybody cutthroat
If you aint spending 45 large on the whole joint
Youre forced to buy 9 hard compressed from a small point
The hood dreary
Neighbours look weary
At the young bucks who just pop pills or smoke airy
Shits scary
To niggas with one package on one corner going to war with one ratchet
The young bucks catch cases
Ramming on their afters
Burn the connect
Let their man jam them for the package
Hustling backwards
All they want is sneaker money
A Breitling and a Grand Marquise
A fresh pair of trees and some Vneck Ts
they done with a gun and squeeze
Til the cops box them in
Caught him with a Glock and ten
Now they on state roll cold locking in
Calling home every chance he get
Talking shit
Making when I get home threats
The block moves on
Young buck the street dont stop
Niggas selling whipped up rock
The fiends wont cop
Try to switch they hustle to weed the tree wont pop
Theres just more of it this shit dont end
I seen niggas lose they life playing dice and skin
Theyll get the same money over
Lose it twice again
Theres a war going on outside nobodys safe from
You either make a way or take one
Yeah I just know what I know
The ghetto
Out my window I see poverty  out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this ghetto  just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo
Out my window I see poverty  out my window 
Youth is dying feels like death just follows me
I see poverty
Most folks chase a high to escape reality in this ghetto  just follows me 
In this ghetto oooh whoooa
Whooo
