I speak the truth
Truth nothin but the truth
Yall know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth nothing but the truth
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know Im known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down tracks DATs reels and slaves
Hit the studio jars of dro bars to blow
B Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that dont hold me back
I roll with crack yall cats tote Macs to rap
Yall dont realize yall released the beast untamed
Speech all flame streets yall blame
It should be an honor for yall to speak my name
I could go before ya honor he couldnt peep my game
Gotta laugh dont act like we spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers cant get in the game
I come from high school and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig
Nigga the truth every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth yall know what Im bringing to you
I bring the truth you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth
Aint nuthin changed with Sig Im still stuck in the kitchen
So what Im signed Thats fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well couple court cases from jail
Couple 44 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission go home my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker wont you change your life Im thinkin
Motherfucker wont I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
Its just another hustle another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they see my face on screens and I aint even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Yall niggas cant stop the BOL whether rock or raw
Im slingin coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block Im on Glock in palm
You wanna get shot karate chopped or stabbed its on
Motherfucker
Nigga the truth every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth yall know what Im bringing to you
I bring the truth you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth
Black Friday management and Rocs the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots thats fatal
That bullshit vest cant save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
Im that nigga thatll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what Ive seen look where Ive looked
Touch what Ive reached and take what Ive took
You gotta go where Ive gone walked where Ive walked
To get where Im at to speak what Ive talked
You gotta lay where Ive laid stay where Ive stayed
Play where Ive played to make what Ive made
You gotta move what Ive moved use what I used
Use tools how I use use fools how I use
Nigga the truth every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth yall know what Im bringing to you
I bring the truth you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth
