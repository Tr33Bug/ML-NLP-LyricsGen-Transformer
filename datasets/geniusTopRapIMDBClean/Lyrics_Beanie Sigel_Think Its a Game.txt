Drove customers crazy in the late 80s early 90s
Now you can find me girlie behind me holdin my mink up
Ice pinkie ring in the air drinkin my drink up

Makes me a mathematician about my math
Get celebrity ass Im a statistician rap with precision

Mouthpiece for hustlers ventriloquist for jugglers

Purpose of man worship Allah then you die
Purpose of my gun run in your shop and take pies
Purpose of my son raise him to do the same

Where your connects gotta meet interrupt your cop
Dependin on the dope size we slide up from both sides
With hammers with hollows you peel we follow with both rides and
They killed your cousin you strapped and you wont ride and
Dont think cause I rap that I wont ride man
