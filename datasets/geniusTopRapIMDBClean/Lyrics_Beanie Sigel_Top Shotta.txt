200 Fanta in a styrofoam
30shot banana in my firearm
Death to any nigga that I slide up on
Supply ya mama with the casket she put flowers on
The Don Dada the rude boy the top shotta
Ya ras clot ya batty boy go suck ya fadda
Im bad boy I warn boy like Big Poppa
I squeeze choppa release copper ya bleed proper
Yeah empty out the clip till the Baretta lock
Circle the block scope see if he dead or not
7shot 38 the leadll pop
Squat squeeze with one eye open like Fetty Wap
And I dont really wanna expose you Im tryna be humble
But deers belong in the woods and not in the jungle
And you aint never in the hood scared them niggas will trunk you
Got niggas in your circle now thats waiting to slump you
Right back on that ass I aint finish nigga
I will drag your ass till you surrender nigga
You sweet nigga you fake nigga you Splenda nigga
Pussy you aint tough nigga you tender nigga
I injure niggas beginner niggas I been the nigga
Bitch I kill your vibe shout out to Kendrick nigga
I watched the LOX and I listened nigga
Couldve been the fourth member but I went with Jigga
Send your niggas Im with whatever lets get it nigga
I slide down your chimney like its December nigga
Pop off on sight shoot up your Sprinter nigga
And you aint bout that life so stop pretending nigga
And I can give two shits if Im offending niggas
Bitch if that shoe fits thats who its meant for nigga
I put the city on the map facts
Who the fuck wanna claim king now Bully back
