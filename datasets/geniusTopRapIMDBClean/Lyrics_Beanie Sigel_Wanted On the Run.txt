Wanted  On the Run  LyricsRunning Breathing
Wanted 100 miles and runnin
Through the rain and the sun when them fed folks comin
Keep your head up youngin gotta keep ya heads up youngin
The streetsll give your head up youngin
Listen clip your contacts stay focused like contacts
Your heads open for a contract
Cant go where mom at the last place you wanna bring the dram at
The first place they gonna track I promise
Cant relax but remain the calmest
Couple rules that your play by stay by stay live
You keep your boots on your laces tight
And only troop on the late night if you play right you stay right right
You never play the day light jakes get on your tail
Never let them see the break lights
Catch me if you can when Im dippin from the cops
Mr Gingerbread never falling victim of the fox
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive  2x 
Wanted but you cant stop runnin
With a price on your head be prepared to gunnin
Dont be scared like the Red Coats comin nigga
Stay underground and keep runnin like Tubman
You cant sleep not a peep no slumber
Man I sleeped about a 100 hours rest this summer
No stress when your dealin with the run in
Waking up in cold sweats pissed scared of the rumblin
Fuck it just prepare for the trouble
Dont be shit scared nigga with your head undercovers
This not a broad threat I got something for em
On the steps with two tecs this is not a warnin
Nigga they close like camera flash
When the hammer blast put on your State Prop camouflage
Crack the box or the avalanche put on your Montana mask
Get to clappin like its Pakistan
What every strap cause an accident
Make a traffic jam dodge all the traps you can keep runnin
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive  2x 
All you got to say is hide me I ride free
I be the one to change your birth SS or ID  I got all that 
Aint no more hangin with the YG State Prop
No Roc private doc case you need an IV
No more Bent thats Accord money 420
Schemes cant afford money money yous award money
Whether 90 or the first degree any murder in the first degree
Well be the third degree and they looking for the perjury
If you aint murk the G perfectly youll be in surgery
Take the seed out the nursery nurse him at the precinct
Give em dessert that aint where he deserve to be
And I went through this personally certainly
32 for burglary now it was referred to me
So they play us in no way know way
Blaze up the roadways AC and OJ
Read the paper eggs and OJ
Call CD the head of the OJays
Thats a gipsy caps risky all the chips we had
45 fleeflicker we niggas hit the gas
When the operation go stale aint no jail
I did my whole album on bail  Thats the truth 
I got you Mac Mittens I send them a black ribbon
Attached to Mac spittin I cant go back prison
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive  2x
