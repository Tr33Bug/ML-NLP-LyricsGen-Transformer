As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be was a gangster
Watch your bitches 
Hey yo I walks like a pimp talks like a mack
Spit lobster and shrimp you could tell by the hat
Gators and flavors colors like now  laters
Split champagne wishes to bitches trips to Vegas
Jot down numbers on small pieces of paper

Breaks down doe over a hoe
Spend my chips over a trick
