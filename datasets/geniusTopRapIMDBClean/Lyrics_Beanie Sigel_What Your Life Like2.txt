What Your Life Like 2 Lyrics
Cmon lets try this Guru
When I was five years old I realized it was a road
But at the end I aint seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block the box the hole
Six hundred fenced in  some innocent some rotten souls
Some men with men  stop it whoa
I aint runnin up in shit but a broad or a bank
Tryin to cop a small hammer move out like Shawshank
With Redemptions I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
Im movin out like Adebisi on Oz
With my skully on tilt two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard everyday I think of pokin the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin me in
Tryin to crack a nigga turnin me thin
Food soakin in lard news fools get opened in cards
For deputy drapes in this prison life what you livin like
Can you tell me what you live like
Can you tell me what that bed like whats that cell like
Whats livin in hell like Tell me do you eat right
Do you even sleep right
Yo tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights tell me what that life like
Gettin no kites like no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life
Them four letters is a motherfucker
Thats forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker
It aint even bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers some socks some kicks from a motherfucker
I cant believe Im doin this bid for you motherfuckers
Im down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand and Ima play it with my poker face
On the block ready to POKE a face
I got an L goin around with a smokin case
You steal the deodorant out of CVS you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three deep breaths
Dangerous duct tape daughters
I take to the street like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order I fluff caine with water
Can you tell me what you live like
Can you tell me what that bed like whats that cell like
Whats livin in hell like Tell me do you eat right
Do you even sleep right
Yo tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights tell me what that life like
Gettin no kites like no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life
Thats fucked up you bout to take your longest trip
And cant do shit but suck it up be strong and shit
Handcuffed ankle to wrist in back of the bus
Flashbacks of you back in the world
Cant fuck now you thinkin bout who in back of your girl
Got her ass up  kill this bitch  playin your crib
Thinkin bout who raisin your kids
Shit was all good a week ago fore they came and raided your crib
630 in the mornin they kick your door in
Feds pour in snatch you out your bed while you snorin
You unaware of whats goin on and
Come to find out clients you had for years turned informant
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin him keys to your crib was your next mistake
At that dinner table breakin out that extra plate
You cant turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time you worryin about what you facin
Heart racin situation gettin scary
Old clients are showin up at the preliminary
DA tryin to bury a nigga to Neveruary 31st
Goddamn that gotta hurt
