Obey the rules when my Glock unloads
Cause when I start firin stop drop and roll
Duck behind cars hide behind poles
Know I live by the code anything goes
Real thugs stand up straight they never fold
And they dont know shit if anything ever blows
Thugs dont wanna talk shit out they wanna spark shit out
Until the cops come and chalk shit out
Blaze with the toaster extra clip in the leg holster
Face off like Cage and Travolta  Yeah 
If you got beef a thug gon roast ya
Talk behind your back a thug gon approach ya
Ride on mamas stacks a thug gon ghost ya
Lay you out flat like a thug suppose to
