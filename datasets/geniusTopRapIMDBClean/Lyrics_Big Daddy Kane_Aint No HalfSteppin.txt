Mmm mmm mmm
Aw yeah Im with this
Im just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat you know
And drop some smooth lyrics cause its 88
Time to set it straight know what Im sayin
And aint no halfsteppin
Word Im ready
Rappers steppin to me they want to get some
But Im the Kane so yo you know the outcome
Another victory they cant get with me
So pick a BC date cause youre history
Im the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me its gonna take a miracle
And steppin to me  yo thats the wrong move
So what you on Hobbs dope or dog food
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to bein dope hot damn
I got it good now let me tell you who I am
The BIG DAdoubleDY KANE
Dramatic Asiatic not like many
Im different so dont compare me to another
Cause they cant hang word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers you better be
Ready to die because youre petty
Youre just a butter knife Im a machete
Thats made by Ginsu wait until when you
Try to front so I can chop into
Your body just because you tried to be basin
Friday the 13th Ima play Jason
No type of joke gag game puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy yes Big not little
So define it heres your walkin papers sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk cause 
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin
To sound like me so soon Ill have to open
A school of emceein for those who wanna be in
My field and court then again on second thought
To have MCs comin out soundin so similar
Its quite confusin for you to remember the
Originator and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator but Im much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest
Should fess dont mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister some say sinister
Nonstoppin the groove until when its
The climax and I max relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin ill
Brain cells are lit ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit makin it legit
And when my pen hits the paper aw shit
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and Ill still have strength
And no thats not a myth and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab Ill only ignore
Be sleepin on your rhymes til I start to snore
You cant awake me or even make me
Fear you son cause you cant do me none
So think about it if youre tryna go
When you wanna step to me I think you should know that
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare put him in the rear
Back there where he cant see clear
Get a beer idea or near stare yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin to step to me must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where Ima get you at
You think Im losin Pfft picture that
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Aint no halfsteppin
Im the Big Daddy Kane
Mister Cee step to me
The name is Big Daddy you know as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme believe that Im the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say Damn that rappers great
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera et cetera it aint easy bein me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now thats dictation proceedin to my innovation
Not like the other MCs that are an imitation
Or an animation a cartoon to me
But when Im finished Im sure that you are soon to see
Reality my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face dare you to base
And if you try and come get it yo Ima show you whos with it
So if you know like I know instead of messin around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break or someone else will take your title
Namely me because Im homicidal
That means murder yes Im out to hurt a
nother MC that try to get with me
Ill just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign
Assalamu alaykum
