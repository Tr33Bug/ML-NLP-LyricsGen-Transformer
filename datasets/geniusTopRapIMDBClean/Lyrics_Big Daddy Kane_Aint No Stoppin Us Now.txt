Here we go here we go on the smooth side
Lets take a ride in stride and Im the guide
With the source and of course
I dont wanna be the king or boss I just wanna get my point across
Cause its time to organize and open your eyes
Realize we on the rise
To the climax time to take charge
Whoever said we cant live large
To seek out fortune without distortion
And stop livin for just a small portion
There is a move to make we gotta take a chance to break
All chains become awake
Cause this is the new way to be proud and brave
And I aint goin out like a slave
In eightynine Im livin like a champ
Step out my face talkin bout a food stamp
Child please put it at ease
Freeze its time to get paid in times like these
We cant take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the Kane and go for yours because
There comes a time where we cant be in the rear
We gotta step up front to get our share
Make the change cause were not inferior
For example there was a black Ms America
Lets start to do for ourself
We cant depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else youre gonna find
That if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemima
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
To stay alive thats the reason Ive
Came to motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Are now in effect and we cant take shorts because
Swing on that right there pump it up here we go
Uhhuh uhhuh pump it up here we go
One more thing
Lets unite together we cant sever never
No matter what or whatever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I see equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand whats grand
I know we can if we just understand
The true way of livin that was really meant for us
So one more time kick the chorus
Ah keep it goin yall
A Prince Paul rulin em all yall
A Prince Paul schoolin em all yall
And Tony Tony Tony Tony
And Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone
Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone
And you dont stop and you dont stop
And you dont stop and you dont stop
