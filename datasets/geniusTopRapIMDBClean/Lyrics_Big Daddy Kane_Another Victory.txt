Here comes the conquering brother that varies and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces  Uh 
That are left behind as youre left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Grippin on a microphone recitin a poem
Givin competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up  Hmm  none kept up  Mmm 
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
Im not about frontin I tell the real deal of society  What 
So how we livin
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Givens
Not to offend I just want you to comprehend
Every message I send  Tell em 
Cause I dont understand I have to wonder damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother get paid undercover
Sellin drugs to one another
Cause all the glamour you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um um lets say um poison
Destruction to all your own boys and
Girls who like to buy and give it a try admire
They cant deny the high thats why they soon die
These are games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay
No sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of

When Im cruisin in my Volvo cops harass me
They never ride past me they hound me like Lassie
Wantin to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh I got a place for them to stick it  Kick it 
They cant understand to see a black man
Drivin a car that costs twentyfive grand
The first thing they say is Whered you steal her
And then they assume that Im a drug dealer
Huh that just makes me wanna laugh
Cause no Im a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin me
My name aint Keith so could you please stop sweatin me
So I can flow on and go on so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin the summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly so here cometh
The royal majesty others have to be
Fully prepared though they still wont last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
Ill show the meaning of power and just cancel  Period 
Out of order conquer and slaughter
Youre comin up shorter boy youll need more to
Compete cause the heat is deep in concrete
To beat bring a complete fleet when we meet
Or stay away put new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when youre ready for business
Cause aw yeah Im with this  Im ready 
Yo Mister Cee what is this

MCs and enemies I freeze at thirtytwo degrees
Because they dont drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day I heard a brother say
Taxi cabs dont even come my way
They all be afraid they wont get paid
So they zoom right past to pick up a lighter shade
And if they stop the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money upfront
Treatin me like Im some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they dont wanna get mugged
Whos in the right or wrong Its time to unite along
And righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like  Kid n Play 
Hey even my man LL Cool J
Stetsasonic  and EPMD
Public Enemy and  BDP 
SaltNPepa cause we cant sever never
Whether whatever we better stand together
That means unite not fightin or fussin or cussin
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin
One another cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin for
