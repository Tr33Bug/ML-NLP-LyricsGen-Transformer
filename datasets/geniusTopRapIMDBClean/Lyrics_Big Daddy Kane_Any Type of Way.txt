Uh Yeah
Ayo Prem man
I be hollering at these cats man you know
Trying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know
This how serious it is on these streets
Yo check it uh
Survival of the Fittest today thats still the test
I seen em kill the best in this ghetto wilderness
Its real in the field cause they bring the drama hard
Guliani got New York looking like its Amistad
Be whatevers clever with the thought of slipping
Thugs start to flipping black women resort to stripping
When they say the drug games dead thats not a fable
Hustlers is locked down or either got a label
Either try to keep the heat on ya on the street corner
Ya sleep a week later your peeps mourn ya
Stick up kids putting in working in Ps
Your food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese
Aint no devourance I speak it now in defense
Im only here to make dollar outta knowledge power sense
So be about the paper till your pockets are full
Please stop with the bull less is profitable come on
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Take it back to the days of
Do or Die
Straight from Bedstuy
Know what Im sayin
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Put these rappers under pressure till they break
Yall know who this is
You know
If you in this for the cheddar you better get it fast
Cause in another minute aint gon be no middle class
What you think this shit will last time to Monopolize
Streets got lots of guys and I know we got the size
What I prophesize is the way to start the rise
Cross the Ts dot the Is and we will not demise
I come through the door four fours to get at yours
The Eye of the Tiger no Im coming with the claws
Its my chance to get the finance so why dance
With proper guidance to take it to the next high stance
Im tryin to live incredible get dat revenue
Thinking ahead of you thats your girl let her through
What you better do is try to chase the paper
Society will rape ya when you fight forces of nature
I been walked that path before so I do feel you
The early bird will get the worm and drink it with Tequila
Ya heard
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Take it back to the days of
Do or Die
Straight from Bedstuy
Know what Im sayin
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Put these rappers under pressure till they break
Yall know who this is
You know
Ive been sitting outside building with this OG
Never will I forget the jewels that he told me
He said when you holding never show your wins
In this ghetto your friends flip on you like Dobermans
Dat buldge in your pocket I see you better hide
While you at it tuck that medallion inside
Forget the microphone you need the iron we squeeze
So you can clap four like Siamese seals
Distrust and greed this was indeed
Given by the mans and know we living by the land
And life I tackle with my soul trapped inside this Tabernacle
The only thing thats missing is the shackles
Do what we gotta to enterprise with the dollar
Create a different aura for the children of tommorow
Therefore I kick styles to make my cash
Come to me in big piles then Im out like 6 fouls
Ya heard
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Take it back to the days of
Do or Die
Straight from Bedstuy
Know what Im sayin
Making moves any type of way
Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb
Put these rappers under pressure till they break
Yall know who this is
You know
