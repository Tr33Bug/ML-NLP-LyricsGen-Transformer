Brooklyn StyleLaid Out LyricsChorus Big Daddy Kane
Come on yall and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Brooklyn style laid out like this
Chorus
I kicks the flavor good to represent the neighborhood
Where I come from and thats the place of Brooklyn
Where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs two to the head
Well is it Brownsville Time to represent for the map
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 112 the double3 ill zip code
Parlayin on the corner drinkin 40s shootin ceelo
Its a Brooklyn thing aight You know our steelo
And for those who just dont know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know
So yo who wanna set it You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldnt test me
I represent for the fo main
And if youre not a booty bandit then niggas cant hang
Chorus
Now lets get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint baby pah where were takin it to
Makin a few dollars dont mean you gotta forget
Where you come from and try to be someone that youre really not
And front with what you got
Youre gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon heh
Im really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
In the PJs all your life in a broken home
Scoob Well alright now 
Up in the PJs all your life keepin it strong WHAT
I be the Louis Ave livin live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
In ways you cant imagine rap bein accepted
Funkll slam like a doper jam pops
Im takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
Like water in the Nile but its Brooklyn style
Chorus
Yo this is Big Scoob no practice
Im flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress
You know my style Baby Pah from the PJs
My lyrics so dope they too fat for local DJs
So hear me out no doubt no need for screamin
My boys in the back clockin your jewels and they scheamin
Why did they step to me I hit em bow budow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief Im rollin mad deep
So pick up your teeth I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin to scare you I just wanna aware you
I bet you wont even look at my face  WHAT WHAT WHAT  I dare you
Yo nigga please yo Im nice with these
While youre guardin your grill Ill be beatin up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9s
With my joint cocked back in case a punk tried to take mines
Where Im from theres no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze now wheres the doctor for this patient
Hes drippin blood and now hes down to his last breath
But he wont make it cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill type of Brooklyn artist
Who rocks the hardest regardless
Who you know and where youre from I pull your file
How  Brooklyn style
Chorus
