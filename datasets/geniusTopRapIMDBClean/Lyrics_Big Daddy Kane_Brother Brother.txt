Mmmhmm right right
What we have here is a collaboration
Of the Big Daddy Kane and the Little Daddy Shane
Were gonna send this out to all the brothers
And sisters around the universe
Its a tune a tune about unity
And peace amongst each other
And were gonna have some fun peep this

The Little Daddy Shane for the world to see
Rikki Tembo no Sa Rembo
Italian men call their girls a bimbo
Puerto Rican men call their girls muchacha
Ask me how I know cause Im a girl watcher
Now I must admit that Im a sensitive guy
Cause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died
But then again at times I may be a mean fellow
Cause I didnt give a damn about the dog Old Yeller
But I love my brother  and I love him back 
I wish people of the world could be like that
So shake shake yall  shake yall  shake yall  shake yall 
AND BUST THE MOVE WE MAKE YALL
Brother brother help each other 
Im not Don Pardo or Guy Lombardo
I Love Lucy but Im not Ricky Ricardo
Im just a teen titan that does some mean fightin
Against any sucker MC thats seen bitin


I been through Different Worlds gave them all a try
Kadeem is my man but Jasmines not my Guy
I wonder if the Kane ever Dawns on Lewis
Its a Sin to be Bad but somebodys gotta do it
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust  uhhuh 
I can make a nun feel the need for lust  true 
I can make a new car start to rust  uhhuh 
And outrun the dog on the Greyhound bus
For an MC to try to battle me freestylin
His mind must be somewhere in Fantasy Island
But I guarantee that by the time Im through
I make him feel about the size of the midget Tattoo
Cause I love my brother  and I love him back 
And more people of the world should be like that
So swing swing yall  swing yall  swing yall  swing yall 
CHECK OUT HOW WE DO OUR THING YALL
Brother brother help each other 
Rhymes that I write generate much juice
Not like Dr Seuss or even Mother Goose
They said I was a child but then I hit em hard
Yeah its good to send a boy to do a mans job
Well Im the Biggest Daddy of the macks and dons
I keep a fleet of women probably one of thems your moms
A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz
Well Im a new jack from the new school too cool
But some of the times I get bizarre  word 
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel
And start to yell BRRRRAHHHHH
While Im up on stage I feel that its my duty
To do somethin fly to make you shake your booty
Because I add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya just like a bunion
But I love you Shane  and I love you Kane 
Thats somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love yall  love yall  love yall  love yall 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE YALL
PEACE
