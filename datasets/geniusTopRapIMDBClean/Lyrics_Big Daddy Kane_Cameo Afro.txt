A rap pro do a show good to go also
Cameo Afro Virgo domino
I go Rambo Gigolo Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Battle cry Samurai Im what they call terror
Erasing all errors give work to pall bearers
Im talking caskets coffins Im the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massive organs
Fear factor hereafter disaster
Climb like the Stairmaster coming through clear a path of
The raw aggression thatll take your best on
You start talking Teflon then you switch to Revlon
Nigga choose your weapon hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit when you aint got ya S on
Get ahead of who Never you skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you but residue the state of vegetable
The mad swag and do flaunt it my dick and you want it
Only question now is nigga who want it
Cause once trouble said  like that  trouble dead
Boy dont make me have to pull out this double edge
A rap pro do a show good to go also
Cameo Afro Virgo domino
I go Rambo Gigolo Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Tel to get a good nights sleep Im keeping in step
Do I come off Yep
My sword crash through your breastplate splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow showing the clear trace
Behind punctured steel their bodies rot
Arm and leg missing head laying near the chopping block
An experience that shattered your spine break spirits
Same shit that fucks with your mind you hate to hear it nigga
Def man world is silent he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choked with bodies float it like rafts
Spark wires from autofire verbal and slang with gats
Streets filled with casualties wherever the tanks was at
Conflict is imminent preliminary attack
Everyones a target so cemeteries are packed
A solid nigga drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupefying drug pass ya cup
Why you trying to test me swordplay when Im sharp in every way
This life I liveIll do it all by myself
Why you trying to test me swordplay when Im sharp in every way
This life I liveIll do it all by myself
