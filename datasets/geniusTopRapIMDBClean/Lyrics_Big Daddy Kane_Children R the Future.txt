On and on and on and on
Me say the beat dont stop until the break of dawn
Nor does the growth of our young world
Yes the children be buildin each boy and girl
Cause you are the cream of the planet earth
The new birth now take that for what its worth
And give the child room to blossom and bloom
Livin large its your destiny to consume
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
Cause thats your goal in life  am I right  Yeah 
To start reachin come on each and every
Single one of yall comprehend what Im teachin
I said listen up listen up listen up youngster
Learn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya
Its nothin but knowledge I shall bring to you
And Im not Mr Rogers or Captain Kangaroo but I know
children children  are the future  variations 4X 
children children Where we goin now
Take my hand my child and let me show you how
Cause Im here to help
those who need Knowledge of Self
Young brothers and sisters considered the cream
That must rise to the top and fulfill the dream
And there are desires that we all want to achieve
But remember respect is most greatest to receive
And we dont have to gain it by bein TOUGH
Or sellin our own kind that cooked white stuff
So bring your negative mind from out of the shade
Find your true self and lets all get paid because
children children  are the future  variations 4X 
People people why we live illegal
Your life just ends short and you know that theres no sequel
sequel  Theyll say that it was fun while it lasted
You run wild stickin up and gettin blasted
Pregnant girls livin solo on the welfare
Cause your socalled man said go to hell dere
And young brothers that could be tryin to rap
Instead are out boostin clothes at the Gap
Now what kind of life is that for a child
Runnin wild livin foul hey change your lifestyle
Get some knowledge and open your eyes
Just take a little bit of time
How fully youll come to realize that
children children  are the future  variations 4X 
I believe the children are the future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all of the beauty they posess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier let the children laughter
Remind us how we used to be
