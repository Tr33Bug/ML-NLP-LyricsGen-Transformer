When Im in motion its just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lamborghini smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes Im the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start
To flowing ahem ahem coughing couldnt stop me from going
On with the rapture so that I capture
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves I just love that Im smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas  reason 
To give em a little of the flavor that please
As I school in the who in pursuin and doin and reignin again and the
Gutter and stutter and killin and chillin collectin the rent and
Jammin and slammin and damn its
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend the way that I make words mend
And the way that I be doin rappers in
Michael Bivins couldnt make these Boyz II Men
I display somethin verbally capable to murder the
Average MC the tough ones Ill burn third degree
And if youre thinkin that Im takin a beatin
Youre sure to see the Pink Panther speakin
Im a native New Yorker I pitch a lot of porker
When I get my ride I be the grill squawker
Tips a smooth talker I love Alice Walker
So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet you hooker you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya is youse a good looker
Queens is residential I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you went in by yourself it was a terror
See I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies out West you call em gats
Its that oh thanks chat well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please dont forfeit
Cause you wont get away your status will be stank
You can ride with me G Im goin to the bank
To meet up with Kane up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug cause they really cant handle
Position from the rappin cause some of them be slackin
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
The three different flavors you know we on the level
Check it out uhh As I come down and get dumb
Yes roughneck swingin along with the drum
Swimmin in the track retaliatin thorough is how
I react Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain bass kick impacts to the brain
Gotta make a mega migraine
Whattup To the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip flip the rhyme then I dip
Hey hiphop cool bust the interlude
Wack do ya on the stage gettin booed
This structure it takes bust the angle of three different flavors
On a young raider choc well thats my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom
All the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up huh Here I am damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
Wiggle your front pram to the runnin man
Sam Busta Rhymes comin on time
LONS did rip a new design
Flavor one taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby
Chiggy change chump the over sized puff
Busta pump you and the love and then I rump
Emotional stare point for the wild
Busta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle
Unload catch you like smell later
Dig on your taste of the third flavor rrrarrrRHHH
RARRARRRRH Direct from the lungs of the dragon uh
