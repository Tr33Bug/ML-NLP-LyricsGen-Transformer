Intro Big Daddy Kane
You know daddys home
Yeah baby Get them sounds up Action
Alright LG baby make the track move one time
You know daddys home
Uhhuh now dig this here right
Now I can remember one time I said
Its eightyeight time to set em straight right  word up 
What we gotta do is see what we got in store for ninetyfour
As I continue to give you more
You know daddys home
This is how we gonna try to bring it to you one time
Uhh and I go and I go
You know daddys home
Peace peace yall dont eat grease yall huh
A Brooklyn nigga representin the East yall come follow me now
I get down for my crown with new found wreck
And bring the noise like Im comin to soundcheck
The stage is clear for me to rock it
So I snatch the mic like a Brooklyn nigga does a pocket
Clear the throat to perform the art
To treat the stage like a movie ticket and rip it apart
Watch the crowd burst from lyrics that I say
To make the brothers get ill and by the way Dukes
If thats your girl in the corner stay up on her
Cause Ive been watchin her more then a Korean store owner
Whoo  Mack man number one you know how I move
Youd think that Id be shavin my rhymes cause theyd be so smooth
Mr Wonderful and all of that gun to pull shit
That you be talkin nigga dont even run the bull
Cause if I roll on you kid I do the body rude
Like the cops did on ummmmmm that Rodney dude
Peep it
Chorus repeat 4X  except last line 4th time 
welcome to a new Terrordome
When I come to roam you know daddys home
Watch out now
Just like Sylvester its still on get it
Still on fukkit lets move along
I rip shop in hiphop to sew it like a ziplock
To get props in this spot look at me at the tiptop
The kid got to get hot you thought that I would flipflop
Or dropdrop but ummmmmmmmmmmm I did not
They say Kane youre old school out here
I said I guess I got left back cause I aint goin nowhere
The Kane will remain in this domain
To reign again when I entertain
Cause when it comes to lyrics I got plenty black
Im so god damn dope I sell rhymes in a twenty sack
The microphone pusher man but not drug related
HipHop orientated keepin you captivated
Mr Cee cuts I linger through em Larry is singin to em
And oh me I just bring it to em
Chorus fades out
