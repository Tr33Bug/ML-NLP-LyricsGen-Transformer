This one goes to my man Ol Dirty one love we be swigging brew
Trigger too even Nas I be digging too
Lets see whose left Mobb Deep oh yeah Meth
That brothers hot like curry one love to Keith Murray
Rappers like Craig Mack quench my thirst for comedy
Id love to hang with Red Man but I aint messing with that bam bazee
The Brat Lil Kim Foxy get that loochee
Especially that cutie representing for the Fugees go girls
Even the NBA make rap dollars
Shaquille Chris Webber Cedric Ceballos
Talents around the world Phoenix to Providence
No need to educate Chicago they already got Common Sense
Houston and Atlanta we love you
Peace to the West Coast they really set the Doggs loose
We always say the futures in todays children
If so make sure Shyheim and A  sell a million
Peace to Eazy E Stretch and Mercury
2Pac and Buffy Notorious BIG
We gots to strive to make hiphop survive
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive
Rappers be coming out with one album then they gone
So with cats like Raekwon support em so they stay on
Then brothers like Smooth wouldnt have to hustle
Its an every day struggle but hiphop I still love you
Chorus
We Entaprizin got the hiphop heads realizin
East Coast West Coast organizin
Steady risin money sizin
What we specialize in
Repeat
Verse 2
The fame in the rap game we all want it
In fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it
And if youre in it for the millions E40
I hope you see 40 before you be 40
What it look like the great paper chase for ends
Lost Boyz being found in Lex coups Bimas and Benz
East Coast West Coast unite lets keep it tight
And everythings gonna be alright
But hold up it seems we got some hiphop cheats
Depending on just having catchy hooks and beats
Rappers using their skills recently I havent heard of none
Me I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson
And yes that I do Ill shatter you
It dont even matter who Ill make them all show gratitude
Fools acting like they dont know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin jewels
Now they say is Mr Kane coming back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn he still pumpin just when you think he aint nothing
That kid just keep coming back what is he the Terminator or something
Lord I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it party people they cant wait until
Starts to boom out so every rap consumer
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
I sting it booyah to stop the half steppers tryin to wing it through ya
Dont make me have to bring it to ya
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
Right now get down for the crown mess around get pound to the ground by the sound
And let the more experienced entertain
Kane meet the microphone microphone meet Kane
The legendaire rap extraordinaire
Commutin to your ear yeah looka here
Chorus 2x
