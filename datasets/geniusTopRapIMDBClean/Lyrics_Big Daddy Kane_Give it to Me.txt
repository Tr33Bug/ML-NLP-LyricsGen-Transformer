Ready willin and able
Here comes the new modern day Dark Gable
On the mattress and on the box springs
Girls they wanna sport me like bamboo earrings
The gogetter the skinshitter
And if your girl says she met me I probably did her
Word up the sex super stud
I jump your bones like ten Crips against one Blood
Nasty  The NASTY
Ready for action if you wanna see why
So come on and lets do this
As I tiptoe through your tulips
Like Moses I part them legs like the Red Sea
And then I plant somethin deadly
Poundin and poundin is how Im servin this
Makin it look like your bed is goin through turbulence
Lots of lust between the two of us
The sign on my Jimmy says Kidneys or bust so
I shove deeper than the voice of Barry
To make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey
Its like a Morris Day jerkout
To put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout
Im ready to tear down walls
You say lets chill but to hell with that
Im not Aaron Hall so
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it in 
I paid the cost to be the boss
Like with that HIV rumor they tried to toss
But Im so good with the women that if I ever caught AIDS
A woman doctord find a cure just so she could get laid
So never fear my dear just come on over here
I practice safe sex with girls I lay next
In other words the Jhats on the head
Cause Im too sexy for AIDS like Right Said Fred
So can I touch you there huh Huh
I like to take my time whenever Im
Massagin my fingers through a girl oohwee
I leave her wet just like her beaver had a Jheri curl
Then I begin to hit those skins
So baby doll let let me in
And if youre the slight bit tight from virginity
vaseline on me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it in 
Just another pervert that loves to flirt
With a skirt so at a concert girls stay alert
Cause I be hoppin on em just like a frog
I run through a Luke video like its a smorgasbord
I start sweatin my back gets to humpin
Then I thump and I thump and I thump and I thump
I dont carry a gun but Im packin somethin lethal
One of the last sheBOINKIN people
So come on Miss Thing dont front
You got me on a hunt and you know what I want that
USSY wait thats not the way oh
Pass the Peas like they used to say
And when I give you this fat one
You gotta guard your grill honey
Nonononononono not that one
Because I give girls the grand slam
Im like a radio station continuous jams
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
