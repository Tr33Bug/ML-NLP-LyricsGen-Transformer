On the Black Caesar tip my dialogue is just like
A frank inside of a supermarket raw dog
Im the untouchable never to be took out
A Sexy Mother ooh child Prince look out
Im keepin girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
Cause when I hit the skins they all say Damn Kane 
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign
But if you think that lickin toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger dont sleep
I write raps ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw rapidly ruinin roaches
Point blank I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers REDRUM REDRUM
Cause I do em somethin awful break em down to a morsel
Makin sure that youre no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when Im comin that if they
Shitted a dictionary you couldnt get a word from em
Its sort of a tradition in BedStuy to do or die
So steppin to me is suicide
I couldnt think of a rapper takin mines
I feel like Ali Im the greatest of all times
Floatin like a butterfly stingin like a bee
Yeah I know this aint boxing but thats still my pedigree
But as for you you have no appeal
How you get a record deal
Like shelltoe Adidas aint a damn thing changed
The way I shoot off lyrics like a firing range
Breakin out in a cold sweat the death threat
Gettin more props than a movie set
The smooth microphone assassin rhymes keep blastin
Uh I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Body Count troop
You must admit that you joined IceTs group
Cause you aint hurtin niggedy nuthin so why you bluffin
Tryin to be the new Big Daddy Something
But theres only before me no one is richer huh
You couldnt come Pryor if your name was Richard
Cause Im the Alpha and Omega
ArmLeguhLeguhArmHead stayin raw til Im dead
And to battle me you shouldnt even try
Cause with wings on your tongue you still couldnt say nothin fly
And I dont care if you bring a crew
And I dont even care if someone else writes for you
Man you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
You couldnt see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume Rapmasters Word Up
Yo MTV BET The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Lets get down to finish this large
You could bring on your whole squad none of you chumps are hard
All that garbage you mumble aint real and seriously seriously
How you get a record deal
A lot of rappers today wonder
Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say
Well youre goddamn right you should
Cause my rhymes are like spandex they make any ass seem good
So act like you know Baby Pop
When I riggedy rock the higgedy hiphop nonstop as I
Freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest
A fury full force in the flames of the fire now
May these MCs rest in peace
Because when I come to town the population decrease
I leave em finished dead and thats that huh
Not even Pet Sematary could bring em back
I slay my prey they decay I tell em like Jennifer Holiday
No no no no no noooooooooooo way
That you could ever touch this no you know how I feel
I think you bought your record deal
