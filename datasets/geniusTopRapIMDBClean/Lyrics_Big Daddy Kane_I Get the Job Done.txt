Hey yo Teddy
Yo
I ran into a young lady Maliya last night
Word
Must have been her husbands payday
Heheh
because she bought me this here brand new
Diamond link that you see me with on
Mmm
Smooth you knowhatImsayin You know why
Why Kane
Cause I get the job done
I work  x3 
I work baby
The question at hand is how do I love thee
I count the ways but girls dont shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you cant posess me
Because I love a young lady thats beautiful
But one thats smart for me is more suitable
In other words to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldnt believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
But Ill take em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King I Shall Overcome
I get the job done
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down without havin a large pick
Rushed into becoming some poohbutts wife
And no longer do you enjoy the married life
Well I let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldnt
And do certain things he probably just couldnt
Let me sneak into your life like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
Youll say Oooh I like it just like DeBarge  how large 
Smooth and mild Ill make you smile honey child
Then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on youll have to say
Like Calgon please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband wont Im a neighbor who will get the job done
TR take it to the bridge uhh
Heres a perfect description of me
Six foot one and dark and lovely
And if theyre sayin black is beautiful its true not phony
Im Browner than Bobby so wont you be my Tenderoni
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An uptodate mack thats ready to attack
And prove that Im a pro and far from a rookie
Aint no hair on my chest but Im one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be onehundred percent
Masculine in order to be in
Id rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl you wont disapprove
And I promise that youll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm now whats a title to fit me
A champ like Tyson a Captain like Kirk no
Employee of the Month cause yo I do work
The KANE is on the JOB
An expert cause I get it DONE
So lights camera action  all hail the one
That gets the job done
