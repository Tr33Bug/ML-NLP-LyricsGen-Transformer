Hear ye hear ye from far and near
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
Its a story of a faraway atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So lets all gather around because
x4 
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime they allll say 
They wouldnt even know what you mean
Cause its a different program yall know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hiphop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack aint nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
Theres a place that this can be done and yo
x4 
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But on the real tip you will see
Im not playing what Im saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems no one says sorry
And war aint nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance where theres starvation
But if you come with me youre sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyones a millionaire
Are you sick
And what the hell is welfare
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So dont think you cant afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only 599
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land and

  x3 
Since Im the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny but seriously folks
Its a shame that people today must live
In a world thats operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyones culture
So lets all gather around before this world corrupts
And we dont even need Scotty to beam us up
Because
