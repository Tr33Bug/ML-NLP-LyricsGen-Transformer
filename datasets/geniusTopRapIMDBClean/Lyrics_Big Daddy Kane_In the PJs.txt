Livin in the world of ghetto life
Shot with the gun get you cut with the knife
Thats the story yo the way the peeps like to move
No fakin the funk its all about how to show and prove
Some get to make it through life livin legal
The others gotta try to survive doin the evil
That men do peace to every hood that I been through
I even got love for my homies in South Central
But to the East my brother cause thats where I stay at
Runnin through the streets like a stray cat
Like that Good Times show it makes me go
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Up in the projects it gets no ILLER
With true gueRILLAS and stone cold KILLERS
It seems that every night you get to hear the fireworks
As much as I hate to see my people die or hurt
Its just a street mentality a reality
Neighborhood warfare that brings home casualties
And just because I moved out the residence
It dont mean that I cant represent
Chorus Kane  Yeah Yeah  chanted in back throughout
So to my peeps in the PJs throw your hands in the air
For all of yall
Let me know youre out there
To my peeps in the PJs throw your hands in the air
For all of yall
Let me know youre out there
And to my peeps in the PJs throw your hands in the air
For all of yall
And let me know youre out there
Ah to my peeps in the PJs throw your hands in the air
For all of yall
And let me know youre out there
Im runnin mob deep around the way
Its me and the crew were tryin to map out the day
Yo whats the haps on how we gettin snaps
Are we gonna shoot some ceelo or play a game of craps
Matter fact Shane ring the intercom
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare
Cause the elevators broke and I aint checkin for the stairs
And do me a solid run to the store shorty
And pick me up some Olde E but not a 40
Just a twotwo of brew will do so I can knock it out fast
To make the coldness last
And while you at man see whered your friend go  word 
He shoulda been back a HOUR ago with the indo  yeah 
And meet us in the back park to get sparked
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark
Aiyyo Jay I see that bulge in the back of your jeans
Hope thats the God U Now know what I mean
Cause if somebody brings the noise Imma make it a silent movie
So take the safety off the toolie
Cause I dont want no beef NAHHHHH BABY
The only thing I wanna do is PARRRRRRLAY
Peace and harmony is what I relate to
But damn man dramas just in the nature
Chorus
I send this out to the homies in the hood
That stood by my side to help a brother do good
Just like SWV you was Right Here
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle
Down to the brothers that got a swift hustle
Like good golly Miss Three Card Molly a neat trick
Where people get beat quick
Wanna see a sweet vic
Jackety Jack blackety black
You get nuttin back and thats a fact
The sweetest game I ever seen
All you gotta do is find the red queen
Just point to it can anybody point to it
I play by the point of the finger of the hand
The one in the middle The one in the middle
Thats black you get no money back
Kane Aww man See I told you
