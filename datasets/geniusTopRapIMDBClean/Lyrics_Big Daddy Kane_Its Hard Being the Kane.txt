Uhh Put your weight on it
Uhh and uh Prince Paul bring me on and uh
Aiyyo Botch bring me on and uh
Mad Money Murph just bring me on and uh
Just bring me on yo
This is a world premier and Im here
A presentation beyond compare
So MCs step to the rear as I break through
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Just like a passenger hurry and fasten your seatbelt
Cause Im about to start broadcastin
The words of wisdom so turn up the system
Loud and clear I dont want no one to miss one
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
The preferred is absurd all the damage thats occured
As I break MCs like a lumberjack
Aint no comin back you cant get none of that
Im not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name aint Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante Im gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
With the mic in my hand I start flowin then
All competition flee and start goin in
The other direction run for protection
Cause I can burn an MC like an erection
Youre too small kid dont get involved with
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
Showin I got the power and thats from bein born the God
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
But theyre just illiterate so I dont consider it
Feedin off poison thats pollutin their mind
And thats the reason I dont swine
I gotta maintain accelerate my brain
And god damn its hard being the Kane
Give it to me Cmon
Cmon Uhh
Give it to me Give it here
Give it to me Yeah
This is the proper way man should use ink
But youre at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Just like a dinosaur but you never find a more
Cause minell keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore
Let me inject this flow of electric currency
For all the party people preferrin me
And spectatin like a tourist cause you never
Saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris
But this aint KungFu no I just brung you
A style that phony MCs were too young to
Digest when I manifest you adolescent
So sit back relax be glad you had a lesson
And this ones for your listenin pleasure
Somethin for all the bitin MCs to treasure
Just like a diary for you to admire me
Before youre put in the Dead Poets Society
Cool as a draft droppin math in a paragraph
I laugh as the wrath break in half your whole staff
But many MCs were able to retreat
Runnin like an athlete but I got bad feet
So I dont chase ya nor do I wait to face ya
Nah it aint in my nature
I just rip shop fliptop and watch MCs get dropped
As I manifest in hiphop
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck
And just like lightnin they struck
Down on all the toy MCs that annoy
Thats how I build and destroy
The poetic printer rough rhyme inventor
With a groove so smooth you cant help but get into
So Im advisin competition to flee
Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee
Holdin my own on the microphone
Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones
So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain
God damn its hard bein the Kane
Give it to me Get up
Come on Uhh
Give it to me Come on
Give it to me Yeahhh
Put in a pause because heres the holocaust
Above all laws in effect and all yours
Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace
A replace erase the waste without a trace
My vocabulary will just have you very
Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary 
That means competition
They cant even touch this even with ammunition
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage
And Imma still blow up the stage
Cause this is a death threat but dont let your sweat get
In the way of your vision dont be missin when I get set
To go on a rampage start a one man rage
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
And leave it in ruins from the damage that Im doin
To prepare the atmosphere as I put you in
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
And so
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
To get fly and face the ace I put em in place
Proceed em retreat em defeat em delete em and feed em and eat em
And all the rest of that good stuff cause I dont need em
Only one survivor can remain
And god damn its got to be the Kane
Get up Give it to me
Give it here Cmon
Cmon Give it to me
Uhh Put your weight on it
