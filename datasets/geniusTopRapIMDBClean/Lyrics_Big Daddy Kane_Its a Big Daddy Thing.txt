Dr Harrah is Mr Kane loose in this hospital
In the morgue I think doctor
I specifically told Dr Riley to suspend him
Aw yeah
We gon pump this up one time
As we set it off a little like this kick it
Pump it up now  Its a Big Daddy thing 
As we send this out to New York City
Cant forget the posse down in Philly
Also in Detroit  Its a Big Daddy thing 
Chicago Atlanta GA
Sendin this out to Miami  Its a Big Daddy thing 
Tampa cant forget Virginia and North Carolina
LA and Oakland  Its a Big Daddy thing 
And the rest of the world as we go a little somethin like this  Its a Big Daddy thing 
Let it rain let it rain be put it pain
With nothin to gain under the wrath of Kane
Cause you cant maintain I drained every brain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or path or road until the next episode
Let the BIG DAdoubleDY explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam so hit the alarm
Or be funky like a underarm
And allow me to show how the microphone
Should flow now competition bow
To me like a Buddha the teacher the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I aint about that slouchin or crabbin
So save it cause thats one thing I aint havin
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to um
Get loose now put a boost and use to chill
The comp to Kane I picked Beetlejuice
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing


Im just that ruthless to leave ya toothless
Cause youre useless makin up excuses excuses
So never touch tap tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foell get slapped with a Pamper
Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But Ima chill wont even dispute you now
Actin wild just aint my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
Quiet as kept not like a star to you
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the dead zone you shouldnt have left home
Steppin to the man now get the head flown
I bring the terror horror theres no tomorrow
Child you shouldnt even bother
To press up and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a gigolo but Im much bigger though
Im like a hitman pullin the trigger slow
And smooth to the groove with lyrics thatll soothe
And improve with every move thats why youve
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football and lets go the nine
Shorts I take none cause I aint the one
In 89 theres damage being done
And for you to diss me will be very risky
Cause I make this be as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose and fall
So yall can see how me the Kane will just reign
Superior cause I aint even hearin ya
Save the yang cause its a Big Daddy thang
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
Big Daddy thing
And this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph
Cant forget Big Sha Big Therm
And also I got to say whats up to my man Horace
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Mack Daddy Nick know what Im sayin
Cant forget my man Ant Live
And of course the one and only Prince Paul peace
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
Its a Big Daddy thing
