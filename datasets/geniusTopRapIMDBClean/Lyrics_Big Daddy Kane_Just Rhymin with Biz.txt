Funky
Ready
Funky Funky Ahhh
One two one two
We came here to do the motherfuckin do
You and the crew
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Cant forget my man Lik yall in the house
Got Fric and Frac in the house
Heyheyhey you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
Thats right
And my name is the Biz Markie
And we gonna rock a little something like this
One two whatcha gonna do
I say yes yes yall to the beat all
Partyhavin people guaranteed to be like havin a ball
Hhhhey we gonna do a little somethin like this I say
Im the rap promoter I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm odor
Put me on water Im a good floater
When I run for prez you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watched Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2D2 drivin down the BQ
When I buy franks I make sure theyre Hebrew
When I entertain and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nightie thats seethrough
Take her to the crib turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwarzenegger
Maybe Commando or The Terminator
Peace party people ha ha see you later
Big Daddy ha ha my man my mellow
Get on the mic cause you know you eat JellO
Check it out yall
You dont stop keep on
Well its the Kane in the flesh of course Im fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten Huh I beg your pardon
To me gettin paid and gettin busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance never
Could I be weak why Im rather unique
I got style flavor grace and plus a different technique
That I be usin and not many can manage
So a brother like me I do damage
Just by pickin up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out and oh yo
I get physical mystical very artistical
Givin party people somethin funky to listen to
Thats why the other MCs cant swing long
I stomp em out just like I was King Kong
Steppin on roaches I get ferocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Cause Imma pimp hear the primp yes the emp
eror bringin much terror in your era
Im ready willin and Im able so bust a move
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Coolin out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that yall its like that yall
Its like thatathethat its like that yall
Cause Im the prosecutor takin a stand
And Im crossexaminin you my man
The judge and jury releasin my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobodys Equal
I hate to brag but damn Im good
And if mics were a gun Id be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game Id be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the MIC
Or if rap was a school Id be the principal
Aw fuck it The Kane is invincible
To be specific I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
Its a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good apparently you lack this
So in turn sit back and learn
Listen close this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how its properly done
Lights camera action
A rap pro do a show good to go also
Cameo afro Virgo domino
I go Rambo gigolo Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
tel to get a good nights sleep Im keepin in step
Now do I come off Yep
