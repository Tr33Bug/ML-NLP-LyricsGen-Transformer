Looks Like a Job For Lyrics
instrumental 
RAW
The BIGDADouble DYKANE
Let it roll get bold
Settin it off lettin it off
Come get some
The wrath of Kane
This is a world premiere Im here
Nobody move nobody get hurt
And I wont have to do nobody work
The minute I come on stage and take position
A demolition where rappers catch a bad decision huh
I start to swingin it puttin my bad thing in it
Soon as I start flingin it girlsll start clingin it
Peoplell start singin it noise oh Im bringin it
To show and to prove to the people
The man that really is the king in it
Cause I take the cake like Hostess
No not the one you wanna play high post with
Warm it up Kane warm as a snorkel
Snatch the microphone and do a nigga somethin awful
I give him the rhythmajazz pizzazz finesse and yet
The flavor to jam and slam the land
I flip the script like nobody can
Its like they lack the crowd to get live
And raw from all the brothers who smothered the mic
Theyre frank with force cause you know Kane comes off
See me and the mic go together like neighbors
And if thats too fast heres a slower flavor
You see I am the man to stand top brand
No band at hand and yes I can can yes I can can
Rip the microphone to shreds
Buck buck rough and tough and a little bit ragamuffin
For havin a rapper that try to battle will stress me
You shouldnt address me cause you cant impress me
So dont test me boy I say you better move over
Yeah yeah huh
Many people tried to say I fell off
He went RB now his rap is all soft
But if you say that on stage Ill prove you wrong
And wax that ass rappin off a love song
Cause with the street in all battles Im still hard
Like a mallet servin competition like salad
Im gonna give you some damn good advice G
Break out before there be some sugar honey iced tea
Cause now youre comin in the danger zone
There no man can withstand or hold his own
I burn a rapper so bad that it bruise
Even if you put a condom on the mic that I use
That wont protect ya I still can effect ya
Cause I flip the script like a movie director
Im makin the nonbelievers believe what Im dishin up
And people thats still fans will be air conditioners
Why golly gee Im the hypest
The power to maintain and sustain cause Im righteous
In other words by knowledge and degrees
You gotta say God bless and I dont mean when I sneeze
A black man you know I got soul
For rockin the track and sparkin the mic that I hold
Not just been flowin for the fellas so for the ladies
I didnt forget you mwah kiss sound
A lot of rappers today know how to flow
Also a lot of amateurs turned pro
But if I ask for the mic at your show
Aiyyo I think you better let it go
Cause I go in a rage on stage
The rap it never stops til I get my props
And if you dont know my style well look here my friend
You saw Faces of Death Hehe yeah yeah aight then
Im tryin to tell my competition the scoop
That Im breakin down any soloist or group
And even though some of them try to play souped
When I come on stage they spread they wings like Troop
And fly away cause I dont play
I slay okay okay
The king of combat my competition scat
Pockets stay fat oh hells yeah Im all that
The one they like to follow bite and borrow
Lock into my style just like a Rottweiler
So you wanna know the meaning of hardcore
Looks like a job for
Big Daddy Big Daddy
Big Daddy Big Daddy
