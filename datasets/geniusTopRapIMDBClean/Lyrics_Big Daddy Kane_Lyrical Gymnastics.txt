Do you know what youre goin through
Do you like this style of rap that Im showin you
The way I flow for you do you know
Yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon check the rhyme to the song
Uhh aw yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four gotta keep em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What Im used to hearin I cant believe its gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King the beef is on
When I come rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees
So run for your lives Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills come see how it feels
I pull you one verse if that dont kill I got refills
You cant do me none kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in Braille you still couldnt touch em
Man Im a bad cat my style of rap is mad fat
And you know sometimes its so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft they wouldnt even kill time right
Heres the news you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You aint never paid dues
Be for real you aint tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmn sham
Im glad in this business I didnt forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
Never to walk in anyones shadow
I do my own thing I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I dont lose none boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die  choose one
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MCs are you kiddin me
If rappers were grapes Id have a whole wine distillery
So I bring it to your face with the bass then I blow
A rapper off the map with the rap when I flow
Then hit you with the skill that is ill and I know
That all of this is good to go cause yo
Thats the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style cause that is where Im from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rappin is quite fat
Im lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies Im givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick even the slimmy ones
Watch out Goldie Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody elses stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers dont believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback like Pumas
I get rough G and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart like my name was Humphrey
When I get through therell be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt I should open a crematorium
I make mad MCs give me my Ps
If you try to disrespect kid you can get these
NUTs like the UNVs
I leave you down on your knees down on your kneehees
Razor sharp many ways of art
Source rings the chart people praise the God
For kickin the flows so fantastic and this one here
Were callin it Lyrical Gymnastics
Uhh so baby baby cmon
Aw yeah baby cmon and check the rhymes to the song
Uhh ah baby baby cmon
Suki suki cmon and Im gone
