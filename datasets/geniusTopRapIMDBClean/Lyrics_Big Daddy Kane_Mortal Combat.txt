The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick so guard it with Chapstick
In other words protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get ya head flown
Fists of fury suckers get buried
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothin could save ya from catchin the vapors
Rhymes thatll sting your face like a quick jab
And Im rubbin em in just like Vicks salve
Captivatin dominatin innovatin illustratin fascinatin
Motivatin elevatin terminatin mutilatin
Rhymes theyre worth their weight in
Gold bold never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter youre so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage dont tell me what another do
Cause I quote that Im RAW
So make room cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume and make your own tomb
A grave or a casket a tisket a tasket
Youre rhymes out of basket
Boy you get your ass kicked
For frontin like you hittin hard
When your arms are too short to box with God
So dont even touch cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle he must be senile
And thats why meanwhile back at the ranch
The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat
Make you say daddy I dont want none  Kool Moe Dee
I seize and freeze MCs with these degrees
Put me to my knees or at ease Chiiiillld please
I break it down to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit they need ExLax
So stop griffin your mind is driftin
Prepare yourself cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you cant understand
At times I gotta say to myself God damn
As I get hot and still be gettin warmer
And I dont have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker
Frontin MCs that be tryin to riff
Need to save it and dont even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin
I step to you and say Now whats up then
Every wordll be just like surgery
Cuttin you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and bend low
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
JOKES aint my style
I aint a child thats why I dont smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine the other rappers need resign
As I go on from night to morn
Beginning to end from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin for static
Looks like a job for KingAsiatic
NE send me competitors
Then again it might just be better to
Just slow down you dont wanna throwdown
I get busy get you dizzy like a merrygoround
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin black gold
So let it be said let it be read cause I lead ahead
Of others whose rhymes are old as ProKeds
Tryin to diss the Big Daddy repertoire Moi
You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote
As I just play em like a pregnant roach and STOMP EM
For tryin the forbidden
Your rhymes aint hittin boy you wont be gettin
None of or in front of cause every one of
My adversaries lack you little son of
Obituary columns will read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin or aimin to be champion
Against me Psssh cant be won
I rank supreme and its a rappers dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause theres only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise manll reach ya
I teach freedom justice and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves from mental death in power
Thats the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam
Make you say  6X  daddy I dont want none 
Make you say say dadaddy I dont want none 
Make mamamake make you say daddy I dont want none 
Make you say  6X  daddy I dont want none
