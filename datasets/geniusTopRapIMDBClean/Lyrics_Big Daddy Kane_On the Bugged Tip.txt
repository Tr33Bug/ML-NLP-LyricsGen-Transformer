Yo on the MIC right about now
I go by the name of Big Daddy Kane
I got my man Scoob Lover on the side of me
DJ Mister Cee on the wheels of steel
Dre on the film and Marley on the boards
We gonna do a little something like this
Some like it hard and some like it soft
Yo bust the groove as I set it off
But wait a minute
Yo Scoob whats up
Pardon me a moment as I interrupt
For what
For this
You like the stylish clothes we wear
And you like our flattop style of hair
Its just those bugged out things we do
That make the girlies wanna stare
Like when were chillin with the crew
Or drinkin that Old English brew
Straight from the bottle not the cup
And it gets us more than just fucked uuuuup
And I like it yall
like it yall
Like it yall
like it yall
Scoob Lover wont you hype it yall
Well Im the SC doubleO BLOVER uh
Ladies come to me Ill be your midnight horror
Need a flat top Come to Scoob Im the barber
Of Da Ville
And thats right
Try to step to us watch what you get
Cuz me and Big Daddys not havin it
Well its the Big Daddy so all hail
Save your wack rhymes hold your female
Pass the Old Gold trash the ale
Cash your food stamps get the WIC out the mail
Love to eat shrimps but I never eat snail
Eat a whole fish except for the tail
Keep food in the fridge so it dont get stale
And when theres nothing to eat I bite my nails
So Scoob Lover you know your rhymes are kickin
Get on the mic cuz you know you eat chicken
Nownownow Ima place a order for a Scooby snack
Not at the Chinese restaurant because I dont eat cats
Now who in the world can ever eat these
When Im at home I chow down with ease
And say More beef sausage mom please
Thats right Mommy Dukes she feeds me swell
Coffee on the table orange juice as well
Some of the things I say are outspoken
Guaranteed to have you chokin
Bitin MCs are the one Im yokin
Kane Im outta here I guess Ill use my token
Ill walk through the gate if the turnstiles broken
Big Daddy if youre down with me
Get on the mic on the count of three
One two three
Now Im a black brother thats out to succeed
So step aside as I take the lead
Sexy young ladies of a lightskinned breed
You gotyou gotyou got what I need
Outstanding kind cool and loyal
Drove all the way to Maaco just to change my oil
Cuz Im the only child you might think Im spoiled
Touch the young ladies make their blood pressure boil
I got the hmmhiccups excuse me sorry
Score a 100 Gs every time I play Atari
Put a hole in the Old Gold blast the Bacardi
On the dance floor hype moves I be freakin
Makin new steps up every single weekend
Not Abbot and Costello or Laurel and Hardy
Im only here to PARTY
Yo check it out check it out
Turn the music down turn the music down
Turn the music down here we go here we go
We gonna end it like this in the place yall
Its like this yall and you dont stop
Now the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobodys Equal
I hate to brag but damn Im good
And if mics were a gun Id be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game Id be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the MIC
And if rap was a school Id be the principal
Aw fuck it the Kane is invincible
To be specific I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
Its a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good apparently you lack this
So in turn sit back and learn
Listen close this is for your own concern
Let me show ya exactly how its properly done
