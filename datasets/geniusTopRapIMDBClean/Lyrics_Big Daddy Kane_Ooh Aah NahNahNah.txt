Enquiring minds wanna know did the champ retire
So here I am boomin like an amplifier
I clear my throat then I float like a boat
Note for note what I wrote you cant quote or even tote
Raps are too heavy sharp like a machete
Pass the microphone cause Kane is all ready
Grippin to play the part to prove that Im in command
The Biggest Daddy of em all and oh Kane stands for
King Asiatic Nobodys Equal
Or NonEquivalent or Natural Ebony
Or Now Effective or Never Ever
Pick your definition and put it together
Cause it still comes out tastin like chocolate
With the finesse MCs never got with
Cause none of them want me to touch the mic first
They know that it only takes Kane one verse
So heres the microphone show me what you can do
And uhh yawn wake me up when youre through
Just so I can go and flow and throw a blow
To show a pro and let em all know
That any MC trying to be this lyrical
Should go ask Smokey Robinson for a Miracle
I wouldnt let a rapper go one round
Im knockin them down just like Jim Brown
So Mister Cee let the music play
And heres what I want yall to say
Ooh  cmon  Aah  cmon 
NahNahNah Nana  cmon like you should 
Ooh  cmon  Aah  cmon 
NahNahNah Nana  uhh 
Ooh  oooh  Aah  aaah 
NahNahNah Nana  sing that song 
Ooh  cmon  Aah  cmon 
NahNahNah Nana
Heres a rap avalanche MCs travel and
Runrun for shelter cause they dont have a chance
Any MC caught talkin out of turn
I straighten em out just like a perm
Now lets take a second just to recollect it
Give a little shout to the rappers thats out
Like all the East coast MCs of today
From RunDMC on down to KidnPlay
The ladies like SaltNPepa to Latifah
Who showed the power of a woman and me a believer
Now backtrack with the musical jewel
And say peace to the old school
And all praises due to the LA crew
You put your state on the map and kept bringin rap through
I cant forget the brothers thats down in Miami
Youre still 2 Live if you never get a Grammy
Cause personally I feel who really needs that stuff
If you ask me its just a bunch of makeup
Theres a lot of caucasian kids that dont even know me
Cause every Billy and Joey is another David Bowie
I guess I used the wrong tools in my rhymes
Cause when I nailed my clock it didnt say Hammer Time
Thats not a diss to my Oaktown friend
Just telling you how it is in the musical biz
Cause I make sure that every rapper in the industry
Becomes a friend of me
And Mister Cee let the music play
And heres what I want yall to say

Ooh  oooh  Aah  aaah 
NahNahNah Nana  nanana 
Ooh  cmon  Aah  cmon 
NahNahNah Nana  cmon wontcha cmon 
Ooh  ohhh  Aah  uhhh 
NahNahNah Nana  sing that song 
Ooh Aah
NahNahNah Nana
