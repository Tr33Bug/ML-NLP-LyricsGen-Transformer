Cause I came back for these troubles to grab me
And theyve gotten a hold on me

Looks to me like Eastside got problems

New rule be enforced in school so we can get rid of
All the bad apples in the bunch
Clean up the wall and cook better lunch
Put the students in class where they should be
To stop roamin the halls and oh could we

Point blank lets change the whole scenery
