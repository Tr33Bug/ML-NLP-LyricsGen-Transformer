Raw  Remix  Lyrics
Here it comes
Since the faroff days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth to give realism
And spaciousness and even where it applies to convey actual movement
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow
So get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare I do declare
Getting busy is where its at
But what youre saying you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rocking how many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect Im out to collect
Cash money cause I get raw
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Boy do I hate a
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Here I am RAW
A terrorist here to bring trouble to
Phony MCs I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause Im at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter Im a kilo
Second to none making MCs run
So dont try to step to me cause I aint the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it so I dont see why you all
Try to front perpetrating a stunt
When you know that Ill smoke you up like a blunt
Im genuine like Gucci raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the AM
Ill make a muscle grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed I bust a
Little rhyme with authority superiority
And captivate the whole crowds majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
Im sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw


Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Give a speech like a reverend rappers start severing
And in my lifetime believe Ive never been
Beaten or eaten and just tooken out
You know come to think about it I keep MCs looking out
And real nervous when Im at your service
Give me that title boy you dont deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme you know that it has to
Be perfectly fitted cause Im committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kanell get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya Im not an amateur but a pro
fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat thats all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe its gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MCs that Im dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne with a bronze microphone
Hmm God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Heres an experiment to begin with
Twentyfour sev chilling killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MCs that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic do work like a mechanic
Make MCs panic they all get frantic
And skeptic like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey what you expected
Ill get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and Ill be damned if I
Ever let a FisherPrice MC hang
Their rhymes are toy nothing but yinyang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And Imma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw
