Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Here I am RAW
A terrorist here to bring trouble to
Phony MCs I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause Im at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter Im a kilo
Second to none making MCs run
So dont try to step to me cause I aint the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it so I dont see why you all
Try to front perpetrating a stunt
When you know that Ill smoke you up like a blunt
Im genuine like Gucci raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the AM
Ill make a muscle grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed I bust a
Little rhyme with authority superiority
And captivate the whole crowds majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
Im sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw
Give a speech like a reverend rappers start severing
And in my lifetime believe Ive never been
Beaten or eaten and just tooken out
You know come to think about it I keep MCs looking out
And real nervous when Im at your service
So give me that title boy you dont deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme you know that it has to
Be perfectly fitted cause Im committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kanell get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya Im not an amateur but a pro
fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat thats all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe its gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MCs that Im dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne with a bronze microphone
Hmm God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Twentyfour sev chilling killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MCs that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic do work like a mechanic
Make MCs panic they all get frantic
And skeptic like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey what you expected
Ill get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and Ill be damned if I
Ever let a FisherPrice MC hang
Their rhymes are toy nothing but yinyang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And Imma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw
