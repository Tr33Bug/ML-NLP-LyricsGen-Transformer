Let it roll get bold I just cant hold back
Or fold cause Im a man with soul
In control and effect so what the heck
Rock the discotheque and this groove is whats next
Attack react exact the mackll move you with
A strong song as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when youre hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift MCs stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist or my death kiss
The rap soloist you dont want none of this
Supreme in this era I reign with terror
When I grab the mic believe youre gonna hear a
Fascinatin rhyme as I enchant em
So lets all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow my rhymes grow like an Afro
I entertain again and Kanell never have no problem
I can sneeze sniffle and cough
Eeeeven if I stutter Imma still come off
Cause rappers cant understand the mics I rip
They sure enough aint equipped thats why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Dont ask whos the baddest of course that is
The maker breaker taker my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed so watch whats said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
Cause I get ill and kill at will
Teachin a skill thats real youre no frill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up
Dont even get up
The teacher is teachin so just shut up
I cant hold it back
Set it off
Now break loose
Rappers take a step back or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct perfect in full effect
Disconnect dissect eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin my flattop trim
Scoob Lover my brother Scrap Lover my other
Dancin with the crew so allow the boys to smother
The floor and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic Asiatic rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin automatically from me
So dont play me obey me
When asked Whos the best you better say me
Im sendin sucker MCs headin north
And if you still want some set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat theyre feedin me dope
Cause Im just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate legit Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom completin a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says Peace
So maestro yo hit it
Big Daddy Kanes about to come with it cause


I cant hold it back
Set it off
Now break loose
