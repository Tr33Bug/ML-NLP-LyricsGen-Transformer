Bust a move we show and prove
Ha ha hey hey laugh now nigga
My mans right behind you Kane pull the trigger
I dont play Im from the hill where shit is real
And Ill be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
Im hitting hard oh word Im gon rock it
Once the shit drops thats dough to the pocket
I cut hair and you still cant get no part
You couldnt deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then its time for code red
My gun is like a ho it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army you still couldnt battle
So where you from England you somebody great
You burning Scoob I dont think so mate
I got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke
Ill have your friends saying Ah man that shit is dope
Leave me alone when Im rocking on the microphone
And play like ET and phone your black ass home
Yo Sauce if youre down with the groove
Get on the mic and wont ya show and prove
Hey here I come with a slick rap tic tac toe
When I flip tracks so gimme my dick back
I flow to it and through it if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like Sauce money you didnt do it
I write my own with bigger hope drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured nope damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic bastard pull hookers like elastic
NBA style fantastic
No time to bite but I just might tonight
I write lefthanded cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I dont get plenty play
Win lose or draw Im booking whores anyway
As I get ready Im steady if I go crazy Id take Eddie
If I was Fred I think Id have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking hey niggas Im ducking nay
Nada no never meaning aint no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast and you can hand over your ass
One line and thats fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim if youre down with the groove
Get on the mic its time to show and prove
I spark the mic like weed thats in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
Im psycho a villain to the styles I be killing
When Im thrusted and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from USA to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks Imma flush ya then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally what
You know my style I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba
More Super than Cat Im the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy if youre down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and wont ya show and prove
Now tell me who is the man
With the highpotent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me thinking I can be touched
Not even Michael Jordanll gamble that much yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid run it
Or else get hit with the ultimate too legit skit
Ahh yeah thats that shit
Drop lyrics on ya strong as ammonia
Thatll dethrone ya scorn ya joan ya I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah thats feared great leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant intelligent compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldnt give me no run
I see the way youre trying to get to me
But with that speech impediment man you gotta come better G
Youre hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldnt last a minute with
The nonresistable noncompetible
No No No Im not saying Im the best
Im just saying Im fucking incredible
And lets just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record trust me nigga itll sound good
So JayZ if youre down with the groove my mellow
Get on the mic its time to show and prove
One checking it two checking it three
Check out the J check out the A check out the Y check out the Z
Aight G
Im breaking MCs up like EPMD
And these nuts if you rappers trying to see me
Im buckwild with styles tadow
Ive been in it running a hundred miles Im well endowed baby gal
Uhh the greatest nigga to touch it you niggas cant fuck with
The incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn big up kid
And aint no eating me up you fast fuckin with jigga
Im like Prince jeans I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it its in the pocket baby mop it dont knock it
Till you try it once you start you cant stop it
Im the cocky breed Im dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme youre diggin the sound
I know you loving the way its goin down baby
So Ason huh if youre down with the groove why dont ya
Get on the mic and show and prove
Come on
WuTang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass disco dorm
Slippery when wet and dont you ever forget
You couldnt get a flick of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream Ow
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason keep that in your head
Yuh my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes Ill be like Well god damn whats the recipe
I dont know I ask my momma she dont know
She says Go ask your goddamn father
Its all about me in the place to be
Niggas think they all that yo that shit is G
Mad game and its a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of Ason who carries on like a manager
Yo Sounds fly right
Danger
