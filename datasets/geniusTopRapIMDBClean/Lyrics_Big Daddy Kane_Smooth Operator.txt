Well excuse me take a few minutes to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and Imma tell about
A minimum length of rhymes of strength
And power so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho swing low then yo the show
Will go on as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But Im not animated like a cartoon
Im for real shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd the listeners the spectators
So lets groove with the smooth operator
Cause Im so smooth
The BIG DAdoubleDYKANE
Im good and plenty servin many and any
Competition wishin for an expedition
Im straight up dissin and dismissin listen
Rappers act so wild and love to profile
Frontin hard but they aint got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Krueger walkin on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner cause Im a smooth operator
Cause Im so smooth
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss and its over miss
Sold to nice dreamers high as the price seem
Girlfriend you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering try to cling
Cause Its a Big Daddy Thing
And Im lovin em right word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Lets Get It On
I make it real good like Dr Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this theres none greater
Sincerely yours the smooth operator


Cause Im so smooth
Now aint that the pot callin the kettle black
Sayin Im a new jack you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say em and the way I display em
To make them sound different in a way thats gifted
And hey Im makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know  step off
Competition Imma get rid of
You cant get a bit of so just consider
A break or rest vacation hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
Im a smooth operator
Cause Im so smooth
Ahhhhh yeahhh and you dont stop
Genuine for 89
And I still aint halfsteppin peace
