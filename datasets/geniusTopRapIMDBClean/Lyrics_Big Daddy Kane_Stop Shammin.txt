Onefiftyeight Lewis Avenue
Between Lafayette and Van Buren that was back during
The days of hangin on my BedStuy block
With Spence and Mitch followin my cousin Murdoch
All the brothers were real goin for what they feel
By the way peace to my man Sha and Big Neal
Now in ninetythree Im still bein me
You think my fridgerator aint full of Olde E  Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I dont try to act brand new
Eatin escargots and usin words like rendezvous
The ghetto life Ive seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin a plastic lifestyle youre more false than dentures
Dont make me pull your file  stop shammin
Stop holdup pause wait  2X 
Stop shammin
So why you wanna be what youre not
And claim to have things that you know you aint got
Youre just a fantasizer  spendin all your money
On Lusters pink oil moisturizer
Just to make your hair curly and thin
You say Black is beautiful but then you go and bleach your skin
Money youre worse than Yacub
Cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
And nmmananahnah I just cant believe ya
Its quite obvious you dont wanna be a black man
So whats next  youre gonna join the Klu Klux Klan
You sold out to your race and its a big disgrace
You cant look your own people in the face
You wonder why it aint no black schools or hospitals
Youre makin millions of dollars and its pitiful
That you can donate to leukemia all the time
But you cant give the Nation of Islam a dime
They mention Muslims you change the subject
You cant even shake Farrakhan hand in public
That whole busy attitude is a sham
Umm bro umm brother umm Brougham stop shammin


Stop holdup pause wait  2X 
Change the groove and fuck it up a little bit
I look in the mirror at times I say Damn Black Caesar
Howd you get to be the woman pleaser
Cause I remember when girls didnt notice me
And now they wanna Come and Talk To Me like Jodeci
Its strange how back in the days I couldnt get with em
Now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
Well Ima hit it but still I show no pity
So I hope you dont think you gonna be in my next video
And many brothers I never even ran with
Be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid
I mean just to get a piece of the action
Man they start rememberin more times than Michael Jackson
But I cant fade to the tagalongs
That want me to drag em on
Frontin like a friend just so I can put em in
But you cuttin yourself paper thin  stop shammin
Stop holdup pause wait  2X 
And Im out
