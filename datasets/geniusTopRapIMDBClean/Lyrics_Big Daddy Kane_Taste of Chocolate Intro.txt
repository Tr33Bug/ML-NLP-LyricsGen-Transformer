Yeah
You know 1990 begins a new decade
Since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
Its been a three four year stretch
And Id just like to thank all of you
Mmm
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States overseas in the UK
Way in Brazil Japan Africa and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
Heres another groove that Im bringin to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that dont cease never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Cause Im so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
Ill have you dancin in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of BIG
DAdoubleDY Kane in the place
Doin the job how you want it done
With lyrics thats bright as the mornin sun
So grab one line rub it on your face like sunshine
And everythin elsell combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh also for every girly
To shamiyo shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh now wait now wait now wait a minute
Uhh Now check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one but all of the above
Comin together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
What joy do we find
Hard for me to say it sometimes
Nothin can stop this flow so back up off me
Hold your cup of Folgers wake up and smell the coffee
Big Daddy Kanes the name of the one and only
You wanna say it three times like Tony Toni Ton
Its not an avocation of being the best
But I at least deserve a cape or an S on my chest
Quote The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
Mmm they shoulda never turned me loose
Cause Im a true livin Casanova
Smooth and stylistic and suave bowler
And they say nasty couldnt even tell it
Cause when Im with girls I get Funkadelic
So ladies stand still as I start to fulfill
Just chill the scenerys about to get ill
The places I feel to give your body a thrill
As I rub you the right way like Johnny Gill
And competition take notes from a champ
You once had this but all your girls broke camp
And now you wanna diss
You swung but you missed
So now tip your hat and bow down to this
Who The father of civilization
With knowledge of self under any situation
The F to the I to the V to the E
The PERCENT
That means an Asiatic king just rocked it
And left your mouth wet with a taste of chocolate
Thats right yall and thats right yall
My rhymes freshen the air like Lysol
Girls uh right there yeah right there
