You looking in the mouth of madness skilled out since I had this
Im talking bout nothing but pure D badness
My acceleration is compatible to a bima
My pockets looking greener from the funky cold medina
Dont tell me bout the things that you done did cause I done did it
Dont tell me bout the skins that you done hit cause I done hit it
And once I rock these with a style thats cock deis
Good God I get the crowd together like knock knees
Now I dont act hard I just mack hard
Baggin video looking honeys with the big back yard
Yes lord girls Im gamin leaving the microphone flamin
Throwing up hiphop signs cause thats the set that I be claimin
Guerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card
Grimies from Fort Green to Malcolm X Boulevard
Now if thats what youre hoping then its the wrong things youre scopin
I may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid Ill get you open
Verse 2
Here comes a taste of the rawness like you never saw this
Once I grip the cordless my victory is flawless
Chaos and havoc lyrically psychopathic
At times get pornographic lord man I gots to have it
Then I commit to hit you with this composite thats ultimate
Too legit splendid come get wit it for your comfort
But then sloppily rappers try to copy me
Take pieces of my property and use it all unproperly
And probably been focusing a while to copy my style
But child what Ill compile is too versatile
Im too superior its sort of like comparing a
Spanking new Desert Eagle to a rusty little derringer
But skip the tool lets try to deal here with the jewel
That Im droppin on you now let me take you all to school
You see to graduate in hiphop you must be smart
And no you dont have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic
Now dig this I drop science but still deal with mathematics
And since I dont be dealing with whats considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass American History
Got my degree in rapology
Hiphop had to set me free look mom a real emcee
So you want yours now well dont get caught with your drawers down
Cause word life this industry is half corrupt just like the Dogg Pound

Verse 3
Rap godfather
Oh goodness gracious you better make it spacious
For the vivacious ostentatious who feel courageous
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
Whatever it takes to see your nerve gone and word born
Black Caesar gonna get his swerve on
My name should be referred to in medical terms
Cause I get way up in the cut and Im talking way worse than germs
You like to chase it playin catch like Tom  Jerry
But on the contrary Id rather sip the Dom Peri
Lay back in harmony because its so bizarre to see
That all the hard core rappers are slowly turning RB
Well pardon me you contradict yoself I see you not perfect yoself
You like that type music yoself stick yoself
What happened to black men of pride nuff men have died
Nowadays whats been applied in hiphop is genocide
Thats when the rappers go get the clappers
Cant you see they trying to strap us just to trap us good god its backwards
One nation under a groove thats how we move
Its time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
When you get done scream Im the one it looks like an illusion
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
Yes mon me got mad flava just like jerk chicken
