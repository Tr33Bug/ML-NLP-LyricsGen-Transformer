Talk about ever meeting Ms Right
Well one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
Theres not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart youre my aphrodisiac
Youve got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know a love like yours would be so hard to find
So Ill just keep on waiting for the day youre mine
Now Ive talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear none appear on your level baby
Maybe its just me imagining
Then again I probably just havent been
With the right female and in detail
Ill probably never will be girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens
I just get skeezed
Baby Im waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know a love like yours would be so hard to find
So Ill just keep on waiting for the day youre mine
The girl that I admire one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together always and forever
For that engagement I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that youre truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
Youve got me waiting for you day by day 
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please dont spoil it
Yeah its a lot that Im asking you to give me
Thats only because I need you with me
Side by side hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it
Ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
Id be the champion of love wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings Im sharing because Im caring
My heartll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that youre my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that Im trying so hard to get through
Is girl Im in love with you


Youve got me waiting for you day by day  Im waiting everyday 
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away  Dreams drifting 
And I know a love like yours would be so hard to find  I know oh so very hard to find 
So Ill just keep on waiting for the day youre mine  Mine mine 
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I cant describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear I will try to reveal
All over and over Ill try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserves the love you can give
So allow me to show you how Im out to live
With something very special palliative and pure
And anything that you want I can give you more
Ill be calm and gentle loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion Im talking devotion
Cause when I get involved I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now I guess Ill be fine
And keep waiting for the day that youll be mine
