See the crowd in an uproar actin unstable
Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
The mic ripper cash flipper Cristal sipper
Derriere batalliere thats French for ass whipper
Long time puttin work in this to be tremendous
If Im not the best then Im a damn strikin resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attackin this enrage to disengage the missin page
To the newest in age thats hittin stage
Now why that be  For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man that make
Rhymes that be so butter my breath smell like Land OLakes
You know the lick see me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean the SAT
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory but heres the Kane story  come on 
Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
Ah man fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do its as if you
Was invisible itll make your life miserable
HipHop icon keep a grip just like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that player hatin out you
Thats the other side of the game and I aint Erykah Badu
Black Caesar dont you even reach my way
You soon to find a vital point thats on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhymin
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen done need alignment
The untouchable dont want to tempt me
I come kickin through your door unlawful entry
It be me even though none of yall want to see me
For real damn I know how Jehovahs Witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Because I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
I turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldnt bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cuttin through split his gut in two
I touch em what him do You know the style aint nothin new
Lets go 


Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky high
Get on down baby we keep it live
Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky high
Get on down baby we keep it live
A good game it lets the plot thicken
But the thing that just aint clickin is the way yall legalize trickin
You talk about your ride when you dont even got one
But I can pull a hot one when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game its like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as Im guttin em black
Closest thing to me would be  whats that  Nothing in fact
I come with more in skill to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance here comes the day of independence
Approach em all with some bad intentions
In other words Im makin em resign
Diminish mine runnin through em like a finish line
Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky high
Get on down baby we keep it live
Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky high
Get on down baby we keep it live
