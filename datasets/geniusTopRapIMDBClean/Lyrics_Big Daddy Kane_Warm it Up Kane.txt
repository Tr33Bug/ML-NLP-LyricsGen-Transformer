Come get some you little bum
I take the cake but you cant get a crumb
From the poetic authentic superior
Ultimate and all that good shit
Im the original Asiatic acrobatic
There you have it now get dramatic
Creatin drama when Im on the scene
And I pack em in mean like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style thats mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble in a rumble just crumble
And Im still calm and humble
You need another helpin hand to swing on
I stand alone but still you gotta bring on
Your Batman and Robin Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch but they still cant face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
Thats for you not to come near period
For I aint buggin or delirious
My swift tongues like a sword thats how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a FisherPrice MC
That thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Singlehanded I aint with that band stuff
Cause Ceell scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage not like a savage
But in my own way of doin damage
As I design the genuine line
Now who flat top rules in 89
Warm it up Kane
Take two of the man with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface but bright as the Cosby Show
Dont attack rappers but make everyone hush
They step to me but cant stop the bum rush
I make material rich and imperial
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old but papas got a brand new bag
So put the mic down boy you cant work it
Due to wack lyrics thats bout to shortcircuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss
No remorse you lost with force I cause a holocaust
First I caught ya then put ya through torture
You moved wrong my son so I taught ya
Just like a guardian now put your body in
The mood to groove with the smooth way that Im partyin
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
And waste the taste cause aint no sugar here
So come near if you dare you Booga Bear
You start hallucinatin like magic
The wrath gets tragic but Kane wont have it
Cause you tried to juice me when youre bluffin
Slowed the pace so I had to start rushin
So pick a BC date cause youre history
Here comes Kane Scoob Scrap Jay and Mister Cee
And this is one thing to us we aint new to
The crewll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
Im the man you cant hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack a vision of blur
Just them thinkin Im competitin I say Huh


Warm it up Kane
Genuine for 89 you know what Im sayin
As I give a shout out to my man Tony A
Tony P Sally Sal and the whole Libra Digital posse
Cant forget my man Yawnski
And Smooth the Barber you know what Im sayin
Also I gotta say whassup to Born True BBoy
And my man big JayZ
The whole rest of the crew Scoob Lover my brother
Scrap Lover and DJ Mister Cee
Cant forget Supreme Abu MelQuan and Shabazz
Wally D and the rest of the brothers
And of course my little brother the Little Daddy Shane
Mandatory end to the story you know what Im sayin
Peace
