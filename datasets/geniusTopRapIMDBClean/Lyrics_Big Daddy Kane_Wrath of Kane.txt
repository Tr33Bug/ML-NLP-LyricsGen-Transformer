The wrath of Kane taking over your circumference
Destroying negativity and suckers that come with
The weak the wack the worse the poor
I thrash bash clash mash and then more
Blow up the scenery I reign supremacy
You need a savior to save ya so lean on me
Im playing rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay I blow away and throw away
So go away cause I dont play
Attacking like a psychopath breaking rappers in half
So feel the wrath
Of Kane
The name is Big Daddy
Here to bring trouble to
The man at hand to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most and boast the loud and proud
The Kanell reign your domain
Yeah Kane 
The heat is on so feel the fire
Come off the empire on a more higher
Level than def one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I can never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let em speed around the board like an Astro
Then send em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking em up breaking em up taking no stuff
But it still aint loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow so I can flow
Now yo
Juice Crews the family Slick Ricks a friend of me
And Doug E Fresh Stet KRS and Public Enemy
Blahzay Blah you know who you are
The red black and green the sun moon and star
Knowledge of self is being taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reaching each
With the speech every leech Ill impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blindll feel the wrath
Of Kane


Marley Marl break it down
Bring it back Cee
Line by line chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose friend or foes
I still dispose and blow em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out
Off the wall and butter soft to yall
So you waited for Kane to come forth to all
Competition that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position you on a mission
So stop lying and trying to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito but still cant complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays so you dine on mine
Instead of fronting and trying to be a friend of
You might as well say guess whos coming to dinner
So just quit submit and forget
Huh you must be on some new improved shit
I get busy from sun to sun
Im only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws bangs or blows
All foes I keep em running like pantyhose
They get soft and tender front and then surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on your class force team or staff
But when Im in effect they feel the wrath
Of Kane
