So out of the mercy of Allah
And the law written in our nature
We call an individual into existence
And when that individual come
I make no apologies for what Im about to say
Rough rugged and real youre on standstill
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
Thats dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Rappers I replace rub out and erase
Competition you must be on freebase
Smoking or choking bound to be broken
Man get your damn hands off the mic that Im choking
Cause I got a stranglehold
Youre still cold on parole for the role you stole
Rhymes that you yell out but you did sell out
Crossedover lost over here now get the hell out
Im not a pop star rocknroller
Im a rebel blessed able to hold a
Mic like a hammer and drop grammar
Treat a rapper like a wrestler and body slam him
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
So just play mute dont even whisper
Open your mouth to speak and Im diss ya
Ragtag and dog put you in the morgue
Because youre petty confetti and not ready to Rock Steady
In other words youre HalfSteppin
Tiptoeing get going because my weapon
Is not a nine an Uzi or a shotgun
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
Long Live the Kane aint a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so dont tell me youre real
We sample beats you sue and try to fight us
tchk Man you still be home with arthritis
If we didnt revive em bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated you wouldnt survive
Youd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand the way that I live
Thats positive and the message I got to give
Its a benefit for you and me
Im talking bout PEACE
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth and they dont chew beef
No pork on my fork strictly fish on my dish
The Kane falling victim tchk Sucker you wish
I flow like water slaughter
Put you out of order floored ya
Rappers are ragging and tagging and snagging and bragging
To be on the bandwagon but Im the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just get back Im Young Gifted and Black
And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sending this out to Divine Force
Cant forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man IceT over on the West Coast
Cant forget Kool Moe Dee Busy Bee MC Lyte the Audio Two
I say Peace
