Yo I got slugs for snitches no love for bitches
Puttin thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow Hell no
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I aint got no hotel dough
Im known for yokin Jacks
And beatin them with smokin gats
Leavin token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightnin
You seen what happened in my last fight friend Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes I leave trails of dead mics
Where Im from niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided crimes are drugrelated
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Sellin pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
Im tellin you shit is about to get drastic soon
Im quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
Its that nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks Im known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most Im leavin niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smokin dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids I kept mad blades
Stabbin teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak cause my techniques great
And Im the nigga police hate in each state
Cause Im the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper fuck around
Youll find my silk boxers in your mothers hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
Im from a wild town
You know my style clown so bow down
Word up  say what 
95 style  yeah 
I got my man JAYZ here  JAYZ 
Check it out now
Check it check it check it out now
Brothers can beg and borrow still feel sorrow
When Jay Z like Zorro get in that ass better luck tomorrow
Im too much nigga so never should you rush
You need slow down or get yo ass tore down
Check it out Im too cocky to stop me you gotta kill me
And when Im gone you can still feel me on the real B
The shit is eternal I rock the heavens well
Even if they wont let me in Heaven I raise hell
Til its Heaven recognize the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga its bad luck to cross me
Im poppin Crystal shootin game like missiles
As projected all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie go back like the oldie
But the goody pullin RB bitches wearin hoodies
They dont be knowin the way I be flowin
When I be goin I be runnin the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things with a swing
And have em rockin like
You say never you run if ever you come
Its never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge
And follow with wisdom
For greater understandin Im landin blows
And knockin sense into those that oppose me
Enticin when slicin through tracks
Youre screamin Jesus Christ hes back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map so give him his dap
And me I just take mine
Gimme those gimme this gimme thatfuck that
You never see me stressed in a GS
On the prize my greedy eyes cant see no less
Jigga incredible even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping extortion and corruption
So you know beatin me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow Im too thorough nigga
I make moves cause bowels to move
When Im creepin through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise I feel no fear when facing yall
Bet your lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcees tryin to be the best
And even in dyin couldnt be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin
Ever since L said Throw three Gs in
And we can get down and split the wealth
Thats when I found I could do it myself I get up
Yeah word life  Big L try that mic out 
Yeah yeah yeah  back to Big L 
Lets get it back to Big L 
Yo one two one two aight
Ill drop one more joint aight check it out

Ayo my crew be deliverin hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin them shits in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
Im so ahead of my time my parents havent met yet
Im feelin like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probly got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and Ima beat your faggotass halfdead
I stomp white cops til they life stops for a low price hops
Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 139 you dont want a block war
Cause my crewll kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC11 bucks
Im killin at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike Im rougher than a fist fight
All chicks aint shit aint no such thing as Ms Right
So we can never be a couple hun
Fuck love All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown MCs I be attackin quick
Im on some rappin shit and some carjackin shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac
And put the gat to his cap clickclack
Sorry Jack but get up out of that
My 38 works great so make a mistake and hesitate
I cant wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didnt listen to what I was speakin he started reachin
So I left him sleepin with his temple leakin
Aight back to my man JAYZ
One time
