Yo my crew is in the house
Terra Herb McGruff Buddah Bless
Big Twan Killa Cam Trooper J and Mike Boogie
And Imma set it like this
Ayo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke
I put chumps to rest fast when my SmithWes blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules I sport jewels and extort crews
Dont get me pissed I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt jerk
So stay alert no smirk cause these knuckles hurt
Im from the alley not the valley
Im hotter than Cali wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Dont hang with jive pals
Adios ghost Im 5 thous
Well Im flav and I was down with the crime wave
Now its time saved yo cause now Im a rhyme slave
In 87 I sold cracks collected some dough stacks
Hold gats a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it his raps are goldplated
This nigga Terra is past butter sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother I leave your rhyme trash gutter
Im more rare the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where its too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck Terra drops the followup
Sour luck niggas gotten props to swallow nuts
For those that dont know yo Im Herb McGruff
Im on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MCs are live but Im mad liver
Ayo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease ate up like rice and peas
Herb can you fight  Yo Im nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L straight from Hell Im the fuck up outta here


Ayo its time to get drastic but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it now I melt the mic like its plastic
I rag crews cause Im bad news
In a mad mood Im servin brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause Im no maricn for poems I slide the hotties home
Heres some advice  Im mad nice
Ayo Im quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fags life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Ayo fuck bribes Im takin niggas lives like a felon
Yo Im bustin chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in the Top 10 is rocked when its locked in
I just abuse the flow dont need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow when I rhyme I just kill your show
I got lines thats deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read braille when they fail dig
Yeah and Im nasty too nasty to trash me bash me
Ayo thats dead so dont ask me
Youd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft I got a pump thats sawedoff
But when I let slugs out you will get rubbed out
For dissin youll come up missin like a cub scout
Rappers be funny like Fletch
Cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines and TECs and never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam  I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the East we leavin at least 20 police deceased
Its the beast on attack so make tracks
I break backs I jack with def gats and black MACs
On Lenox Ave aint no light looks you fight crooks left and right hooks
If you front get your life took
Im havin nailsharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
Im blazin trails from jail cells so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boombyebye Dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys but I call em crackmore valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
Im in a daze and Im so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogies next up and keep my head straight
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like its a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin domes poppin bones
And sendin niggas hoppin home
Word to God its kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if youre comin to see me nigga bring a cast and crutches
And niggas I dont need a gun for you none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And its death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin ass to ash
No need to question am I nice cause its a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC10
And niggas aint half as nice so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife they aint no match for Mike
Now Im bout to skate in a rush just finished makin it tough
Peace to Big L ayo 8 is enuff
True true And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to DWhiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginnin
Whats up to RockNWill from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mae Murda and the BBO Crew
The Best Out Crew the MM Crew
And all the other crews thats representin in Harlem
You know what Im sayin
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew Word up
