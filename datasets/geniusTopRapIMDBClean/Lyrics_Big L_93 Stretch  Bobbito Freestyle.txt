You better flee hops or get your head flown three blocks
L be keepin niggas hearts pumpin like Reeboks
Its the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet
Disrespect and Im a break your fuckin neck
Im known to put a cap in a duck face
I spray guns fuck mace
Im a nutcase from a rough place
Its called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on that assll get stuck clown
I got styles you cant copy bitch
Its the triple six in the mix
Straight from HE double hockey sticks
Im the devils son like my song said
I smash niggas like cornbread
You cant kill me I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and my crew peel caps and carry gats like its luggage
Im nowhere near trash so step to the rear fast
Before I have your queer ass cryin like tear gas
Every day I gain clout and my game sprout
Some niggasll still be virgins if crack never came out
The Big Ls hard to kill when my squad gets ill
You better guard your grill before you get scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
Im crazy quick to knock a duck off
Ill pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
Youll get smoked like a Phillie fast
cause your shit is really trash
Fuck around Ill swing on ya silly ass
Its Big L the crime converter
Sayin peace to all the niggas in jail doin time for murder
I wreck the mic plus the whole stage
Rockin cornrow braids
Im killin muthafuckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Marc Buchanan and North Beach
Im makin rap hits I snap flicks at mack chicks
Just the slim ones you wont see L with no fat bitch
Yo Im the nigga that they call AWOL
Punks I slay all on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin gs from transportin kis on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin like a sensei
Im smoother than Ben Gay
Comprende
Im outtie like MJ
So Herb McGruff
My mellow my nigga
Get on the mic and pull the MC trigger
