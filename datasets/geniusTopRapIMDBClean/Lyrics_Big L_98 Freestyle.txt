Yo fuck all the glamours and glitz I plan to get rich
Im from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And Im all about expandin my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie huntin
Trigger temper Im quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like Im probably frontin
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
Im older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin around yall
Cause niggas like you be prayin on my downfall
Hopin I flop hopin I stop
You probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin the rock
I got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I havent got is more stitches than you
Fuckin punk you aint a leader what Nobody followed you
You was never shit your mother shouldve swallowed you
You on some tagalong flunky yesman shit
Do me a favor  please get off the next man dick
And if you think I cant fuck with whoever put your money up
Put your jewels up no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red Im far from broke got enough bread
And mad hoes ask Beavis I get nothin Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel fuckin chicks is a rule
If my girl think Im loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you actin for
You aint half as raw you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga somethin fore I crack his jaw
You runnin with boys Im runnin with men
Imma be rippin the mics until Im a hundredandten
Have yall niggas like Dammit this nigga done done it again
I throw slugs at idiots no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch eighthundred and fifty rocks
Im makin wonderful figures
I dont fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
Aight let me kick some more shit one more time
Yeahyeah Spit some more   Bobbito
Aight check it out yeah check it out
Yeah check it out yeah check it out
Uhh check it out aight check it out
Aight we gon hit it like this check it out
Yo check it yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit you aint worth stickin
Ive got a left hook that be leavin guys knocked out
Keep frontin and Imma choke you til your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing swing right back
Battle Corleone  why do a stupid thing like that
Yo Im not in the mood son so dont push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight grippin my dick like a pair of pliers
You fuckin snitch  right now you prolly wearin wires
Its not a joke so as soon as he laugh
Imma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heartbroken make him quit rap and start smokin
My album is done so no there aint no parts open
Im not a sweet stud Im a street thug
Thats quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug til he leak blood
You sure soft watched you fall off might slide your whore off
Then call all off and tear your jaw off
My life is far out I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You aint a player put that cigar out
Take that suit off before I shoot off and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloodyred like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of yall niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join I got McGruff with me we puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with  fuck them too Ill buck them too
Be careful what you rush into you lameass nigga
No dough always on the trainass nigga
Canal Street 10karatchainass nigga
You got fucked upstate you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin chicks in the ass when I was sixandahalf
Yo Imma take you out your misery
And after this nigga
Put you in the social studies book cause youre history
