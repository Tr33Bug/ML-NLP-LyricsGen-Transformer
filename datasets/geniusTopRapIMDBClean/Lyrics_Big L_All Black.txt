Yo once again its the Big L that kid who got much props
From killin corrupt cops with motherfuckin buck shots
So dont step to this cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo size too
I was taught wise Im known to extort guys
This aint Cali  its Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good that shit aint even go wood
Im not the type to take sluts out I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out then break the fuck out
Me bein a virgin Thats idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six Gs
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese
Thugs better scat when the gat goes clickclack 
Or Ima have your family dressed in all black
Thugs better scat when the gat goes clickclack 
Or Ima have your family dressed in all black
I steal lives like a stone thief so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn  I got it goin on word is bond
Ducks be gettin thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
Im catchin bodies like a villains supposed to
And I squeeze triggers  not just on niggas but hoes too
So dont try to test me cause I cant stand testers
Fuck around Ill introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears pal
But man youve been rappin for years now
And aint made a hit yet you flop in a split sec
In the showers the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews I come outta wars barely bruised
Im puttin motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the getgo
Leavin fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe


Yo ever since I was young I ripped mics and I killed beats
And Im known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name I got mad fame
Im quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS then Ima start rapin bitches
Im all about makin papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty Gs is what the creep stole
So the next day knocked on his door
And shot his granny through the peephole
Thats the type of shit Im on word is bond
Got it goin on from the break of dawns to the early morn
You know my style Im wild
Comin straight outta Harlem pal
Its Big L the motherfuckin problem child
This goes out to all yall bitchass niggas
So if your mother aint ready for a funeral dont fuck with me
Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I aint talkin bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo Im bout to sign out
But before I go I gotta say peace to the NFL crew
You know who you are
And all yall niggas talkin that gun shit and wont bust a rhyme
Stop fakin the funk
Word Im bout to get up outta here
Yo Im out B Yo peace man I gotta get this money
So all yall niggas on my hit list  get your suits ready Hahahaha
