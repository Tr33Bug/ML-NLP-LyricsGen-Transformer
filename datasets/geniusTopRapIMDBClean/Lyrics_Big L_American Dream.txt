Mm check it yo
Crooked corrupt criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler blowin out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin inhalin the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream weighin tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smoker Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper Ive been a willy for a while nigga
Gruff got hoes the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes drop top Rolls
East coast West coast fiends overdose
Gruff get the cream with my team and Im ghost
This money be temptin me to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen I sold morphine for more green
Kept dope in a Nautica coat under the drawstring
And watched out for cops squad cars and Beemers
And laundry ninas flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach yeah coastin with commuters
Smokin the buddahs on the cruise line boat to Aruba
For a while yo pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo and ship it out whenever I say so
Yo Makin this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether its Uptown Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We aint splittin this cream
Yo Ima run hysterically til they bury me
Count numerically hills of Beverly
More grands than Cherokee president like Eric B and Rakim
Drug game Im top ten locked in right now is not a option
And those who creep got the Mac and the heat
They got the fiveinch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy braggin
Last year had me saggin wasnt ready
When Heavy was back and tossed me in the paddywagon
But aint nobody out here stoppin love
Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club poppin bub
So all the fame without the fortune goddamn you wrong
Killa kid Cameron surviving in the Amazon
Yo I leave you dazed and froze with all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted while bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me Im back to sea sippin daquiris
Coke factory fiends baggin up crack for me from
Cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chubby
All the ladies love me they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my babys ugly
Each night I sleepwith freaks with Lamborghini Jeeps
Neighbours be sneaking peeks
At how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot I cut your collars Juan
Cause these is modern times
And the only thing I see is dollar signs
Yo Makin this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether its Uptown Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We aint splittin this cream
Check it To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every teams dream Big Ls a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know Im crazy quick to smack a groupie
Im known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci  Absolutely 
Harlem kids is known for felonies and sellin keys
Pushin 300Zs GS3s and puffin trees
These Gs breeze while DTs be yellin Freeze
We stash cheese and keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo Im set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain said Act a fool and get slain
Nigga yo bitch chose me you know the rules to the game
Yo Makin this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether its Uptown Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We aint splittin this cream
