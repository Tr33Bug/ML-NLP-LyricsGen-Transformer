Fuck them other cats Im runnin with my own wolfpack
Keep frontin like yous a thug and get your dome pushed back
Cause you dont get down that tough shit you talk is profound
Yous a clown fuck around come Uptown and get found
I keep a pocket full none of you niggas can touch my funds
I dont fight no more all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed Im squeezin MACs bustin off caps
Those coward cats with golden platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies to make CREAM rise
Its all about these green guys front your whole team dies
How Im livin so far swell you cant scar L
Headed a cartel sellin more cakes than Carvel
And Im labeled a kind thug police got my line bugged
Hope I see the grave from old age and not a nine slug
Im quick to bust a mean nut in some teen slut
Big L is cleancut with more jewels than King Tut
