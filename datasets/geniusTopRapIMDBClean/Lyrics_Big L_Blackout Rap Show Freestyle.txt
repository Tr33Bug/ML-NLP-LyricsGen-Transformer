I be puffin blunts in the house hittin stunts on the couch
This year crazy cats gon get punched in they mouth
When your wife see me she dont know how to act
So dont be mad when I blow out her back For real
Your whole crews a buncha poo butts made a few bucks
Jd a few sluts then yall started runnin your lips a little too much
Got chedda to blow pockets never get low
Chickens sweat me wherever I go
Me and OC be in the Lex Cartier specs Nautica sweats
GoreTex with Presidentials on full of baguettes
I done sold coke sold crack sold smoke sold smack
Now I wanna gold plaque can I get a soul clap
Some cats be col wack
You got the lye Well brother roll that
And if it wont get me high then hold that
Imma cop me a six and cruise through the block with your trick
Imma keep droppin them hits it wont stop til Im rich
Any mic I hold in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd dictating shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic
Scolding bringing somatic to this rap shit
Bona fide Mic set you cant see me on it
Master the art so now I just flaunt it
Born to live a life and die but til then
Imma keep on writing slick rhymes with the pen
I take the cherry from a beat like a virgin havin innocent
Bust my nut bring rhyme to life like Genesis
Poetical renaissance endeavors are flawless
Tearing it up when it comes to me picking up this cordless
One of New Yorks finest
On this trip I coincide with Beatminerz
Bringing out the best in me
We formulatin like a recipe
Water and dough we sho nuff
Bestow my presence
Then Im divine like the seven
Keeping it tight cause what I suffice is raw nigga
Its only right
Like that yall
Its like that yall
On the Blackout Rap show with my man Phat Phillie
Check it out uhh
We about to get into a verse like this
Check me out yall
Hmmmmm
Yeah yeah
A couple of years ago before the year ninefo
My cash flow was low I was low on dough
Used to try to talk to fly girls and they was like No
I knew that all of thatd change once I started to blow
Now my pockets are bloated because I exploded
Stay devoted dropped a hot album now Im loaded
I hang with fly stars buy cars for fiftythou
The New York City child thug with a pretty smile
I love this rap game thats why I married it
Its a big load but somebody gots to carry it
At one point I was about to give up
Then got offered a record deal and my eyes lit up
In 1992 boo my dream came true
First I got the fame then the cream came through
Word up I used to rhyme all the time
Whoever thought that slim kid from onethreenined
Shine down the line huh
I used to sell cracks now I sell tracks
Listen up cause when L raps he tell facts
Im the type of cat to lay wack MCs to rest
I was told to work hard to achieve success
Words of wisdom from my father
He said L when things aint going so well
Dont give up try harder
And never be afraid to make mistakes
And dont spend your cash foolishly save your papes
Cause good things come to those who wait they turn
Stay concerned cause its a lotta papes to earn
And help those thats less fortunate than you
And stay true to whatever you do until youre through
Yo uhh
OCs illin I will never ever bore you
OCs illin I will never ever bore you
To rock like I do it takes certain zest
Im truly untouchable like Elliot Ness
See my word and verse is fly One moment tranquil
Then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill
I can rock a party right all night just trust me
Not an MC out there who can touch me
Anywhere I go young ladies they rush me
When Im on the mic no way in hell you can hush me
My mere presence will leave you in awe
And when Im through you too will call me papa
Now is the time to settle this vendetta
Slicin MCs like a Swisscheese shredda
If you dont like Swiss then I cut you like chedda
Thick slow and quick great pain it will inflict
The beats on time and the cuts all click
Elegant never meant I loves to invent
If you heard me say I rock this is what I meant
I dont shriek I speak I could never be weak
I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique
Im shrewd never booed I wear the MC crown
When I step in the place MCs they bow down
Suckas I will smash theyre not fit for the class
Yo when we get on the mic they break out like a rash
Cause my sonic atomic MCs get moronic
Chillin with Big L we like Its bionic
Charismatic emphatic bass has no static
Strungin off the rhyme like a cocaine addict
Nothing but cheers call OC the leader
Def rhyme writer fake MC defeater
Girlfriend said youre sweet but Im sweeter
Ill slay any MC in this rappin arena
Colossal not a fossil MCs are quite docile
Teach what Im preaching you can call me an apostle
Tall not short dog and this is the sport
Im a soldier with the mic and Im guarding my fort
And MCs are no bigger than my big toe
And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhyme just for you my friend
Big L jump on this mic and flow once again
Yo its L the Harlem
Check it out bust it
Yo its L the Harlem pimp baby
For real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And thats ill
Playa hatas be giving me harsh looks
But Im tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
Forget em all
Yo its L the Harlem pimp baby just like I said
Right now Im going off the top of the head
Its me and OC we be lowkey
Chillin in the cribs icedout Roley
Chillin with my man his name is Phat Phillie
