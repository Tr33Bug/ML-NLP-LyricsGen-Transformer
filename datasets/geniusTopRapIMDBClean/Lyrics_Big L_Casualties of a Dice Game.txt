Its Flamboyant yall
Yeah yeah yeah Corleone yall
Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corners crowded niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And Imma gamble until he come back  why not
Clickclack cock the gat back gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed mad cats pockets was fat
They playin ceelo my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack got my bread back jumped in my red Ac
Im waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot and Im far from my block
Finally he walked out told him Hop the fuck in
On my face he saw the grin and said How much did you win
I estimated about 45 maybe 50 Gs
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey Ds
Now Im alone headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones I said Yo son Im on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs bring your big gun
I dont believe this this nigga said he cant make it
Cause some bitch is in his house buttnaked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he dont give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut what
Im cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from and his grimy crimey
Its about to get real hasty
Grabbed the steel took it off safety
Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast then stopped short and made em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too leakin with a deep gash
I aint panicked I was quite calm
Couldnt use the right arm so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him shook my head then started buckin my heat
Its over now cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think Im dyin Im feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help I had to catch a cab first
To onefortyfirst and Bradhurst
Thats where Bones live walked in the buildin staggerin
Lookin tore down shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye he knew he would die
Started to cry stuck the gat to his head and said Why
Then he offered me all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out hes assout then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood about to pass out
The hospitals up a couple of blocks Im on my way but
Damn here comes a couple of cops I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back Im goin all out
I aint holdin back I been to jail once and I aint goin back
I kept shootin one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad and couldnt stop it
But still had the fifty thou profit in my pockets
The coast was clear so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens that means here comes the Jakes
But its too late Im knockin on the pearly gates
Yeah casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah its Corleone yall
Yeah its Flamboyant yall
Big L yall Flamboyant baby yeah
Big L uhh
Big L yeah its Flamboyant yall yeah
