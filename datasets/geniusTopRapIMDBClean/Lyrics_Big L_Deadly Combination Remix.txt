Deadly Combination  Remix  Lyrics
Yes indeed
Its the mix king Ron G
I got somethin the world aint ready for
New York City LA Chicago Atlanta
DC Detroit New Orleans
Yall know the deal Flavor
Hahahahahaha
Yeah nigga yeah
Thats right
Baby
This how we do it
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin to kill me
Picturin pistols spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real
And even if I do conceal my criminal thoughts preoccupied wit keepin steel
See niggas is false sittin in court turned snitches
That used to be real but now they petrified bitches
Im tryin to be strong they sendin armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed my firepower keep me warm
Im trapped in the storm and fuck the world til Im gone
Bitches be warned  word is bond youll get torn
Im bustin on Giuliani he rubbin my niggas wrong
And then its on Before I leave picture me
Im spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it
Niggas dont want it  you can get it bet it
Make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga We dont cater to you hoes
Fuck wit me  have a hunnid muthafuckaz at yo do wit 44s
Hahahahaha
Yeah nigga
Thug Life


Im hard Jehovah said Im barred from the Pearly Gates
Fuck Him I didnt wanna go to Heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees wit my hands gripped
Talkin bout some Praise the Lord shit
Hail Mary  Fuck her I never knew her
Id probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our Father  My pops stuck up dope spots
Big black and mean wit the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin
Uh Im loco bro but aint no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while Im shittin
The lesson from the Smith  Wesson is depressin
Niggas keep stressin the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take
To make my heart stop and my body start to shake
Ron G stop the break
I be that young pretty fly smooth glorious kid
A Bad Boy just like Notorious BIG
A RocAFella like Shawn Carter
Wit more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash armed robber
While yall be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that Im in
Hot rhymin diamonds shinin autograph signin
My lifestyle is far out
Every week  bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh Cause I keep CREAM Im large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream
Yeah yeah Big L Harlems finest
Yeah that nigga who hold it down for Uptown
Hahahaha
Thats how we do it out here on this underground real shit nigga
Its the heat nigga
Now rewind this muthafucka  you know you cant help it
Deadly combination bwoy
