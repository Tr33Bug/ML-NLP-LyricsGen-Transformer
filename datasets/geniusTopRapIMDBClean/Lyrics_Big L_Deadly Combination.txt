Picturin pistols spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts preoccupied wit keepin steel
See niggas is false sittin in court turned snitches
That used to be real but now they petrified bitches
Im tryin to be strong they sendin armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed my firepower keep me warm
Im trapped in the storm and fuck the world til Im gone
