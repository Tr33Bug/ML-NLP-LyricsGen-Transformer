Ayo Showbiz man I had this bugged out dream last night that I was the Devils son B
I was doin some ill shit
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
Im wavin automatic guns at nuns
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
Im wavin automatic guns at nuns
Ls a rebel on a higher level go get the shovel
Cause Im the only son of the motherfuckin Devil
Its a fact Im livin foul black
Niggas should have known I was sick
From the shit I did a while back
Cause bein bad I couldnt stop
When I was in preschool I beat a kid to death with a wooden block
Faggot niggas I was backslappin
I realized that every time I got mad that somethin bad happened
A nigga hit me with a can of beer then he ran in fear
Later they found him hangin from a chandelier
Enemies I be buckin quick
My moms know who I am
Cause she know who she was fuckin with
On my skull the 666 no tricks
When I catch fits my mom picks up the crucifix
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
Im rollin with Satan not Jesus Christ
Enemies I got several done
Big L straight from hell the motherfuckin Devils son
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
Im wavin automatic guns at nuns
Its Big L and Im all about takin funds
Im a stone villain known for killin and rapin nuns
Ayo I even kill handicapped and crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and youll see triple sixes
Theres no doubt Im all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
This kid Joe owed me dough I didnt take his life
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
One nigga cold tried to diss me and that shit is risky
The nigga took a swung but he missed me
So I popped off now the chumps knocked off
I spit in his mothafuckin face and then bopped off
Once a hottie shot me with a shotty
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way Im livin is dead wrong
Im a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Killin is fun Im number one with a gun
Front and get done cause you cant run from the Devils Son
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
Im wavin automatic guns at nuns
The Big L is strictly gunplay
I run through church and pistolwhip the priest every Sunday
Once I put out the crazy order
I sent niggas to kill Tom his mom and his baby daughter
Im livin up to my extortion image
I be stalkin Lennox
Catchin more bodies than abortion clinics
A kid tried to take L out
Shot me in the chest with a TEC
I just laughed and spit the shell out
Next I took his gun then he dropped to his knees with ease
I made him freeze he begged me please not to squeeze
But I aint the type to fuss I just snipe and bust
Click clack bang another nigga bites the dust
Shorts Im takin none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devils Son
Word Big L
The motherfuckin Devils Son is definitely in effect
Givin a shoutout to all the murderers thieves
Armed robbers serial killers psychos lunatics
Crackheads mental patients mental retards
And a special special shoutout to all the niggas with AIDS
Peace
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin Jesus
Im wavin automatic guns at nuns
