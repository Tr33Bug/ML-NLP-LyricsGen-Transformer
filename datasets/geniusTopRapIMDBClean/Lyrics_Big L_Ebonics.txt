Yo pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it
My weed smoke is my lye a key of coke is a pie
When Im lifted Im high with new clothes on Im fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips movies is flicks
Also cribs is homes jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy cigarettes is bones
Ugh a radio is a box a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed you got stuck
If you got shot you got bucked
And if you got doublecrossed you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note a con is an okeydoke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Ima never stop speakin it
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill 
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill 
Yo yo
A burglary is a jook a wolfs a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin of shook
If you caught a felony you caught a F
If you got killed you got left
But if you got the dragon you got bad breath
If you 730 that mean you crazy
Hit me on the hip means page me
Angel dust is sherm if you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
Max mean to relax guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub a victims a mark
A sweatbox is a small club your tickers your heart
Your apartment is your pad your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Ima never stop speakin it
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill 
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill 
The iron horse is the train and champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey thats ugly
If your girl is fine shes a dime a suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine if you in love that mean you blind
Genuine is real a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing bleeding is leaking
Begging is bummin if you nuttin you cummin
Taking orders is sonnin an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotels a telly a cell phones a celly
Jealous is jelly your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L you took a loss to show off mean floss
Uh I know you like the way Im freakin it
I talk with slang and Ima never stop speakin it
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills Im ill 
Speak with criminal slang 
Thats just the way that I talk yo
