Yeah check this shit out
Kool G Rap and my dog Big L
Holdin it didown ya heard
Aiyyo I heard your single you better make a whole new song
If they said that shit is hot then they told you wrong
Clown niggas you aint got a chance at all
Big L Corleone too advanced for yall
I make moves and boss all across the world
So dont be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
I cruise in a GS Lex Cartier specs
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes swingin like the Mets
Throwin the dice and takin all side bets
Never bummy sip rummy get money
When I hit honies she felt the dick in her tummy
On the lelow I see dough from here to Rio
Flamboyant Records C to the EO  what
Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo from the spot to the cellblocks
Hot as hell blocks where shells pop
Where they sell rock to cop the SL drop
Hood bitches in nail shops no good snitches that tell cops
People find bodies in lobbies you can smell shots
Niggas turn stale on the Rock until they bail drop
New York livin got a nigga fourfifth liftin
Send you as a gift to the mortician
If you forfeit livin  my fortune is forbidden
I say it one time before spittin
Then I leave your forehead drippin
I laid low then came back for more bread grippin
More thread flippin
More head from chickens its time to turn the ape loose
Bust out the cage and let the gauge loose
Blow the feathers out of your Northface goose
Its G Rap comin back with a click of brave troops
Have yall niggas runnin for homebase like Babe Ruth
Have you holdin holes in your body like you play flute
Lay you down til you get found up in the sprayed Coupe
Prepare for the takeover  give you the face makeover
The seedier row and sheet draped over
Be found on the block with the street taped over
Or comin out of deep coma your speech made slower
Corona Queens shakedown Im comin with the nickelplate pound
To trade rounds with all you fake clowns get down in the unsafe town
Lacin it down black guerilla fams kid we takin the crown
Ya heard


Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo  all of yall weak people fall back
G Rap and Big L we all that
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin big holes with small gats
Have em all fallin where the wall at
Yo Kool G Rap holdin it down with the hazardous Big L
Know what I mean echoes
