Yo on the scene is the brother thats big Im not a little kid
Im a nig who dont dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they aint nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the 38s cocked 2 deep up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights and thats trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop or Imma stop em by any means
The Big L wont hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
Cause justice means just us white kids
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
Im about to flip cause Im fed up with that bullshit
Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up  Aw shit 
Whether its the hot warm cool or the cold season
Pigs be fuckin with a nigga for no reason
Youre just gettin home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up and thats fucked up
This every day not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or youll be layin in a pine box
Bad enough they got 38s now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
Im not only fed up with the cops
Im also fed up with them punkass cab drivers who dont stop
They dont care if its snowin
First they slow down then they see your skin is brown then they keep goin
Cause I wasnt white the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip the trigger I pull quick
Cause Im fed up with that bullshit


Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up with that bullshit  bullshit 
Im fed up  Aw shit
