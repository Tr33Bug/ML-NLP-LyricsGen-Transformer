Big L Corleone
My nigga CTown my big brother Big Lee holdin it down
Flamboyant baby for life
We takin over  No doubt 
Comin to a theater near you
Check it out come on check it
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
Better watch me round your girl if you aint fuckin her right
You damn playa haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Yo the spotlight is mine it aint his no more
When Lee come home niggas cant live no more
And Im straight keep a Harlem World mindstate
I never lounge where you find Jake
Surprise niggas like a blind date L rhyme great
And Imma increase the crime rate for old times sake
Run with me and Imma make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs we go straight to the bar
Leave em empty I cruise through Harlem in a M3
Never pay for parties say my name and Im in free
Im on some 100G car shit superstar shit
Sellin niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
Im dumb hot Ill wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cocked represent one block
139 nigga the Danger Zone
We quick to put a bullet in a strangers dome
Im known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo Im out I done took up enough time
We out no doubt
You know how we do
Flamboyant for life
Big L Corleone
A smooth kid thatll run up in your baby mother
Big L for real
Corleone is too advanced for yall
Big L Im a pimpedout nigga for real
Big L Corleone is too advanced for yall
Yo its Corleone and Queens Most
We bust til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go we must bring toast
Forever poppin the chrome always droppin a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how Im gonna give it to you Big L style
They brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
So pal back up a bit give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World not Melrose Place
So Imma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Yall niggas better stop frontin cause I might get vexed
And Imma run up on yall and slice yours necks
With the machete pockets heavy slang more cane than Eddie
I represent unotresnueve
Time is money so I stay late
Im quick to slide a playmate bust off like a treeight then vacate
