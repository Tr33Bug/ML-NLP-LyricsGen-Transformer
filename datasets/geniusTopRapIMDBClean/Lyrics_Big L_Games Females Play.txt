Aiyyo whats up This is Big L know what Im sayin
Callin to see how that joint know what Im sayin came out
Aiyyo fellas keep a eye open watch out
Cause females be playin a whole lot of games like these
Aiyyo fellas you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some dont play fair
You might get caught out there if you not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke shes shady
You got cash Shes ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death well dressed in Chanel Guess nothin less
Body got more curves than a S I smoked the boots like cess
And I confess the sex was the best  Yes 
Within a week she had keys to my rest
I done made her my main squeeze and gave her Gs to invest
Then one day I overheard her talkin to friends
Sayin how she didnt like me all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinkin she was wifey
Trickin ridiculous givin her jewels that was icey
I said Its over and what I gave you you can have that
It wasnt even her  it was myself I was mad at
Lettin that dame use me for my name and my fame
Thats lame but its a shame how I fell for the game
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name she replied Monique
Soft and sweet from her head to feet hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat lets go get somethin to eat
She said I was that RocaFella shed been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night she said she wasnt a freak
Yeah right Its all good so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home and said Tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin shes pregnant with my child I think thats quite foul
How is that I wore a Lifestyle
So watch out fellas watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah you better watch out
Watch out fellas you better watch out
For real
