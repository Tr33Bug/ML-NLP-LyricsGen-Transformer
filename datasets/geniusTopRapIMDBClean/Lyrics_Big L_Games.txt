Yeah yeah watch us turn it up for yall
Tight broads watchin
The Guru the great Dat X and Big L
Flamboyant for life
Check it a year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name she replied Monique
Soft and sweet from her head to feet hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat lets go get something to eat
She said I was that RocaFella shed been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night she said she wasnt a freak
Yeah right its all good so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doing our thang
I drove her home and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming shes pregnant with my child I think thats quite foul
How is that I wore a Lifestyle
Aiyyo fellas you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some dont play fair
You might get caught out there if youre not aware

Im in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol slick shit that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell how you gon fuck my man L
Like we dont cross paths in these New York streets
But thats good cause hes my man and we both shine
And to say we dont love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted
Things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it think back on how we dissed it
Now we twofisted she aint never resisted
Left it red and blistered shakin
I could slam it if it wasnt NO money makin

Word up Games
These girls nowadays they play many
Techniques for getting your loot they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick just for some ice and shit
In the beginning theyre polite actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushing your Land
When she got you  she goes and fucks your man
Understand you gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud theyll set you up Baby Pah
Somell try to get you stuck up somell fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough and the fame basically
Yo you cant make a ho a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick  could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefing over these honeys
Not me I keep it moving they aint getting jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon stay Flamboyant
