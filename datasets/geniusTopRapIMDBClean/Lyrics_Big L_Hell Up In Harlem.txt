I walk around with six thou sippin on Cristal
My whole clicks wild Im rich pal no more sticks Im makin hits now
What I recite you takin hours to write
So if you bite just tell your man what kind of flowers you like
Im about as ridiculous as bankrolls clothes and hostin shows Smokin foes and strokin hoes in the Poconos
I roll wit intruders looters and sharp shooters
Who spark Buddhas and fuck thick bitches wit large hooters
I grew up in the slums of greed
Known for Drawin guns with speed or
Sellin tons a weed cuz I got sons to feed
Harlems where the thugs rest in the slug fest
We sendin faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
I only roll wit big willie ass niggas
So motherfuck all them little silly ass niggas
I chew punks like chew sticks known for droppin new hits
I know you want me ho if I was you Id want me too bitch
L is that nigga you expect to catch wreck on any cassette deck
Im so ahead of my time my parents havent met yet
So Herb McGruff my mellow my man
Word up get on the mic and do the best you can
Yo its me livin in the lap of luxury
Never ending funds my niggas got the guns
Hons wigglin shakin they buns
Thats how it runs money makin in tons
Mansion swimmin pool you know the rules
Champagne and brews flossin my jewels
City zone mad game like pretty Tone
357 chrome to your dome
Hard as stone all Gruff cars got phones
Like Mob style smoking cigars and bones
Who be that Hundred dollar bills crispy
Versace suit slightly out to blaze and   
Gator morry sliding through the party mad pissy
Champagne cooler filled wit Mo Don and Cristy
Eyes low from the dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low what the fuck we buy mo
Im universal girls love Herbs style
Every now and then mix my herb wit Tical
I run wit real niggas who live life foul
My clans off the hook yall soft and shook
Now look we never talk lives get took
Straight up crook Gruff can never live by the book
Yeah and ya dont stop

So I change my ways start carryin the Quran
Follow the man that they call Louis Farrakhan
Soon as I stop dealin drugs is a career
A thug appeared hit me wit a slug from the rear
