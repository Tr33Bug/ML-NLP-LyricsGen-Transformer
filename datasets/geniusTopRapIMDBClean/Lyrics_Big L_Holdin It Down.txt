Yea yeah Flamboyant Entertainment
Big L
Yo yall fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send em home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone Im rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 PM
Pockets crazy slim jumped out the grey BM
Went to the ATM took a thou out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club knocked some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now Im thinkin which chick number I could dial out
Cause its L the Harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks
But Im tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
So F em all when its cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Megaice is what Im heavy on
If it aint Cristal boo I guess its Perignon
If the nanas too tight I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mill burst
Ive been off the scene over three years and cats is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that wanna battle  get a deal first
I sport the bulletproof fitted hat
That attitude  you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon get it at
What I stay strapped I go to sleep with my steel
Makin figures while you broke cats is keepin it real
L is raps most livest cat Im gettin stacks
While you askin people Do you want fries with that
I rob fags in the staircase no mask barefaced
The one police wouldnt dare chase
Keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes No way pal
Word up  my money longer than the OJ trial
Harlem World keep holdin it downnnnn
Big L Be The Long overdue  Big L 
Do you still got it got it  Its so amazin 
Yeah yeah yeah Harlem World keep holdin it down for Big L
Nigga long overdue  niggas wanna know
Do you still got it got it  Its so amazin 
Stan Spit yo uh
Yo what the hell yall can tell Spit Not shit
I did a flick and bounced on Ls shit
Well shit expect me to go platinum
Thats the only reason why Im rappin
And since L passed niggas expect me to make it happen
With no release date I sell in each state
Im the type to drive to Philly for a cheesesteak
So what Im a Harlem king doin my thing
My name ring  chains and dames what the fame bring
After platinum its the same thing
And niggasll never learn
Til I pull the steel and make they lover burn
You dont get another turn games over
Heres my flamethrower
Rearrange your Rover Harlem soldier
Wait til I get older  and we wont stop
I thought Mase told ya
Nigga Stan he do what he gotta
And these haters cant do me nada
Be in Nevada with a lot of enchilada


Harlem World keep holdin it downnnnn
Big L Be The Long overdue  Big L

Yo yo move the fuck back
A bring the heat when I touch tracks
These niggas beef then wanna chill Fuck that
These rap niggas with the mills we deduct that
I asked all my ghetto cats where my love at
Now where the brews and the drugs at
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Puff with the dread cause I puff black
High til I die and you can trust that
All I wanna know  is the club packed
I see the haters sweatin shorty but I dug that
She put my nut sack back where her lungs at  little ho
And them niggas who owe give up that
Huh its me and Corle like Eddie and Nolte
Go head and provoke me
