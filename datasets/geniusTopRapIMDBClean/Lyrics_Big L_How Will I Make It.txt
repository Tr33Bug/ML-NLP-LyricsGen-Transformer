Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them and never will
Im only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
And how will I make it I wont thats how
I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it I wont thats how
Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it I wont thats how
I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it I wont thats how
Five years passed by now Im at the age of 15
No more fun and games its time to get cream
Cause Im about to burst its like my life was cursed
I went to church prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep now I can eat
Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiyo I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again
I hope I dont get snatched by the beast again
But its getting crazy hectic cause Im broke get up naked
And cant get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I cant get a fair shot
I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
Word up man its real rough out here man
In the ghetto all you can wish for is a better tomorrow
It aint getting no better its only getting worse word up
