There are too many MCs who are overrated
You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
So give it up become a actor or a actress
Or a producer cause you fail to use the
Mic right so take flight fore I bruise ya
For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
Ayo Im serious Big L aint playin games
I should get foul and buckwild and start sayin names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
Goin platinum and dont have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
I dont like the way its goin down
Because it should be the other way around
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
MCs  whats goin on
I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
One minute youre hardcore and raw
Thats what you was known for but not no more
You changed you rearranged youre not the same
Your raps are plain that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that Nobodys but your own black
Used to make phat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
So MCs dont ever step out your range
Remain the same and only change with the time
Or else youll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like Im goin for mine
But if youre rough stay rough
If youre dap stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads


I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
This is how it should be done
Im not the one and my raps are strong like rum
But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb plus slum
How come  Rap skills  they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin you speaks weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack and you went on tour with that crap
Dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes  they dont write theirs
But still call themselves MCs
Please how could that be
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
