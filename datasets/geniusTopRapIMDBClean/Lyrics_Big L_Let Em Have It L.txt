Settin it off lettin it off  whatever   x4 
Let em have it L  What
Give it to em L  Yeah  x3 
Let em have it L  What
Let em have it 
Ayo Im serious Im not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
Im cool as a light breeze Im playin rappers out like striped Lees
Im smoother than velvet my lyrics are wellwrit
You sayin Ls this and Ls thatget off L dick
I dont roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now hes in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo Im the brother that you never even thought of beatin
Black white or Puerto Rican Im gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up give me two thumbs up
Settin it off lettin it off  whatever   x4 
Let em have it L  What
Give it to em L  Yeah  x3 
Let em have it L  What
Let em have it 
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
Its all about me yo its a B I G L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldnt kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause Im a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
Im naughty and stop callin me shorty my names L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MCs be talkin about breakin jaws when they couldnt break a promise
With Big L you cant swing long
So get behind me and sing cause every hero got a theme song
Settin it off lettin it off  whatever   x4 
Let em have it L  What
Give it to em L  Yeah  x3 
Let em have it L  What
Let em have it 


The Big Ls back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact black Im puttin Harlem on the map
Wassup cause Im a stiggy star
Breakin em up and then takin they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin the microphones apart
Im undefeated thats the stone truth
Cause battlin me is like fightin a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didnt last I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass  boom 
I make a lot of dough Im quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go
When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy
Cause Im a rough rugged gangsta not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L
Settin it off lettin it off  whatever   x4 
Let em have it L  What
Give it to em L  Yeah  x3 
Let em have it L  What
Let em have it
