I be that playa with the big street buzz who all the freaks love
Braided hair light moustache a little peach fuzz
That slim guy all my life been fly
Representin onethreenine Harlem World NY
Yeah
Yo I was destined to be a star honey
Plus I rock jewels that cost car money
And cats like you never got rocks on
Rappin bout Roleys and got a Swatch on
Playa hatas dont wanna see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Huh  You know 
How cool can one MC be
Yall still envy me cause Im MVP
Cruise through Harlem in a bulletproof MPV
Man you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
Word
My style is rough like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick ugly bitches get the wrong number
I stay droppin like April showers
Give me BETs address so I can send Rachel flowers
And Im rap most livest cat
Gettin stacks while you asking niggas Do you want fries with that
Try to tax me and watch the nine mil burst
Ive been off the scene over two years and yall still thrist
To hear L drop a ill verse
And all you unsigned rappers that wanna battle get a deal first
Im quick to smoke an ounce with my thugs
This be that party shit that make you bounce in the clubs
I defeat creeps with techniques on elite beats
Always front row never sittin in the cheap seats
Boo I got too much cash for that
I never date rape I get too much ass for that
And do I walk around the streets broke
No way pal
Word up my money longer than the OJ trial
Yo my Harlem World playas yall can shine with me
Got my own label now so yall can sign with me
Yall can take it from the bottom and climb with me
Its fine with me thats how it was designed to be
Im in charge of all
Just threw a party at the Taj Mahal
Cause The Mirage is small
We gonna build like construction real hot production
No playa hatin just congratulatin
And Im known to taste a chick
Take her to my Harlem hideout and lace her quick
And believe me I know the right place to lick
As long as I got a face yall got a place to sit
Im a true Don from here to Huston
Strong like a Yukon
No more jelly strictly Grey Poupon
Pretty ladies wanna see L
Fellas wanna be L
If I go to jail youll wear shirts saying Free L
