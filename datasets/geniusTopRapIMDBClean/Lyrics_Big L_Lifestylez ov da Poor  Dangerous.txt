Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different
They dont give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin 
My name is L and Im from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave theres a big park
And if youre soft dont go through it when it gets dark
Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
Theyre sneakier than alley cats
Thats why I carry gats
Yo Im a muthafuckin fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me its all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 5050
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because Im all about ends and skins
When you got those you dont need no muthafuckin friends
If I catch you on a late night black youre getting stuck jack
My moms told me to get a job fuck that
Ayo picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob selling corn on the cob
Yo how the hell Imma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man Id rather do another hit
I want clean clothes mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo I admit Im a sucker
A low down dirty sneaky doublecrossin connivin muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasnt poor I was po  I couldnt afford the or
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene took his brand new ring
Cause sticking ups an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beatup ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him Give up the dough before you get smoked
Oh youre broke gunshots
Now youre dead broke
The Big L was called crazy
A topnotch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I dont care Ill do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck cause I dont give a fuck
Some say Im ruthless some say Im grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
Cause I was livin the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
Word
All of us from Harlem
139
Thats living the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
KnawhatImsayin
This goes out
To my brothers
Big Lee and Don Ice
Reggie Reg TC Todd Lou Black Tone
Whitey Ty Speeder Ru Dog Herb McGruff
EJet G Love Doc Ring Slice and Rich Dice
I cant forget the 140 Lennox Ave crew
And I gotta say rest in peace to Mate the Skate Dog
And my man Kerry peace
Now what kinda life is that for a child
Now what kinda life is that for a child
Now what kinda life is that for a child
Now what kinda life is that for a fucking child
Word to mother fuck all that stupid shit
Controversial not commercial nigga
