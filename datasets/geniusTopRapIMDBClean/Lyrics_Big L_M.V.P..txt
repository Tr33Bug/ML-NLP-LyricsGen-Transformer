MVP Lyrics
Ayo spark up the Phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip fore your ass is out
In a street brawl I strike men quicker than lightnin
You seen what happened in my last fight friend Aight then
Ls a clever threat a lyricist who never sweat
Comparin yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolet
And clown rappers Im bound to slay
Im sayin hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah Cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw em they come back
Im comin straight out the NYC
Im down with Diggin In The Crates and Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Ayo if rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Yo its a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJs who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the mans back with a dance track
So heres your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time Im jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flyin saucers
No more iron horses cause Im buyin Porsches
Comin straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Yo if rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Battles I lose none I make crews run I get fools done
Got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly leave you smelly then take your Pelle Pelle
Im the neighborhood lamper punani vamper
Mess around youll find my silk boxers in your Mommys hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
Im like Heav  I got nothin but love for you honey
And since Im lookin slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my  Chill 
Im comin straight out the NYC
Raps my JOB and Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Yo if rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
