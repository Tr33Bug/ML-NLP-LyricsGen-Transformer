Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick mad chicks be on a brother tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
All the hoes gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets  thats what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich then them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
Cause if you broke  youll get a whack slut
If you got dough  you get a hoe with a fat butt
With fresh gear long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losin all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and outta luck
Then she takes off and breaks off your hoes gone
So long dear Im outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings okay
But when you broke you gets no play
If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
And if you dont got money you wont scoop a honey
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass
And if youre not clockin loot you wont be knockin no boots
Girls in the 90s aint nothin but crooks
Its all about whats in your pockets not how you look
Thats why you cant talk to just any whore
Leavin brothers for the next man cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always askin for a dollar
And if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be your best friends
Yeah As long as you collect ends
You think shes all yours
But as soon as your dough go your hoe go now you solo
But when you was makin papes sellin jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin em to the movies every weekend
Now that youre dead broke the girls stopped speakin
Cause nowadays girls want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big
Cause when you on top everythings okay
But when you broke you gets no play
I tell it how it is cause Im a bold figure
And I hate a moneyhungry girl AKA gold digger
It aint even funny
Some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money
Im lookin nothin like your poppa
I wouldnt give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why Im so fly
A girl asked me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz Imma break it down like this
Its like that yall and thats a fact yall
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack yall
Its Big L yall Im livin swell yall
I do my thing thats why my name ring bells yall
If you dont got endz girls be frontin
If you dont got endz they aint givin up nothin
If you dont got endz all the girls ignore you
If you dont got endz they act like they never saw you
If you dont got endz if you dont got endz if you dont got endz
