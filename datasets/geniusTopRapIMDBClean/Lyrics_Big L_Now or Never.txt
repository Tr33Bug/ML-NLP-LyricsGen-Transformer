Its time to make power moves and get the chedda
And buy the real nice things that makes life better
No foolish acts moves must be clever
Im down for whatever
I gotta blow son its now or never
I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin on hot corners that be smothered with cops
I must warn  my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond we leave mics torn
Yall brothers slept too long now its on
L Corleone will never flop my records are forever hot
Front on me  you better not
I keep the Beretta cocked
This goes out to my peoples Uptown
Downtown midtown across town and outta town
You see me flossin often at all the club sites
At the bars buyin Cristals like they Bud Lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces get the digits chicken heads get the wrong number
Yo I announce facts when I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot got a spot on every block
Honeys thats very hot get slid to the Marriott
95 was a beautiful year for L
Now Im back and all the ladies still cheer for L
Whatever I write is gonna be tight
Cause if makin hits is wrong I dont wanna be right
Nevertheless the East is were my crew rest
We bust caps that go through vests
We only do what we do best
And thats cripplin you brittle men
Since you wanna play rough then say hello to my little friend
I like droptops when its hot I like Lands when its snowy
Bank account is Fat like Joey
Im not very religious you wouldnt call me holy
Sometimes my hairs cornrowed sometimes its froy
Spark up the youknowwhat pop the Moy
L stay flossin Presidential Rolly
Yall brothers know me I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eye winks as I buy drinks
And every girl I got looks like a model
If you ever see me with a chicken then she mustve hit the lotto
Uptown is my home and where I roam
I stand alone Big L Corleone got it sewn
Sellin weight in and outta state to generate cake
The one jakes hate got homicide runnin out of yellow tape
I pack toast with infrared scopes I turn crews to dead folks
If yall fellas is playas Im the head coach


Word up son its time to blow
Stack that dough create a better life for me and my fam nahmean
I done seen the ghetto all my life its time I see somethin different
Haha yeah get the picture The Big Picture
