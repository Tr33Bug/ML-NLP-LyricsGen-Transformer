The game is called rap
Other MCs aint got a chance at all

Yo Im straight loco to hell with you and your broke ho
You aint a big dog you more like Toto you got no dough
I smoke dro mixed with coco strong as bolo

Antihomo thats a nono so fuck popo
I push the sevenfooh and not the Volvo
CTown push the sixohoh Im with a bitch or Im dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While yall buck for legs I buck for heads
I even buck celebs nigga fuck the feds
My underground niggas yall can shine with me
Got my own label now so yall can sign with me
Yall can take me from the bottom and climb with me
Thats fine with me thats how it was designed to be
Gats we bust backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
Cause half of you niggas thats rappin now is wack to us
Gats we bust backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
Cause half of you niggas thats rappin now is wack to us
And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game block they shot at the rim
That aint in you  the fuck you gon possibly win
I do it Booty Calls on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip make cream just like Ready Whip
Heavy with styles thats the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasiers Im the bodacious
Body parts are big and like Schwarzeneggers
Smokin Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you block the cash we lockin ass
Ima put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I dont mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now  exhibit styles I kick with it
Pardon me but Im fucking sick with it
Ayo gats we bust  backs we crush 
Only hot tracks we lust  and crazy stacks we clutch 
And we need plaques to touch  that say platinum plus 
Cause half of you niggas thats rappin now  is wack to us 
Ayo gats we bust  backs we crush 
Only hot tracks we lust  and crazy stacks we clutch 
And we need plaques to touch  that say platinum plus 
Cause half of you niggas thats rappin now  is wack to us
