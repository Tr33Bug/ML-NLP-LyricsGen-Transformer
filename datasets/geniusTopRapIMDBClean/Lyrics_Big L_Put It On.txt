Hey hey hey
Come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on
Ayo you better flee hops or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers hearts pumpin like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothersd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM and yo guns go pow pow
Im known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin nookie Im not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
Im never hittin dirty chicks
Got thirtyfive bodies buddy dont make it thirtysix
Step to this youre good as gone
Word is born I leave mics torn when I put it on
So put it on Big L put it on
Come on put it onnn and onnn and onnn
Come on put it on Big L put it on
Come on put it on represent put it on come on
Nobody can take nothin from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
Im known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
You dont know  you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother and Im a lady lover
A smooth kid thatll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz Im known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause Im a money getter also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me Haha yous a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows wouldnt be clever to miss
Im leavin competitors pissed
To tell you the truth it gets no better than this

Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean Ill see you when I get there
And its a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
Im puttin rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hangin in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You cant kill me I was born dead
And Im known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My raps steady slammin I keep a heavy cannon
