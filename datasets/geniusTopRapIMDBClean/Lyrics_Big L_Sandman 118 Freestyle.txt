Aiyo check it out 12 12
Its the Big motherfucking L and Im bout to catch wreck on this Dirtman shit
Yo check it out
This is that Sandman 118 shit
And its the BIG L straight from 139 in fucking Lenox Harlem the Danger Zone
I gotta represent it somebody gotta do it
You know what Im saying
Aiyo I got a new single out its called MVP the Most Valuable Poet you know what Im saying
Cause Im the most valuable poet when it comes to this shit and Ima prove it right now check it out
My clique is quick to put a bullet in a strangers dome
You shoulda known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest in a slug fest
We sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums of greed known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed cause I got sons to feed
And its a must that my toast smokes Im not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties I carry ghostnotes
And its a must that I commence to slaying
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
Imma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli like a wooley
I keep a tooly for any moolie who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L to hell is where Imma send em
After I skin em and spit some venom in em
I run with intruders looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddahs and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Yo Im the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
When I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends like there he go
Never had rules to follow none of my jewels are hollow
Try to tax mines and youll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out with suicidal thoughts
All my life Ive been a lady bruiser a wrong chooser
School refuser drug abuser born loser
Clothes bummy nose runny it wasnt funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
Imma hit the mainstream with ill raps thats poison like gangrene
Im better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
Im not a coward and fronting on me I wont allow it
Im high powered fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front and get your belly torn I keep a Pelle on
Im fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Prignon
On the ave I pump rocks quick to give a chump knots
You aint tough the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick ugly bitches get the wrong number
