Ay yo hookie is a game that a fool plays
Im sitting here reminiscing about my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
Scoop the chick stupid prick get the digits and the address
Yo they was jocking cause I was clockin fast cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thang let me explain
I hit em up get em up and put em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses I cut the whack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat  hey 
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was macking females in my school days
Yes yes yall  here we go here we go 
Ay yo the school I went to a whole bunch rhymed
Thats why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain whack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you couldnt hear the bell ring
One of us froze then dozed to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
Thats why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left emcees and they whole crew phased
Yea thats how I did it in my school days
When I first got inside high school I wasnt known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman in other words a new jack
When you mentioned Big L brothers was like Whos that
Then I made the master plan now I got a batch of fans
So when you mention my name now Oh thats my man
You see how its all about me now
All the girls scream Ow whenever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me cant do a thing to me
I used to move alone now my crews fat
I went from a new jack to a new mack thats true black
Im cutting rappers like souffls I came off like toupes
Yea thats how I did it in my school days
