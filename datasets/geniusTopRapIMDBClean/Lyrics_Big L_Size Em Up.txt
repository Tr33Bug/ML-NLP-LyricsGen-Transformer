Hey yo the streets love me man
And I love the streets
So I know ya aint think I was comin with some fruitcake shit
Yall know me better than that
Ayo I shoulda been out
Im deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin Ima try yo chin out
I knocked a lot of men out
I left em on the floor spittin phlegm out
Its either that or Ima squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone ice spinnin jigged out white linen
And if a bitch dont like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin
Dont be mad cause yo careers in the ninth innin
Its over now nigga leave the game
Im from the danger zone where emcees get slain
Where thugsll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace its all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washingtons face
A lot of cats be frontin
Mad singles wit a fifty on top
L tryin to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac cause they really were hot
Rap game heavy hitters its a shame they no longer wit us
Niggas wanna be L ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail youll wear a shirt sayin Free L
What Word up man them niggas is hungry
They ready to bite a nigga arm off
All my wolves in the house are you live or what
See Harlem bout to get it all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine who gon rise wit us
And the first cat who act we gon size em up
All my wolves in the house are you live or what
See Harlem bout to get it all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine who gon rise wit us
And the first cat who act we gon size em up
Ayo I hear a lot of bitch in your talk
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Time is runnin out
Niggas likeL when you comin out
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wifes missin Im the nigga she was last seen wit
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A buncha niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit dime hoes who stuff the coke in they ass
Crazy beefs got provoked in the past lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd Ima never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
Now Im icey I aint gotta say one word you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit hate to be around that shit
You dont know me just say whats up gimme a pound thats it
When I was at the steak house pullin cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin take out
How you make out you took the fake route you oughta break out
You couldnt get a bitch before you put your tape out
What Yeah fuckin punks
Niggas like you will get robbed everyday


All my wolves in the house are you live or what
See Harlem bout to get it all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine who gon rise wit us
And the first cat who act we gon size em up
All my wolves in the house are you live or what
See Harlem bout to get it all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine who gon rise wit us
And the first cat who act we gon size em up
