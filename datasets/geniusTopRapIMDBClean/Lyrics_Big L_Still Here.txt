I be a Harlem World party pleaser
You might find me on 139 sippin a Bacardi Breezer
Thats where I rest at killin tracks is what Im best at
Jealousy I expect that I dont stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on that I can scheme on
Treat her nice take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the US Im seen on
It aint all about me Im tryin to put my team on
Because its good to have a crew to lean on mics I fiend on
You think you can do it like this Dream on
Ima chrome my rims and ice my chain
Fly clothes and pretty hoes is the price of fame
Yo you know the game plan
CTown thats my main man
We never bring luggage we go shoppin when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
Lll make ya dame swallow
Your ice dont shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin about L so dont doubt L
Whats this motherfuckin rap game without L
Yo thats like jewels without ice
Thats like china without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label Im with
DJ scratches
Big L
Yall know the name
Hes still here
Ha ha youse a funny nigga
Play this yeah yall
Play this yeah yall
Big L
Yall know the name
Hes still here
My nigga Big L yeah yall


Im straight loco to hell with you and your broke ho
You aint a big dog you more like Toto you got no dough
I smoke dro mixed with cocoa strong as bolo
I pack a fofo platinum roro
Antihomo thats a nono so fuck popo
I push the sevenfooh and not the Volvo
CTown push the sixohoh Im with a bitch on dolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While yall buck for legs I buck for heads
I even buck celebs nigga fuck the feds
I stay sweatin out a bitch perm
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
I watched Corleone do it now its Chris turn
A Hoodlum like Fishburne
Act illy get smacked silly with the macmilli
You see me on MTV and Rap City
Keep frontin Imma step out mask on with the tec out
Squeeze shots and make you check out
DJ scratches
Big L
Yall know the name
Hes still here
yeah yall
Big L
My underground niggas yall can shine with me
Got my own label now so yall can sign with me
Yall can take me from the bottom and climb with me
Thats fine with me thats how it was designed to be
I be that young teen with DUMB cream
I refuse to be unheard or unseen I shine like the sunbeam
All you niggas better come clean before my gun scream
Raps a fun thing only roll with one team
Flamboyant Entertainment thats who I came with
I pack a nine and once I aim it I got to flame it
Push a blue eight got props from here to Kuwait
And while your crew hate you hear me on Big L new tape
They call me CTown I snatch mics like a rebound
Pack a threepound thats my prerog like B Brown
I rip shows in large arenas like the Garden or Meadowlands
Got nuttin but love for all my ghetto fans
On 139 and Lenox eyes get shut
The Danger Zone is where pies get cut where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon size you up
Like Corleonell grab the chrome and throw five in your gut
Aiyyo gats we bust  backs we crush 
Only hot tracks we lust  crazy stacks we clutch 
And we need plaques to touch  that say platinum plus 
Cause half of you niggas thats rappin now  is wack to us 
DJ scratches
Big L
Yall know the name
Hes still here
Yall thought this was over with
This aint over with
