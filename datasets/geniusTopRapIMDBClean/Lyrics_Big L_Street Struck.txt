A come on
Yeah its the Big L
Coming at you once again in ninefive
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown and everywhere
Check it
Yo where Im from it aint cookies and cream
Theres a lot of peer pressure growin up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends theyd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin to school theyd rather sell drugs
Its best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because its gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners actin stupid gettin lifted
Their life is twisted and most of them are quite gifted
In other words they got talent
But theyd rather sell cracks and bust gats
And run the streets actin violent
To them its all about hittin skins and makin some easy green
Cause thats all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin a sweet nut
They dont give a  What  cause theyre street struck
You better listen to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
Before the rap contract I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a Mac I was into all of that
I started rappin and got nice as hell
If it wasnt for this I might be doin life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling caine
If thats what you gotta do to maintain go head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot own a house and nine cars
What good is that if youre dead or behind bars
Ayo its not even funny
Ive seen a lot of my peers give up their careers
For some fast money
They couldve been boxers ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo they used to be legit kids now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave em up cause theyre street struck
You better listen to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time Im in the crib writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up I try to leave the streets alone
But its crazy hard kid in other words its spooky
The streets be callin me like the crack be callin Pookie
It aint a dumb joke listen to this young folk
Cause where Im from you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed from bein street struck
You better listen to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
Cause being street struckll get you nothin but a bullet or jail time
Word up
Ayo take it from me the Big L
Cause I been through it all you know what Im sayin
Stay off them corners and stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets
Im outta here
