Stretch  Bobbito 95 Pt I Lyrics
Yo check it
Yo I got slugs for snitches
No love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet
Known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow hell no
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I aint got no hotel dough
Im known for yoking jacks
And beating them with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightning
You see what happened in my last fight friend
Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of dead mics
Where Im from niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
Im telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
Im quick to blast a goon
And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare
I keep a shotty near
Its the nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks Im know to roast
Until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most
Im leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak
Cause my techniques great
And Im the nigga police hate in each state
Cause Im the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper
Fuck around youll find my silk boxers in your mothers hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
Im from a whyle town
You know my style clown so bow down
Word up 95 style I got my man JayZ here Step up to the mic Yo word up The singles called Put It On Its in stores right now Produced by my man Buckwild In the chorus he got Kid Capri and got a LG remix which you heard a little while ago Word up JayZ
Stretch was wondering if that was a condom endorsement
Oh nah nah nah nah
Yo we got Jay we also got Da Graveyard right Thats coming up next With JayZ on it Well we got JayZ in the place Whats up baby
Whats up man I just come up out that hectic party man down in the city man That shit was hectic man Cops sitting there with shotguns and all that And that was an RB party man you know
Yeah well the plague is everywhere
It was probably Reef
Yeah it was probably mad Daddy Reef Yo he beat you up you know what Im saying so
Yo I dont give a goddamn who it was Im here now
Yeah you do your thing baby
So you want this beat
Yeah that shit is fine Check it out now Check it check it check it out now
Brothers can beg and borrow
Still feel sorrow
When Jay
Z like Zorro get in that ass
Better luck tomorrow
Im too much nigga so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out Im too cocky
To stop me you gotta kill me
And when Im gone you can still feel me
On the real B
The shit is eternal I rock the Heavens well
Even if they wont let me in Heaven
I raise hell till its Heaven
Recognize the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga its bad luck to cross me
Im poppin Crystal shooting game like missiles
As projected all hos affected by this style
I mack like Goldie go back like the oldies
But the goody pulling RB bitches wearing hoodies
They dont be knowing the way I be flowing
When I be going
I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things wit a swing and have em rocking like
You say never you run if ever you come
Its never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
Im landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that oppose me ha
Enticin when slicing through tracks
Youre screaming Jesus Christ hes back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
So give him his dap
And me I just take mine
Gimme those gimme this gimme that fuck that
You never see me stressed in a GS
On the prize my greedy eyes cant see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping extortion and corruption
So you know beatin me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow Im too thorough nigga
I make moves cause bowels to move
When Im creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
Armed with the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise I feel no fear when facing yall
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcees trying to be the best
And even in dying couldnt be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin
Ever since L said Throw three Gs in
And we can get down and split the wealth
Thats when I found I could do it myself
I get up
