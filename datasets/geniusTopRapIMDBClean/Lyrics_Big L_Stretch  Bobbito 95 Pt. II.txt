Stretch  Bobbito 95 Pt II Lyrics Big L 
My crew be deliverin hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
Im so ahead of my time my parents havent met yet
Im feeling like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Guillianni hung
Never had a gassed head
Got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and Imma beat your faggot ass halfdead
I stomp white cops till their life stops
For a low price hops
Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 139 you dont want a block war
Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time a mack eleven bucks
Im killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike Im rougher than a fist fight
All chicks aint shit aint no such thing as Ms Right
So we can never be a couple hun
Fuck love all I got for hos is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcees I be attacking quick
Im on some rappin shit and some car jackin shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black ac
And put the gat to his cap clickclack
Sorry jack but get up out of that
My 38 works great so make a mistake and hesitate
And I cant wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didnt listen to what I was speakin
He started reaching
So I left him sleepin with his temple leaking
Aight back to my man JayZ here
JayZ 
As soon as I grab it I eat it up like a savage
And no I dont have it I get it together like a marriage
Im seeking all rappers Im on my ps and qs and carrots
Yall dont understand well goddamn dont you know my status
Im flowing the fattest mmmm that is mmmm Im the baddest
No need to explain my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me they find Im a bit much to swallow
Youre thinking thats hollow the rhythm is too rrugged to follow
I hit you like bam biggity bam bam biggity bam
Let me take a little breathgod damn
The kid is a wizard
Im definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up nah whenever Im in the uh
Whatever I touch whatever I clutch
You know Im gonna end ya uh
