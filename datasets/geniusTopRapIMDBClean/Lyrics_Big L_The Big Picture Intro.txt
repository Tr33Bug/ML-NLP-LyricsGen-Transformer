The Big Picture  Intro  Lyrics
Onetwo yall know yall know
Alright we gon keep it moving
Check this out though
We gon keep it moving we gon keep it moving
Get em up yall know what time it is get em up
Right you are
You a true underground head
You know what this mean right here baby
This aint motherfucking LL Cool J get it up
You know what this mean
It dont mean lazy motherfucker either get it up aight
You ready Prim
It dont mean
Everybody keep your L up like that
It dont mean nothing but one thing
Throw that L up in the air
We gon have you do this shit
All motherfucking night so get used to it
Get used to it
This is for my man Big L word em up
Put your Ls up put your Ls up
Put your Ls up put your Ls up
You know the game plan
CTown thats my main man
We never bring luggage we go shopping when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
Lll make your dame swallow
Your ice dont shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks plus drop the slickest hits
You know nothing about L so dont doubt L
Whats this motherfucking rap game without L
Thats like jewels without ice
Thats like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label Im with motherfucker
