Fuck who did I offend rappers
Sit back Im about to begin 
I drive up and down Harlem blocks icedout watch
Knots in my socks cops think Im selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if Im drunk but Im sober
They wouldnt fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo youre mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names try to hurt my pride
Youre just mad cause Im a young cat pockets dumb fat
Talking bout Where the gun at I been there and done that
Im through with that illegal life Im staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou without a pistol my whole cliques wild
Im rich pal no more sticks Im making hits now
I drink Cristal Im through breaking laws
I dont sell coke any more I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap I doubt that
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Aiyo enoughs enough Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus they want a niggas soul but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure death before dishonor I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So Ima keep doing what Im doing
Pursuing my dream till theres enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So wheres your witnesses that you claim to have
Saying that Im taking half extorting New York and not paying tax
Im laid back playing the role laying the low
But its the same old Joe so dont get KOd
Hey yo Im gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid why dont they just let a nigga live
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick


What would you do if a vicious enemy
Suddenly started coming at you
Armed to the teeth and ready to kill you
