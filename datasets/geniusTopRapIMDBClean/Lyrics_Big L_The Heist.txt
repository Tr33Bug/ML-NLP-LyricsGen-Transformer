Yeah yeah
Yeahyeah yeahyeahyeahyeah yeah yeahyeah
UHH This goes out to all the ballers
Hah in the streets and in jail
Yeah yo its your man Big L
Onethreenine Danger Zone
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out uhh  bust it
Aiyyo I just left the studio and its about two in the morn
Just finished doin a song
Now Im ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And theres a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jump in the Jeep stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep my voice is hoarse barely can speak
I called back on the cell  its Corle mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn
Its my wife you sure
Yeah Im sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door
Say no more which one
The one in Jersey son right over the bridge
We goin hurt those hoes
And hurt both of them kids
Now Im in the Range
Switchin lanes doin a buck n change
I cant wait to touch them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin the chrome
Icegrill lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with em playin the cut
Lookin like he cant wait to start sprayin shit up
Yo who that in the background


Its Tommy Gibbs
Oh I didnt recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you aint scared theres no time to back out
We gon take the back route
And pull the gats out and throw the mask on
We aint leavin til everyones dead and all the cash gone
We gon get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do
So lets do it
I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dressshirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
They just walked in party of four two chicks two males
What room they got She paused and said 212
I took the steps now Im out of breath I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now cause its about to pop off
Saw the door let the Glock off tore the lock off
Took a deep breath then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
These two crab cats we know they hustle upstate
We know they got stacks
Cause they dont fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told em when this is over well be lettin em loose
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there I found 50 kis in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass and two million in cash
I was dumb glad the shit didnt fit in one bag
So I got three filled em all up to the T
I put the bags in the van then I locked the truck
When I got back Corle done popped them punks
Aiyyo fuck it L we might as well pop these cunts
Now thats four bodies
Two outtatowners and two hotties
And after that we aint sleep for three days
We hit the PJs split the money three ways
Now we all laughin hard gettin nice and weeded
Celebratin nigga heist completed
