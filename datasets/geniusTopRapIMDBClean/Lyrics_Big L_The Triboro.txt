Phenomenon OC
Big L onethreenine baby
Diggin In The Crates
Yeah yeah this is Joe the God Terror Squad reppin
Yo yo yo
Im from a place where them niggas dont talk no shit
Where them wigs get split where the guns forever click
Where the track stars come to warm up for a race
Blue and whites ride by and niggas yell Fuck them Jakes
So much respect I can lay dough on the floor
Walk away and come back without cats runnin off
Im a model hos wet dream in her sleep
Performin Xrated fuck scenes me goin deep
OC the Starchild let your cameras record
Im like a man bein honored at the Grammy awards
I pitch lines like fastballs mushout rap my ass off
Knuckle gaze crumblin your glass jaw
Supreme figure drink liquor what team thicker
The Big Picture be the motherfuckin theme nigga
Flamboyant forever this is how it goes
Pray we dont clap your way when the gats explode
Where Brooklyn at
Yo BK dont play
Harlem World
Where niggas get the money all day
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay
Triboro so thorough always
Where Im from dudes get sliced cause crews is trife
And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
Ima slide to the telly and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber Ima use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
When I rock gators hoes be like Them shoes is nice
Dimes Im willin to hit I stay drillin a chick
They all know I aint shit but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the tech at your dome to leave you restin alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess til Im gone
You got this nigga frontin like he the main event
When his album aint even last long it came and went
Im like Gotti to him I throw the shotty to him
Niggas dont want it with L they like Anybody but him
Where Brooklyn at
Yo BK dont play
Harlem World
Where niggas get the money all day
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay
Triboro so thorough always
Hoodied down with the mac Boogie Down where its at
Fuck around hear the sound of the gats
Wanna clown we react fuck that
Do you know what you do when you fool with Joey Crack
Im coke on the streets Im open for beef
Im hoping you reach so we can go with the heat
Im like a nigga that you just cant kill
Niggas spittin that hot shit but just aint real
Uhh its like you muhfuckers frontin for me
Nuttin to see when Im the one you wantin to be
Lovin the stee come through plush in the V
Got niggas mad cause they payin while we fuckin for free
Make Trizz a household live what I told
I only speak that true shit that I know
Besides yall dont want it with us
A hundred or plus killers that be lovin to bust
What the fuck
Yo Remi so crazy rhymes be blazing
Styles just switch like hips on gay men
Trips to the Caymans rich and famous
Rhymes so hot my spit be flaming
Benz be rimmed up doo be pinned up
Bitch talk slick whole crew get hemmed up
My shit drastic all type of tactics
Rip shit flip shit spit shit backwards
Screw you dont let the pretty face fool you
I kick shit like kungfu and I jam like guns do
You got one I want two like water I run through
Psycho make you wanna change your whole mic flow
Floss it givin bitches lyrical abortions
Stay cautioned my first shit was just a lil portion
I come back with more shit playback some raw shit
You cant rock so Imma take your spot make you forfeit
Where Brooklyn at
Yo BK dont play
Harlem World
Where niggas get the money all day
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay
Triboro so thorough always
