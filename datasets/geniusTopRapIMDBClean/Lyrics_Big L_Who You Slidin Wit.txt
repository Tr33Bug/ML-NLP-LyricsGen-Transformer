Yknow We been dancin all night
I been buyin you drinks all night and shit
You goin home wit a nigga or what
Tell me somethin

We can jump in the SL rent a room at the best tel
I make it last cause I sex well
HennRock and Alize I get drunk off
What up miss Get wit a real man and cut that punk off
Erythang gon be alright
I been watchin you watch me all night
I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
She had big breasts honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor gettin our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me wit they hoodies on
Tryin to peep the ice under the sleeve
Im like Its time to breeze told honey Lets leave
Took her to MGs got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal I said Whats the deal
For real  you goin home or you tryna chill
She got close whispered somethin slow in my ear
And it aint hard to tell where we goin from here
Yeah
I aint on that hatin stuff
I was feelin shorty and the bitch told me she was datin Puff
Im a average nigga
And she said she was in a 6month relationship wit that nigga called Jigga
How Imma compete wit that Im a corner nigga sellin crack
Guess I gotta be a ball playin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch aint even wanna fuck
She runnin around all open off Kurupt
The hoe I thought was gon be real easy
Told me she got a man hes some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
Whats wrong wit these hoes Im a fly nigga
I dont wanna go flipmode on Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez bitch know Feds
She used to be in The Bronx rockin PROKeds
Wit some Dominican dro heads
Ridin topless on the back of mopeds titties all out
What What What
If your game rusty around your dame never trust me
Cause soon as you blink Imma slide her off and bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low  Im freaky like that
I never get caught creepin cause Im sneaky like that uhh
It aint my fault your girl be hohoppin
And matter of fact the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
Its because of me why shes walkin crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait cause Im not on the patient tip
Just hit me off we dont need a relationship
And when you mention my name it ring a bell
Ask any female nobody do it like L

Took her to the crib and bombed her wit this big brown anaconda
