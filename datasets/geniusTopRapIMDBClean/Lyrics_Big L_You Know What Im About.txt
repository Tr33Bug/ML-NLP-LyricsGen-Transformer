When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
Im quick to buck a duck and I dont give a fuck about 50
A hardcore life I chose to explore
Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs what thugs got
Pockets swellin hot from sellin tops on the drug spot
Gs was clocked fat knots went in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
Cause I choose to use a gun dont mean that I cant fight
Cause we could put the guns down and go one round
With the hands my man I aint the one youll get done clown
I can inverse my style cause Im versatile
Quick to burst a child Im livin worse than foul
I pack two tecs in case your crew flex
I wet up the set in a sec and yell Whos next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh
Youll get smashed like a deli snack youre softer than jelly jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat
On one three ninth street Malcolm X boulevard
Its full of hard brothers thats thick and quick to pull a card
I tell facts when the beat start
Listen here sweetheart the Big L is street smart
I fuck ducks and they crews up make em give the jewels up
For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up
I had beef with this nigga named Randolph
Now hes in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
A beat down from Big L thats what all pranksters get
Like Al Yankovic Im on some real gangster shit
Im never fuckin with no handicapped or crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and youll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed Im a villain admit it
Im the type to murder you then tell your moms Im the kid who did it
Peace and love is somethin that I dont rhyme about
Fuck what you heard you know what Im about
Knockin niggas off knockin niggas out
Knockin niggas off knockin niggas out

Its the man with the rough flow
Some niggas dont like me but I dont give a fuck though
Cause Im in command yall
Im smackin niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I aint the funny type
To joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin money right
Cause I got the right game
Definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Im rolling numbers with no practice
Im snatchin up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes
Cause I got strategy
Im rollin head crack trips and makin all the brothers mad at me
Word Im taxin shit
Im shittin on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin to earn props I aint the one to see
You clownsll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
Ya gotta find a better way
Ill pull ya card your file shit plus your resume
Cause I dont play clown
I gotta get mine thats why my face stay frown
I dont smile dont try to pull my file
Ill lay your ass like tile you know my motherfuckin style
So just slow down cause yall cant throw down
And yall cant accept that a niggas makin dough now
And Im livin better troop
And Im makin more noise than a fuckin heavy metal group
Im a cool man a brother with a smooth plan
Thats why Im seein more papers than a newsstand
So peep it dont try to run around or speak it
Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret
While niggas are packin steel actin ill
Im on the DL with a female and Im stackin bills
How Im livin Everything is well
Cause a nigga like me yo Im ringin bells
Without doubt I got clout
Yo fuck that shit yo you know what Im about
