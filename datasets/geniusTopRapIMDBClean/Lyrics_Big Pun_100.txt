Ooooooooooohhhhh Puerto Rico
Toma
Pronto llegara el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we wont stop
We always knew wed make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
Puerto Rock Puro not Menudo no Im not the one
Im studyin Judo you dont know if I got a gun
Its Pun from the X side of things baguette inside my rings
Everything I want I gets badaBING
Its mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound to the ground no pity
Watch the sound fopound twenty round milli
Get smacked silly for coming out your mug
Im known for bouncin thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Dont matter put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs have you pissin in a plastic bag
Thats a drag now you abnormal
Dont make me grab the Rambo
And put some motherfuckin stabs on you
The night is young and Im already fightin hidin my gun
Promoter buggin screamin who the fuck invited Pun
Pronto llegara el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we wont stop
We always knew wed make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
From San Juan to Bayamon Im the Don Juan beside the Don
Live long get your party on
Dont let the liquor fool you cause Ill stick it to you
Somethin sharp to the heart or somethin big to move you
The Desert or the shottie whatever you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe must have been Puerto Rican rum
Thats the hardcore two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one bones I break them
Pigs are bacon so get fried if they come
You see that Im like G Rap Pac Master P
All balled up with a twist of Marc Anthony
Recognize me Im the one thats cockin the auto
Tony Sunshine please canten el coro
Pronto llegara el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we wont stop
We always knew wed make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
It aint over
I thought you aint like the beat
Te digo que no se ha acabado
La tierra del Borinquen donde nacido yo
Aha aha aha aha
Es un jardin florido de magico primor
Aha aha aha aha aha aha aha
Un cielo siempre nitido que sirve de dosel
Y dan arrullos placidos las olas a sus pies
Pronto llegara el dia de mi suerte
Te lo juro por mi gente
Te juro que un dia llegara
And we wont stop
We always knew wed make it
Even though you player hated
We still made it to the top
A Puerto Rico
