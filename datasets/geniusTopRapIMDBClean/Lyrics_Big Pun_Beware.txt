I gave you fair warning beware
I gave you fair warning beware
Yo What you thought Puns shit was weak Now you cant sleep
Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
Im like the beast with a warrant far from a law man
Gave you fair warnin now you on the stairs fallin
Im callin out any rapper that I doubt smack him in the mouth
Throw him in the yokeboomthen I knock him out
No doubt Freddie Foxxx files
Twentyshot auto Glock blaow Benny Blanc Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and Im proud twist your cap and Im out
Sleep with the fishdips for yappin too loud
Whats happenin now Niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin on the smallest victim gives em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest
We polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory ya niggas cant do shit to me
Physically lyrically hypothetically realistically
Im the epitome of catchin wreck
Catch you when you cash your cheque
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fuckin Lex
Nothin less than the best if the Squad did it
Hardheaded niggas better beware and fear like God said it
I gave you fair warning beware
I gave you fair warning beware
I gave you fair warning beware
I gave you fair warning beware
Ayo I warned you now all niggas could do is mourn you
Im born to kill and still thrilled to put it on you
Theres no regrets remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die some of us kill even massacre
Who wanna try Punisher will if you ask for it
Im hazardous for your health and Hells your next stop
For real my shits cocked the world has just stopped
Im not the one you should be underestimatin
Come test your fate and I guarantee Ill be under investigation
You cant handle the whole Ill slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know however though I still hold the title
When all my rivals have chance to dance with Mr Homicidal
Hand on the Bible I swear to defend my crown
Ive been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Dont fuck around and catch a rude awakening
My crews basically waiting patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then well surround you form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you Terror Squads everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody who are we
The foundationyoure facing a whole army


I gave you fair warning beware
