Niggas is flossing a lot time to start extorting the block
Just a portion of the prod off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Something for the cops to keep em blind so we can grind
With peace of mind turn the key and shine without being dimed
Time to expand New York to Chicago Colorado
You know my motto Clock Gs and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Prignon
Were buying out the bar and Don Juan
And every womans Chandonin
Long donging em down like Sean Michaels does em
Im like a psycho fucking sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister
Cmon on sister Big Puns Mr Cock and Squeeze like a gun tester
Crushing sisters backs with the demon snap hit you from the back
Close your eyes relax let me feed the cat
Living fat true mack niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck just wasnt as mass appealing
I started feeling funny niggas coming short with money
I called my son he told me chill hed be over in twenty
Punny whats the deal Niggas wanna kill me
He said its real they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly
Had more to claim niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
Its like a dream I called my team and started flipping
Locked the clip in started lifting
Niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now but itll take more to hold me down
Top of the world ma Ha ha top of the world 
Yo this is the bad time  boomerang bring it all back
Flashback live and prosper eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula popular to the masses
I miss the EClasses rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang  plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shining like sterling then you broke like brick in Berlin
Now should I slit my wrists Go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedies above the law
Fuck em all
Im coming for the rich thieving em even if I wasnt poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course I bury any adversary trying to floss
Just because the reason I leave em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage
Feeling the gauge front page these are the last days
Cash pays and rules  the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like its all good through every ghetto
I aint judging but bugging how we fall so many levels
The devils got us by the balls
Thats why the law allows the drugs to overflood
Knowing we gonna buy it all
Its time to call a world order where every girls your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
Im gonna get mine either from crime or through the Bible
Whichever way it better pay Im feeling suicidal


Yo this is the bad time  boomerang bring it all back
Flashback live and prosper eat well and get fat
I was Pop Dula popular to the masses
I miss the EClasses rocking game with death glasses
Rock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis
Boomerang  plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shining like sterling then you broke like brick in Berlin
