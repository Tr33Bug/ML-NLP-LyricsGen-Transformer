Ill battle you all from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis the God of War like Mars
That leave MCs smashed by my Squad
Its odd yall never seen relish but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas rockin the Beamer sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before rough rugged and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This aint a game Ill leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin your chain
Nawmean do him and the fiend grab his wallet
Leave a trail blazin like Rasheed Wallace
Whats todays knowledge
Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin on the corner so wont speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son thats all that its about
No doubt silence of code violence of mode
Under control can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low tryin to blow trees
And for no reas we hit a nigga up for mo cheese
Better relate and start to think or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt
We brave in the heart playin a part amazingly smart
Razorsharp futuristic raps state of the art
Takin New York cats past the stars first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low business never personal
Just some words to know if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry em
Depends on the state If death is my fate then cool Im dyin
If thats my destiny its meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me Aight crew  no doubt Pun 
Aight then lets fight then
Im hypened comin with the thunder and the lightnin
Invitin the comp ice on the arm
Nights when I storm snipin your moms right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm its the ghetto god
I rip a niggas heart out his frame
While I scream Terror Squad
Be larger than life my initials carved in my wife
She said shed starve if I die understand Im a god in her eyes
The father of Christ sure to be immortal
Guzzlin beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin thats mi hermano


We will be here forever  KRS
We brave in the heart pppplayin a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun thats the ghetto God
You aint understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldnt think I did that shit
Im from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready for this big dog who hold a 9 steady
Im John Blazin when you see the arms razin
Shit crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready
Switch quicker than Marbury
Im a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean Im on top of the whip
You plottin to flip fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose
I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues
We will be here forever  KRS
We brave in the heart pppplayin a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun thats the ghetto God
Make way for scrill I dont play I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glockthats my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
Im already hot but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post Then dont beef with Joe
Still niggas think I wont bring the heat out
Thats like sayin Puff aint never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first Terror Squad shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the Earth
Im dressed to kill my niggas rep for real
Joe Cracks back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit it dont get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin your lips
The streets a trip either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas thats seekin to flip
