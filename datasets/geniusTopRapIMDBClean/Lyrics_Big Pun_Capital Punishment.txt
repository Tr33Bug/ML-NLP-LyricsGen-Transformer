Its mine its all mine you understand
At least me and my peoples
Can you dig that
21st century thought Id never see it
Right around the corner baby
Ours for the takin
Yo
Ive seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin us
Watching us close marketing host is here to purchase
Purposely overtaxin the earnings
Nervous burnin down the churches
Theyre scared of us rather beware than dare to trust
Throw us in jail million dollar bail left there to rust
Lets call in order give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin my own Im livin alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan you go girl
Shes an exception some people can leap to the impression
See me myself I start flippin and fall victim to deep depression
Im stressin the issue here so we can gross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin fired and hired as a pistoleer
Theres no longevity livin off negativity
Fuck it Id rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
Thats how the city be everybody gettin they hustle on
Judge singin death penalty like its his favorite fuckin song
Word is bond takin my life you know they lovin it
God F the government and its fuckin capital punishment
Capital punishment given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin with
Cant live alone watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin the llello for life the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens people with dreams Gods and Earths
For what its worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First its turnin tables open our own labels
Disable the Republicans then reverse capital punishment
Ive seen it all up close shit out the movies youd be buggin
My cousin Chuchi barely a juve lost it and turned on the oven
He wasnt playin blew out the flame and started inhalin
Baring a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin
Wearin the virus Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff blow your head off fuck a snuff we bust lead off
Get off your high horse or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans The Last of the PoRicans
We need some unity fuck all the Jeeps and jewelry
The maturity keeps me six feet above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybodys a desperado
I guess tomorrow aint promised unless youre Amish and deaths your motto
Like Zorro I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z but a P cause Punishments what I resemble
I lend you this if it expands yours for you and yours
A real man cant fall he stands tall
The Mans claws are diggin in my back Im tryin to hit him back
Time to counteract where my niggas at


Capital punishment given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin with
Cant live alone watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin the llello for life the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what its worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First its turnin tables open our own labels
Disable the Republicans then reverse capital punishment
You like that its Pun and Prospect
We hold nines own more treasure than gold mines makin progress
With Don Juans theres rules to be made crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid nothin yall can do to behave
We laid in the slums made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentality
My strategys why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise so I would never fall to the lies
Its no surprise but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah I want the glamour laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
While Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm never shaky calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade then the night back to day
Like the twentyfour hour rotation
I know the location its just a little information
From the Squad bringing the Terror for the nineera
And let it rain on your fine leather nigga what
