Warning
Yo wanna rumble with the Pun huh
blows raspberry Shit on the whole industry
Who puff more Owls than Pun Pile on more styles than Pun
Who the only one with over a thousand guns
Running up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off
In the shower powerdrive ya daughter
Im all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mentals compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type qualities allow me to poli with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghettos the jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles
Or struggle or live civil and humble
My niggasll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can fathom for twenty grand
Niggasll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down just wilding in jean
Pile on the green surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
But now Im a King so its more than money
All the honies used to call me Punny
Cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rolling lovely and you feel worse
Want my money let your steel burst
Cause Id rather see you in Hell first
Mucho trabajo poquito dinero
Im selling perico
Yo whats the deally yo
Im Uptown making moves just like Castro
Mucho trabajo  Yo yo yo  poquito dinero
Im selling perico
Yo whats the deally yo
Huh Im Uptown making moves just like Castro
Yo yo yo keep the lights keep the camera all I want is the action
The battles on where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd waiting to see if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
Itll never happen Im on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered Dont Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka bury me next to my father
In three days Ill rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open in my hands I got the Gatling
Im looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury you wouldnt like me when Im angry
I turn Mr Rogers Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This aint Pictionary all you see is the cemetery
Bodies from World War I and II is there
You dont want a third war thats nuclear warfare
So Big Pun count the stacks make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we running a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
Youre better off in DC with the mayor smoking crack
This aint a diss Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
TEC for TEC or we can go text for text oh
I forgot you dont read so take this hole in your chest  blaow
Hide the blood give you the gun run and hide
So when the DT shows up he thought it was a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
