Classic Verses  Drop it Heavy and Fantastic 4  Lyrics   from the Show  AG Full Scale EP
from the DJ Clue CD The Professional
Yo my squad is honored like Elijah Muhammad
But Im Godretarded aint no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but Im in the ruff listen up
If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet its in the cuffs
Aint no snitch in us bitch in us
Unofficialness everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The fourDs all these is more reas
To either get big or leave and let live
We the best there is TS aint nobody else
We probably Dove cause we all way on top of the shelf
Im lockin your wealth with the master keys freeze
Dont try to breeze or Imma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese please dont test the toaster
My techll roast ya body faster than Ferraris Testarossa
Youre gettin closer to death Reapers got a hold on your breath
You goin straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat now you froze in the bed
Minute ago you was poppin shit holdin ya dick
Now whats the problem you aint nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin your guns and runnin the island
You wast violent you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic did it to get out of the calisthenics
Im Dianetics combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance Im a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it you cant win you better join em
Im headannointin niggas like the Holy Gospel
Im the only vato loco to smoke you with fireblowin nostrils
Watch for the toast when you see it you better draw yours
Warlords callin The Giant its all yours
Fuck all yall nonbelievers I roll with God the Squad and TS
Out with the BS we platinum they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85 Im 400 solid
Brainbolic with knowledge cockdiesel scholars
Holdin it down walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town soakin you down wit toast til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force thatll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns Im on the serious tip
You keep playin and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
Its like that but dont think I wont counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
Im swift with the mac quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose
