Mad stressed
Yo just chill bro chill man 
Nah nah I gotta get this money
Yo chill you got everything going for you man 
I aint got nothing right now man
Niggas calling you and all that man 
Nah that shit was down
Bout to blow soon you know 
Niggas aint for real kid Thats a dream kid This is reality This is reality This is the real world Nah I gotta get this fucking money kid Word up Fuck that nah fuck that
Whatever man 
I got the sweetest heist million in cash another three in ice
Who can I trust Cubanll bust plus get beef tonight
Heres the plan  plan  we nab the man bring a camcorder
Grab his fam and run the train on his granddaughter
Nah chill thats too ill for real Id rather kill somethin
Heres the deal we shatter his grill and drill fuck him
Oral torture no doubt the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops hes guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
Its settled better put on your metal foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto a rebel of chance the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash level advance
Takin a chance Ive only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran
Movin on the stash first we get the cash
For the fast money I smash the niggas shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and Ima shoot the place
Ayo the plot thickens Im pickin the locks in the back entrance
Payin attention not tryin to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got the popo locked with a Don The Rock Muraco chokehold  oh oh 
Their security systems linear laser protection
No sweat I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin the vault for weapons assault second of course
Its poison it sprays boiled and baked in Epsom salt
Reppin New York is the cat burglar the fat murderer
Slippin the clip in the MAC inserterer
Hurtin your pockets droppin your stock to zero profit
Holdin heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like De Niro mob flicks
Back to the topic at hand the grand prize
The safe flies open the shine almost blinded my eyes
I cracked the code enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin for the back lets go
Thats when I heard the sirens hopin that my ears was lyin
Knew we was dyin when I saw the guard we tortured cryin
Pointin at the building screamin I can see them kill em
Snipers was willing but couldnt theres too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said Fuck it we die we die busting our guns
Oye castigador saca el fucking caon
Vamos pa la guerra vamos searlo
A castigarlos
Movin on the stash first we get the cash
For the fast money I smash the niggas shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and Ima shoot the place
Movin on the stash first we get the cash
For the fast money I smash the niggas shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and Ima shoot the place
Ayo its time to pay and I aint trying to give my shine away
Lets show these pigs how much we give a fuck about the brighter day
I cock the Eagle Cuban drew the Glock it was diesel
Said See you in Hell coppers and started poppin like it was legal
We need a plan if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin out of ammo I got about a handful of Black Rhinos and two Rambos strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said Move your fat ass faster motherfucker they gaining
I gave him the case told him Go head save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory tell the family I gave em Hell
For real thats when I heard the tires screechin
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin
conversation and gunfight to fade
