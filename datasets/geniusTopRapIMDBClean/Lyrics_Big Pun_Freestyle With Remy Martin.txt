Yo yo yo
What the fuck Terror Squad
All we do is battle what what what what
Yo its The Dream Shatterer strictly for cream team battler
Ring rattlin microphone fiend spline splatterer
King of the throne bringin it home five nights
Up in The Source  five mics
Whippin a Porsche  high price
Pumpin the 97 rhyme heaven her voice is mindbendin
Imaginin Angie nuttin but panties and my 911
Thats what Im reppin the thug tech and the glove
Step in the mud with less than a SCUD Im splittin your rug
Its just Im in love with Mrs Martinez
Latin Goddess or Venus you just happen to give me the hardest penis
You wanna see us apart youre chasin the dark
Long as she run the battle she got a place in my heart
Yo yo yo yo
All of a sudden the big question is yo who this bitch Remynisce
Is she really thorough with her borough can she represent
Do Remy write every line and every rhyme that she spit
Is she really the shit is her flow really sick
Get off my dick keep your sorry ass compliments
I get mad quick yall knowin me aint got no sense
Bitch dont try to play me because you not a player
Believe me you dont really wanna see my gangster
Its easy to cock back and smack the shit out a hoe
Had to leave niggas bleedin just so we could get our dough

On the Bruckner like fuck you gettin weeded and speedin
Im untouchable nigga I aint never have love for you niggas
Cause yall pussy thats why I aint never fuck with you niggas
Motherfuckers is scandal on the avenue of Randall
Dont slip into some shit you and your click cant really handle

Before I stab the bastard baby in the bassonet
Ill body a botty bwoy blow his gut open
Leave son chokin gun still smokin
Know how many niggas like I bet you Pun wrote it
Yall can all take a dirty dildo and deep throat it
