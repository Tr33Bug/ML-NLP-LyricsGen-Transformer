Uh  Glamour life style baby  Dum dum dum dum  bottle the rocks  Yeah yeah 
Freeze the ice 100 mil kid money money money mo
Platinum status  Word word yeah what up what up 
Stick around
Yo I plan to live a life aglamour
Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas drinking Don P
Thinking beyond deeper than Gandhi while Im in the Diamante
Counting my Gs Im out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear flickin hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah Cuban Link is into getting Benjamins
Cause if doesnt make dollars then it doesnt make sense
I represent I meant to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to a penthouse resort
Im the Latino thatll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even DeNiro know not to gamble in my Casino
Vino on the rocks lobster dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx second to none unless its Pun
Its the glamour life blow up the kids and the wife
Players who aint half as nice swear to but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock freeze the ice stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an the shottie down the lake leaving no identity
Just the memory a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe to pursuit them troops
Against the bigjoker
Sipping alimoca playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher must be fam
Or the hammer have to smoke Pun
Get the motherfucking guns 
Since now Ive become the one wanted for a lump sum of Gs
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed we let him bleed for 50 Gs
Ship his body to the states filled with 50 kis
Please no remorse for your two face
As I assemble my rifle out the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take whos place Not Seis
Your bodyll be laced and left without a trace


The glamour life the glamour life yo
Its the glamour life blow up the kids and the wife
Players who aint half as nice swear to but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock freeze the ice stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
Yo its the motherfucking Don Cartagena
The leader Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina Mira
Street dreamer like Nas my entourage is thick
Camouflaged in this bitch so God forbid you start some shit
My squads equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an cop killers with the carved initialin
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga Im staying paid yous a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway back to the subject in the bubLex
In the back seat having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live having the ice and shit
Think twice I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts keep the five burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaisers learnin everything illegally
We could be friend for years cross me once thats thievery
The glamour life blow up the kids and the wife
Players who aint half as nice swear to but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock freeze the ice stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
Yo the dough the rap the audience party heavy til the 40s in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent an old man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the Fallopian wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium prostitute emporium
500 Benz 500 friends sell Cambodian
8 cups of vodka 4 cups of juice for sodium
Money money sweet as the smell of magnolia
It gets you dime bitches spitting image of Apollonia
Now how can I go broke pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote milkin dumb honies I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland slingin
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currencys gonna murder me its never enough
Breakin my ass gettin it just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sams bluff dun taxes dont bite us bite us
My life yo its the glamour life blow up the kids and the wife
Players who aint half as nice swear to but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock freeze the ice stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
The glamour life play precise defense is tight
Im out to settle the score lets do it right
Enough for looking at grave its paying back tonight
Yo Twin pass the lye pass the light
The glamour life this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter me and my mother
Now shes fifty years old pushing a hummer
The glamour life hand me a knife Ill slice and dice
Men or Mice send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line let them hear it
Let them fear it send it screaming to the Holy Spirit
Glamour life the glamour life the glamour life
Its the glamour life yo its the glamour its the glamour life
The glamour life the glamour life the glamour life
Cock the hammer end his motherfucking life bitch
