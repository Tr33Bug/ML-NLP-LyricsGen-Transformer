Ayyo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
Thats mathematical madness Im on the savage the strong
The marriage a bond of havoc and song
This massacres on as if Picasso laced you
Theres lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
Im possum at grade school thats how I have to debate you
Raps are like cables snatchin you fatal
Thats how master degrades you
Im battlin Jesus  haysoo  if he passes through my label
Snatchin his halo
God I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and its hypnotizin
Im only emphasizin Im still all about business and enterprisin
Im super lyrical a brain boosts the chemicals
Thats used contenicals inside of my mental projectable
Just call me Baby Jesus cuz lately niggas is praisin me
Just for the way I blaze to be crazily tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavery
Gaze Into my eyes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Plus Im hard to talk to if you live I probably thought you stalked you
Where you walked to at night caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy Pataki scared
This town aint big enough for both of us  And we aint Goin Nowhere 
There it is plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
Im into black magical torture romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker like Tony when gas whores Im the masked enforcer
Out for the cash and the chocha
Smash the coca bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up you do what Swallow the stuff
I dont give a fuck any more Im only twentyfour years old
And Ive already broken every law
Im horrorcore this is for the heads
Runnin up in your crib knot if you still hot in under the bed
Ayyo I shatter dreams like Jordan assault and batter your team
Your squadronll be barred from rap like Adam  Eve from the garden
Im carvin my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine off the  board head 
Reverse that I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cuz he aint worth jack
Hit em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
Im the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow niggas be swearin Im blacker than coal
Like Nat King I be rappin and tongues packin
The ones magnums cannons and gatlin guns
Its Big Pun The one and only son of Tony Montana
You aint promised manana in the rotten manzana
Cmonpana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
Im in Ivana with winea try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma
