Something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects man
And thats how we roll roll
You know Im well known like Al Capone fully blown like Ton Montana
In a zone sittin on chrome stoned sippin on champagna
Rollin ganja up in Bible paper see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ John Elijah Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream bustin out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard deemer medallion
Mockin God even Italians see my battalion propped abroad
I got the Squad overqualified pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted threewheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly  blown Benz chrome rims 
Shinin like the  stone gems  on my  gold rings 
I got it sewn Twinz I cant begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
Ive been a killer and a drug dealer a bugged nigga
But now Im like Puffy cause moneys thicker than blood player
Im still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together and figure which cleaners the best for the hit
I get the job done Puns handlin business
Candlelight dinners havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses so expensive my whole familys religious
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll


Aiyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crews official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
Im tryna triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God FullAClips and myself thatll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
Im on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
Im infinite like math so Im gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day bullshit and sittin on your ass
Im all about cash and the power
A stash with the powder that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Lets get it locked I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryna stop our cheddar from stockin forever
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
Big Pun is the largest thang
Joey Crack be stayin paid
Terror Squad from the projects man fades
