Youre my darlin darlin baby
Youre my darlin darlin love
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I said youre everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Ooh youre
Yo I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesnt stop Im only beginnin Im bonin your women
While you home all alone Im blowin up in em
Sendin them back to you mad at you
Dont catch a motherfuckin attitude
Im just showin you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment when Im up in it suckin it
Bustin it outnice blouse let me unbutton it
Youre fuckin with King Papi Chulo when knockin culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high word I be drillin em
Bitches be tryin to ride but the curve be killin em
Fillin em with the cash my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it first work the tongue then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half watch the gat baby take a bath
Be good I might put away the wood and give you the mustache
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core but no Boriquas eat the pussy
Scuse me for bein blunt but Ive been eatin cunts
Since pimps was pushin pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin and grindin simultaneously grindin
Climbin up the walls with my balls bangin off your hymen
Im a diamond in the rough  ugh  bustin in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick rip your fetus out of place
Yo bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car lets start the mnage  trois like Escobar
By far Im the best at all sex positions forget the kissin
Im skippin the tonguetwistin TS Tradition
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
Some chick in back of me bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zacharys
Cause she heard I was packin meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies lifted her belly
And Put it in Her Mouth like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say Im too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish Ill make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks come back and fix your favorite dish
Not  You crazy bitch I aint with that Ima hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that Im the mack doin my thing
Pullin your strings makin you feel like you in a dream
Its the king of the HipHop Quotables givin you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin baby
I aint a player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin love
Im no player I just fuck a lot
Youre my darlin darlin baby
Youre my darlin darlin love
Youre my darlin darlin baby
