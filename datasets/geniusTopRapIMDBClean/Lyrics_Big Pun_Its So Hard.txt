You can catch me in the cherry red onefifty
Got the Glizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy going sixty down a onewizzy
Drunk pissy tryin to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin bottles up in Sues Rendevous
Fuck that Spun the Uey lost a hubcap
Its back to the shack came back in a Whats that
Straight from Paris checkin Gabys new baby carriage
Perry Ellis auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers nothin less cause its realer
In the Big Apple where its quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you best friends kidnap you
Trust no one got beef bust yo gun
You dont need no one talking bout that you owe him

And to the Boricuas stay up stay up stay up
And to all my homies you gotta know whats up
