Ha Ha Ha
Do you see me now
You remember me The guy from the back of the class that used to wear the glasses
The one you used to laugh at
Look at me now brother
Do you like fruit
Well Im chewin your girls nipples
How do you like them apples asshole
Im laughing at you
Im laughing at you now
You told me I was ugly
I was scared to crack a smile
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Im Laughing at you now
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Im laughing at you
600 Benz 20 inch rims house on the hill hittin mad skin
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine
So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran cause I feared none
Puns from the street where there aint no rules
But carried heat cause he aint no fool
Aint no room for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us cause weve been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus
The messages dont sleep till its over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin over Im still in the water drownin
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now im ice forever
Stomach bustin out the white carrera
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
Ay qu ser What can I do but take you to strive
Ay qu hago I hope the streets dont take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN
Im laughing at you
Im laughing at you now
You told me I was ugly
I was scared to crack a smile
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Im Laughing at you now
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Im laughing at you


Now its not funny cause Im hot and got a pot of money
A lot of hunnies around  Dont stop do the brown for me 
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasnt the man
I aint gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldnt silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
Im not going to hit her Im gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin high now no more whiteout send the cubans
To provide now its my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Aint nothin change im still humble and modest
And im always proud to admit I came straight from the projects
Hardy har har har
Dont you forget about me now
Dont 4x 
Dont you forget about me now
Dont 4x  naw
Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah NahNah Nah Nah Nah
repeat 2x 
Dont you forget about me now
I said dontdontdontdont
Chorus
