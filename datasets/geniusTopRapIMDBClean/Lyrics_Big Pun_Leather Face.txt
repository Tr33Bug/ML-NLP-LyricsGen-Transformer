What I gotta do let yall niggas know
I am THE NICEST EVER
Hardcore Commercial What you wanna do
You wanna wile up you wanna dance
Dont matter to me I got it all locked down baby
Its not a game its war plain and raw
Blood stain the wall
When I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin
Unless you got my ends
Ima make you twins with the Headless Horseman
Hell extortion sell your soul live your dreams
Dont pay the cost then bam bam
Say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood
Screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs
I dont need no love
Give me your fear money respect beer honeys and sex
Were here
Ill bend them checks for years hungry and stressed
You fuckin with Chris  fuck Pun  dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator the head decapitators back forever
Cant count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep I put em back together
Thats the terror cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh like Buffalo Bill
You fuckin with reel to reel rap axe maniac
Sound bwoy killer hack hack chainreact
Two for one double the death same price

What you came for
Surgery with a chainsaw
Word to Pac and BIG
My Glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Aint no bullshittin getting the full treatment
Special two heated missiles til your crews leaving witchu
I rip you in half  blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little  HA HA  and dash in the SClass limo
Thats how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out
For talking loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew
Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew what Im fitting to do
I split you in two leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Rip it like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy probably robbing your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North
Stashing knives up my ass
Surviving the task we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips fast as vets that spit
Add some tips for any bastard bitch pappin shit
Watch me rep til the casket from the bassinet biatch
Ahora tu
X2
Its not a game pah  Now the leg huh
