Fake lyrically handsome call collect a kings ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Waynes mansion move like a phantom
Youll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fags
So I run through em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad what I got they cant have
Sinking they ship like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son Im way past the minimum entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia sure to hold the Gideon
Official bboy gentlemen long term never the interim
Born inside the winter wind day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioned in the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon the Danish rings by Entenmanns
Rush up on adrenaline they get they asses sent to them
Gentlemen you got a tenement well then assemble it
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling making em WOOP
Like blue gelatin swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me
Yo niggas dont know so I gotta flip
It seem theyve forgotten how dark it could get
When I bark when I hit scratch like a Pit
We both know you pussy but you stay talking shit
What Imma have to do dog run up when you rest
Catch you while you comfortable with one up in your vest
One up in yo chest of course they the hollows
You goin away today you just lost tomorrow
Imma go platinum You gots to be kiddin  Nah 
Imma go platinum No bullshittin
And Imma stay flippin flows rippin shows
Strippin hos gettin dough let me go
And niggas know who the best is
The dog DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
Im wreckless cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
And then go from like midnight to breakfast
Yo yo my Alma mater is the rooftop back in 85
With summer cookouts to crack lookouts
Megahookers with pocketbooks out
The corners where we hung out my uncle that was strung out
Beef during the drought and all the guns that we brung out
Niggas hustle for cloud Brownsville street type bouts
Blackouts ultralootin door to door army recruitin
Drug lords continue shootin in weathers and come Novembers
Sleep in red snow where niggas bled so the spot control
Goldchains with diamondlinks makes product in kitchen sinks
Think tanks matching to banks stuck up bitches actin stank
Gunplay without provisions went on twentytype collisions
Weed spots getting took when ponine run the jooks
Crooked beats crooks be lurkin hurtin
To catch a body workin to say they perks when
Its a nigga head they burstin first and last
Ill lock your block then smack that ass
Cumlaude and streetwise slide fast
Alright Im in fascination with the shorter words turn to audible
Put a little more to it try to blow through
See its like the way you think and Ive been made to endure
I floored rap like  
Gangs straightaways moving out of buckets some change
Paralyzed while I hit you like Colombian King
And Im soaring killing words they couldnt explain
Spark flames so it burn slow feeling me every bit
As much as Dutch know though a ransom my thumbs crush
My motivation lands where the guns bust
I know myself and the law we might trust
Mic like a coldbrush goin front porch to the street
Movin through this life of speed
Tryna square and exonerate theyre here to eat
Besides that dude you got me feeling the beat
Its like this freestyle off of the cap
With my nigga Big Pun cause he bust mad raps
Thats DMX we rock this shit no doubt
With my nigga Canibus let me show you how
Now we get down to the specifics the Heineken
I be grabbing up the mic before we rhyme again
What time again Dont talk to brainless such
People around the way tell me that I smoke too much
Im rolling in the Dutch thats the thing I do
While Im chilling with my niggas from the QU
The zoo niggas ride we like gorillas and such
While we ripping you through cause we just too much
Freestyle off the top of my brain I maintain
Showing the motherfucking stress in the game
Still I wouldnt break the flow fast Speedy McSlow
Geronimo I get the dough nigga what
I shatter dreams like Jordan assault and batter your team
Your squadronll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
Im carving my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine
Off the boardhead reverse that I curse at the first whack
Nigga with the worst rap cause he aint worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
Im the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow niggas be swearin Im blacker than coal
Like Nat King I be rapping and tongues packing the ones
Magnums cannons and Gatling guns
Its Big Pun the one and only son of Tony Montana
You aint promised maana in the rotten manzana
Cmon pana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
A man of honor wouldnt wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
Im pure adrenaline uncut straight to the gut medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain Ill explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire Imma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver can put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime fuck it I like the shine
Up in the white and lime clutch with the pipe design
Plushed out both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach get the fuck out
Take a hike we can even battle to make it right
Go head lace the mic you finished say goodnight
Headtohead in the street Ill leave you dead in your feet
Settling beef Ill even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it wont matter your dreams still gon shatter
Its a long ladder to climb and mine is on stagger
So get outta town fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard desert bird player you outta bounds
You could ramble out the mouth like you Rambo
But you slouch if we battled youd be out
Without a shadow of a doubt and thats the ugly truth
Killers walk with muddy boots
Once my dogs cut me loose thats a bullet in your bubblygoose
Fuck is you talkin like you crazy Barkin like you wady
Ill have you crawlin walking like a baby
Dont try to play me cause Im not a playa
Aiyyo I shot the place up and pass the heat off like a hot potata
Im bout to make a million dollars but still Im rowdy
So I hope Im rap and rhyming before I have to kill somebody
Thats how it is in the stone jungle if you known to own a bundle
Guaranteed a nigga gon mug you
And no one love you when you broke as shit
Focus kid commercials dont lie curse you to die
Coke is it rob your life away thats a big price to pay
Forgetting to teach his kid how to ride his bike today stupid
Let the world know the truth you dont want me to shine
You studied my rhyme then you laid your vocals after mine
Thats a bitch move somethin that a homosexual rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum you only dropping clues
I studied your background read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drugfree role model you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you aint got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While ninetynine percent of your fans wear high heels
From IceT to Kool Moe Dee to JayZ
Now you want to fuck with me Nigga you crazy
You dripping with wack juice and you cant get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start
Give me the respect that I deserve or Imma take it by force
Blast you with a fourtyfive colt make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war now you wanna talk
Its about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
Thats why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
Its because of him now at least I know what beef is
Its not what I would call this see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin off of dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you something you might got more cash then me
But you aint got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
Ill let you kick a verse fuck it Ill let you kick em all
Ill even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Clap clap now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Stick you in the groin kick you in your Vanguard award
Stacks a Vanguard award
In front of your mom your first second and thirdborn
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it I say Naw he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man such as myself
Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it man you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because its been a minute Ill forget it
Fuck that Cause like Common and Cube I see the bitch in you
And Imma make the world see it too
Straightup and down
Canibus and the Punisher
The ultimate executioners dream
Swinging the guillotine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it
Dont ever get it confused
Fuckin with Canibus the human Rubiks Cube like you got something to prove
Yo whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles to bar stools fruits and foods
You got a album out You get hit with your CD too
Runnin outside lyin cryin denyin
That you aint The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him
Whats the difference Yall niggas still aint in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
So wicked I got Satan ejaculating all over his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin white living the hype he ruined his life
But Im a MC of a different type yeah thats right
So make sure your grip is tight or Ima snatch your mic
Word up like that
