Yo yo Elaquaz Gates speaking
Yall know me
Once again we definitely do not need no hooks
Word up 
No hooks
This is the TWIsMer symphony
Til infinity
Yeah
What you want
Yeah check it check it
Something like this check it
Yo why you rhymin like you killin niggas
You aint never feel a trigger
Screamin that you real but youre still beginners
I make examples out you ample rappers
Smack you make you trample backwards
Catch you fallin flat then strap you back in Pampers
Thats a sample just to let you know
Test me and invest in souls
Especially on some flesh meats that was left on skulls
Those opposing holding grudges will be holding crutches
Motherfuckers blasting me thats blasphemy Im old to roughage
Whos the toughest As rough as they come Ill snuff em
Any one of you bluffin my name aint Punisher for nothin
Keep huffin and puffin Ill blow your face in
When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seising
Chasing popo out of puerto town loco til I part the ground
In my coffin tossed into the lost and found
Down in deep beneath the weather in my leather job
Six feet forever halfasleepBronx niggas never die
I be the orphan maker off the coffin breaker awesome organ shaker
Work invader Jordans flossin often and the chocha taster
Clique vodka knickerbocker wicked boxer sickest monster
March Scala uppercut them thick sponsors you dickchompers
Incredible tendencies dragon blood in the pedigree
Immortalized in every rhyme beat you down for like centuries
Impressin me Barely Your life is not necessary
Im Peter Pan to you fairies nefarious action bearing
Criminal lyrically Im parallel youre minimal
Keep on talkin shit Ill put your body with the minerals
Grow a tree known to be explosivesee no holdin me
Fix a thousand blunts so you can kinda match my potency
Oceandeep inside your moms esophagus
Gargle it and hock a spit
Shut up little nigga give your moms a kiss
Pitiful and we never stumble on the lyrical
Even if we stutter we will still shshshit on you


You know exactly what you dealing with a captivating lyricist
Who get it in with a pen or extended clip killin it
Like children in the city of God we rock Timberlands
While chilling on villainous blocks you not built for this
Infinite skill is genuine realism
Apparently I give you a clear picture
So you understand Im not playing with you better ask somebody
Go by my men who show me love loyalty and respect
Or your family crying as you lying
Thats my word Im standing by
The red dot on your head will leave you absentminded
For acting live the man whos wiser advances higher
If you think lifes a bitch the passions dying
You lack the fire to satisfy the smasherriders
Thinking they can see me are merely blinded by their denial
Its a clear reminder theres levels I continue rising
You and your feelings are for women I have the finest
My calibers incredible Shaq is a regular
Hunting down your sector or moving like the Predator
Camouflage injectera rhyme rectora
Frontline connector of drastic measurea
Round One recommendera in the splendor of
In my crib I create send your ass upstate
Im remarkable remake you remind I retake
I was born this great you reenact your fate
Fool niggas in the boroughs better activate
Expeditiously Shaq will get loose on brakes
Twentyfour hours seven days a week
My God tell me what yall know about me
I blow up your block like a M80
A blockbuster whether or not my styles gutter
Niggas talking shit damn yall cant fade me
You the past bro gone like the 80s
Break it down Shaq a few of these emo got that back black
From Brooklyn to Orlando we play topofthestacking em
We racking em tray two on the knapsack clickclacking em
With caliber having a good time getting back at em
TWIsM get wism recognize the ONealism
Soul survivor I strive more beats is what I give em
I live em eat swallow and breathe one heard you need one
Word is bond put that down on my only seat son
Running fullcourt five mics in The Source
Elbows and knees please give respect to the boss
The onthereal the ontheregular the goforjugular
The rap smuggler the givingpropstoSmoothedaHustler
Rappin is fundamental sole survivor in the nation
You face it the crew next a few man lace em
The bigger we are the harder we hit
The harder we hit  What nigga 
Lyrically fit for this type of shit
Push us in a corner and were coming out
Fighting what youre writing aint important
Not the spite its full extortion
The bigger we are the harder we hit
The harder we hit  What nigga 
Lyrically fit for this type of shit
Push us in a corner and were coming out
Fighting what youre writing aint important
Not the spite its full extortion
Full extortion
