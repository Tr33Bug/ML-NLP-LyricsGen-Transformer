Mamma I dont understand
Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now Im on the run
Dear mammahhhhhhh what have I done
Somebody save me I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin to play me
Couldnt hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin my girl like she was hoein on tour
And knowin Im raw money tried to play fly
I said whassup to the bitch why she couldnt say hi
That aint right I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles
I put em in his face
I didnt have to disgrace myself I hate myself
AHORA A TU BLAH BLAH Brace yourself
Thats the law the streets are like basketball
Sometimes you shoot sometimes you pass it off
Cant always take a shot make one mistake you upstate for what
Too much hate time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I aint tryin to see em
I love a brother doin triple life but I aint tryin to be him
Thats why I be on the low and keep my feet in the row
Cause theyre tellin me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whaddayknow Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody for steppin on my kicks  STUPID 
Mamma I dont understand
Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now Im on the run
Dear mammahhhhhhh what have I done
I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my mamma head and Ima cry like a baby
She my heart and soul what Jimi Hendrix was to rocknroll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weaknesses but Punisher keeps it glizz
So dont pull out cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is  hold up thats the gas chamber
Think before you put on that skimask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger dont be so hard on yourself
Thats how youll end up twelve years old
Bein charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste tryin to figure the shit
Until I finally realized were just niggas and spics
Thats what they feel what can I do but just stay real
Keep somethin in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause aint no brothers runnin shit in the system
You goin straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
fuck you talkin about I live here
This is my buildin nigga fuck you nigga
Thats my daughter right there playin fuck off me
Get the fuck off


Mamma I dont understand
Why he had to fuck with me now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now Im on the run
Dear mammahhhhhhh what have I done
I dont have much time so Im only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma I love you and Im sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul I love you
Heyyyy mamamamma
I just killed a man
Mammaaaa what am I to do
