Ms Martin Lyrics
Yeah sometimes you gotta fool em
Sometimes you gotta send a woman to do a mans job knahmean
In this case my girl hit like a grown motherfuckin man
Yall niggas better lay low
Catch you where it hurt knahmean
Blow your balls off nigga
Where my girl at quick to bust the MAC better believe that
She always got my back nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack where the weed at
She dont know how to act cause thats my girl black
With that monster rap better believe that
You know the Bronx is back she represent that
Cause Terror Squad got her back some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap
I inhale the deepest cock back and bust rhymes at your speakers
Im troubled shoot out the air bubbles in your sneakers
The type to cop a Range along with all the features
Then take the back streets to avoid the leeches
A pregnant bitch talk shit Ima destroy her fetus
Her dead baby popped this pussy and his boys cant beat us
Straight strong armin bombardin and bogardin
Remy dont write her own rhymes nigga I beg your pardon
Its Ms Martin I done broke night in the studio writin
While fraud broads dont get no publishin still be bitin
They kill me lyin like they the ones doin the scribin
When you can hear the ghostwriter all up in they rhymin
I flows like water got this drizzle with little C
Catch me with Pun eatin Skittles in the middle of Little Italy
Yall dont know diddly I spit hot and drop shit
Every time I kick a rhyme Pun I burn my lip
Take another pull bust another shot yall cant stop me
Come through in a jail suit and the new Beef and Broccolis
Doin it If Im havin a good time and you ruin it
I seen a nice casket thatll look good with you in it
New improved shit the year start with a two shit
Next millennium sell a million Clue shit
Exclusive to tell the truth yall useless
Cause Im a dime that could rhyme you still on the deuce list
Where my girl at quick to bust the MAC better believe that
She always got my back nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack where the weed at
She dont know how to act cause thats my girl black
With that monster rap better believe that
You know the Bronx is back she represent that
Cause Terror Squad got her back some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap
Remy Martin dash reminisce slash
Remy cash like a check in a stash
Me without rhymes is like a flynt with no flash
Stripper with no ass car with no gas
Tryna go fast I love to hear the guns go blast
I love the sounds of the shells fallin down
Love to smoke weed stay blowin trees fuck liquor
When shit get thick I love to hear my bitches raise his clique up
You sick but Im sicker plus our guns is bigger
If you really wanna kill us do it nigga pull the trigga
How you figure you could really come and take whats mine
And all I gotta do is send a little letter to Rah
Hell send the troops out
My brother dont hesitate to pull a tool out
And Im his little sis so he taught me the same shit
Quick to flip but your name should be prickless
Cause every time you open your mouth you suckin my dick
Talkin shit as if you a soldiernigga
When you a no cash low class doja nigga
Yall rock rocks we bling bling boulders nigga
Look over your shoulder Im in the Rover its over nigga
Inhale cock back and bust just because
I know none of yall busters is touchin us
I got the thoroughest thugs and baby reminisces
That dont give a fuck with a aim that never misses
Hugs and kisses never just slugs and stitches
Thugs and bitches forever check the mugshot pictures
Fuck the weather I still got my tan Timbs on
Just copped the pink mink and winter been gone
I been on this thug shit yall cant seem to fuck with
My shit is hot dogs to top it off still spittin mustard
No fair cause I dont care I go to war wit a musket
Just give me some Oreos a jar of dro and two dutches
Cause Pun be the nicest motherfucker on the market
Now he got the nicest bitch what Remy Martin
Where my girl at quick to bust the MAC better believe that
She always got my back nigga twirl that
About to blaze a sack where the weed at
She dont know how to act cause thats my girl black
With that monster rap better believe that
You know the Bronx is back she represent that
Cause Terror Squad got her back some say heed that
My niggas love to scrap
