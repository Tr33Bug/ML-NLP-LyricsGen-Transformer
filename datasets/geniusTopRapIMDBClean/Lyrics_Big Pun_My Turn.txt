Cant do what I do
This is my game this is me

Yo its my turn I demand my respect
Give me my burn or get slammed in your neck
Cause its my turn Imma reach to the top
Gimme my burn Imma speak with the Glock
Cause its my turn dont make me turn your wig
Gimme my burn dont make me burn yo crib
Imma rhyme it right and keep the ghetto in a trance
But when the time is right me and the devil gon dance
Fuck you and yours make way Im comin through the door
And screw the law breakin the rules aint nothin new at all
Im true to all the shit that I done check the clip in my gun
Respect the clique that Im from or get lifted or somethin
Dunn you just a small fry fuckin with the fall guy
Big Pun the Honorable all rise
Skys the limit nothin less if my guys is in it
For the right price even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes thats how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
And lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build but math do be equally compatible
And secretively battle you to reach my peak in equilateral
Im from the streets deep in the barrio aint no Mario Brothers
Official Bronx niggas quick to body yo mother  ouch 
Yo its my turn I demand my respect
Give me my burn or get slammed in your neck
Cause its my turn Imma reach to the top
Gimme my burn Imma speak with the Glock
Cause its my turn dont make me turn your wig
Gimme my burn dont make me burn yo crib
Imma rhyme it right and keep the ghetto in a trance
But when the time is right me and the devil gon dance
Jesus H Christ how many times I gotta pay the price
You scared of death Ill make you twice as afraid of life
I bring sight to the game for every night you complained
You couldnt see the light I was bright in your brain
Ignitin the flame keepin your third lit
Speak and observe with the mind
What are blind sleep til they worth shit
Im earth wind and fire the first one to fire
Reppin T Squad since birth til I retire
I wire your jaw wire the walls with plastique explosives
And riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers moms live
Keep flappin yo gibs and Imma come back with those kids
From the back of the bridge
I think two hand touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips but Im truly assassin
Four hundred pounds six feet tall brutally handsome
Thats the pro got beef with Pun you gots to go
Mafia style tear you a new assahole
Flash your dough but you too cool for the captain
Cause I dont give a fuck if I was quadruply platinum
And to the 50 Cent rapper very funny get your nut off
Cause in real life you dont know
Ill blow your motherfuckin head off  ooh yeah 
Thats my motherfuckin word you understand
Thought we was a fuckin joke Shit
Terror Squad nigga you dont know me
You dont know my name dont say it you understand
Told you before I aint no motherfuckin rapper understand
Shit I dont make no songs about rappers I dont like
If Imma make a song its gon be how I beat yo motherfuckin ass understand Thatll be the name of the motherfucker
Thats Why I Had to Beat Your Motherfuckin Ass
