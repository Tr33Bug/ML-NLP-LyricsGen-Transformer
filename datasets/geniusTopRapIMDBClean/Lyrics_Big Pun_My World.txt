Uhh yes yall baby
Yeah yeah work it out
Work it out dawg work it out now
Uhh yall motherfuckers big dawgs in the house what
Terror Squad what Terror Squad what
I aint a rapper I just bust a lot off the top
What yo yo
The penalty is death especially when Im mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble cause they aint sayin nothin
If aint blazin somethin with the MAC Im in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toastll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke aint no more debatin my squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgination of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat gas and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real dont get left in the hills
My tec and my steel turn your whole crew into vegatables
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agendas in and out
Unseen like I entered the ninja
Its my world girl either love it or leave
If you was my girl youd be thuggin the weave
Suckin the blow pop with a ring in your tongue
Baby dont stop thats how you bring it to Pun
If this is my world Id be Tony the man
Call me The Godfather controllin the fam
Runnin the whole coast Id be a mafia king
Nothin but the finest diamonds in my watch and my rings
Stupid gimme yours
You be lookin bunny rabbit
Give your pants bunny rabbits what you know about that
I aint about to pop you stupid
Fuck the small talk niggas know Pun keep the fo cocked
Dont walk too fast might pass through the wrong block
Dont stop keep it movin the streetsll ruin
The average man faster than the motherfuckin teamsters union
We doin dirt cause we gotta five dolla a hour
Three kids and my motherfuckin big mama
My Sig Sauer got different plans God knows Im just a man
So hide your wrist if its glistenin
Listen man we just niggas tryin to work it out
Listen friend strictly biz its nothin personal
We thirsty now and I aint drinkin out of plastic cups
Platinum plus  Thorough  crystal glasses with the fancy cuts
Fancy us livin life lavish
Drippin ice cabbage livin in the six with some white bad bitch
Tight package I gotta pass
Im from the ghetto nigga I like a lot of ass
Its my world girl either love it or leave
If you was my girl youd be thuggin the weave
Suckin the blow pop with a ring in your tongue
Baby dont stop thats how you bring it to Pun
If this is my world Id be Tony the man
Call me The Godfather controllin the fam
Runnin the whole coast Id be a mafia king
Nothin but the finest diamonds in my watch and my rings
Word life T Squad holdin it down yknahmean
Gettin this money by any means baby
Let me get the fuck up outta here fore I break somethin
