Cause Imma ride for my niggas die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til Im high with my niggas

Fresh out the box oiled and cocked Glock 21

Cause Imma ride for my niggas die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til Im high with my niggas
Hold me down Pros
Aiyyo its off with his head
Put that nigga to sleep and make a coffin his bed
I come from rough times where niggas bust 9s and be like fuck rhymes
And puff dimes living on front lines and lust crimes
You better trust mines Im down for the cause
Gimme a round of applause and hear the sound of the 4s
Cause Imma ride for my niggas die for my niggas
