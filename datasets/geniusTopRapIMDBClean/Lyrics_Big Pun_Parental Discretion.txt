Ayo Im hard to talk to
If you live I probably fought you
Stalked you where you walked through at night
Caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy got Pataki scared
This town aint big enough for both of us and I aint goin nowhere
There it is plain and simple
Like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow they brains out they temples
Im into black magical torture
Romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker like Tony when he gassed Sosa
The masked enforcer out for the cash and the chocha
Smash the coca bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up you do what Swallow the stuff
I dont give a fuck anymore
Im only 24 years old and Ive already broken every law
Im horrorcore this is for the heads
Runnin up in your crib now if you still hidin under the bed
Parental discretion advised Cover your eyes
Little kids  get out of here This shit is homicide
Drugs and money this aint no Bugs Bunny
Little girls too this aint for you its for the thugs honey
Ayo my shits the truth 150 proof no question
Parental discretion advised keep out the eyes of the youth
Its too explicit bullshit I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight its like theres no rights
Thats why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I fight the power spike the powder  the 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change things rearrange but I stay the same
I played the game for the wealth until Ive made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper thanks to Joey Crack
For the chance to do it my way like Frank Sinatra
I aint an actor so its all facts strictly raw rap
Totally intended for yours dressed in all black
With the ski mask or the pantyhose
Makin cameos in liquor store cameras with the twin Calicos

So forget the boom
One look you shook  you know Im stickin you
Liftin you off the ground look down  thats where Im puttin you
Look in my eyes and remember me how does it feel mentally
Havin the enemy be the last thing you ever see
The recipe is death and Im the chef fricasseein your flesh
Be my guest but I aint cleanin the mess
Me and TS we testin niggas faith just to see they face
Expression when destined to states that death be in the case
Im in the state of grace in the hated race by the pagan face
Couldnt fight us made a virus gave us AIDS
I paved the way cause they aint get me yet
Wet me or affect me yet
I know they comin they just tryin to let me sweat
I recollect when I was just a boy eatin Chips Ahoy
Wasnt allowed to raise my voice now Im makin noise
No more toys strictly MACs and missiles
Shorties with forties packin pistols
Catchin bodies makes you official
So they say I pray theres a better way
My kids dont do as I do they do as I say cause daddy dont play

Word is bond
One thing about MCs is that we dont conceal the truth
We present real pictures about the positive and the negative
So dont blame the hiphop
When your seed is learnin the real life from us
Do your duty at home and raise your child in the house
Parents you dont do your job
We gonna put your children to bed at nine oclock
Past your bedtime
You get your ass in bed you aint posed to be hearin this shit
Word up PUNISHMENT motherfuckers
By the Punisher and Busta Rhymes hah
Terror Squad Flipmode Squad niggas
