I was the luckiest man on Earth my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than giving birth
My first verse explains some of the games she was playing
Im blaming myself cause in my wealth
Was where her pain would haven
Behaving like a moneyhungry hooker
Funny how the money took her
From a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreaming wasnt sober
Told her how I felt gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fucking belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Should have drowned you when I found you
Crushing in my boys Camaro
I didnt bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor you aint shit like my mother said
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
Ive been so bad so bad
Wont you come back please
Nah baby Im not gonna be able to do it you blew it
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid girl whyd you do it
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
Its hard maybe we can make amends be friends
Were only hurting all of us for certain by forsaking him
Just take it in dont even say a word observe the way you were
Preserved these words so you wont play the herb
Ever again never pretend that he doesnt have a father
Im always there and you dont wanna bother
I honor my word on my fathers grave
Guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resisting
Im insisting you chill for real before you come up missing
Listen I dont wanna fight Id rather do whats right
A boy needs a father thats the most important part of his life
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
Ive been so bad so bad
Wont you come back  Cme back baby 
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
Ive been so bad so bad
Wont you come back please


I gave you everything love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldines
Several dreams of cream fulfilled the green Deville
Cadillac to mack matter fact redeemed to bill
I mean for real I aint playing mami
How you wanna stay Armani fresh
Giving the next nigga my punani
You want me back cause he hit it wrong now you wanna get it on
With the Long Don word is bond my shit is strong
Come back  Girl dont even start again I beg your pardon
And get your hands off my sixbutton Cardigan
This aint no love lost between us far as Im concerned
Please leave cut that busted weave Ive been dying to burn
Go buy a perm try and earn some respect
Its better to have loved and lost than to live with regret
Come back  Come back baby  to me
I want you to
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
Ive been so bad so bad
Wont you come back
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
Ive been so bad so bad
Wont you come back
