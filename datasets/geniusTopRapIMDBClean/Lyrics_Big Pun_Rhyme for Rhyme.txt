Enter my world of doom consume fear and feel the panic
I ram a lightning bolt between the earth and the moon and curl the planets
Im bell Atlantic with lyrics expanding for galaxies
Battle me mathematically Im giving your wisdom a cavity
Rapidly flowing controlling the time jump over the line
Im blowing your mind with just a flow of the rhyme
Im Hogan in his prime too strong and fast niggas could bomb and blast
Cmon you still be on your ass
Im satisfaction guaranteed spit fiction like Quentin Tarantine
Kick you in your baddest dream shit you havent seen
I have to be perfectly honest
We should have an anniversary to acknowledge the way I work the Ebonics
I verbally vomit on novice niggas that try to kid us with garbage lyrics
My style delivers outside the outer limits
Im like the pyramids cause every point is precise now you know me for life
3 pound Cuban studded with ice
Yo as dea predicted Im in my PJs waving a biscuit
Cops raided my lab and enslaved my mistress
When I speak you listenin The way I rhyme I leave precision
Until your mind freak your mic out in each position
The 5 40 out piped out with deep dishes
Check the flow never test it yo
I manifest it like drug connects pitch and blow
Destined for greatness check they way my necklace glow
Fake niggas hate this You think something sweet about me
Come taste this 9 in your face kid
