Still Not A Player  Clean Version  Lyrics
Dont wanna be a player  TS 
I dont wanna be a playa no more
Im not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for
For my thugs  I dont wanna be  for my thugs  I dont wanna be a playa no more 
I dont wanna be a playa no more
Im not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Whos down to crush a lot
Hey yo Im still not a player but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah see you later Im gone
Penthouse suite Penthouse freaks
In house beach French countess ten thou piece
Rentout lease with a option to buy
Coppin a fiveoh Benz for when Im not far up in the sky
Puffin the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin PJs
Now we reach the peakage runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride it wont cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my Im big huh I rip my through your hooters
Im sick you couldnt measure my  with six rulers
Hold up chula Im all about getting loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get HOOF
I dont wanna be a playa no more
Im not a playa I just crush a lot  No more 
But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for
Uptown baby uptown
I dont wanna be a playa no more
Im not a playa I just crush a lot  I dont wanna be a playa 
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Whos down to crush tonight
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass
I dont discriminate I regulate every shade of the
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat and breasts highly intelligent bachlorettes
Thats the best I wont settle for less
I wanna ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
Its hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional Im let you know
Once I put the blows get your clothes cause you got to go
I could go downstairs little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty Twin I dont care
Round here they call me Big Pun if you with the big guns
Thick tongue known to make a chick  come 
In the  hot tub poppin bubbly
Rubbin your spot love got you screamin Punish me
But it dont stop watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like Dont stop get it get it
In the  hot tub poppin bubbly
Rubbin your spot love got you screamin Punish me
But it dont stop watch the Pun get wicked
When I even Luke be like Dont stop get it get it
I dont wanna be a playa no more  Punisher Punisher Punisher Big Punisher 
But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for  Punisher ooh Big Punisher 
I dont wanna be a playa no more  Punisher Punisher Punisher Big Punisher 
But you know Big Punisher still down by law  Punisher ooh Big Punisher 
Whos down to crush a lot
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
No more rollin with an entourage
Unless its Pun and the Terror Squad
Punisher Punisher Punisher Big Punisher
Punisher Joe and Big Punisher
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
Boricua morena boricua morena
