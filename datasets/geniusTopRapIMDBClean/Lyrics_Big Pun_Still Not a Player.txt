Ayo Im still not a player but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah see you later
Im gone penthouse suite Penthouse freaks
Inhouse beach French comtesse 10 thou piece
Rentout lease with an option to buy
Coppin a 5 or Benz for when Im not far up in the sky
Puffin the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin PJs
Now we reached the peakage runnin trains for three days
Who wanna ride It wont cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
Mama Im thick huh Ill rip my prick through your hooters
Im sick you couldnt measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up chula Im all about gettin loot
But Ill knock that boot if you out to get koofed
I dont wanna be a player no more
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for
Uptown baby uptown
I dont wanna be a player no more
Im not a player I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Whos down to fuck tonight
I love em Puerto Rican to blackberry molass
I dont discriminate I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts highly intelligent bachelorettes
Thats the best I wont settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
Its hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional Ima let you know
Once I put the blows get your clothes cause you got to go
I could go downstairs little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty Twin I dont care
Round here they call me Big Pun if you with the big guns
Thick tongue known to make the chicks cum
Up in the hot tub poppin bubbly
Rubbin your spot love got you screamin Punish me
But it dont stop watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like Dont stop get it get it
Up in the hot tub poppin bubbly
Rubbin your spot love got you screamin Punish me
But it dont stop watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like Dont stop get it get it

But Big Punisher still got what youre lookin for
I dont wanna be a player no more
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Whos down to fuck tonight
