Ayo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles your back and shackles and laughs at you
Thats a mathematical madness Im on
The savage the strong
The marriage and bond of havoc and song
This massacres on as if Picasso laced you
Theres lots of hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
Im possum at grade school
Thats why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable slashing your facial
Thats how a master degrades you Im battling Jesus
If he passes through my label Im snatching his halo
God Ill trade you if you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and its hypnotizing
Im only emphasizing
Im still all about business and enterprising
Im super lyrical with brainbooster chemicals
Thats used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable
Lyrically Im supposed to represent
Niggasll tell you that Im nice with the blah blah blah
Lyrically ImIm supposed to represent
Black Thought the super lyricist your archnemesis
Still with the Punisher thats my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they dont really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up like uppercuts
Newfound ways of ripping shit up I develop
Your squad chest swell up still youre miniayture to me
Natureally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record long like a epic
Immerse you in some old next shit ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph somethin like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf cause what
Lyrically Im supposed to represent
Niggasll tell you that Im nice with the blah blah blah
Lyrically Im supposed to represent
You will lose I must break you
Lyrically Im supposed to represent
Niggasll tell you that Im nice with the blah blah blah
Lyrically ImImIm Im supposed to represent


Ayo peace Roots East Coast niggas reppin the streets most
With heat toast and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those niggas thatll lift your mentals
Lyricsll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental
My instrumentals the Renaissance no resembalance
To nothing you come across lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis true believers
Just call me Baby Jesus cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavory
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way its all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
Ill leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thoughts just a fortress
Approach this ferocious upcloseness
Lyrically Im supposed to represent
Niggasll tell you that Im nice with the blah blah blah
Lyrically ImImIm Im supposed to represent
Lyrically
Its suicide
Lyrically
Youve seen him you know how strong he is
Lyrically
You cant win
Lyrically
Its suicide
Lyrically
Youve seen him you know how strong he is
Lyrically
You cant win
Lyrically
You cant win
Lyrically
You will lose
Lyrically
I must break you
