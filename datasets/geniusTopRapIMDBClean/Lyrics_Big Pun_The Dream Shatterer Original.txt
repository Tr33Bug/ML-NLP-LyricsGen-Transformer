The Dream Shatterer  Original  Lyrics
Aiyyo I shatter dreams like Jordan assault and batter your team
Your squadronll be barred from rap like Adam  Eve from the garden
Im carvin my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine off the board head
Reverse that I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cause he aint worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
Im the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow niggas be swearin Im blacker than coal
Like Nat King I be rappin and tounges packin
The ones magnums cannons and gatling guns
Its Big Pun The one and only son of Tony Montana
You aint promised manana in the rotten manzana
Cmon pana we be mob rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
A man of honour wouldnt wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda grammar
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
Im pure adrenaline uncut straight to the gut medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain Ill explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire Imma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava this scholar advisor is smart as MacGyver
To put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime  crime  fuck it I like the shine  shine  Up in the white and lime  lime  Comes with the pipe design
Plushed out  No doubt  Both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach GET THE FUCK OUT
Take a hike we can even battle to make it right
Go head lace the mic you finished Say good night
Head to head in the street Ill leave you dead in your feet
Settlin beef Ill even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it wont matter you dreams still gon shatter
Its a long ladder to climb and mine is known to stagger
So get outta town fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard desert bird player you outta bounds
3X
You know the Punll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
Ill come and get you and let the desert eez tounge kiss you
With one pistol and two clips Ill make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics Im charismatic my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear whipser in your ear
Crystal clear come here let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here you aint got to search further
The first murders the worst now I thirst further
For reverse birth every verse hurts every curse words
Already more offending than Eddie Murphs worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin his games tighter  IS A GOD DAMN LIAR
I set him on fire retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
The king of New York Lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town with a Mac hoodied down
Im no joke I soak your face with a sweeper
Die in disgrace or face your death through the speaker
4X fades out
