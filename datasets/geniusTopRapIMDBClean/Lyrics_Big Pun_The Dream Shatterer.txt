Ayo I shatter dreams like Jordan assault and batter your team
Your squadronll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
Im carvin my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cause he aint worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
Im the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow niggas be swearin Im blacker than coal
Like Nat King I be rappin in tongues
Packin the ones Magnums cannons and Gatling guns
Its Big Pun the one and only son of Tony Montana
You aint promised maana in the rotten manzana
Come on pana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
A man of honor wouldnt wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
Im pure adrenaline uncut straight to the gut medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain Ill explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire Imma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver could put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime fuck it I like the shine
Up in the white and lime clutched with the pipe design
Plushed out  No doubt  both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach GET THE FUCK OUT
Take a hike we can even battle to make it right
Go head lace the mic you finished SAY GOODNIGHT
Headtohead in the street Ill leave you dead in your feet
Settlin beef Ill even let you rhyme to the Benjamins beat
But it wont matter your dreams still gon shatter
Its a long ladder to climb and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard Desert Bird player you outta bounds
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
You know the Punll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
Ill come and get you and let the Desert Eez tonguekiss you
With one pistol and two clips Ill make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics Im charismatic my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear whisper in your ear crystal clear
Come here let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here you aint gotta search further
The first murders the worst now I thirst further
For reverse birth every verse hurts every curse words
Already more offendin than Eddie Murphs worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin his games tighter IS A GODDAMN LIAR
I set em on fire retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out ya brain and leave ya insane in the dark
The King of New York lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town with the MAC hoodied down
Im no joke Ill soak your face with a sweeper
Die you a disgrace or face your death through the speaker
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
