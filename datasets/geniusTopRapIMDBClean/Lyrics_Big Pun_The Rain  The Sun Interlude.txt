The Rain  The Sun  Interlude  Lyrics
And though the rain
Keeps fallin down
I know the sun
Wont wash away
And though the rain
Keeps fallin down
I know the sun
Wont wash away
You see thats what I do
I sing thats my outlet
You need one
I aint no fuckin singer
But you are
One of the best Ive ever heard
When you rhyme
Its like its like music to me
Its magic
Dont ever take it for granted
You have a gift
And though the rain
Keeps fallin down
I know the sun
Wont wash away
And though the rain
Keeps fallin down
I know the sun
Wont wash away
You have to share it
Understand
Come on Pun
Just try
One time
Then they all know
You understand
Then they all know
That you the one
And though the rain
Keeps fallin down
I know the sun
Wont wash away
Yeah yeahyeah
Like that Twin
You got it
Now they all know
Got you Props
You know I got you Twin
Much love
