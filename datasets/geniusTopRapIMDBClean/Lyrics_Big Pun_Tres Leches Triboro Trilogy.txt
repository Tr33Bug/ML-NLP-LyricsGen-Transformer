Tres Leches  Triboro Trilogy  Lyrics
Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Wake you up and as I stare in your
Wake you up and as I stare in your
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember P the one you got your whole style from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got your rhyme style from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember P the one you got your rhyme style from
Yo its the P cut and scratched
Yo disperse from off this who the culprits
That claim to be the newest rappin bullshit
My rhymes get Ruger endorsements
My song boost Intratec sales through the ceiling
Lets talk with guns convos til the police come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like its Hamburger Hill for real
Its Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit stuck on some wild out shit all about it
We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith pull out long fifths extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the cliqueah sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the HAVOC nigga
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got the technique from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got your freestyle from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Deck I told yall Protect Ya Neck
Im Rebel INS your highness cut and scratched
Fake one take one no ultimatum face one
Theres no escape from
Straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue make one false maneuver  you a mystery
Unsolved the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove Bowery suits and purple gloves
Me and you can have some fun make it a blast
You couldnt take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war still tradin slugs gettin major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You privatize home in but cant seem to clone
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun the one you bit your whole shit from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun the one with over a thousand guns
You start to suffer cut and scratched
Yo Big Punishers ready
Prodigy Deck and me QB  Shaolin  and Bronx trilogy
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth swing on your worlds piece
Foil your plans boil your grams take your shine
Fold all your hands spoil your mans make him mine
Take all you made call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin got the nueve right behind your melon
Aint no tellin when the bullets behind the trigger
I do it to live niggas and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldnt survive nigga if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear showin your whole vocal
Who told you you could roll through
My lyrics practically rose you from the grave like The Crows do
I told you a long time ago dont ever fuck me
Cause if I leave you half dead consider yourself very lucky
Very ugly from the face up leave you laced up
Joey Krillz Pros Cuban Link Triple Seis WHAT
Soon you start to suffer
The RZA
The Inspectah Deck
Yo its the P
The Punishers ready
