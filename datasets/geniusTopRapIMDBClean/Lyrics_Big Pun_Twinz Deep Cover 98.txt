Twinz  Deep Cover 98  Lyrics
I can feel it 
Ready for war Joe how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops thatll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer the Punishers ready
Meet me at Vitos with Noodles
Well do this dude while hes slurpin spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin floor
Joey Crack  buck em all
If they move Noodles shoot that fuckin whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
Little did we know that we riddled two middlemen who didnt do diddly
Itll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldnt hesitate to kill
Im still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mothers wake
Smack you then I whack you with my snub treight
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your familys children
Like Amityville and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin
Insanitys buildin a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanitys dealin
A villain without remorse whos willin to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support
I support Pun in anything he does anything he loves
A brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me
One of the best might be even better
Leavin niggas kneelin on they right knee
Spike Lee couldnt paint a better picture
You small change Im blowin out your brains gettin richer
Hit you with the MAC  MAC 
Smack your bitch nigga what
You gettin stuck My trigger fingers itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels  Jewels  cruisin in the Land bumpin Cash Rules
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryna pass through
Thats true  So who the next to get it 
TS  the best that did it
Get it off your chest kid admit it and its 
Yeah And you dont stop
Twentyshot Glock with the copkillers fill em to the top
Yeah And you dont stop
Joey cracks the rock and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah And you dont stop
Well make it hot nigga what Bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah And you dont stop
Its still 187 on an undercover cop
Fuck the police I squeeze first make em eat dirt
Take em feetfirst through the morgue then lodge em in the deep earth
The streets cursed the First Amendments culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight I hold my rosaries tight as I can
Im one man against the world
Just me and my girl  Black Pearl Latina ms fina but keeps it real
You know the deal we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it its no secret watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it
Creep with me as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin ass as I blast off heat
And you never see me talk to police
So you should know that I really dont care
Pull you by the hair slit your throat and Ill leave you right there
So beware  its rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun  speak and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets
Fuck peace I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin
Catchin niggas while they sleepin no relaxin
Keep your eyes open sharp reflexes
Three TECs is in the jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors Terror Squad  ghetto scholars
FullAClips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until Im locked and shot down
Heather B couldnt make me put my Glock down
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine I bust mine every time
Plus Im the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it  go and get it
Set it baby and Ima bury ya
So remember the Squad that Im reppin
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas til its Armageddon
Yeah And you dont stop
Twentyshot Glock with the copkillers fill em to the top
Yeah And you dont stop
Joey cracks the rock and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah And you dont stop
Well make it hot nigga what Bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah And you dont stop
Its still 187 on an undercover cop
Yeah And you dont stop
Twentyshot Glock with the copkillers fill em to the top
Yeah And you dont stop
Joey cracks the rock and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah And you dont stop
Well make it hot nigga what Bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah And you dont stop
Its still 187 on an undercover cop
