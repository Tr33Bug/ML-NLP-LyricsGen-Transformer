You got to watch those jokers who pop those
You know those crustylipped snotnosed
Easy to spot those actin rah rah talkin blabla
Thats caca chill papa no ahahh  ahahh 
Im quick to dumb out run up in yo crib with the guns out
Spray your peeps smack the baby teeth out your son mouth
Who can stop me I told shorty Ima shoot you papi
Caught him in the crapper with the clapper
While he was doin caci
Ill probably die in jail  make it through life and fry in hell
Either way Ima lead the way cause only timell tell
I rhyme for real not that imaginary vocabulary
I really will stab you and every one of my adversaries
Theres no remorse  fuck these thug niggas show me the boss
Gimme a hustle worth the risk of goin up North
I love my freedom and you know I love my bein
So sometimes I gotta get ugh and mug for my per diem
Ill see him in hell well settle it there better it there
And no innocent bystanders to get hit with a spare
Like I really care who catches strays from the MAC
Like I really care who you paid to rap on your track
Nigga you wack  you aint bringing nuttin for us
I got songs with the Devil and Jesus singin on the chorus
You cant ignore us nigga you know how we roll
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
You got to watch those jokers who pop those
You know those crustylipped snotnosed
Easy to spot those actin rah rah talkin blabla
Thats caca chill papa no ahahh  ahahh 


Cant no comp come at me this battle the Bronxll back We got the nicest niggas alive talkin bout Papis nasty
Cocky crafty like Rocky sassy Puerto Rock Apache
Posse not even the cops could catch me
Im too fast  fourhundred pounds but I move ass
Soon as you spoke I already smoked you with two jabs
My game is tight  you wanna play just name your price
Fame to ice your brains your life the game is sheist
And Im the trifest on the field
Even in school I was nominated the most likeliest to kill
This bastard steal a full clip and a extra
And Imma blast ya til your whole click respeta
Leave you muerta it aint me its the metra
tate quieta the bitch got a bad temper
Dont surrender  you aint got a chance
You be lucky to leave here halfdead in an ambulance
So take a chance but expect the worst
Put my foot so far up your ass
The sweat on my kneell quench your thirst
You got to watch those jokers who pop those
You know those crustylipped snotnosed
Easy to spot those actin rah rah talkin blabla
Thats caca chill papa no ahahh  ahahh
