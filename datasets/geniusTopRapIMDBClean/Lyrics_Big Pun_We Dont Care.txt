And holdin the Glocks call to the cops Im blowin the spot
Baby better head for the hills my niggas wild for the night
My lead ready to peel this shit really real
My clip really filled your chick better chill

No survivors frozen Godivas or roses and flowers
Sour the grapes of those opposin the Squaders
Thrown in the garbage like funky pajamas
