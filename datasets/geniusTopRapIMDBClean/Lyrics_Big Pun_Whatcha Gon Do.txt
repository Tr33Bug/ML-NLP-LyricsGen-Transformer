Its hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame
My college terrain was the rugged streets from Harlem to Queens
Back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
That started this thing called rap where I reign supreme my team
Regardless of that Ive seen things as far as a crack
Thatll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
Im part of all that thats why its so hard to go back
And start it from scratch
Im locked and Im trapped in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin days
I have left to the form of flesh
Should I lie in my grave
Im tryin to persuade my mind to try to be brave
And not give death the satisfaction of seein me dyin afraid
Thats why I rise from the grave singing church songs like
I was Jesus Christ barumpumpumpum
Whatcha gon do when Pun comes
Knockin at ya front door
And he wants waaaaaaaaaaar ooooh  holy shit  yeah
He aint a rapper hell kill you
Till my last breath Ill have death before dishonor
come on  and welcome drama  yeah 
Wit open arms and a code of honor
My whole persona equals that of gods
Definin matters hard and more before you even had a job
Ill stab and rob if I have to
Fuck it ill blast you tell the devil it was Pun if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin um
Show em my emblem the tombstone the throne every millennium
A child is born that can perform at a level beyond
The expected 4 minute 30 second song
We reign supreme my team be all up in ya dream
Wit the kill anything grill chillin beside the guillotine
Executioner style black suit and a smile
Whos next to get they neck hacked loose in the crowd move from the aisle
Dont make me have to prove that Im wild
Word to Cuban my crew killers yall niggas shoot in the clouds
Whos in the house 
Punishers straight from hell Whos in the house
Terror Squad motherfucker we the real 
Whats the deal now you know thats how we roll
Hard core like BO bring in the chorus baby bro
