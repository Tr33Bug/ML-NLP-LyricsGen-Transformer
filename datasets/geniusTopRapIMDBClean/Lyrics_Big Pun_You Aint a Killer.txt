The harsh realities of life have taken toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
Take control Im makin dough but not enough to blow
JOs they lust my flows but ayo I dont trust a soul
Thats all I know or need to these evil streetsll meet you halfway and eat you alive tryin to survive illegal
Ill leave you lost mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then Ill stomp your corpse
Its the Bronx of course recognize the accent
One of the last livin stillinaction general assassins
Catchin any wreck blastin any TEC smashin any chest
Passin any test Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker
Sow what you reap or wake up
Shakin up a storm like Anita Baker
Ill take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satans fiery lake then I lock the gate
Make no mistake this shit as real as Joe
We follow the killers code
When we come for you tell me where will you go
Nowhere to run hide Ill find you and silence your screams
And even if you kill me Ill still be in your fuckin dreams
You aint a killer you still learnin how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Wont even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It aint where youre from its wheres your gat
Youve made a grave mistake
Shouldnt have come here you changed your fate
Your brainsll make their debut on the table
When I raise the stakes
The pain is great but only for a second
It starts strong then lessens
Just when you restin the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress  TS 
Blessed him with no regrets  yes 
Welcome to Hell son the threshold of death
Face the serpent I blaze your person
You get laced for certain leavin Jakes no trace to work from
Close the case like curtains
Im hurtin heads severely really tryin to bring the pain
Theres nothin more satisfyin
Than when you cryin screamin my name
Its not a game its Purple Rain floods of bloodstains
Big Puns my thugs name
Bustin my guns thats my love thang
Ill slit your jug vein and snatch your Adams Apple
John Maddentackle your corpse
To hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
Thatll have to hurt Ill work your body til it burst
Then curse tu vida like a Brujera verse
Im worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken your manhoodll be taken
Fakin like you Satan when Im the rhymin abomination
You aint a killer you still learnin how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Wont even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It aint where youre from its wheres your gat
You aint a killer you still learnin how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Wont even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It aint where youre from its wheres your gat
Its hard to analyze which guys are spies be advised people
We recognize who lies its all in the eyes chico
We read em and see em for what they are
Ds in undercover cars
Takin my picture like Im a fuckin star
Im up to par my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the minishottie
Ill body a nigga for a penny probably
Im obligated to anything if its crimerelated
If it shine Ill take it still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that Im the last edition
Properly a stats magician
Couldve went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now Im strictly out for cream
Doin things to fiends I doubt youll ever dream
My teams the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heavens kings
Down to the Devils mezzanine
Ive never screamed so loud Im proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick threetofive
So be advised the streets full of surprises
Its not what crews the livest
One that survive its whos the wisest
You aint a killer you still learnin how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Wont even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It aint where youre from its wheres your gat
You aint a killer you still learnin how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Wont even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It aint where youre from its wheres your gat
You aint a killer
