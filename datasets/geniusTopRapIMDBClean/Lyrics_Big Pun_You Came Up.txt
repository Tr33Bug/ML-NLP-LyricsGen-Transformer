Yo what the deal baby
I see ya aight
Still not a player but you still a hater
Ha Pun here where my horns at
Where my horns
Fa ye da da ya da da da da
Fa ye da da ya da da da
X2
Pun you came up
What what Makin it happen
From rappin on the corner to possibly goin platinum
But when we roll are you still ready to ride
Yo Ill be ready to ride and Ill be ready to die
Ayyo my word is bond
Long as Im alive Imma put it on
Coulda gone to jake shit thug nigga til Im gone
Weight of the Bronx Im flippin
Five boroughs thoroughly reppin
Lets unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
Cause everybodys checkin for Pun second to none
Cause Latins goin platinum was destined to come
The inevitable heavenly better than whatever you do
We eligible TS is incredibly credible
For the revenue we gettin you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
And it never quits
Take it from TSs top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker bombin tracks ever since
I was young I wasnt always Big Pun
It wasnt always this fun ayyo I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due lay a few
But I aint sayin who stayin true to the game
No names playin it cool just me and the crew
Holdin it down long as we round
We gonna keep sockin it to you like Homey D Clown
Goin down like Pac ready to ride or die nigga
Ladalelalalalala
Pun you came up
What what Makin it happen
From rappin on the corner to possibly goin platinum
But when we roll are you still ready to ride
Yo Ill be ready to ride and Ill be ready to die
Ayyo aint nothin changed Im still the same
The way you remembered me since the centipede
Harder big blacker back in the 70s
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on the block with Cuban and Seis
I still do but now its in the blue convertible eight fifty
My true niggasll always be wit me
The shifty kiss me tell me they miss me then try to diss me
Cause Im a rispy crispy for life sixties the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist but I psych em out
Though they like to doubt
I make em all believers once I let the Tyson out
Cause I can vouch for only a few only the crew
From the old school I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotter
Thats cool for a dollar
I wanna holla at my peeps thats reppin the streets
Wrestlin the beast of chest restin in peace
Blessin my seeds and watchin over us
Til I die Ill align the souls with mine and shine for all of us
Pun you came up
What what Makin it happen
From rappin on the corner to possibly goin platinum
But when we roll are you still ready to ride
Yo Ill be ready to ride and Ill be ready to die
Fa ye da da ya da da da da
Fa ye da da ya da da da
Fa ye da da ya da da da da
For my thug niggas thug niggas
