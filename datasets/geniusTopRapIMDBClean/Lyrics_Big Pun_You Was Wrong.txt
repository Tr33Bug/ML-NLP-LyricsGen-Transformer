Yall dont know
Aiyyo its on I see how niggas didnt learn
You is wrong thought the fire didnt burn
Its on me and Pun aint from the Bronx
Yous wrong nigga we can get it on
Aiyyo guns we toss em and bodies we auction
To his family we tell em he owed us a fortune
Gimme fortythou you can have your child you dont know
What I had to go through to clap this clown
Check my background
The last nigga to see you bleed
The last nigga to see you breathe
The last nigga you wish you shoulda believed
And Drag move quick blend right in the wall like a brick
The only thing you see before I blow off ya shit is my wrist
Cuz my hand the gun is covered in
Not this range when I pump this pistol its very rare I miss
Its damn near on your lips
Yall keep talkin like yall teflon with no weapons
Nigga Im pumpin my raw I aint thugging no more
Nowadays niggas run upstairs open they drawer
My circumstance you aint got that chance
Mines in my draw you get it
Thats means yall walks for two dicks so dont be stupid
And make me use one unless you not a bitch
Aiyyo its on you thought I was wack
You was wrong album double plat
Yo its on stop talkin shit
You was wrong get off my dick


How dare you doubt or deny Big Pun the undoubtable
The only rapper thatll pull out a gun and slap the shit outta you
You cant tell me nothing Ill clonk you and stomp out ya belly button
Im too violent for this rap shit I should be out somehwere killin somethin
Too quick to blast some niggas talk shit and dash
But I really will KICK YOUR ASS
Juggernaut I dont care if you a thug or not

On your mark get ready run Im sparkin everyone
Dont wanna get locked Stand back and watch
Where you from
How dare you come and try to shit where I eat
Fuck you nigga literally
Dick in your cheeks you rich in the street
But Im still gon hit chall niggas
Because up north you be tossin salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right nigga
Why cant you ever be wrong
Now its on from the Bronx where its at
You was wrong me and Pun brought it back
Now its on stay on with the gat
You was wrong its the Don Joey Crack
Who the fuck want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I dont chat on the phone cuz the phone tapped
You heard theres money on the block we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up till its rock get my dough back
You niggas so wack tryna compete
I blind you with heat Im the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Whos liver than me I aint know you really want it
Im like Christ niggas beg for they life when they see me comin
Aint nobody gonna stop my shine you outcho mind
Dont make me have to cock my nine pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Dons
Since ninetytwo Ive been proving that yall niggas was wrong
Aiyyo its on though Id stay on the block
You was wrong now Remi on the rock
So its on thought I wasnt gonna drop
You was wrong I was right all along
I told these niggas that I was the sickest bitch
And everytime you spit Imma spit some sicker shit
Ridiculous I reminisce and blaze the track
Type of shit make a nigga wanna play it back
Yall hatin that but Imma make em all believers
Fuck hot Imma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers Imma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin in a hospital hooked up the monitors
Thats for the game yall lames just came to first
Cuz I aint neva heard a bitch straight flame a verse
I blame the church how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for cuz you aint never rhymed like that
How the fuck you gon tell me that chick is tight
She aint aight cuz she dont write you wrong
