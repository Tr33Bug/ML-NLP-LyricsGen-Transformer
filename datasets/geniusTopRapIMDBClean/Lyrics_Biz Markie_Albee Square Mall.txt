On the mic at this time in the place to be
Im the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance make the music with my mouth and all
But Im here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if youre lookin
For me the Biz so just come check me out
Cause 247 Im mikin the house
So when I come in the Mall and then I start to roam
You wouldnt think its a store you would think its my home
Cause when I come in the place then I hang up a sign
Reads Home sweet home  this house is mine
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I been to many malls from state to state
But Ive never been in say one this great I hate
To say about the other shopping centers thats left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doodoodef
I be in there everyday walkin around chillin
From when they opened all the way until when
Its about time for the place to close
Im just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in party people I just might
So I could stay forever and it wont be just like
A bum that you see sleepin on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all been havin fun
See to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers there that try to compare
There aint no way they could hang out with Albee Square
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali and after that Ill
Go take a stroll inside of Gibbs Pups
Then buy some fresh silks Ballys too
Next stop Olympic wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While securitys riffin about leanin on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendys
In the Albee cafeteria could be shoppin plenty
From store to store just stuffin face
And I do the pfrronetwo while sayin my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
Thats where I be until the day is done
Just coolin in the place thats number one
So next time youll be in Brooklyn walkin around
Play like Price Is Right and come on down
And
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shop  lets all go shoppin  3x 
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shoppin  Swan and Biz go shoppin
Lalalala
Lalalalalala  till end
