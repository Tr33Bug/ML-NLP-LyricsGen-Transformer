I was on my way to 125th
I saw this def Benz yo thats my man Cliff
As I flagged them down he pulled to the side
At this moment I had to swallow my pride
Cause usually I wouldnt ask for a lift
But it was cold as hell and my legs was stiff
He said Hey Biz what you want a ride
I said Hell yeah he said I cant cause my girls inside
So he jetted off leavin two tracks
Not at one time did homeboy look back
It took me an hour to get where I was goin
And to top it all off it had to start snowin
My sneakers was old and my coat was thin
But my determination kept me goin within
I had nobody to help me as you can SEE
Im alone again naturally
Alone again naturally
So I went into the show and started maxin
People came up to me and started askin
Whassup wit me and when Im gettin on
And how many records is Shante gonna perform
I dont know but now I gotta go
Cause Shante is callin me to do the show
First she was on and then she called me out
I did a lot of funky beats without no doubt
I put the mic on my head and began to riff
The crowd began to flip cause I was rockin the shift
When we was done I started to laugh
Massive people come to me for my autograph
After the funk was over it was time to break
If I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake
As I saw Shante get into a limo
I had to walk home I wrote it in my memo
Im alone again naturally
All alone again naturally
Now Im aight nothin to worry
Wherever I wanna go I get there in a hurry
Thats right Im big time very well known
Now Im sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone
Right about now Im gonna explain
It was Cool V TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane
Doin shows all together as one group
None of us actin big headed or souped
Then after that we all formed a block
I paid everybody told them how they rocked
They all grabbed they props and when they seperate
Swan said Ill see you later Biz in a couple of days
When people see me leave like a mammajamma
Its like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour
But when Vaughn came home he thought I was in somewhere
With a girl was in bed nah
Alone again naturally
Im alone again naturally
Ahh ahh
