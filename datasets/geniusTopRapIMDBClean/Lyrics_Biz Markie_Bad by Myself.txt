Yeah yeah yeah
Oooooohh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah yeah yeah
Let me tell you a story now
I was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night
It was after the show and the moon was right
The  was really perked off the Red Zone
I was in my MPV I was all alone
A lot of outoftown people askin me for
My John Hancock or my signature
I gave it to all of them cause I was down to earth
And plus the Apollo is my home turf
So I walked across the street til Im on 125
I saw this pair of shoes that was really live
It wasnt just a pair of shoes that was on her
From the ground up she looked like a plate of lasagna
I said Hey shorty not you your hair
She turned around slowly and started to stare
She said Why dontcha take picture itll last a lil longer
Me likin you grew a little bit stronger
She asked me whats my name I said Emmezah emmezah
The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer
She asked me what am I drivin and how is my health
I know what youre really thinkin baby LET ME TELL YOU
I can do bad by myself
I dont need no help to starve to death
I can do that alone
I can do bad by myself
I dont need no help to starve to death
I aint tryin to be funny honey
She started arguin with me and say shes not like that
I know who you are I dont care if youre livin fat
Because I have a mother and father that take care of me
And Im livin in Long Island with a JOB
Okay okay I got you wrong I must admit
Ima give you a little time to see if youre legit
So we started goin out on a regular basis
I was takin her to the movies and my hangout places
Like the Q Club The Scene or The Arcade
I thought this relationship was tailormade
Cause she was sweet kind considerate I was hypnotized
Never thought shed try to pull the wool over my eyes
After I smacked it and flipped it she thought I was whipped
I know she is like a knockout but Im not gettin bullwhipped
She asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends
Because you got two MVs two BMs an SL Benz
What are you my accountant or the IRS
Why ya clockin everything that I posess
She want me to waste everything and be small as an elf
Let me tell you somethin baby let me tell you
I can do bad by myself
I dont need no help to starve to death
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I dont need no help to starve to death
I aint tryin to be funny honey
Now all her friends boosted her to get my dinero
Like if I was a drunk Mexican wearin a sombrero
I knew she had a boyfriend on the side
She told me yo she didnt have to hide
She said she cut him because he was too jealous
He always thought I was tryin to talk to other fellas
Its now the present and that was the past
From now on bein with me is gonna be a blast
I know she thought in her mind its gonna be great
Juicin and reducin everything I make
With her Victorias Secrets neglice
She tried to seduce me in every way
She would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow
She acted too true blue to be after my dough
My man Jeff told me but I didnt wanna listen
I was too hooked and strung out I thought he was dissin
Then she popped the question and asked me for some dough
I looked her in her face and said HELL NO
Youre a head nurse and you want my wealth
You must be CRAZY AS HELL cause
Let me tell you know
All day long you been talkin on the telephone
Braggin to all your friends about all the cars that I own
But YOUUUUUU dont tell em that Im the one doin it all
While youre out there livin it up and havin yoself a ball
Ummm whoahwhoah yeahyeahhhh
I can singinginging
