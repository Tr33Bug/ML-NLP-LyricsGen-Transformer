Hey kids shake it loose together
The spotlights hitting something
That is been known to change the weather
Well kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
Youre gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine ohho
BBBBennie and the Jets
Hey kids plug into the faithless
Maybe youre blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive let us  take ourselves along
We fight our parents out in the streets
To find whos right and whos wrong
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine ohho
BBBBennie and the Jets
Take it away
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got the electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine ohho
BBBBennie and the Jets
BBBBennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets
