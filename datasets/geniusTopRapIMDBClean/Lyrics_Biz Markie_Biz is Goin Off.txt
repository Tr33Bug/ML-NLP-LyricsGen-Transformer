Hey to everybody and people that say partyin
Its time to hear a funky rhyme from me the Biz Markie again
As I just display em the way I like say em
The stutter steppin style that I use to amuse and HEY
Im the original hellified kinging
For freaky sound for throwin down and you know that Im bringing
The crowd to enjoyment by what I do
Like ahowwoww WAHHAZOOW boom ah one two
I keep the people cheerin because of what they hearin
Movin and groovin to a devestatin sound thats glarin
Because theyre in the mood for me
The BIZ the EmmezahEmmezahARKIE
The party rippin never trippin king of crowd pleasin
I can turn it out without a doubt in any season
I entertain crowds a million and thous
Homeboys makin noise as I do browse through a girls blouse
Say the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked
I can turn it out with different sounds on my record
That I say give em as yall exault the rhythm
The magnificent record maker of Prism
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Go off go off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off

Ha ha ha ha ha Check out this bizarre
Rappin style used by me the BIZ
EmmARKI with the E and you will be agreein
A brother aint a brother unless he is say like Gn
Up with his technique and keep the people freakin
Like me the Biz Markie because my style is so unique and
Guaranteed to rock the mic with rhymes that I say
Im just as good as Clint Eastwood so wont you make my day
Markie the original yes I am the boss
And I can rock the microphone for you and yours
Go boom ah one two til my voice is hoarse
Then take a pause annnd you know of course
I can rock a party with so much force
Im the greatest entertainer Marley came across
Puttin pictures in photomat to give em a gloss
And I dont eat spaghetti without the meat sauce
Whether Ragu Prego Hunts or Aunt Millie
You wanna get dissed Then try to get illy
With me the inhuman because Im like boomin
Reagan is the Pres but so was Harry Truman
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Go off go off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Mark is ah goin off
The Biz Go off go off
Now I make rhymes each and every day
And always seem to come up with somethin fresh to say
In January February March April May
And the other seven months of the year but anyway
Hey feel the lay okay heres a rhyme I must display
When Im finished you be in it sayin HIP HIP HOORAY
I will be an emcee til Im old and grey
And I can even rock the mic with tooth decay decay
Yo  ladies of the 80s know that Im the
Original BIZMARKI say with an E
You know me and my man Big Daddy
I cant forget Cutmaster Cool V
And my partner my best friend TJ Swannie
Rockin the mic would say most definitely
So listen dont be missin I will never be dissin
I just rock the mic and always have discipline
Listen to the brother aint no other you discover
I rock up the mic just like if Im your mother
Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark
Repeat to fade
