Coming right out of your speakers
Never reaching a peaka
Perfection direction in any section
My style is kickin like Chinese Connection
Most Valuable Poet thirteen years strong
The island of Long is where I belong
Superb like Goldberg iller than Godzilla
I scared Michael Jackson into writin aThriller
The ginger ale sipper the freestyle flipper
Never see me in a pair of Grand Union brown clippers

For the next year you still gonna hear gonna hear
