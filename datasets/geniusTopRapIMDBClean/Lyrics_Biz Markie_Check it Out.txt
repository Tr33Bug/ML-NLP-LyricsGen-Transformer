Yo this is kinda slow
But I know the Jeeps gon be pumpin it
But this is this is one subject that nobody dont know about
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house
When you hear my golden voice you know its me
The poetical energetical rap MC
Well thats not the subject matter of to be cool
Im just tellin you girls and fly kids stay in school
I always reminisce when I was in class well
But you feel like a simpletone when you get expelled
Or even if you have a couple of days in detention
Its just as good as one bad suspension
So when youre grown up youll say the same thing
To your kids be in class before the bell ring
But you know kids is kids
To them high school is like a three year bid
Im not gonna tell a lie I used to cut class
Until the principal straight got in my ass
He said Biz the only way youre gonna get a BM
Is to get your education instead of hangin with him
So I got my head together and chilled the hell out
And now all the breakbreakers says is check him out
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house echoes
Now this is the second part of this lesson
Im sayin it this way cause its my profession
You dont have to go to high school to be an MC
But you got to know the value and means of money
Cause a lot of parents they are taxpayers
So its real stupid when you disobey a
Principal vice principal or even a teacher
Cause when you do that you know youll never reach a
Higher level or even your goal
Because you dont wanna listen to what youre told
So please take heed to what I say
I hope Im not sayin it for my health today
Cause if I am please tell me so I can stop
Its not like Im your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
So you can be educated and have clout
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house echoes
Im just tellin young people to stay away from drugs
Cause if you mess with that itll make you bug
Whatever you wanna like call it Im tellin you
Dont become a drug addict or alcoholic
Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is feen and complain
Cause Im tellin you just like this off the top of my head
Dont mess with it cause you will be misled
By other people devils and demons
Im Biz Markie Im not Alfred Simmons
Im just tellin you to do this without no doubt
Cause Im the Biz and I got the clout
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house
Check him out check him out check him out check him out
With the beat Im gonna rock the house echoes
Thisll go out to my man Def Jeff
My man Back Spin my man El Caban
Cant forget my Doctor Bombay
