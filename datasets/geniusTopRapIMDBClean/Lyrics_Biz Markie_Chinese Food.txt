Yo you know this is funky
Id like to say rest in peace to Aaliyah  sweet thing 
And Left Eye Lopes
But you know shout out to my man Bruce Lee
Jackie Chan check it out Jet Li
Imma bring it to you like this
Drop a three pointer from the corner like swish
Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap
Shell tops new and Space Invaders cap
Old school like bread and gravy
Me and Monty roll together like Fred and Grady
Aint nothin you can say to stop this mad man
Play Defender Centipede and Ms PacMan
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
In a house with no heat just kerosene
Call Biz Mark so you get the better connection
The type to wear Timbs to a wedding reception
Im so smart I even got a GED
Plus a videohoh BET and MTV
Im the best thing out now go ask your moms
Spendin money on cars just to pass the time
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice thats good
Egg foo yung 
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice thats good
Fried one time 
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice thats good
Mix it mix it up nice 
I need a coupe of egg rolls in my neighborhood thats good
Im the Uptown rhymer large like Big Momma
Keep three girls on the couch like Oh Drama
End every line with period no comma
Hidin out til Im found like Osama
Walk on water filled with pirahnas
Want the tie within coats with no liner
If I ever lose my girl I go find her
If not I got Shirl and Tawanna
Right back on ya yep the old timer
Any contract you got I no signa
Dont smoke or use drugs of no kinda
Everything that I wear is designer
Just like Dolce hang with Gabbana
Biz Mark play his part the show timer
Make any party hot like your sauna
Still keep the crowd controlled with no drama
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice thats good
Egg foo yung 
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice thats good
Fried one time 
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice thats good
Mix it mix it up nice 
I need some egg rolls in my neighborhood thats good
Its the Mmah ZahaYYAH Rrah ZahKaYYAH
When Guiliani leave I will be the Mayor
In the year twothou Im gonna house
Im still tryin to look up a girls blouse
Got a Hummer for the summer Benz for my girlfriend
When it comes to ice I got a lot of diamonds
Im hangin at the Rucker watchin skiptomyloo
Girls askin me to do the puh ah onetwo
Weather is good about eighty degrees
My XRay vision seein thongs and Gs
Thankin the Lord for the beautiful day
I seen people sippin on Tanqueray
Everythings the same in the new millen
Seattle is where they got a HipHop Museum
So listen to the way I rock the spot
Right about now Imma make you hot
Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice thats good
Egg foo yung 
Beef and broccoli with a little white rice thats good
Fried one time 
Chicken chow mein with a little white rice thats good
Mix it mix it up nice 
I need some egg rolls in my neighborhood thats good
