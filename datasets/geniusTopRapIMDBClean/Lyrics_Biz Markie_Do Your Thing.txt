Spit on the mic and dont you dare quit
When I get on the mic I guarantee
Theres no better MC than Biz Markie
Everything I say or anything I do
Will move yo posse or your crew
When you me hear me say and what I play
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
Well Im too cold to freeze too hot to burn
And I never miss a tag when its my turn
Cause I can rock the mic if you give me a chance
Cool Vll cut the record make you do the Biz Dance
I can  flip the crowd with a wave of my hand

You can do your thang and anythang you choose
But please please leave my thang alone
You can do your thang and anythang you choose
But please please leave my thang alone


Im the court jester the manifester
I used to buy my clothes at AJ Lesters
The rhymerator the beat creator
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The dime repeater the MC greeter
Knuckle bleeder no need for a heater
The only MC in history
Who didnt even have to RAP
The bum destroyer Im comin for ya
Got took to court and didnt need a lawyer
Make James Brown get down  yeah yeah 
Made Beretta go get her  yeah yeah 
Made Laverne and Bill Cosby  yeah yeah 
Go change they sweaters  yeah yeah 
I fought Mike Tyson dropped him in 4
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
And this is somethin for the radiohhhh
Got ladies screamin STRANJE STRANJE
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex Id be a porno star
With Sade and Janet in a menageatrois
Merrily merrily life is just a dreamah
First car I ever had was a Beamer
First girl I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris I gotta go  gotta go
repeat 2X w ad libs
