Aiyyo heres a tale about a female I once messed with
Or better yet skins that I swung eps with
Face full of grace waist shaped like Vanessa Del Rio ohmeoh my but the heffer had
Big juicy lips wide hips you had to call fat
Stacked back to mack yo the hooker was all that
And lots more and baby girl I had the hots for
But Im really not sure who she spread the twat for
Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
But I dont give a heck so I still went and checked her
On the down low he aint around so
Out of sight out of mind get your coat and lets go
So we dipped hopped in the whip and we was gone
Off to City Island cause they had it goin on
Two yuks a foo now the mood was set
Caviar at the bar Red Star Moet
Silk suits spendin loot like a straight up mack
When I felt somebody finger tappin me on my back
And turn around quick but before I could begin
All I seen was a big mac10 aiyyo its her boyfriend
Hooker got a boyfriend
Why do she do this boyfriend
Ohh ahhh why do she do this boyfriend
Check it yo
I broke camp ran like a champ yep I jetted
Off to the trunk for the pump time to set it
Money kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him
So I started lettin off gunshots but I missed him
Honey got scared and called the fiveoh
So yo you know the half Dukes time for me to go
Cause I aint the type to be doin no bid
For a dame or a lamebrained punk Spanish kid
So I chill call the hooker up the next day
She told me come over yo bet Im on my way
Be there in a sec yo Im not too far
She said Park around the back so he dont see the car
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
I said Sorry about last night money kinda wild
Umm yeah I know small thing dont worry
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry
Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
Got her buttnaked and before a second passed
I had her on the bed with my fingers up her ahh
Now shes ready set for a good steady bangin
Until she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin
She told me Take it easy yo trust me just chill
Knowin once I get up in it yo Im goin for the kill
So she spread em thick rich and creamy like mayo
Aiyyo layo the tip is on the wayo
Pinned her legs back just about to slide in
When the door burst open SLAM damn its her boyfriend
Did it again
Now Im mad money done spoiled all the fun
On top of that he beefin and he aint got a gun
Flippin the jibs I guess he wanted to brawl
So I started hookin all buttnaked and all
Threw a right caught money dead in the jaw
BOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now I had him time to put his head for rest
So I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed
Honey all hysterical and screamin all hoarse
Said she seen a box car pullin up in the yard
Just bout to jet yo guess what I saw
Some old big black HMMM bust in the door
Now hold up what the hell you doin in my house
Get your ass off the floor put your teeth in your mouth
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Look better yet yall stay right here
Im goin to get my gun
Now thats it Enough is enough I aint with it
Im catchin mad beef and yo I aint even hit it
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
But aint a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that
So umm I got my coat and I was on my way
Thats when she started breakin down and beggin me to stay
Knock it off it aint that much beggin in the world
Next time I want some skins Ill go and hit my own girl
Man Im out and I aint tryin to see you again
So eff you eff your pops AND YOUR FAGGOTASS BOYFRIEND
repeat 2X to fade
