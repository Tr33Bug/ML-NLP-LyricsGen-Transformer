Im An Ugly Nigga  So What  Lyrics
Hey hey hey know what I heard
Beautys only skin deep ugly is to the bone
Back in the days Im not gonna lie
They used to say Im ugly a hurting guy
They would crack on my lips and my powder
Saying I look like yuck without the house or Wig Howard
From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded
Just because the way I looked they said I farted
I was very very sad and you wonder why
Because my looks and my gear wasnt ultra fly
I wouldnt even attempt to ask a girl out
Cause she get around her friends and began to shout
Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend
It was Mark I told him if the world would end
But my parents told me beautys only skin deep
If thats true then why do girls think that Im a creep
I even joined the football team to get some recognition
But that didnt spark the key in a girls ignition
They said Im so ugly I give Anican a headache
Aw man that is the icing on the cake
So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts
I dont care what you think cause you all are nuts
Im an ugly nigga so what
If you dont like the way I look you can kiss my butt
Im an ugly nigga so what So what Ewwwww  Repeat 2x 
Im a tell you story thats really bugged
About a guy with a Benz and hes dealing drugs
In the begining before he got his riches
He was so ugly he gave me the itches
I mean if you see him you think I might be kooky
But homeboy looked like um Godzooky
I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star
And everybody laughed when I said Monstar
I cant laugh now because its a new decade
My guzufriend got the girls and got it made
I guess having jewels having money having a vehicle
Makes you sexy handsome gorgeous and adorable
When youre spending money giving girls what they want
Behind your back they talk about you say youre ugly and you front
Why do you go to bed with someone that you dont like
Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike
It would be wrong if he heard what youre thinking
Thinking that he look like um Stinking Jenkins
But let me tell you a secret he has ESP
And this is what he whispered in my ear to me


Im an ugly nigga so what
Just because I got loot thats why you give me the butt
Im an ugly nigga so what So what  Repeat 2x 
Let me tell you how poor I was
Dome to the doo and doo to the dome
For the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb
Now people always ask how are these things known
Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home
Thats why I keep a pick in my nappy fro
And for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe
But at night I be starving like Messy Marvin
I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain
They offer me a lot in the army
But Id rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army
Cause times are getting harder than boot camp
Man Im so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp
So if my hooptie breaks down I just have to suffer
And tell Minekie Im not gonna pay a lot for this muffler
So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run
But even on the beaches they call me a beach bum
Something aint right with me and that really frightens me
Cause nowadays girls dont even like to sprighten me
Some say Im embarassing but I got some comparison
Like if I was on TV I would be Oscar Madison
Is there another like me Only God knows
Man I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes
But for now Im just going to do the strut
And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts
Im an ugly nigga so what
Just because Im poor thats why you wont give me the butt
Im an ugly nigga so what So what  Repeat 2x
