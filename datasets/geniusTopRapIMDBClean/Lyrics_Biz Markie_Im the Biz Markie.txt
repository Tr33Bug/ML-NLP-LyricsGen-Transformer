Id like to introduce myself
Its me the diabolical Biz Mark symbolical
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now Im on the run again starting other capers
And people couldnt catch me even if I was The Vapors
I leave you in trauma with my funky personna
Cause Im jamming just like Teddy but Im nasty like Madonna
Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
Is like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on
I dont give a damn if my record gets panned
Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
When Im sure that Im pure like Snapple
Suppose when I write my rhymes like Im the Big Apple
Or New York or whatever you call it I dont even care
Cause if I can make it there I can make it anywhere
So I walk the walk through the streets of New York
Got more green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk
So dont try to stalk cause my style brings more
I rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B Shore
People always want to give dap to everyone
But Ive been around the world so I ahhh 
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Take a pause for the cause cause this is a recording
If rap was a prison then I be the warden
I do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans
And when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon
You want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave
And I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave
And when I drop a style call it def call it cool
As long as you dont call me when Im on a toilet stool
I stoke and swin in a room full of women
When I trot the globe like Meadowlark Lemon
Everywhere Ive been Ive seen em fat and thin
Even girls with hair on their chinny chin chin
But you can be just a friend if youre sporting your own look
Or if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Women love my style from Cali to Long Isle
Even got my mother singing Thanks for my Child
My temperature rises every time Im near a stereo
Cause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio
But I go on and on and on and on and on and
From midnight point to the early morning AHHHH
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet   Repeat 4x 
Its my way or the highway Im ahead of the slow lane
But when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train
Rappers like to flow with all energy and action
But Id rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson
So dont try to stick to me like somebodys gearshift
Cause Ill hit you so far west youll come back Easter
The style I display but I say it a badder way
I got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday
Youre still confused cause you dont know how bad he is
Like a pregnant  who dont know who the daddy is
Just like a snap I can whip any rapper
Thats why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper
Youre lost in the sofa trying to cross my line
Then run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind
Im coming on strong cause Im dropping nothing soft
Still had it going on when The Biz is Going Off
Im singing in the rain cause I got the audacity
Or some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy
You couldnt shine on my in the spotlight
Cause your ass couldnt shine if you sat on a flashlight
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet   Repeat 4x
