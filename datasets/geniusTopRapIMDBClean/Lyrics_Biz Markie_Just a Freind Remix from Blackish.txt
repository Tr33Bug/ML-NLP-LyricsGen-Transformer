Just a Freind  Remix from Blackish  Lyrics
Im on it
I just love coed baby showers
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
And you say hes just a friend oh baby
You got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend
I got friends and thats a fact
Like Zoe Junior Diane and Jack
Forget about that lets go into the story
About a girl named blahblahblah that adored me
So we started talkin gettin familiar
Spendin a lot of time so we can build up
