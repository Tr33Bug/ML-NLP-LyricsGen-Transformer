Did you ever feel like cryin and think youd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot flow to her heart
And think that you were there
Did you ever wonder where she is or wonder if shes true
One day youll be happy
