Ah one two ah one two
Ah one two ah one two
Id like to introduce myself
My name is ah Biz Markie
Well Im the human orchestra called Biz Markie
Makin music orally is my specialty
When I go BOOM ah one two girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite em
I know yall in the mood just go with the flow
And I can play rappin records and all disco
Like Beat It Billie Jean by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous Three record they call Action
When you hear me do it you will be shocked and amazed
Its the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Well I dont just do the beatbox I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin get the girls hearts pumpin
All the party people say Isnt he somethin
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music with my mouth
Imma tell you party people how I began
It started when Im livin in Long Island
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth all sorts of beats
Grown people used to say  WHAT
Grown people used to say  WHATS
wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboys basement party
They thought it was a record they aint know it was me
When they came by the DJ and saw who it is
They said Make the music with your mouth Biz


song continues as just a beat for a while
It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But its real difficult even knocked me out my socks
Its a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
Its not all about spittin breathin hard and chewin
You need practice be ambitious in the schoolin
Let me tell you party people you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
Thats why I like doin sounds thats hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you cant believe
When I walk down the street people crowd around me
And say HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time Biz Markie
I tell em it takes a lot of practice and lip control
Ive been doin it since fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it the people say Im good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
Im tellin you a fact its just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say Whattup Biz
Everywhere I go I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say Im the best
But Im guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS
You heard the beginning now heres the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
Thats why Im here to say today
That Im doin my beat in a special way
Makin musical tunes orally I have perfected
Im very well known and greatly respected
I like to thank people without no doubt
Peace hi party people its time to break ou
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Biz continues beatboxing and scatting to the end
