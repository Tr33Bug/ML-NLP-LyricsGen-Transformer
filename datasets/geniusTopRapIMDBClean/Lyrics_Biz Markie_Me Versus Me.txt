Im the original BIZ
The EmezaEmezaEmezaEmezaARrahKIE
Everywhere I go I always G
Im thinkin somethin that you never could see
Doin the beatbox and the RAP
Thats why Im the Inhuman Orchestra Biz Markie
Im here just doin my JOB
So I can reach the TOP
As soon as I get to the TOP
Then I will be DON with the E
I rock New Jersey and NYC
Whether its at a club or a block party
To my man Capri Starchild and Brucie Bee
Baby J and DJ Marty
The title of the song in the place to be
Is not this or that its Me Versus Me
Biz Markie beatboxes
Me versus me
I think its time to act up and throw a fit
Cause Im rockin to a beat that just wont quit
This is the real thing not counterfeit
Cause everything you hear Im doin it
The name of a baseball glove is a mitt
And what I need on my BMW is a kit
A preacher preaches from a pulpit
And my man Benny Hill got a lot of wit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit
The past tense for bite is called a bit
Everywhere that I go all attention I get
I used to live by the North conduit
The Biz Markie will always make a hit
This is one thing that I like to say
This is a different kind of rhythm and rap display
Im not Frankie Crocker or Lamarr Renee
Cause both of them are radio DJs
Otis Redding be sittin by the dock of the bay
Im bound to wreck your body to the break of day
And if you wanna see me at a show you gotta pay
Cause if you dont you will have a little delay
Zipdedoodah zipdeday
