This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Only people that knew him know what Im talkin about
And at the end of the story you will say without a doubt
This wasnt your typical case of fast livin
Anything he was makin he was givin
To his moms pops his brother and his girl
Cause they meant the most to him in the world
Around Suffolk he wasnt known
But in Eastern Long Island he did have a home
Called LI is where he stayed
Where there was no need for DCon or Raid
He was cool with everybody he had no enemies
Im makin this record cause hes a friend of me
Cause hes a hard workin kid Ive just stated
Thats why this record is dedicated
To my man Rich
Yo yo this is for you my man
God bless you
Let me tell you what happened in the early 80s
When we wasnt thinkin about gettin all the ladies
Me and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest
You can ask Keith or Kevin cause both of them were with us
Wed try to get a job everyplace that it takes
We was even at the factory they call 
Everywhere we went they said theyd call us back
Or even said theyre not hirin to throw us off track
But Richie Rich said forget that stuff
Even though times was rough
We kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin
It seems everywhere we went the jobs was tooken
Still Rich didnt give up the faith
He found a job that wasnt safe
Even though it was dangerous it wouldnt switch
Thats why this is dedicated to my man Rich
Yo this is to you my man Rich
Cause you know you go way back you go way back
Word up God bless you
The way the story end is just a tragedy
I wish upon a star that it didnt have to be
Endin this way for my man Richard
Cause still in my mind hes still as pictured
Like he just had gone yesterday
For sellin CRACK
His dream was to be a boxer
So he could knock the socks off of
An Iran Barkley or even Mike Tyson
But on the streets he was sacrificin
For his family and his wife
Cause he struggled he struggled all his life
He wasnt a straight up criminal or villain
Or even tryin to get stupid or illin
Was messed up for takin somebodys life and shit
That tried so hard and just wouldnt quit
This is a slow record with a switch
Because its dedicated to my man Rich

To you my man
This is to you Rich
Peace
