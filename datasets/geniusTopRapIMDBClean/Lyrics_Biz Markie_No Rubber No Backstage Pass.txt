Verse One Chubb Rock
Here we go
To the consumer and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I come backwards on stuff you dont deny
If you try to act fly then Ill punk you I and I
When I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise to invade the media shame
Take it insult call me the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lees a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it OJ he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid the drug addict
If you missed me dont kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two BizMarkie
Ladahdi ladahda I like to say
You know me as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Oh I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because Im like smart like Mr Spock and
Captain Kirk and you know Im workin
Im bound to wreck your body go OWWW I go bezerk and
You always hearin you always clearin you always cheerin
Hey umm umm Im dissapearin like Magic
Im tragic all of a sudden
You Gotta Have It like Spike Lee hey you know me
As the Uhriginal B IZ the M the A
The ickaZarRKay IE
Im not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it
The original here to rock and get respected
Im Markie heh the MahhZayRKay
The man appointed rap King and Im here to stay
Im down to wreck your body Im not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over to my man Chubb

Verse Three Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era thats the point of the one
Be unique critique from the crumb me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it cheerio kid and here I go
Off beat slackin but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The acoustic suits it the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs well it should Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise super star in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild child in the rubadub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out with my rubber band
I can tell that you need me you dont want me to get paunchy
And me I dont want to catch no HIV
So well protect you and me but mainly me
If you dont want no rubber then PEACE
