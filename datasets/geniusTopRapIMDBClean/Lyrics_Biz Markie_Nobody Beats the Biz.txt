Yes yall and to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and what I am displaying
A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rocking parties I am a nympho
Maniac brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and like you do Bacardi and
You wont be fighting or illing you just be partying
Down with the funky sound with yours truly
Im the original BIZ MARKI but the E
I came to have fun and not be number one and
Just here to let you know whos like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz

You know me as the BIZ MARKIE and
I go for what I know doing a show for human beings
Im guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
Im bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toetapper always having fun
And when you hear the Biz Markie I get the job done
Yes Im the MAR the KIE you know thats me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I dont be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter Rooftop Union Square and
Roseland the Heartthrob Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the Worlds Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that youre on mine or on it like a hornet
But you pay for a good performance doggone it you want it
Thats why Im here to be like letting you knowing
That Imma highly recognized as the king of discoing
Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
Im the best person for this type of employment
Thats why

On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop nonstop but how I hiphop
On the mic and like make you coop
erate with the rhythm that is what I give em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing the style that Im using
But in the end Im sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny oh honey its just ridiculous
Dont try to front come on and admit you was
Thrilled chilled your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it so lets go the lap
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz 
Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz
