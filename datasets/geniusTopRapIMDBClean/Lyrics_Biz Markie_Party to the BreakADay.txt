Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Onetwo doin the do
This goes out to my man Truck my man Jerome
Bilal and the whole Long Island crew
And it goes like this
Hey how ya doin its me
The incredible unforgettable B
Izzah give me Rrah KI with the E
I got mo rhymes than Muhammad Ali
Hey  The way I get down you will say
Damn that nigga Biz always makes my day
My style is untangeable when you hear
Cause the brother on the mic is most debonnaire
On the DJ tip Im like savoirfaire
Cause you can probably find me anywhere
Im the best from West Im the beast from the East
Im the OLLLLLD SCHOOL like a permanent crease
Like Scooby Doo or a Chucky doll
You better grab a seat because youre gonna be here for a while
So for all you new schoolers relax and chill
As the Diabolical tell you the deal
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
I got so much on my mind like my name was Chuck D
That when it comes to DJn Im a Public Enemy
I rocked all colors races and ages
When you see the crowd go crazy you will say Im outrageous
I rocked Sinbad Cancun Essence and the Grammys
Magic Johnson parties at Superbowl in Miami
First Friday Philly Dallas and St Lou
My bars Alex and Kenny Johnson know what I can do
Chicago with  Detroit with D Archer
New York with Gator Lenny Smith and Lenny the Barber
I do all the hot joints like Eddie Murphy and will flip it
Still get down and dirty in Newark and Elizabeth
Keenan and  brothers Pat in Orlando
Keyshaun Walker and Diane Valentine yo
I rock weddings from Toni Braxton to Boyz II Men Shawn
And this is what they say word is bond


They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
Let me tell you how I started in ninetytwo
When I was DJn from Jersey to Howard U
I did homecomings from UVA to James Madison
And did The Tunnel Reflect or Kordell and Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ love
From rockin from Virginia and seein the Q Club
People looked at me and said Why you DJn
I loved Oh Baby You and youre a rock singer
So the transition from rappin to DJ wasnt smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From  to Jones Street to Philly Greek Picnic
Florida and Bayou Classic and Atlanta Freaknik
All the girls in Gstrings and thongs
If you would please just sing along
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
They know I partay to the break of day
