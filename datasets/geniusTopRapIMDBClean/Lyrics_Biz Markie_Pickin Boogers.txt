Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross
But its sure to have you trippin so yo listen close
Its not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
But its rather on the bug tip and its called Pickin Boogers
Now what Im sayin might not be kosher to you
But its still somethin we all have to do
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Yo dont try to front like its so gloomy and gray
Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day
Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip
With a finger tissue or even a QTip
Take it from the Biz Markie because Im jokin
And also remember this slogan
Hey ma whats for dinner
Go up your nose and pick a winner
Pickin Boogers  4x 
Let me tell you what happened on the train man
I was coolin one day with my partner Kane
Headed up to the Rooftop ridin the D train
When the man sittin next to me was so profane
Hed stick his finger up his nose damn near to his brain
You should a moved 
I was just about but all of a sudden homeboy just pulled out
A big green slimy  nah Im not neven gonna say it
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Then the man jumped up and said Whats wrong with you
And wiped them off his face and said I cant mess with you
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo you got to know the name of the game


Hmmm
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
When I was class clown and he was my brother
Sittin at the desk pluckin boogers at each other
Never doin work as we was supposed
Cause we was too busy diggin up our nose
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person thatd leave his food
No matter who you are we didnt give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you a man
We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand
Catch anyone from anywhere
But the best fun about it catchin Kane out there
Especially when we playin ball in the gym
I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him
Now were grown up and things have changed
But we still be playin the pickin boogers game
Just last night when Kane was gettin ready
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti
Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl
One night at Latin Quarters I was standin at ease
I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez
I didnt show enough that I really did want it
So no half steppin I pushed up on it
Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat
Had a spotlight beamin on my Biz Marck hat
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
But that dried up booger just ruined her look
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldnt be bold
So I played if off and said thats a cute green mole
I was hopin from that she would wipe it away
But she didnt do nothin I guess she wanted it to stay
I said before you get my number I dont mean to diss you
But write it in your hand because youre gonna need the tissue
