You gotta get FUNKY  You cant get funky you got to get SILKY
You cant get silky you got to get DOO DOO
And this the way you gotta do it a little somethin
You gotta like swing your hips like this and jump
And then you gotta throw your hand up to your head
And then your leg gotta hit your ear
And then your hand gotta hit your head
And your leg gotta hit your ear and jump
And this the way to do it

Kick your legs til the right is into the left
And do a dance that is known as the DOO DOO DEF

And if I dance with yall I will revive it
It is of the words and isnt goin away
I will make it come back like Sugar Ray
