Romeo Romeo wherefor art thou
Thats what Juliet asked but I dont know now
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Yo Ida Ida Idont know where hes at Juliet
Dont regret cause he will be back
To come and get you and bring you to the crillzab
But theres an obstacle thats in his way
I think its thethethe  that wont decay
Well Im the BIZMizzaARK
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
That you two people are a part of life
It explains why Romeo died by the knife
Or was it  the poison on Juliet lips
Or vice versa I dont know it make my mind flips
Whichever way it was its very educational
So look at the movie and listen cause its sensational
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing a long now come on now
Romeo and Juliet gettin busy  repeat 4X 
To the ROMEO and the JULIet
I think the thing he did was to get respect
The way that I see it it was a great deed
Because if wasnt he wouldnt succeed
At getting Juliets heart and loving care
And all of the moments they had to share
But I really want you just to check out the plot
Of the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot
It will make you laugh it make you cry
And thats when you know you will be satisfied
Cause you know I wouldnt tell you nuthin that wasnt right
Cause the Diabolical is outta sight
Yo Romeo and Juliet should be household names
They names should be in the hall of fame
With my funky beat you can never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing this song now bust it out now
Romeo and Juliet gettin busy  repeat 3X 
Romeo Romeo HAH
Romeo and Juliet gettin busy  repeat 3X 
Romeo Romeo HAH
