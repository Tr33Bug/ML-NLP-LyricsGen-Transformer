Shes Not Just Another Woman  Monique  Lyrics
I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46 or 151
After school Id go to her house to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48 she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling Coke or 123
But when Im in Moniques presence I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When wed go trick or treating I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldnt miss her more than Id miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique because
Shes not just another woman
Shes not no no
Let me tell ya a little somethin about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Leenette the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument oh we was never fussin
Thats why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do you know she would
We would have family day in back of building 70
I would win her a prize so she could treat me heavenly
I dont care what nobody say because
This girl would make my day and


Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl especially for me
No matter how many years ago I cant forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile I guess I rang her chimes
I didnt see her again until 1988
And I saw her again and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me and what would occur
Then I asked was she swingin any capers
She said  no not me nobody got no papers
I couldnt believe after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears cause
quickly fades out
