One two one two three
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top  sayyy whaaaat 
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top  wellllllll 
Well I demand respect so everybody salute
And by the way Backspin is my attribute
You may or may not know who I am
But frankly my dear I dont give a damn
You may know me from Rockin With Biz Markie
Or Shante when she used to battle Sparky
You might have seen in some videos with other folks
Sittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes
The meaning of my name some people may try to guess
Yes yes Im fresh to the flesh so let me manifest
I make romance Im not a freelance
I spin records BITCH I dont breakdance
I scoop girls around the world thats what B does
The name Backspin means that B was
Born as a creative cut king
Supreme poet inferior to nothing
Call me the teacher since Im the one who taught you
Whats that  Myyyyyyy DICK  CAUGHT YOU 
Im signin off because my rhymes complete
I say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top  sayyy whaaaat 
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top  wellllllll 
Well get a grip and yeah the Capitals rippin
More than just a ordinary style cold flippin
Those that attempt to diss or try to take this
Title away what I think you better forget it
Pitpat this Jack get off of the crack black
Its the true fact your record hit the pillow sack
And now youre wonderin how make a comeback
But dont make me laugh your studios a twotrack
Biz hits the bassline then I rip the real line
Together its combined and designed to a master rhyme
A little touch from Cool V himself
An overnight process then its ready for the shelves
Perfect shit on wax is made
Then bring it to the radio and let it get played
Theres no joke and only time to get fanatical
So listen up or pay attention to the Capital
Im done with the rhyme for the time so you can have em
Aiyyo guys why dont you throw somethin funky at em
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top  sayyy whaaaat 
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top  wellllllll 
Yall know me as the Original D
Like to the I say with the A and hey
Bust this MOND
I grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear
Its always def and different
Never somethin from the previous years
Im quite slim but rougher than a pair of Timbs
The Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend
I dont smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor
Bein smooth keeps my rhyme style that much quicker
So yo hey chief bust this technique of speak
Im feelin sheik and also rather unique
Im smooth as    you cant deny Im
Innovative with style and bound to hit primetime soon
As I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon
Give props to the rapper the brother dresses Dapper
Than Dan cause Im the man Id like to make ya toes tap
With the funky type of flow Im smooth as a Lambo
Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam
So once but not twice this brothers precise
When it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice
Pullin women cant no man compete
I nut em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street
So
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top  sayyy whaaaat 
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top  wellllllll 
Ready for the riot I rip rap rapacious
Crews dont slip youre payin penalty slashes
Clashes crashed but I crash ass or
Ravish the mic and then Imma pass all
Hard to handle run a gamble like Vegas
But I never lost the force be runnin wages
Of pages and pages biters think Im cajun
Spice cause Im so nice and eighteen is my age is
Rappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle
Dont even know why they waste time on the packll
Of nine cause my rhymes do em in like rifles
Stress the word so you know I live trifle
MCs metamorphosize to digest
Days from a faze and my praise is like a rajah
I reckon that crews that step over this way
Think life is a game and they just too pissed to play
Some say on mics Im a master
A snatcher a catcher a very well matcher
But crews better know that I hit like after
Effects whos next I wreck from now til then
And then when the then comes Imma go hit again
Like ratatattat of the tickedy eatin dicker whore
So every move I make I make sure its riggydiggyraw
Biz
Mar kie the original
Everytime I see V yo I got material
I was just kickin funky records for you
Cause Im down with the rhythm of a ah one chk two
Singin on records I get respected
It dont matter to me cause you know that Im connected
With BMV Biz Mark and Vaughn
Down to wreck collect and then jet to the break of dawn
Discombobulate sentence aint complete
Unless I go beatbox AHH AHH AHH UHH cough on beat
Zipzopaziggalah zaggazuckazaii
No matter what I say I always come out fly
Because my records get respected as I like jettin
You will agree its me cause you know Im inventin
A different kind of rhythm of rhymin state
Thats why you like everything I create
Pickin Boogers The Vapors Just a Friend
Thats just some of the things you can comprehend
So just check it MCs wreck it
You listen to the Biz Markie dont disrespect it
Just listen
