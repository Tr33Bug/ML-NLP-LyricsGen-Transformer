Check it out  Come on 
Dont go to Getty go to Exxon
Like Bonita Applebum ya gotta put me on
Got good luck like Lucky Charms leprechaun
Cant believe Freaky Tah and Big L is gone
You think Im a mailman with my delivery
Aint no other brother like the BI with the Z
EmezahARrrah say KI with the E
I got mo rhymes than Muhammad Ali
Not number one but here to have fun
Guaranteed to proceed and get the job done
Yall know my competition is none
Funky funky fresh from the day I begun
You rock with me youre guaranteed to have a ball
Got a big belly over six feet tall
My favorite team is the Vikings when I watch football
Heres another one to get you off the wall

Soon to be elected in the Hall of Fame
I rock the microphone emceeings my game
I flip so many styles my name should be Flipper
On Threes Company I wish I was Jack Tripper
Back in the days I used to eat litina
Back in the days my sister had a Thumbelina
Back in the days I liked a girl named Angelina
Back in the days I wanted to get in between her
My jingle bella always RocAFella
Even my acapella will be a best seller
She couldnt believe what I had achieved
Funky like ring around the collar doo doo on the sleeves
Enquiring minds always want to know
How did I get my ill freestyle flow
I just tell em straight up without no B
Ask me no questions yo heres my ID

Im not Captain Kirk or Mr Spock
When I put the party people in a state of shock
Im like Mark Twain or Shakespeare
Cause when Im on the stage people throw they hands in the air
Wavin em wild like in a frenzy
Dog in the house like Im Spuds MacKenzie
Im just doin it just rockin the house
Sucker MCs is quiet as a mouse
Comin off the top of my head
Im not dumb so dont be misled
When I was young I never pissed in the bed
Always listened to what my moms and pops said
Love reggae so much you could call me a dread
Got a big belly so you know Im wellfed
And Im a loverlover like my name is Ed
And Im too awesome like K and Teddy Ted
