The Biz Dance  Part One  Lyrics
Im the Biz Markie Im known for beatboxin and rap
And now its time to put Long Island on the map
And lettin you know that itll put you in a trance
Its somethin funny made by me and its called the Biz Dance
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Cause its very difficult to do what is it called
The Biz Mark Biz Mark the Biz Mark Biz Mark
The Biz Mark Biz Mark the Biz Mark Biz Mark Biz Mark
The Biz Mark Dance is second to none
Ill explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs til your pants almost rip
Shake from side to side witcha arms and hips
While youre doin it if you mess up your hair
Then you know party people that youre halfway there
Theyve heard of Biz Markie all the way in France
And the kids in AntARCTICA is doin my dance
2X w ad libs
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
Come up to the front all the ladies to one side
And all the homeboys to one side
And Imma show you how you should do it
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
And then this the way you do it
One two
One two three here
Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark
Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark
Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark
Go Biz Mark Go Biz Mark
