Now this is a difficult subject
About something thats crazy  oh what the heck
They know they have something that people dont like
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing Im talking about is an essence
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you cant see with the naked eye
But to the nose its a nuisance
It comes in so many forms its camouflaged
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it wont show it
And you will swear its just a mirage
It can be with you when youre talking
It will be so close you think its hawking
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York and
Everybody know what Im saying
From here to the Himalayan
If you dont know you must be doodoo
This is what Im saying
About the dragon
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventing this
Check your hygiene and your dentist
You might think Im messing but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness
But if you think Im misguiding you
By saying theres something inside of you
That bothers everybody when youre at a party
And your reactions to it is pee you
Youre sitting there baffled and puzzled
Whatever you have you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzled
But if you listen to me
The diabolical energetical B
The IZ MzaMzaARKIE
Im tryina give you HELP

So Ima end it off like this
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore check them before
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon
I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool had the right gear and slim
The only thing was wrong he smelled like a gym
His secret telling rumors his right guard went left
And his band was playing a song that was funky to def
He was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
A sprinkle a day wouldnt last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with Sensurround
I tried to tell him but he just wouldnt listen
He thought from my heart I was trying to diss him
I started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging
I said Yo Tock you got the dragon
