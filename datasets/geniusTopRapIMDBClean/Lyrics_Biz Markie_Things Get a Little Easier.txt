And yes yall yes yall
This is a different kind of dedication
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
But Im just tellin ya straight on up
Dont be messin with no drugs
Whether youre young whether youre old
Whether youre bad whether youre bold
Dont mess with it cause its not for the soul
And we gonna do it a little somethin
With three subjects like this
Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Who was sellin crack just like it was Avon
And you know yknow the reason I say was
Because thats no longer what my man John does
There was a time when he was wearin much gold
Drivin a Benz Jaguar and a Rolls
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
Yohohohoho word to grannys panties
Cause he would make dough grow and sling it like a yoyo
Being broke was just a nono
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
You shoulda thought about what you did in the past
To realize this fast livin wouldnt last
But the same guy that was a big time hoodlum
Is now in jail waitin for someone to duke him
Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it
Subject two and this one is a doozy
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Now when youre on WIC as problems may seem enough
But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up
On a crack mission no type of ambition
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Her eyes got dim her body got slim
She said theres nothin in the world like a good ol stem
On and like on and and it was strong
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
I want to get HIGH so high
I want to get HIGH so high
Shed go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha
Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
And when she saw her friends comin from the spot
Like Prudential she got a piece of their rock
Thats why


Subject three finally the
END about a girl by the name of Marie
She used to be hot most beautiful to the utmost
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
Of curves swerves word to the mother my brother
And boy did the BIZ love her
But then singing those were the DAYS
My friend we thought theyd never end
And she looked alright to the SK Biz Markie
But then she got on drugs
Started wearin extensions and rugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
rapping because nowadays Marie dont look so hot
Everytime that I see her shes headed for the spot
Her hair is all knotty cause Scotty got her body
And her underarms kickin like the ho know karate
Her clothes are real dirty and usually the same
As for money she dont have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
She was puttin a pack of NoworLaters on layaway
fades out
