This is another hit from Biz Markie
Dedicated to the radio not he or she
Because its time for them to get recognized
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
Thats why Im comin out my face like this
Far as negativity you never get dissed
If it wasnt for you nobody would know
Thats why this is something for the radiohhhh
This rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJs
That play all the hits on seven days
And even on the weekends the DJs will be freakin
Without a doubt because everyone is uniqueand
The way they cut the records and be talkin
It sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman
To all the disc jockeys thats on the go
This is something for the radiohhhh
Biz ad libbing a harmony of for the radio randomly
Now Ima kick it like this
Id like to thank all the people state to state
For requestin my records on the radio greatly
Appreciate what youve done for me
And my reward to you is my MUSIC
Straight up I make the music just for you
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
As long as youre in good physical health
Because youre the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
Like puttin some salt and pepper and butter on grits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
Cause theyre the ones the jam selectors
A couple of years ago when I didnt have a record player
On the radio I thought to myself sayin
If I ever get the chance to playin my stuff
Im gonna make everything extra tough
Cause radio will last to infinity
As long as my name is the BIZ
EmmezahARK and Im hear to say
Number one entertainment form in the like USA
Cause if it wasnt for you nobody would know
Thats why this is something for the radiohhhh
Biz ad libbing a harmony of for the radio and singing shoutouts
This is the conclusion of just the beginnin
Of hiphop on the radio mix never endin
Story and fightin just to get the right and
Have our respect on a station thats excitin
In about two years I will be a superstar
Be able to buy anything I want even a car
Cause if it wasnt for you nobody would know
Thats why this is something for the radiohhhh
Yo Id just like to say it like this
Cool V scratches to fade
