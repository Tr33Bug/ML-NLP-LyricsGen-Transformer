Id like to tell a story and it goes like this
Before I was makin money hand over fist
The mid80s is what Im talkin about
You will agree without a reasonable doubt
As I tell this tale sittin on a pail
This is one youll like when its done
Only certain people know about Union Square
The Rooftop Latin Quarter cause I was there
Red Alert downtown Brucie Bee uptown
Grandmaster Vic had a different sound
You had block parties with free gifts
Mr Magic and Marley gave radio a lift
You dont understand but we do
Thats why Im tryin to explain it to you
So sit back and listen to what I say
As I tell the story of this beautiful day
Well go dancing in the dark  HEY
Walking through the park and reminiscing
BREAK IT ON DOWN
Before Versace and DKNY
There was a lot of clothes that was fly
Like Polo Benetton CocaCola and Osh Kosh
Guess jeans and others thats acid washed
DC wore KSwiss and Sergio Tacchini
Girls wore tennis skirts that was mini
Spot Ewings Le Coq Sportif
New Balance Fila Nike and Ellesse
African clothes and medallions was worn
And when Rakim came out knowledge was born
In the midst of it all I almost forgot
There was a brother uptown makin his own spot
Makin Gucci leather and suede tailor made
That had more flavor than moms KoolAid
Im gonna tell you the name of this man
He goes by the name of the Dapper Dan
See at this time you might think Im strange
Cause I wore a fourfinger ring and big gold chains
Like I was Mr T from the ATeam
It was just a sign of me makin cream
But the cars and jeeps was increda
Like the Audi 280 Zs 98s and Jettas
Cherokees Wranglers Suzuki Sidekicks
LA and West coast cars was doin tricks
Now the dances was crazy to match
Like the Pee Wee The Wop and the Cabbage Patch
The Prep The Snake and The Biz Mark Biz Mark
The way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark
Now listen to what I got to sayah
Reagan was Pres and Koch was the Mayor
You cant beat that with a baseball bat
And youd never see me without my Biz Mark hat
4X w ad libs
