This is a story about without a doubt
When Im done you will all scream and shout
They always say time is on our side
If it is why is it a rough ride
If I could save time or return to the past
I would bring back the good times hate to last
Like when I was the size of JayZ
Back when Ra was still with Eric B
Remember when friends was friends and LL had a Benz
And cell phones and beepers was the new trends
When Koch was the mayor and Reagan was the Pres
We listened to what other enemies said
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I know yall remember goin to Great Adventure
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
The beginnin of the summer at Jones Beach
When tshirts were ten dollars each
Didnt matter if you had a Lex Beamer or a Benz
As long as you had room for all of the friends
Mr Softee came through or the Good Humor truck
When ice cream was less than a buck
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
Id bring Masterdon Buffy and Scott LaRock
So  please listen to my song and rhyme
If I can turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time


If I could turn time back in a rhyme
Id bring back Bird Magic Jordan in their prime
Remember the days oh remember the days
When they had the hightop fade craze
Want back Big Daddy Kane Fresh Prince and Kid  Play
Oh what a beautiful day
When parties was parties and clubs was clubs
You could tell the real MCs from all the scrubs
When havin your own style and originality
And your character and real personality
But I have to go and off I sign
If I can turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Aaliyah  Jam Master Jay 
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Biggie and 2Pac
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Scott La Rock
I wish somethin bad I wish there was somethin made to bring back Left Eye  Barry White 
I wish there was somethin to bring back my man Dahsil Masterdon 
I wish there was somethin made to bring back my man Keef Cowboy 
My man BO my man Step from Baltimore
I wish there was somethin to bring back
All the strange people that I knew that was a part of my life
For all of our loved ones that have passed away
