Yall know me as the BIZ
That roc the microphone most definately
Bringing you styles that you never heard
Like brother thug like brother nerd
Im real super high in the 80s
Even Austin Powersd say yeahh baby
The hip hopper unpredictable showstopper
Whatever I say ya know its proper
Cuz when I kick it I kick it like a field goal
Like Erik B and Rakim ya know I got soul
I got funky rhymes that blow your mind
Buggin you out without a doubt every single time
Im cookoo for cocoa with my vocal
When Im in san francisco or when Im local
The Ma forever just doin my thing
Im guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
Chorus
Ladada Ladadada  4x  with scrathing
Biz in charge and yo Im livin large and
Oooh I like it like el debarge and
In the tune I can croon with a bank and a 
So hurry up and get the sick smokers out the room
Before I catch asthma or emphysema
You can catch me in a playsport or a beamer
I rip and rag play freeze tag
But since I got older its all such a drag
But it dont matter now like purina cat chow
The first beat I did was meow meow meow meow
Dont have a son or daughter even though I oughta
Its almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters
Roof top program  baby what a man
Now I plays the tunnel 
Yo paul let the music cease
When I count to three everybody say peace
Chorus til end
