Radio TV and even the press
Know the meanin of VAPORS
The meanin of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be there when youre down and out
Once youre established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
Can you feel it nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time what Im gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
Make the Music Nobody Beats the Biz well check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it she always fessed
Talking about Nigga please you work for UPS
Since he wasnt no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didnt appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number shed be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
I got another partner thats calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow thats laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grownups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rastatype Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail or someone would shoot him
But now hes grown up to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didnt like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar ooh youre a star now
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to yall as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts scratch transform with finesse
imitates cuts and scratches and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said Sorry Mr Lee but theres no help wanted
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
Til the like break of dawn
To put this JOB in effect
But theyd look right past him and be like Next
Now for the year of 88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousins like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Vaughan welcome to my store
Offering him a job but naw he dont want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasnt
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager I wanted to be down
With a lot of MCDJing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street I say Can I be down champ
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doodoo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties theyd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched without belief
Yo Biz do you remember me from Noble Street chief
We used to be down back in the days
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
