Goes around
What comes around goes around
Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
When everytime I see you girl you know that I drool
Daydreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you though you was topshelf babe
I asked myself time and time again what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didnt have to conversate with me I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extrasandwich in my lunch box
Youre treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good girl I could
But you give me that look like you dont wanna be bothered
But thats okay just keep on frontin see
Cause one day Imma make it and youll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big and yes I finally made it
Been doin shows videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now its me youre hawkin
Now I turn up my nose and keep on walkin
You see ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah we can talk Im in a rush please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And dont come poppin that justafriend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now
The words around town that youre on the money tip
But sorry I cant do nothin for ya honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because thats what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself thank God for showbiz
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it yo I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
Its a new game and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her
What comes around goes around
You know what Im talkin about
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
