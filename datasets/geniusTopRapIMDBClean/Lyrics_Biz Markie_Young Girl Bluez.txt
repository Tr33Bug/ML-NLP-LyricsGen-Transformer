Huh huh huh now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feeling blue I said  Slick Rick  Repeat 4x 
I was walking down the street just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
362436 I looked to her and I said I need a fix
I asked her the same blahzay blahzay
Her name where she live and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know youre bugging off the nickname I would be too
But every time she be walking she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond I wouldnt be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21 heres the news
Its the hiphop version of the Young Girl Bluez
As the story goes on I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1800 beeper
Call me looney crazy psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
She said come and get me from Mickey Ds at 8
Thats where I work after school pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school but I didnt think it was high
If you saw what I saw then youd know why
You wouldnt believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what Im doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle Im very confused
Im stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age aint nothing but a number thats what ChiAli said
Okay then why dont you get that through the judges head
Proceeding along I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked What do you want She said A pair of earrings
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrived kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew I would be a disgrace
How old are you now to Rhumbareen
I was in shock when they screamed Sixteen
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the neverending saga of the Young Girl Bluez
