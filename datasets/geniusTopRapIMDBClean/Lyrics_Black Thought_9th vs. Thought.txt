9th vs Thought Lyrics
Twofifteen
Twentyone pound
Uh
Im not a typical arrogant American on prescribed medicine
Im sick as I ever been
Rollin out of the dealership in a McLaren
These rappers is Peter Pan Im PanAfrican
Space invader blackin em
Mixin Alexander McQueen with Haider Ackermann
Real rapture in the form of a living man
I dont give a damn not a mortal could test me
See I dont get examed
Im a high priest and a wild beast
Once warrior now chiefthe mouthpiece of the foul East
And Ima rock em sock em robot HOF I drop bombs
Any flow I got come at you like coms
You should know Im not for the run of the mill drill
Im still trill the flame thrower the real deal
I dont coincide with the oddness
Your highness is where the pantheon of the gods is I promise
Im known for being brutally honest
If lyricism is spiritual to you then rewind this
Ima kill em but it aint about to be with kindness
I believe the industry about to see a conquest
Changin of the mindset
Money just a concept never been a object
Even when my mother was livin up in the projects
Now my ratin is higher than young Richard Pryor get
Still speakin my mind just in a different dialect
It takes two to make anthropology
The student and the studied
That being the case it is time for the studied to examine the student and to evaluate its own self
I said I seen it all I had it all and I aint mad at all
This rapper toss gravitas like a cannonball
Stayin up all night throwin my sleep pattern off
I need a doctor on call to keep Adderall
Position of my commission is trilateral
You fuckin with me you trippin for tryin that at all
I mess around make the call get the gat involved
I know people its a small world after all
My credit card say its onward at the mall
My broad lookin like she Cinderella at the ball
Reborn every January like a Capricorn
From downtown no Ryan Lewis and Macklemore
Its yours truly Im Paul Mooney Im George Clooney
Im fully immersed in the craft bringin awards to me
The bass player said he gon sue me
I gave the finger to him the Lord gave a round of applause to me
My soul winnin Ive been goaltendin
Cold sentence scroll pennin nigga gone til its no limit
The vision came to me so vivid
My observation was if money for the takin Ima go and get it
Yall know my everyday lay no costume
I murk rappers and they cant play no possum
Another studio but its the same old outcome
I told my nigga Spon Vicious Baby we got one
Listen


Accurate scholarship and free dedicated artists would reveal a singularly important thing
Racism was and is not only a mark of ignorance
It was and is a monumental fraud
