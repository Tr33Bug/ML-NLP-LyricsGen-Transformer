Yeah America the ugly
This country is deep to say the least
Ask from Louisville  Kentucky to LA to the East
Where the race been on but recently I been makin peace
With the fact that Black bodies are worth more if theyre deceased
Or trapped in a ninebytwelve awaitin our release
Not takin it upon ourselves to break away and teach
The next new crop before they face the next few cops
Cause a traffic stop at night alone could get you pop
Nina Simone said Whats the matter with you Rock
Is it my hiphop Hey whats the matter with 2Pac
We will finish the journey from Mecca to pilgrimage
Build bridges over burial grounds they filled with us
I grimaced upon a photo I found
A still image of a friend who said to lean on Him like Bill Withers
I wish he was still with us
They issue moratoriums on the truth and label us revisionist historians
Changin the point of origin in all the events
Any prince with some kind of sense is all theyre against
For generations they aint shown us that the American modus operandi
The holders control us and try to fold us
But yo watch your body
Oh America
Not gon bring me down today
Dont wanna see another American heartbreak
Oh you cant keep me down
Oh America
Yeah watch your body for me
I wasnt built to breathe
I wont be another American heartbreak
My soul you wont take
You cant keep me down
The beast brand is strong
To each man his own
For every Tameka Mallory in the cold hand o Jones
Get up like Jayla Rose so they dont stand alone
Leaders understand the code
Pawns do what they suppose
In part this heart of stone
Is for you to make it home
If I perish when you grown
I want you to take the throne
But when drivin you a target
Dont be talkin on the phone
You a alien you might as well be walkin on the moon
When you walk into a room
Never shrink so you can fit in
Your beauty and your brilliance aint built to keep it hidden
Your path more like division of Richard Wright
Was written too long ago to give him too strong to be forbidden
So whether saint or sinner heres the tenor like Kamasi
Im from the kinda posse thats down with TaNehisi
Clowns could try to box me the hate can never stop me
Im a product of American heartbreak but watch me
Im still a problem liftin my wings
Despite the system that vilified the victim Im still alive and kickin
Ima striver a survivor a husband and a father from the bloodline o kings
I move different than ya watch ya body
Oh America
Not gon bring me down today
Dont wanna see another American heartbreak
Oh you cant keep me down
Oh America
Yeah watch your body for me
I wasnt built to breathe
I wont be another American heartbreak
My soul you wont take
You cant keep me down
Built to last strong
Nothin gon hold me down no
Power yeah that Black power
Thats how I keep holdin on yeah
Im holdin on  Holdin on yeah 
Holdin on yeah
Im holdin Im holdin strong
Holdin holdin Im holdin on
Cant nobody bring me down
Im holdin  Stronger 
Cause Ive got that power  Ive got that Black power 
Yeah yeah  Built to last 
Im built to last ooh
My my my my my
