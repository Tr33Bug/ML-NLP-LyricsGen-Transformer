Uh Im sorry for your loss
Its a body dead in the car and its probly one of yours
The writing all across the window and the walls
Whether it was true or false we shouldnt have got involved
Remember we walked past the teacher take the chalk and laugh
We wrote punishments I will not talk in class
Now its pistols punishin people for talkin fast
And all these innocent bystanders is haulin ass
I hate to say I told yall but I told yall
Things fall apart when the center too weak to hold yall
Im just collectin what you owed to my old jawn
You bout to get swooped down on and stoled on
Fools swear they wise wise men know they foolish
Well we was headed for the web even before computers
I never thought youd give me a reason to do this
Cain and Abel Jesus and Judas
Caesar and Brutus I see intruders avert your eyes
I told you keep out of the hood circumcise
How could you sleep I thought you always was the first to rise
Ayo you heard the line Everybody plays the fool
Well Ill be that exception to the rule
The principal that handdeliver lessons to the school
I was makin major moves my dollar dj vu
My mission when my ambition was brandishin a tool
To be a icon wearin slippers made of python
Get mine quicker cause Im slick as a pipeline
Transportin the oil tribulation and toil
Hit the operation but Im back in the soil
Got my crown tilted my gown quilted silk with cashmere
Burnin Rome down in a minute built it last year
Newsflash I dodged the bullet that killed the cashier
My homie told me to come with him to the masjid
Them brothers said Dont go from written bars filled with rage
To primetime television and your gilded cage
Then forget theres people in the world still enslaved
I barbwired my wrist and let it fill the page
Gun fire and flares sirens glare
Im in a iron chair where people who care dont get the lions share
When I dont give a fuck then I aint fair
Im on a higher tier with people gettin money like the financier
Catch the herald Im fresh chopped and beveled
Rap on a doctorate level so F Scott Fitzgerald
Maybe Im the new Rakim maybe Im fat Pharaohe
Undergarments of armor be my intimate apparel
PreKardashian Kanye my rhymeplay immaculate
Same cadence as DOC preaccident
Maybe my acumens on par with Kool G Rap and them
Give me the proper respect mothafucka we back again
For a couple things we lost in a fire
The drive the desire to perform on a higher
Plateau Im at that show lost in a mire
Wonderin how we got so far from inspired
Look when photos were sepiatoned
And record players were somethin you would keep in your home
Yo the traveler the meaning of Tariq he was known
For the exemplary performance uniquely his own
I made the twentyone pound for some a newfound religion
Where moneys put down its only one sound that make
OGs and young lions equally proud to listen
The secret amalgamism a algorithm
Comin from where only kings and crowns permitted the darkness
Where archaeologists found my image in parchment
Rolled into a scroll holdin a message for you
It said The only thing for sure is taxes death and trouble
The anomaly sworn solemnly high snobbidy
Freakonomics and war policy dichotomy
Thats Heaven and Hades Tigris and Euphrates
His highness the apple of the Iris to you ladies
As babies we went from Similac and Enfamil
To the Internet and Fentanyl
When all consent was still against the will
I got that detox for yall
The microphone doctor black Deepak Chopra
Im a griot that make you wanna peacock your arm
Every heavy dignitary payin me top regards
Boy Im three optics far from your binoculars
So that smart money finna get the heat out the car
Yo Im KDot Lamar meets 2Pac Shakur
Got profiled by a few cops too hot to charge
Listen somebody said a price tag was on a rappers head
So we gon see a nice bag when a rapper dead
The mask black the flag green black and red
Theyll probably wave a white flag after plasma shed
No doubt yo the game went they own route
I cant explain what these lame kids is talkin bout
Or how they fit they whole foot into they own mouth
I put a couple bodies in a brown bag then Im en route
Im sneaker shoppin with my son a size 8
Prior to they release cause why wait
Look in my estate I got electrified gates
For these blas guys hatin at a high rate
Cause I dodged fate then got great the flys straight
If we aint family or friends then we dont vibrate
And Im that gun in yall face none of yall safe
If I catch you at the right time in the wrong place
Slippin sippin on somethin with a strong taste
Like Whiskey or bootleg Bourbon with a corn base
My Levante resemble a vehicular threat
The mic I spray resemblin the sickle of death
It aint strenuous to come from a continuous breath
I set fire to the venue Ima spin you and step
Rinse repeat you checkin for the sound of the beast
Im the hound Ima creep I get down Ima eat
Ima keep somethin to lay a naysayer to sleep
Playin with heat nobody and nothin fuckin with Riq
Yo these weaklings is claimin they cuttin up in the street
Nigga peace you aint workin with nothin but the police
Listen you aint finna be nothin but the deceased
Listen you in interment with a permanent crease
I strike fear in the hearts of rap figures
Who mind bare the stigmas of time no black privilege
From boom bap niggas to trap niggas
You in the trap with us when the lines is as vivid
As the walls on the graph autographed by the Lord of Wrath
I reside between the seconds on the chronograph
How much more CB4 can we afford
Its like a Shariah Law on My Cherie Amour
How much hypocrisy can people possibly endure
But aint nobody workin on a cure my young bull
Yall just regular Im an apex predator
Brim stay fresh feathered up etcetera
Nevertheless I got a message and left
One dead messenger yep
My pen is Henry Kissinger Buzz Bissinger
Look my caporegime is to no redeem
And my oldest son Ahmir Saleem out of New Orleans
Took a golf cart to the Baccarat from the Waldorf
What was on the wall That depend on what you call art
Ima say 300k aint even in the ballpark
I charge more just for awkward small talk
So yes whos fuckin with it if its not the best
I get the lobby painted fresh upon my request
Its Kafkaesque his holiness stop the press
That Cobalt blue reminiscent of Makkaresh
Lord we got Padma Lakshmi for you
Let her massage your back with black seed oil
The foundation is firm the flags need soil
Me I need royalty because I bleed royal
Go through the veins to the brain fabulous and strange
My journalistic range is a catalyst for change
It got anybody that listen pissin flame
And cause the Hall of Fame got so many missin names
Ill acknowledge the original Peoples not Oliver
Yall go get the next challenger for Excalibur
Im more policed for my core beliefs
They tried to capture me
And brand me on the cheek with a fleurdelis
The side of my heartll be more discreet
Im international my passport page is like War and Peace
Ive always played my part from the start
Back in Philly where the triggers is mandatory to spark
With a slightest inflammatory remark
I have you and the livin a category apart
Listen a grain of saltll tip the scales it never fails
Walk on egg shells sleep on a bed of nails
Criminal records like record sales
Makin heads or tails we like Henrietta Lacks up in the cells
My mother was a working class very lovin woman
Who struggled every dinner coulda been the last supper
I come home chasin goodfornothin halfcousins
And then walk in the crib to the smell of crack cookin
She was introduced to that substance abuse
On some of the strongest drugs that the government produced
Look I even got excused by the principal
My story is out of the dub dub interview
Ive seen some icecold summers hot winters too
I never thought Id win Grammy Awards with The Roots
I never thought I would be gettin long in the tooth
My OGs told me Boy you better go and live your truth
I am a walking affirmation that imagination
And focus and patience gets you closer to your aspiration
And just cause they give you shit dont mean you have to take it
My words capture greatness sworn affidavits
Yours truly the celestial bein
You stay seein pullin up in the fresh European
Highsteppin out of it dressed to a T and
Not another got more soul less you Korean
Ive been havin visions of Nat Turner holdin his masters head
Like Yorick and Horatio in Hamlet
Smackin it like a tennis racket underhanded
Send a message through the Gram The Eagle has landed
Dressed in a military jacket made of canvas
I am no guerilla I just make em go bananas
Outstandin red black and green bandanas
Cocked hammers hairs on my chin is outstanding
Cant manage the weight of war theyre just out ballin
Look Ill fall up from the sky to see my callin
Im not crawlin Im a free man like Morgan
Seein manhood in the hood is a damn good bargain
If a black man dont tap dance
And every girl that got a fat booty dont lapdance
Well I guess its somethin wrong huh
Niggas completely uninformed
I dont burn bridges yo I keep the haters runnin for em
I aint one of yall peers Im the sum of all fears
Somebody stronger than me Who that Im all ears
Like Obama I wish he had another four years
Yall some jolly good Hollywood Squares
Im like ahem approach the altar with your offering
I spoil rappers rotten like my only offspring
Being his excellency gets to be exhausting
You in the residency of the one they call King
Dada Ali Baba the talented Mr Trotter
Inside of my right palm the mark of the stigmata
Big Poppa wig chopper emperor Jaffe Joffer muhfucka
Im stronger than the coffee out in Kaffa
All yall niggas vaginahot remind me of Icona Pop
I step in the booth Im a bull inside a China shop
Mollywhoppin watch another cotton pickin body drop
Every time we rock yo they actin like its Mardi Gras
Til the party stop skirt off like she that Ferrari drop
Soul Cycle pumpin that Earth Wind  Fire badiah
Coolin pon the dock  la marina hard body yacht
You seen another rapper cleaner mami Probly not
How it feel to be the best that did it I admit it
Im visitin from planet BringTheseNiggasDeathInMinutes
And yall know Im exquisite wicked as Wilson Pickett
The sickness I exhibit Im too legit to quit it
I dont fake it til I make it I take it to the limit and break it
Never timid what Im bout I represent it
Infinite just like Chace is been a million places
Conversation is how beautiful my face is
People hated on how sophisticated my taste is
Then I pulled up on these mothafuckas in a spaceship
Pantomime Im made of elements you cant combine
Im at a level of intelligence you cant define
Einstein Shakespeare Voltaire Tesla
Recording artist slash psychology professor
I preach for the East never fold under pressure
The beast from the East and I glide like Clyde Drexler
Ayo my new name is eighty five Xs
Cause Im the rap game certified specialist
When I was reckless I was worried bout the guest list
Im helpin rappers everywhere fulfill a death wish
Yo Flex Im glad we made contact
My nigga Osse know this shit for Combat
Brain matter contain too much data
I tell a story like fingerprints and blood splatter
