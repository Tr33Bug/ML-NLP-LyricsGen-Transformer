Of being in complete unity with each other harmony with each other And not letting the man maneuver us in fighting one another Long as we practice brotherhood among ourselves and then others who want to practice brotherhood with us were for that But I dont think that we should run around trying to love somebody who doesnt love us
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
I was uh too young to care when my father died
I had to put one in the air when my mama died
Both victims of completely different homicides
It makes me wonder sometimes damn how Ima die
I cant shake these memories Im haunted by
If it bring a tear to your eye then I apologize
When every child is born another shot is fired
How many hours is left before the clock expire
Im bothered by it and placing the bricks instead of sound
Wondering how to move a nation of millions
Because they aint felt the bass in a minute
Every minute hip hop is ever so patiently waiting to get it
Take a look into the sky and see em scraping the buildings
Or look into the mirror see the face of resilience
My heart and frustrations is in it when I spit it its vintage
So molded into my own image yeah
Come together
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Move a nation of millions it aint hard to tell 
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Move a nation of millions it aint hard to tell 
One thing one thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Move a nation of millions it aint hard to tell 
One thing I can tetetell you is you got to be free
Move a nation of millions

Uh a sick cycle where we living revolved
Like were one step away from forever sleeping tomorrow
Fighting for pieces of hog my  is scarred
Hard to be godbody niggas body your squad
Go against all laws turn up the pressure from the neck up
It aint all good the hood really need a checkup
The blood and the veins it seems it long ago changed
All addicted to riches fame is a cold game
Dopeboys and rappers thats the role models
My soul feel hollow there is no tomorrow
We need to come together like X and King
Fore we live another day all vexed in

Put the pain down player get together with us yeah
