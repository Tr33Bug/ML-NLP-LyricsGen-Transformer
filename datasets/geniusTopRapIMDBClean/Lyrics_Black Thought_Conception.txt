Where I go where I go from here
Oh I know I could be nowhere
And trust that all that moneys good for nothin if you scared
Singin yeah yeah
Look
I am no fashion model but
I got fresh for photographers
The camo coat had the collar up
Cause my emotions was bottled up
And though the ocean did not erupt
It turned up til its loud enough
To just make somethin out of us
Pass the shadow of a doubt in us
Godly geometry and calculus
That I can move any mountain with
A nigga gotta be an alchemist
Tryna create another avenue of revenue
Or several because Im in love with havin you
Security is just a whole nother animal
I cant assume Xanadu had a panic room
I wish the man in the moon had a manual
And gratitude for the wishes I granted you
A lifetime finally Im understandin you
The lifelines that delines in a hand or two
And how its difficult to undo the damage youve done
Once the codes run under the scanner too
So if you capture the flame and its painful
You just charge that to the game
Cause its shameful to just fall back and complain
That you fractured the laws of attraction again
Focus on a more passionate plane
No conceptions immaculate man
Where I go where I go from here
Oh I know I could be nowhere
And trust that all that moneys good for nothin if you scared
Singin yeah yeah
Once again to the well I went
While the soul man screamed bloody hell out there
Im tryna decode the meaning of the spell Im in
And I dont even know what fucking hotel Im in
I checked in as the monarch of melanin
The elaphant my body is a shell Im in
Piecin myself together teachin myself to never
Let one loss divorce my development
Reminds me of Ego Trippin like Nikki Giovanni
Wishin the system might deliver me a body
Cum laude the rug on the floor was from Saudi
The message Id hung on the door was unrowdy
No dowry the price of it all was one cowrie
Now we the last flophouse on The Bowery
Human traffickin moving Africans
Still grappling with fantasies fill the bracket in
And if you capture the flame and its painful
Then just charge that to the game
Cause its shameful to just fall back and complain
That you fractured the laws of attraction again
Focus on a more passionate plane
Estimate a more accurate frame
Of time a frame of mind attached to the sane
No conceptions immaculate man
Where I go where I go from here
Oh I know I could be nowhere
And trust that all that moneys good for nothin if you scared
Singin yeah yeah
Where I go where I go from here
Oh I know I could be nowhere
And trust that all that moneys good for nothin if you scared
Singin yeah yeah
