Yeah the universe let the planets align
Spent 10k and the card didnt decline
Bartender one Casamigos  and lime
Im celebrating gracefully getting better with time
I aint even halfway through this incredible ride
But like Im kind of doing an incredible job
When I was eighteen living beyond my means
I was afraid of my dreams looking at the finer things
Wishing I could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip
Upgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip
Cash rules everything I just wanted a taste of it
Fast food hurrying saving time not wasting it
Selfsaboteur speaking it to my paramour
Torch rappers like Im igniting the aerosol
Maintaining the wherewithal that embarrass yall
Gamechanger the way I shredded your cabbage off
Explaining is changing apples to applesauce
When we were young innocence was ours but that was lost
Where I reside is the dark side of the glory
The fury I manipulate is the arc of the story
Written without a ghostwriter to author it for me
This is crime and punishment Im the judge and the jury
Listen Dostoyevsky
I swam with crocs fished with sharks
May never pop charts but I know Im popular
I was built to run the game I came up playing guard
With young niggas between 55 and 6 foot 4
I banked over both tryna bank over some more
And ball out in something gorgeous thatll keep me in court
Where theyll judge like yall does yall dont know me enough
Yall still owe us for what all yall did to the Cold Crush
To my donuts Im shooting J Dillas and what
I wanna cop when I get loot and recoup
I had to go through hella doors so in short thats why I only want two
But I aint got Jay number I CC em the proof
Cause everything I pictured in my head has always come true
They say you need vision to see eye to eye with the Druids
Spent 25 hundred on sheep skin let it seep in
I aint turn starboy in a weekend
It took more like 7 years make a sane man drink Everclear
It aint ever clear if we ever guaranteed a year
Fruits of your labor huh you work hard to get it
Jamla stitched on the motherfucking ROC fitted
Before the big lights it had to start with the scrimmage
Know that itd come sooner or later Im Trae Young nigga
Huh Im Trae Young nigga
Uh I said Dostoyevsky meets Joe Pesci
Tired of staring at a glass half empty
Turning me from Dr Sebi to cocking semi
It got me clutching my machete from the Serengeti already
Wild Styles and Fab Five Freddy
Im a stranger in Moscow dont ask how deadly is the ummah
Patrice Lumumba Kwame Nkrumah
To the Tripoli shores from the halls of Montezuma
Stop intruder Im built on facts Im not your rumor
A malignant tumor slid through in a suede Puma
The steady heavy legendary all praise is overdue
Same cloth as the chosen few rap Noble Drew
I guarantee you know more music by the suckers
Its not a victimless crime if anybody suffers
In a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us
Well whats the use of em trying when cant nobody touch us
Unless its fabricated probably drug related
But love or hate it I will not be subjugated
When they screamin You the greatest that did it whats underrated
As if every other player who spit it was unrelated
If every mans a temple the circumstance is simple
So to be transcendental I do enhance the mental
This is elder statesmen conversation
Take a look into them books from down in the basement yeah
