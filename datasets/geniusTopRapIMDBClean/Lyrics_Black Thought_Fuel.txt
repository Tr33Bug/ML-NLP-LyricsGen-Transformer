P is for the city
P is for P is for for the city
P is for for the ci ci city
P is for P is for the city where it all began
Im an Ernest Hemingway portrait painted by Ernie Barnes
Clean sneakers and dirty horns last soldier of thirty gone
Who lost hope but still journeyed on
Yet Im the reason we gon have to get the gurney for him
Karma police carrying customized cuffs for me
I hope these taped up gunsll still bust for me
I had the whole world it wasnt enough for me
It got me feelin like the Lord lost trust for me
I made a means to an end when there were no wins
I burned bridges I had sworn to be eternal friends
The last ones I ever intended to turn against
Until we grew our separate ways like fraternal twins
So to the chosen few with whom I need to reconcile
My mothers mother my only brother my second child
Ive always loved you although that was rarely said aloud
So take forever I guess better late than never proud
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows ashes in the bay
Never lookin back until theres nothin in my way
Yo identify with the dead or the livin I dont know
Maybe my people set up to fall like a domino
America the beautiful go ask Geronimo
Whats the worst they could do to you I bet my mama know
I bet my father know your Honord throw the book at us
Even if justice wasnt blind shed never look at us
I want that clutch of what I could not touch
I was tryna get what I could get before I get locked up
And when that death clock struck
I was depressed enough to go ahead and press my luck
They held me down so long I figured I should just rise up
Like helium from the delirium
Tryna change my skin color like a chameleon
But are my best years of life behind or still ahead of me
What would I leave behind if I was over everything
The foundation for creation of a better me
Thats honestly the true definition of legacy do it
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows ashes in the bay
Devil on my back and theres a demon in my way


God damn it I said now
Told you once cant fool me twice
Hate to be the bearer of bad advice
What I see before my eyes bear witness
P is P is for the city P is for
Fuel the fire  P is for for the city P is for for the for the city 
To light the path of least resistance
P is for the city for for the city
Resistance
Yo they say my seed is a future threat thats all too correct
For that two fifths of a man that barrel to your neck
God damn it the hot hammer get all due respect
For the young cell block cannon that calls you collect
After runnin multiple rings like the Dream Team
Tryna breathe and touch keys like Kaseem Dean
Supreme cream his hands so dirty it seemed clean
Scream murder watchin 30 for 30 here go the theme nigga
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows with the lovebirds in the bay
Never lookin back until theres nothin in my way
P is for the city for the
P is for for for for the city
P is for for the cicicity
P is for P is for for the city where it all began
