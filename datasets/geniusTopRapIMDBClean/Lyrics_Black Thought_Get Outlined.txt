Uh LA uh huh Chi Town Philadelphia PA
Hey now uh LA yeah Chi Town Philadelphia PA
Listen pick any city the South side the outside
It isnt pretty the tots cryin and shots fired
Protection there be the lopsided cop kind
You see the scene of a crime like every stop sign
My section of twentyone pound is downtown
They walkin round wit the guns out its wild how
The youngings dumb proud followin the crowd now
Leading the blind with they minds up in the Soundcloud
Aint a lotta sunshine when you on a frontline
Listenin to that ghetto drumline duckin onetime
Thinkin how the Devil doesnt tire even sometimes
Wonderin how the fuck could ones rhyme be this unkind
Everybody cold to me seeming through this bullshit
The only thing that sold to me bein told we should hold on
Gettin old to me Im about to buckle
Cause holdin tight got my hands fully whiteknuckled
And to be honest tomorrow is not promised
Whether you on the streets of Chicago or Botswana
You gotta be rock solid not to be outsmarted
The rise from rockbottom to one of the top scholars
I never ask whats the secret of success
With a target on your back and a scarlet on your chest
Listen just get it not a minute to rest
This is not a test settle for the best nothin less dig it
Pick any city the South side the drought side
Where EMS has arrived well its about time
People who just get they tops fried get outlined
Minutes and seconds go clockwise but not mine
Where Im from its a war scene
Where more fiends scream for Morphines Zoloft and Thorazine
We dont subscribe to the grand scheme
The plans seems to be keepin us all sick sellin them vaccines
Aint a lot of fun time when your only son dyin
And the worlds comin untied from the inside
Thats between affection and depression its a thin line
Stress and pressure here is multiplied ten times
Everything is blurred to me lessons deferred for me
Fam said its been a long term since they heard from me
My lil homie never made it out of surgery
Sometimes I feel like South Philly tryna murder me
First everybodys upset cause you died
They like Wait a minute man
I aint the ones whos dead hes the one thats brown bread
Hah so in comes the second lie ya dig
