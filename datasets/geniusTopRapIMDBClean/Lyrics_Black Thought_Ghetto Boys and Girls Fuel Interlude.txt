Ghetto Boys and Girls  Fuel Interlude  Lyrics
I I came from the bottom up
I know a lot of boys you stop em on that street  Yeah 
Goddamnit  Ay ay 
They askin where you from
My family never had enough
Every time you quittin  Ayo 
I never had enough
I be like Im from nowhere
Listen everything I leave to this world
Still movin onward you say you from nowhere now  Uh 
Is for these ghetto boys and girls  Ayo ayo 
Right now Im with the young boys
Ayo and they convince us to adopt lies til the stock rise
While the vultures try and push the culture counterclockwise
Got us lickin shots at one another for Popeyes
Niggas rockclimb try and come out on the top side  Listen 
I mean the top of the food chain fuck a top five
My fears is fuelin my mood swings like the Mach Five
Whats the reason I just got high I forgot why
Another day another Glock fired like were not tired
Hollow men in the wasteland like T S Eliot
Spear stickin out of the flesh of a fresh elephant
News comin out in the press and they just relish it
When your hopes shattered in stress you say To hell with it
This is for my young boars in them gun wars
Out here on their going dumb jawn on the front lawn
Tryna break the long arm of the law that hunt for em
Bettin lives on the luck of that draw we want more nigga
Everything I leave to this world
Still movin on aboard nigga
We not human we at war nigga  Ow 
Is for these ghetto boys and girls
Listen listen listen listen
