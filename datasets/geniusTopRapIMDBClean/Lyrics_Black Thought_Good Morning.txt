Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Yeah  Grind easy bitches 
Hey good morning  Woo 
Hey oh good morning  Woo 
Yeah ayy  Good morning 
Yo Im from the home of the ghostses water plugs and wokeness
Water bugs and roaches drugs and overdoses
How you approach this Philly is where the dope is
My uncles Reds and Willie is still the goldsmiths
Hold shit steady were closeknit and deadly as a heart attack
Trust me the pitbulls is petty
Already infamous limitless Getty Images  Woo 
Foul temperament you start shit we endin it  Woo 
Its mad last wishes gas mask kisses  Oh 
The thin line between savants and savages  Oh 
Your life could depend on the laws of averages
The difference between Black and white is mad privilege  Fuck that shit 
For Lucifer son of the morning
Who swore wed ignored every one of them warnings
But try to run for cover under one of them awnings
Cause here the storm come
Tell the Lord time for His encore performance
Good morning  Woo 
Hey oh good morning
Yeah ayy  Good morning 
Good morning 
Fuck that shit  Hey hey 
On the wakeup
Dreaming every day of tryna get my cake up
Yeah
I got four million in homes three hours apart
Drug dealer tastes I think I glow in the dark
I only do features to keep hittin my mark
And show you motherfuckers you aint good as you thought  I am  lets go
Panamera shopping in the pandemic
The work got grill lines when the pans searing
Give you the whole clip to let your mans hear it  Oh 
Them pallbearer next to them so they can all fear it  Oh 
Ulterior motives with the modus
Bulletproof package like Im POTUS
Im just cashing in on what they owe us
They say the coming winter is the coldest
Celine fur hangin off the shoulder  Woo 
Whats worse the gift or the curse  Hey 
The only way to celebrate a death is with a birth
That Maybach sink can be converted to a hearse
I mean every word why you think its just a verse  Oh 
Im gone
Hey good morning  Woo 
Hey oh good morning  Woo 
Yeah ayy  Good morning 
Hold on 
Just as soon as the sun rise the night dies
You was building pyramids and African empires
Where paleskin savages with straight hair and light eyes
Was still eatin raw meat and barely could light fires
Before we ever sold cocaine we civilized Spain
You are not the first Black man in the Mediterrane
Shit you lying to impress you is just insane
I look at you with the disdain of an old shit stain
How you product of a God and you worship a man
I was God in the flesh before I drove a Mulsanne
Five keys of gold sittin on my neck in the frame
Surrounded by Black women West African king
And Im gonna go to Ghana to reclaim my name
While these chump rappers rap about the shit they cop
Man I cop my block and this shit dont stop
Im the official unofficial mayor of my city
Learned my lesson from the crack trappin school of high thoughts
Push the D like Pusha T and kept my mind Black Thought
Michael Render is the ender what the fuck you thought
Michael Render he the ender what the fuck you thought
God
Haha 
Ayo its the blues I dont know if the Crips even use it
Something bout your whole album is cribcleaning music
