No John Trumbull  Intro   Black Thought
Yeah Listen
You ever see a painting by John Trumbull
Founding fathers in a line looking all humble
Patiently waiting to sign a declaration and start a nation
No sign of disagreement not one grumble
The reality is messier and richer kids
The reality is not a pretty picture kids
Every cabinet meeting is a full on rumble
What youre about to witness is no John Trumbull

Give it up for DJ J Period on the 1 and 2
New York City this is a special Hamilton Mixtape edition of Ham4Ham You all are literally in the room where it happens
I wanna thank you all for coming out and thank you all for having us
My Shot  Rise Up Remix   Black Thought  Joell Ortiz
Ayo mugshot gun shot dope shot jump shot
Take your pick but you only get one shot
Advice from a schoolteacher to a young tot
Applyin a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox
When even role models tell us were born to be felons
Were never gettin into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon end up either robbin somebody or killin
Its not fair thats all they can tell us
Thats why I hustle hella hard never celebrate a holiday
Thatll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So Im unapologetic Im on my calisthenics
If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it
My final destinations different from where I was headed
Cause Ima shoot for the stars to get it
One shot


Im not throwin away my shot
Hey yo Im not throwin away my shot
Hey yo Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
I said Im not throwin away my shot
No Im not throwin away my shot
Yo Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
When opportunity knock you dont send anyone to get it
Answer the door welcome it let it in or regret it
They said if you cant beat em you join em
I say Forget it
Cause once you join em youre buildin a ceilin the way youre headed
Be American express how you feel and take the credit
Dont settle for 87 go premium unleaded and
Take off shake all the hate off its over
Its they loss the payoffs their weight off your shoulders
Must admit Im feelin um kinda um
Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher
Than a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize
I surprise you guys Im a prize fighter
My ninetofive describe your scribe survive minor
Setbacks and take steps back from pied pipers
Be leaders believers in yourself and mean it
I mean you only get one shot take it or leave it
Hey yo Im not throwin away my shot
I said Im not throwin away my shot
Yo Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
I said Im not throwin away my shot
No Im not throwin away my shot
Yo Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
Its time to take a shot shot
Im not throwin away my shot
Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
I said Im not throwin away my shot
No Im not throwin away my shot
Im just like my country
Im young scrappy and hungry
And Im not throwin away my shot
Its time to take a shot

Give it up give it up one more time for Regina Spektor ladies and gentleman Alright we got our next performer here right now A beautiful unbelievable RB singer here to sing her song from the Hamilton Mixtape called Burn I want you to put your hands together for Grammy nominee Miss Andra Day Round of applause
Burn  Andra Day
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive
She said Be careful with that one love
He will do what it takes to survive
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
Im rereading the letters you wrote me
Searching and scanning for answers
In every line for some kind of sign
Cause when you were mine
The world seemed to
Burn
The world seemed to burn
You published the letters she wrote you
Told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what youd done
She said You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun
You and your words obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you
You you you
Im erasing myself from this narrative
Future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
Youve torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They dont get to know what I said
Im burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn
I hope that you burn
Man Andra Day you are quite incredible Give it up one more time for Andra day ladies and gentlemen We cant begin to tell you how amazing this album is We got artists like John Legend Wiz Khalifa Jill Scott and so many more on this Hamilton Mixtape Its been a year since we began to put it together and we cant wait for you all to hear it But we got one more performance for you before you rush out to cop that Hamilton Mixtape Back together again for the first time ever performing their song from the Hamilton Mixtape here is Grammyawardwinning RB artist Ashanti and hiphop legend Ja Rule Make some noise
