Lend me an extendable ear then another ear
Hit the Three Broomsticks get me a Butterbeer
And Imma tell ya bout a halfblood wizard boy
This kid Harry Potter from the house of Gryffindor
Magical young man from the badlands
On the run from the Prisoner of Azkaban
Ey Hermione was like his best friend
And his homeboy Ron was his right hand
When students at the school started turning petrified
Harry and the squad knew the way to rectify it
Magic wand golden child on the special side
Play a quick game of Quidditch as an exercise
Harry was humble more in the presence of Dumbledore
But mention Voldemort and it makes him wanna rumble more
In Diagon Alley on a Universal Tour
See you on the Hogwarts Express  all abooooard
