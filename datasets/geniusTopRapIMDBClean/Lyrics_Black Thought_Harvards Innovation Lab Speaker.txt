Were living in some times thats the craziest
They say these legislators are the laziest
Dedicated religious figures have gone atheist
Each and every thing must change theres no escaping this
Im on the block postapocalyptic smoke covers
Coincidentally presented by the Koch Brothers
The magnitude of this is bigger than the both of us
The attitude is trying to manage not to choke from it
Go and get the bolt cutters open the floodgate
Any relationship Ive ever been in was lovehate
The city I was living in really never was safe
For some a temporary resolution was duct tape
Now Imma probably be on the blacklist
But I dont give a fuck so Im gonna shrug like Atlas
And if my skepticism was a brand new practice
Would yall be disappointed like yall just got catfished
Its cold blooded
Im wholeheartedly coldhearted and swole from it
The same unseen hand is still in control of it
I should be mining my own like its a gold nugget
But Im on that same bullshit just on a lower budget
Waiting on change that been low
Til the day after tomorrow I sit by the window
In a police state like your man Michael Winslow
My kinfolk told me theres a brand new Jim Crow
I been going to bed at 10 up at 5
Hustling to the bus and ride to the job
Its feeling hot as the Fourth of July
My lady just getting home we leading separate lives
She couldnt be one of those Stepford Wives if she tried
They shot my cousin he died it wasnt justified
I guess Ill see him if I make it to the other side
The corner deli owner tell me Hurry up and buy
If everybody is somebody tell me  who am I
The same figure who came from Anguilla
Aint nothing different I think Im addicted to painkiller
Im unpermitted to enter the village of ShangriLa
Im depicted as being a killer thats dangerous huh
Half dozen in one hand six in the other
Yo this is more than a sun tan its living color
Black as oblivion black as obsidian
Black as the sky at midnight ante meridiem
I am black as a portrait with Diddy 2Pac and Biggie and
Black as the influence on the culture we living in
I survived the Chitlin Circuit vaudeville and then
Managed to inspire The Beatles and Bob Dyl and them
But did I miss the mark because Im just as dark
As John Henrik Clarkes inner thoughts
At the time of the Harlem Renaissance
After which rights activists
Deviated the flight path to black ratchetness
Putting us back smackdab where night catches us
We just go along for the ride passengers
Gluttons for punishment masochists
Still doing whatever master asks of us
Will this generation go down as the last of us
Where being young menwhileblack was hazardous
Enter the proverbial masked avenger
All these pretenders suffer from symptoms of Affluenza
Im just thinking aloud about extinction agendas and plans
My grandmother definitely remembers
Listen her suits were tailormade
Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways like the way she knelt and prayed
Wailing Lord master forgive us our trespasses had us real afraid
I never listened but I still obeyed
I got to see how gangstas played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then mom started chasing that base like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain
Shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings Black Thought is what that all became
My journey from a dirty hallway to the hall of fame
Music  my therapeutic way to deal with all this pain
I was headed for the drain soaking before the rainwater came
And chaos thats when the order came
I started doing what Im supposed to do in life
Trying to move out of the dark and closer to the light
They say when you get a chance to do it over do it right
Cause tomorrow isnt promised every time we say goodnight
Listen hold up
Dope shot mugshot gun shot jump shot
Take your pick but you only got one shot
Advice from a school teacher to a young tot
Applying a sticker to a SpiderMan lunchbox
When even rolemodels tell us were born to be felons
And we aint getting into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And of these other peoples blessings were gonna be jealous
Its not fair that thats all they can tell us
Thats why I hustle hella hard I dont celebrate a holiday
That could be the day a brother couldve struck the lotteray
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So Im unapologetic Im on my calisthenics
If I have given it all Ive got I cannot regret it
My final destinations different from where I was headed
Cause Imma shoot for the stars to get it
One shot
