Ayo
I been pennin the Iliad and the Odyssey
A premonition I really had it was prophecy
Back in the kitchen now where we at is monopoly
The mathematician I entered the system properly
This officially a Philly jawn once again its on
I was born ringing alarms like Tenor Saw
My track record is what I aint got a blemish on
Unless I remember wrong
Well either way Im bout to finish strong
Redemption songs of a Genghis Khan
Revenge is sworn later on though the gang is called
You hit the nail on the head bro we dont bang with yall
Your team different we dont move with the same decorum
What I reflect is still a real feel temperature
Symptoms show Im physically ill and still emperor
Track whisperer carboncolored conquistador
Kiss the jawns and make em cry its not difficult
Woah a lot of rappers is rollin in fear of Trotter
They far from rock solid they soldiers Terracotta
Of my philosophy Im the father like Aristotle
I will put a end to your whole saga you Harry Potters is soft
Your rhymes EMO mines is nonGMO
Im a vessel a vehicle yall dont see it though
Im comin for the riches you stole like King Leopold
And keep the whole world on watch while history unfolds
Ayo
