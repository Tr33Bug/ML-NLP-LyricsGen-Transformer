Shit crazy
Dark room with the cloak draped over the mic
Colloquium light the smoke from the opium pipe
Silk road is a code so the only advice
To bring truth to the light play this only at night
If its over your life its not only a fight
My homie called it a plight and my homie was right
How to speak truth to power is refuse to cower and teach youth
The hour of reckonin is upon us theres enemies among us
Essentially in more than recent memory they hung us
Public assembly to watch death become us
Better believe it but if not check the numbers
Gramps told my father they sold his papa for gold and copper
Even though he was the strongest cropper
Now am I wrong if I teach my son to properly hold a choppa
And how to bring down a helicopter
Whats the concept The industrial prison complex
For niggas in the projects with they eyes shut
That still walk around blind to the conquest
That havent really realized whats the time yet
No due process the price is no object
When sentences match the crime they do not yet
Its been a war on the heavily melanated
For your own security you better be educated listen
And if you dont see whats happenin you just cant see
