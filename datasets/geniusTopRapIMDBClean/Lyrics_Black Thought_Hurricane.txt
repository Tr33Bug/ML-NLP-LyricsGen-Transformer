Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time its a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption surviving in a bind

Yo talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it aint shit yall could tell him
They said hes on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows thatll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid 
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted 
Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid
Dont understand the point that you at
Or how the hell you came to it
Flashback to images of that night out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ we on that again
Hurricane
Accuse a Hurricane
Aint change a damned shame
Its life for Hurricane Hurricane
Forever imagine your locked down forever
Could yall stand the weather
Could you hold it together
You tell me that you know the pain
Yo imagine if your life was like a hurricane a hurricane
Forever imagine your locked down forever
Could yall stand the weather
You built for that weather
Yo know whatm saying
Know whatm saying
You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
What can become of kings and young kids
Summer dream deferred incident occured freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words later on
The cops yall know what they be on
A niggas life is like a field that they play upon away and gone from
Natural lifer a soul he had to fight
Learn it himself sleep days stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking he got afterlife exercising
Developing his knack to write
Never leaving his cell in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
Its amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champions fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace Ru
Hurricane
Accuse a Hurricane
Aint change a damned shame
Its life for Hurricane Hurricane
Forever imagine your locked down forever
Could yall stand the weather
Could you hold it together
You tell me that you know the pain
Yo imagine if your life was like a hurricane a hurricane
Forever imagine your locked down forever
Could yall stand the weather
You built for that weather
Yo know whatm saying
Know whatm saying
Yes I am the inescapable the irresistable
The unnegotiable the unchallenged 
I am time
I scroll in measurements control the elements
I hold the evidence I tell the story 
I am time
I know no prejudice I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement I move forward 
I am time
You cant recover me conceal or smuggle me
Retreat or run from me crawl up or under me
You cant do much for me besides serve
Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully
Plaintively I wait to see what history will shape to be
Whos hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angels scribe the page for me
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who    patiently
Hurricane

Yo know whatm saying
Know whatm saying
The clouds clashed and the heavens gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter the Hurricane Carter rising
From out the south water like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You cant believe the world we live ins injust
All I see is more proof theres no place for us
They had my man Carter locked in a cage like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control
It was done to all of us they tapped directly into our soul
Either its singsing or its bars around your mind
Theres no where to run no where to hide
In a sixbysix a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is
