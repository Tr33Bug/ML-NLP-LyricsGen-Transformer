Im Not Crazy  First Contact  Lyrics
Twentyone pounds twentyone pounds twentyone pounds twentyone pounds twentyone pounds
Yeah
So when Columbus got here he got off the boat and he said to the first people he saw Who are you And the first people he saw said Were human beings
They say the world keep turnin Californias burnin
Who reignited the thirst for knowledge over the learnin
Oh wise and powerful black scholar holdin a sermon
The Gods is proud of you with your sword raised in a turban
Columbus said Oh Indians
The return of the prodigal sire accountable
For makin remarks remarkable
I hear some artists withdrew and I was responsible
A vessel partial for sendin that holy gospel through
Columbus is every descendant of the tribe of Europe that came
This is a mentality that came the Columbus Mentality we name it
But in about discovering this its you know almost like this is when the virus got here
We go to war when peaceful solutions impossible
A mountain is not to be confused with an obstacle
Anyway when Columbus got here
And he didnt know what it meant to be a human being
Easy stop fucking resisting back up back up
What the fuck Im standing right here
Im not moving Im just standing still
Back up back up
Love patience brotherhood and unity
We try and we try and we try if they become a threat
