Im Not Crazy  Outro  Lyrics
We go to war when peaceful solutions impossible
A mountain is not to be confused with an obstacle
Im as sharp as the scalpel thats used in a hospital
So til that day we expire and turn to vapors
Ill be making this paper and finally earnin my acreage
Leave it for Quadry Asa Ahmir and Benjamin Trevor and Jordan
Bia Tarik and themll finally be safer
I lay it all on the line find me a taker
If any man is an island Ill be probably Jamaica
A storm is formin too stand down yo Im warning you
I come to switch up the climate like global warmin do
A man called Portugal got with the oracle
We move from metaphorical to historical
So when when we when we introduced ourselves to the Europeans as human beings they just didnt get it
