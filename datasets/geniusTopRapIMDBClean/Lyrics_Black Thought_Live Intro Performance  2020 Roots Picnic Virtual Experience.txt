Uhhuh Two fifteen twentyone pound
I said memory banks too strong to try and jog with
Id probably fry your omelette on some com shit
Long firearms holder what I write a song with
Right or wrong moving right along
Its a higher form of convo with the gods Im in dialogue with
I hear the voice of the announcer signing off Rachmaninoff
Threw a Molotov on your doorstep
A bullet from a Glock tore through your cortex Monarch of Melanin
They all relishing the way Im Ralph McDaniels meets Ralph Ellison
The fine arts is elegant dark as heavensent
Official intelligence presented to you by the stopper
Tell them cops its too late to talk to me proper
Them South Philly boys is who offed Jimmy Hoffa
What hangs in the balance to the Talented Mr Trotter
And the twofifteen my savant crew
What can kill you in five words Thats not a haiku
Whats the most powerful book  Thats not the Bible
They say Do as I say do but not as I do
Its about time we held history liable
For survival of the most fit let them quote this
Get the people more than only hope for the hopeless
Knowing the police headquarters is the culprit
Slugs spiral outta the fourfifth and dont miss
I give a fuck about confederate flags
I got a heart more darker than Americas past
My bars is part Chris Parker part Malik Shabazz
And just shine like a treasure taken outta the trash
But dig it it gets deep like a bass guitar
The fiends never say the taste is off
The CDC done trace the cough back
To where your faith was lost at and press 69 to call back
When the Jakes provide bricks what would you call that
Some freemason type shit what would you call crack
Now we can swan dive into this or we can just fall back
I faced time with the victims they was just all black
Im like what does it give to the man whos got everything
Freedom is above and beyond duPonts Registry
You aint racing with the baton youre not getting me
Where you rotate in is not the proximity
Look its been about more than just the flesh
Its so ill I can still never catch my breath
Its so real in the field so protect your neck
Like you was in the Seventh Seal playing chess with death
I figure Ill be a sage for the rest of my days
The way I surf to the stage on the crest of the wave
Like a black Pharoah that suckled on a breast of a slave
If you place me on a page dont mess up the name
It goes TAR one I like a monocle
The last astronomical master of the chronicle
True spelling of it is with a K and not a Q
I break it down to particles and molecules
Dark or melo slick McArthur fellow prophet of rage
An audio slave like Morello
I was raised in my formative stage
Right in the ghetto where they made me not be afraid nor to settle
Im a one and only son of young lieutenant Thomas X
Knowledge wisdom common sense never mind the rest
Trying to find honour where theres absolutely honorless
The Spook Who Sat by the Door devil behind the desk
Im thankful that Im wide awake for this
Diasporas Afro pick like Hank Willis
Any activism is bad for bank business
Americas always been safe for straight killers
Yo the trail was tailormade for me to fail
The kill or be killed all end with me in jail
Its funny how the new Mark Twain could be Chapelle
And we shut down the starving trend if we prevail
I wont be reduced to simply a trope
It proves everything that I wrotes a slippery slope
Its hard to cope and still push the envelope
When your mind is far beyond this kaleidoscope
Ayo the way they cutthroat a brother do we not bleed
And from the shots do we not run in top speed
Whether black blue brown bowlegged or knockkneed
Every weapon is not made by Martin and Lockheed
Are we detained if they say that we cannot leave
Am I insane if I tell you I cannot breathe
Messages written in languages they cannot read
Public Enemys Chuck Ds and Hank Shocklees
Stick with your preposterous beliefs
They pull up and park and let the block perish in peace
And this speech could be the last words of the deceased
That makes my next mixtapes a posthumous release
But listen spilling a black mans blood so iconic
I go hard today because tomorrows not promised
Do the knowledge you could be crowned king Tutankhamun
God forbid go back to packs of Top Ramen
The overlook effects an astronaut problem
Lets count down in seconds till NASA start calling
As for Black Thought Im a master
Probably never be captured Method with the last report
Sorrow is the debate the statements and everything I create
The negatives not relative they dont relate
Thats cool it is what it is can I be great
Waiting for the big payback like its a rebate
To elevate to the V12 from the V8
A whip so fast that its impossible to be late
And its all love but its impossible if we hate
It deflates the wind from against our sails
Trying to keep in check like the prince of Wales
Toss any infidels against the rails
Heavy metal Mtley Cre no Vincent Neil
Im in channel but still go against the grain
If you talking about my life its probably a movie
Whod play me and my wife Taraji and Chewy
Back in the day maybe a young Ossie and Ruby
My chops is like Canada Lee
So yours truly for the Oscar
I started smoking weed like a Rasta when we lost Cassandra
That was hard to ponder
But I refuse to break down or stay somber
While history repeats itself like a mantra
I got too much more to live for
The demon and the Lord out here in a turf war
Its the way that the whole world is worse for
Probably with the wildlife reclaiming the earth for
Yo Philly stand up twofifteen
