Uh yo
Greetings and salutations Im runnin outta patience
So everything in moderation even moderation
Check every single allegation for recalibration
Call that the big pay back its debt consolidation
The credit fell what the hell too much bchamel
Well FML they desecrated the decibel
Go check the mail then let me know if its heads or tails
My ears burn like desert trails and Jezebels
Uh somebody must be talkin bout me
For carryin a big stick and walkin loudly
Articles in the Times and the New Yorker bout me
My killer instinct is like Orchid probably
Im a Pulitzer Prize Fighter how I vaporize writers
Shut em down at one time synchronize silence
Make the audience forget you call it Alzheimers
Child rhymers dont come at the old timers
Whether your fan base is lil mommas or Obamas
How you claim to have somethin in check with no commas
You and Mary got the same request its No Drama
Im the pinnacle of language yes the Dalai Lama
Who the clown talkin down to the twentyone pound
I gotta send him some rounds to simmer him down
Cause youre not worthy to even touch the hem of the gown
The brim of the crown motherfucker remember the sound
Its like
Hey yo
Yo
Since the second grade I been gainfully employed
Hustlin for change everyday from three to four
When other kids was into playin games and bein bored
Goin against the grains what I painfully enjoyed
When they was into race cars trains TV and toys
I was thinkin fat gold chains and freakazoids
Fillin the deeper void listenin to that Indecent Noise
People used to tell me Boy your brain gon be destroyed
Left hand to the law right hand to Allah
Both hands to applaud who brought sand to the shore
Confessin all your sins to the dope man through a door
I seen a preacher man sniffin cocaine through a straw
We almost had it all just one more cannon ball
And two more Geritol with one more Adderall
I got the game sewn like the tailor of Panama
Now I go by the name of an untamed animal
Wonderin how I can evolve to prestigious and less vicious
A more visceral individual best wishes
Just on principle I been answerin death wishes
What the Lord giveth is a king long liveth
