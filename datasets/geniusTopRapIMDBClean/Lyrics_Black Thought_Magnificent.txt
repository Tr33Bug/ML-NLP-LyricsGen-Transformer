Uh two fifteen  Thats right 
I hurt myself to see if I could feel  I am magnificent 
Then I began to pray to see if God was real
I said All Seeing reveal to me that which is concealed
Somethin told me that I probably shouldnt be behind the wheel of that Bonneville
I was still feelin kinda ill not a dollar bill
Time to kill tryna sign a deal
Ten years before State Prop was rock la famille
I was poppin pills unaware that steel sharpens steel Ive grown
Droppin my popular BBoy poems  MagnifMagnificent 
Took me to Amiri Baraka from LeRoi Jones
To Hajj Malik elShabazz from Detroit Red  MagnifMagnificent 
And to the polar opposite of what your report said
Well me and Sponart was playin our part
Creatin con art to curatin fine art now a niggas a monarch
The torch head was force fed look how the flames flicker
Now if its what Thought said you know the name quicker
Uh ay yo  Im magnificent 
The big homie in The Smithsonian  I am magnificent 
Im an ox so the box niggas cant throw me in
The punishment Ima hit em with is draconian
Its in me  MagnifMagnificent  muscle memory is Pavlovian
The magnificent with a tinted skin tone
Aint nobody fuckin with me keep em in the friend zone
Keep em closer than my enemy which I depend on for that motivation
Thats what keep a nigga en vogue
Fingers full of Flintstones
Louder than a motherfuckin pimp clothes
Haters I am the weapon the Lord formed against those
I prefer the law of mathematics over Jim Crows
My prose keep em devils jumpin out the windows  MagnifMagnificent 
The man tellin you shams to go to hell if you a god damn pyramid scam evangenical
The origin of my grace is unavailable
But you would know the name of the place is Illadel if you a real one
Ayy yo
I I I I Im magnificent 
Got the bop gun loaded up to kill one
Drop cruisin like Top Gun through Brazil
When your net worth is millions people too familiar
My network is real young careful where you chill son
Im the magnificent
Stay playin where them bad bitches is
Dilla Slum Village macknickelous
People know my style nasty as black licorice
Telephone stacks sickenin thats niggarich  God damn 
Dont make me burn your wings off like the Icarus  I am magnificent 
The Lord take away the same thing he giveth us
Temptation do not lead please deliver us  I am magnificent 
When you a beast you kinda cease to give a fuck
You stop listening please tell me not this again
Begging Bring back Black the block missin him
To murder tracks right in front of mad witnesses
Fortyfour magnificent what the bidness is
I am the most magnificent 
I I I I Im the magnificent
