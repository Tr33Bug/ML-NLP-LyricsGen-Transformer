I said outer space the place that Im parkin in
My marketin when you see the sky darkenin
Rhyme artisan from the crew thats bipartisan
Hi haters a 5th grader youre not smarter than
Alpha  Omega you betas I march harder than
Batteries yall aint included youre not a part of it
I just took a flight to France to cop cardigans
At Lanvin
Im that primetime Buju Banton
And Im just trying to get it on til I die
Am I wrong if Im living like the laws dont apply
Making music out of nothing know that boys bonafide
Its disturbing when a murderer enjoys homicide
Talented Mr Trotter squad beyond qualified
Multiplying the dollar sign the grind is real its Palestine
My sidekick came from Columbine
That fly shit came from Saint Laurent
Surprise bitch I never lived a false moment in time
Riddle me what kind of omen am I You know the slogan is ride
I said a weapon should be chosen to fire
Only the ghetto Beethoven replied the ninth wonder maker
Thunder breaker send these toys to the undertaker
My pen smoking like a rude boy from Jamaica
While Im erasing every fuckboy from the face of the Earth
Whats up boys Its time for you to get your weight up
Yo I probably began in the Rift Valley
In places untraceable by Rand McNally
Took a cobblestone trolley through a Mercer Street alley
To more championship rings than John Salley
Biochemically on par with Salvador Dali
I traveled to Tijuana and smacked the federali
Who packing avocado toast like Mario Batali
Im an ocean without a coast going back to Cali nigga
Name some other body equally as ill
Frequently I see the drama call me Cecil B Demille
Not a chink up in the armor though Im lethally for real
People been telling me recently Tariq you need to chill
But picture that the diplomat pistol slap aristocrats
Any rapper coming for me Ima send a missile back
Not too many legends got a legacy thats this intact
That equipment Im grippin kept where the ammunition at
Soul Makossa like Im Manu Dibango
Wild as the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Im Hunter S Thompson doing it Gonzo
A rapper winds up as a John Doe I told niggas
Sixty seconds to shine before I fold niggas
I must be out of my mind with it gold diggers
Here come the general for the quadricentennial
Im a nonmillenial what I rep is the old niggas
Lets meet at the crossroads and toss Os
And learn some things only the Lord knows
Break the law its the only law now no one knows
Got pies in the oven but no DiGiornos
We all got fucked but no pornos
We aint growing corn but got cornrows
We aint plant greens but we be spending it
Lifespan is short try extending it
If you aint into reading  Im recommending it
Im reading Carter G Woodson when Im in the woods
When the moneys cut off will we barter goods
A lot of niggas is cowards and ran out of fatherhood
Should we kill them or let em live
I dont fuck with no suckers I never did
Mi amor if you a Moor
If I ever go to war its the kids I do it for
I eat emcees they can send me a few of yall
And by a few I mean way more than two
You can times that by twenty and tell em to come through
And watch em get beat like African drums do
Old soul I probably gave lessons to Sun Tzu
Lyrically Im Bruce Lee mastering Kung Fu
Rhyming with Black Thought possessing the black thought
I told you that Im conscious but bet you Ill clap off
Ima be the one that they hold in a rap off
I aint wrapped too tight my nigga I snap off
Or maybe I snap on
When I go for the ride my nigga then latch on
Im Hannibal on an elephant animal but elegant
Given you hell heaven sent
Light a joint Ive been places youve never been
Close my eyes I could die then get wise
Treat my life like a script Im getting it revised
Used to keep the beat joint right up in the Levis
Im the tenth wonder I told them to ask 9th
Im the other Black Thought the last ear bender
Avatar ghost the one who could bend time
The one who could bend rhymes the one who could bend flows
Repping for old niggas little nigga you know
We the ones who made making of a murderer
Fuck around you could be in making of a murderer
Ghost
