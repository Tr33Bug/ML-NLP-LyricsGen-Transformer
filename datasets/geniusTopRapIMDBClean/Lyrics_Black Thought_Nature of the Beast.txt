Like sheep to the slaughter
Everybodys caught up tryin to find
Something to be a part of
Livin with our guards up all the time
Forever with a wall up
And breaking through it all never crossed the mind
The world seems smaller
And greatness is withering on the vine
Wont anybody take the lead
Its ourselves we love the least
Everyone seems make believe
Thats the nature of the beast
Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say kid
Everything aint what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
Ay all I wanted was to be more poppin and to see more profit
Whats the detour options ayy
I feel like Phillip Seymour Hoffman less Denzel Washington
When people are watching me
If the right amount of likes and follows can make me less hollow
Id somehow be more complete
But people tend to be more toxic so we see more gossip
And theres tension on the streets
Wont anybody take the lead
Its ourselves we love the least
Everyone seems make believe
Thats the nature of the beast
Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say kid
Everything aint what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
Everybodys caught up trying to find
Living with our guards up all the time
And breaking through it all never crossed our minds
And greatness is withering on the vine
Couple dollars and a dream
What did mama say kid
Everything aint what it seem
Life is what you make it
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
We are we are going through the same thing
Going through the same shit
