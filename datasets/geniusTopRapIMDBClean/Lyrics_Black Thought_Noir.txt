A young inmate who knew his fate was truly great
Had to escape from the chains that brought him to the States
To save face he made more than a few mistakes
While backtracing his roots like Henry Louis Gates
Respectfully the trajectory he remained in it
He tried to walk on water instead of wade in it
He went from cradle to grave hes been a king of the slaves
The menagerie of America he was made in it
Instead of waiting for Superman his people had a plan
They were sticking it to the man whose energy was spent like solid gold
Uberman
cause everything he did came back like a boomerang
A ruler without a throne the ruins are not of Rome
Intruder without a home a heart made out of stone
A blade made out of bone the skin of a copper tone
A loner but not alone the child thats got his own
NOIR
NO
NO
NOIR
The wave took some time to catch on
The spade was grey he wasnt afraid to press on
Neither was his child because he embraced the weapon
That aimed at the same prize his eyes were kept on
Surviving on soup kitchens bread lines and newspaper clippings
When he was in the headlines for being degradated
Segregated and redlined
For bluecollar crimes that couldve got him fed time
Where funds is critical and sons is killable
That unfulfillable 40 acres untillable
To make it in general wouldve taken a miracle
I pray for the Earth the day the meek will inherit you
A singer that says a Joyce but couldnt lift every voice
Deciding your life and death is making a heavy choice
Lifting a heavy weigh with so much hella hate
That every day I await is a reason to celebrate
NOIR
NO
NO
NOIR
