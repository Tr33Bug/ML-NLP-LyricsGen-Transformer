Living in some times thats the craziest
They say these legislators are the laziest
Dedicated religious figures have gone atheist
Each and everything must change theres no escaping this
Im on the block post apocalyptic smoke covers
Coincidentally presented by the Koch brothers
The magnitude of this is bigger than the both of us
The attitude is trying to manage not to choke from it
Go and get the bolt cutters Open the flood gate
Any relationship Ive ever been in was lovehate
The city I was living in really never was safe
For some a temporary resolution was duct tape
Now Imma probably be on the black list
But I dont give a fuck so Imma shrug like Atlas
And if my skepticism was a brand new practice
Would yall be disappointed like you just got catfished
Its coldblooded Im wholeheartedly coldhearted and swole from it
The same unseen hands still in control of it
I should be minding own like its a gold nugget
But Im on that same bullshit just on a lower budget
Waiting on chains that bend low
To let day after tomorrow I sit by the window
And the police state like your man Michael Winslow
My kinfolk told me theres a brand new Jim Crow
Ive been going to bed at ten up at five
Hustle to the bus and ride
To the job
Its feeling hot as the Fourth of July
My lady just getting home We living separate lives
She couldnt be one of those Stepford wives if she tried
They shot my cousin He died It wasnt justified
I guess I see him if I make it to the other side
The corner deli owner tell me hurry up and buy
If everybody is somebody tell me who am I

The same figure who came from Anguilla
Aint nothing different
I think Im addicted to pain killers
Im unpermitted to enter the village
Of Shangri La
Im depicted as being the killa this dangerous huh
Half dozen in one hand Six in the other
Yo this is more than a suntan
its living color
Black as oblivion
Black as obsidian
Black as the sky at midnight altomeridian
I am black as the porch who
With Diddy 2Pac and Biggie in
Black as the influence on the culture were living in
I survived the childless circuit
Vaudevillian in
Managed inspire the Beatles and Bob Dylan and them
But did I miss the mark because Im just as dark
As John Hendrick Clarks inner thoughts
At the time of the Harlem Renaissance
After which
Rights activists
Deviated the flight path
The black ratchedness
Putting us back smack dab
Where night catches us
We just go along for the ride
Passengers
Gluttons for punishment Masochists
Still doing whatever master asks of us
Will this generation go down as the last of us
Will being young men while black was hazardous
Into the proverbial masked avenger all these pretenders
Suffer from symptoms of affluenza
Im just thinking out loud about
Extinction and genders and plans
My grandmother definitely remembers
Listen her suits were tailor made
Sundays Mahila played
Simple familiar ways like the way she
Knelt and prayed
Well and Lord and master forgive us our trust
Pastors had us well afraid
I never listened But I still obeyed
I got to see how the gangsters played at such an early age
When my father was there to set them to us early grave
Their mom started chasing that base like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain
Shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings black daughters what that all became
My journey from a dirty hallway to the hall of fame
Music my therapeutic way to deal with all this pain
I was headed for the drain
Soaking before the rain water came
And chaos thats when the order came
I started what Im supposed to in life
Trying to move out of the dark and closer to the light
They say when you get a chance to do it over
Do it right
Because tomorrow was a promise every time we say Good night
Listen
Dope Shot
Mug Shot
Gun Shot
Jump Shot
Take your pick But you only got only one shot
Advice from a school teacher to a young tot
Applying a sticker to a Spiderman lunch box
When even role models tell us were born to be felons
And we aint getting into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And of these other peoples blessings weve grown to be jealous
Its not fair thats all they can tell us
Thats why I hustle hella hard
I dont celebrate a holiday
That could be the day a brother could have struck the lottery
I refuse to ever to lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up to just another one that got away
So Im unapologetic
Im on my calisthenics
If I had giving it all I got I can not regret it
My final destinations different from where I was headed
Because Im going to shoot for the stars to get it
One shot
