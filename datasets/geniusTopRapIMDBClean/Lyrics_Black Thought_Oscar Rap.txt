Im hip hop like gazelles in a kango
They say Im so off the chain like Django
Im on a mission like Argo Im not insane though
I pick my movie tickets up at Fandango
To see Les Miserables with Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway
Them Beasts of the Southern Wild with Quvenzhan
Im thinking one of the best was Lincoln starring Daniel Day
But then again the Life of Pi is definetely a candidate
Whats that movie with De Niro Hardly talked dirty
The Silver Linings Playbook or Zero Dark Thirty
Even that chick flick Amour is still award worthy
The Oscars is airing live Id hit record early
