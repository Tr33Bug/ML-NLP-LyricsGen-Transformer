Im from the Jam Boys army Riq Gees
And I never been tooken out
I grill emcees like Im cooking out
Im like a south philly crack house in the eighties
Im robbing them blind crippled and crazy
I keep the whole industry scared and taken
All types of medicine move on up like a Jefferson
And get yours I keep raw shit in orbit
My game like the preacher on the pulpit
The killer culprit is back that make you shake
Your necks will break its PA state
Cheese steaks and tasty cakes
I lace this style I mastered in
Niggas thinking fast Im far more faster than
Im on that thing you couldnt even hang with nooses
Fuck around and get stomped toothless
We in your face Jam Boys in the place baby
Niggas learning the way the tables turning right now
True emcees out the from out the Illadelphbow
Chchchch mad styles and thats word
I take yall herbs to the death
You better keep quiet as kept
Quit huffing and puffing I let you know a whole blood clot lot
The JBs in the spot a lot of emcees came to my show down
Now Im about to put your fucking ass low down
As you can go so slow your roll
Without a doubt I never been taken out by a nigga who couldnt figure
Yo by a nigga who couldnt figure
Listen any nigga who wanna get too close
We the utmost Jam Boys tracks will attack any rap host
Introducing Yo fuck that niggas name
Jam Boys far too complex stop playin
And when it rain it pours
We the money making boys
Porn Slim North and Raw
The talent that I got will will rizock the spot
I been in it for a minute but if yall forgot
Then whoa ohho let me slow up with that flow
Cause if I move too quick you might not know
How Im homicidal when it comes to the hard shit
Twofifteen roll on the scene you a target
They get taken out quick cause I done had it my nigga
You can suck my dick
