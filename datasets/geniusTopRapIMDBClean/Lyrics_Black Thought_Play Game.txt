Walk through Times Square and what do ya see
Ugliness where architecture used to be
Glamor and style are replaced by gaud
Like the sixtydollar spectacle its all a fraud
Thats the play game  Thats the play game 
So why do I want to play the play game
Thats the play game  Thats the play game 
I must be insane to play the play game
Even offBroadway its no guarantee
That some MBA wont decide what you see
Just like America lackin innovation
Just gettin by on glitz and reputation
Just like Amrica on the decline
Unconcrned with the product just the bottom line
Write for the movies write for TV
So what if its crap At least you wont write for free
Make thousands of dollars for a first draft
Your life wont depend on whether Frank Rich laughed
So just forget Shakespeare Beckett Molire
Thats the play game  Thats the play game 
Thats the play game  Thats the play game 
Thats the play game
Why do I care  Play game play game play game
