Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come on watch the garden grow
Ill see you when you get there
Uh alright yeah two fifteen yo
Downtown for the win woah
Sean C for the tempo Portugal for the intro
This is Arctical Don Disco from the one choir
Calling shots like an umpire
Where I live yo man I done lost mad kinfolk
Over gunfire through the window
As a young squire who become Sire
I had no way to tell what I was in for
I was 59 like Royce with the giant voice like Mik Winslow
Never been quite lik them so Im on my own time
Mind darker than a coal mine
Thoughts deeper than a gold mine
So Im out here slangin on this blade
Hopin that I dont get cut by these police
Makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil homies my lil sons
Got them keys and they got them drums
Making superstitious runs on them insufficient funds
No more rules in this here shit toddlers packin a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber
See you with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
If it aint about that paper then man that aint what Reek habla
Man you know whats goin they say Woke about that dope
Ask them fiends about them keys bout that coke bout that smoke
Two fifteen my city man and we it from round here
If its crazy where you at then it aint no different round here
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know  We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow  We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know  We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow  We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Yo reminiscin over old times sip a little bit of Oban
When the wind blow like a land mine balled up fist now
Who the fucks this calling on the landline
Back back like a hair line I dont really want the air time
I dont wanna smile for the camera damn I just wanna see my fam rise
I can feel when a man lies tryin to grow old and wise
And Im still fly like airlines stay sharp like samurais
Dip low like Camron Big Show when its slam time
Word to my nigga Anton
Bogarting through this door
Hopin that it dont get shut
By these police makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil uzi weighs a ton man I truly aint the one
My lil junior straight from juvie make a movie gangster run
Yall confusin this here shit with some television drama
None of yall lil mamas touching Mr Trotter
Even with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
Real ones out here winnin you swimmin in deep agua
Click pow Im a rebel just for kicks now
Been down with the get down
You aint sayin shit sit down
This loud twenty one pound my town
Man we it from round here
If they bout it where you from then it aint no different down here listen
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know  We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow  We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know  We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow  We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Yeah Alright Ill come home
At the end of the day everybody got good and bad
In every culture in every race
But you also gotta remember where your people at
Cause you always should want to love your people unconditionally no matter what
