Theres a real suspicious guy hes up to no good
Rest in power rest in paradise
If I could change matters I would spare a life
Cause lives matter theres clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
Rest in power rest in paradise
If I could change matters I would spare a life
Cause lives matter theres clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
They say that uh time heals all wounds It does not
In America one tradition that lasts
Is black blood woven into the fibers o the flag
Not addressing the problems of the past
To nowhere fast but following the path
So called leaders on hire for the Klan
Still rapin and settin fire to the land
Well thats the climate how can I become a man
If survival is a triumph and we got the underhand Listen
One killer one child one weapon
The shooter was unthreatened seventyone seconds
So many unanswered questions I see reflections of myself
I feel like in fatherhood we are connected
Too long before the shooter was arrested
So wrong worldwide weve been affected
To them its real sins of the father remembered still
For every Trayvon Martin there was an Emmett Till
You killed my son
How many more kids will we wait for them to kill
My tears collectin like raindrops on the windowsill
If the wounds heal the memories never fade
I wonder if youre in heavens eleventh grade
Six thousand two hundred and thirty days
Too young of an early age such evil and worldly ways
The thing in which we believe the way in which we behave
The way in which weve evolved the monster that we became listen


Rest in power rest in paradise
To all the babies too young to have had to pay the price
Cause lives matter theres clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
Rest in power rest in paradise
Know as long as you still got somebody here to fight
Your lives matter theres clearly nothing as dear as life
You have become a symbol in the spirit life
