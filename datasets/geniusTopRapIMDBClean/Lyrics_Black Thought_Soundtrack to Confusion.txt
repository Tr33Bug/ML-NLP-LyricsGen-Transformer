This shit crazy
Twofifteen
Uh Im here seated at the helm
The black soundtrack to confusion is the film
Im channelin uncertainty and usin it to tell
The story of winnin in life then losin it as well
The triumph was Makaveli inspired
Awaken a sleepin giant commander Tariq ibn Ziyad
Fresh from the fire and into formal attire
Thats from a foreign designer
I call the plug supplier but a high we got
Try me not thats the caveat
Youd probably get the same thing my last body got
Poet Laureate swift chariot the Maserat
The one to watch born the year of the ox
I got more than a reason to revel like Desus and Mero
Lyrical religious hero on Jesus level
The reason none of these heathens is even as thorough
We bare arms like Idris or Venus de Milo
My blood is different than the blood that you bleed if its yellow
Im colder than Paul Robeson leadin Othello
Im older than the barcode it aint easy to tell though
The rap John Henry they send me deep in the railroad
Im heavy metal the rock roller the rebel without a pause
Perspective is bipolar as ever
I gotta cross the bridge and then burnt it into ash
A reoccurin dream and then turnt it into cash
The reoccurin theme is the hurt lives in the past
But undeniable lessons I learned live in the stash
Uh the breadwinner the dead center the headspinner
I heard life is a bitch I went to bed wit her
I once was told to know thy self
How can I grow myself if I dont know myself
The lowhangin fruit for bottom feeders no topshelf
I chase demons for a lotta reasons not just health
Seated at the throne summonin the ghosts like a seance
I never take a day off work it never pay off
I wish for more peace on this Earth and never chaos
As long as classrooms gettin sprayed with the ARs
Yeah
Revelation of a blessin in disguise
I looked hate in the face and read the message in his eyes
They clickbaited a nation and requested the response
And dictated the makings of another renaissance
But wait the fate of its what the government decides
And I dont mean the state I mean this government of ours
The mark Ark of the Covenant requires
Frauds Im makin a mockery of em with the bars alone
The population of the world has grown
And more people in the streets than live in gorgeous homes
A lotta heavy conflict zones the swords are shown
Im tryna study all the language on the Georgia Stones
To quote the classic joint What a fool believes
And what the teachers of the school believes
Is very different from what the thieves
And the class in rule believes
Im tryna give yall some jewelries
We under pressure like a diamond mine
Huntin it somethin like a phenomenon
And we losin light like M Night Shyamalan
Them people searchin for somethin with body armor on
You never know who they wantin thats why we on the law
Preparin me that isnt necessary
What Im haunted by is knowin where the bodies are buried
Yet Im taunted by the omen
Knowin my adversary Im gone til Neveruary
Its on its gettin heavy for real
