We need each other we have to have each other for our survival
From the revolutionaries to the conservatives a black united front
Uh huh  Is what were about  Yeah 
The makin of the mob the changin of the guard
An angel from the Lord in ceremonial garb
The big homie in charge main culprit at large
Emerged over the odds the victory is ours
The talented Mr Trotter a midnight marauder
If theres blood in th water no stoppin the top shotta
I drop bombs multiple arms lik candelabras on a mission
Im chasing chicken like a Chupacabra nigga
Salute your father Im headed back to Wakanda
After the drama rappers get medivaced to the trauma
To kill a lion separated from the pride
I rule Zion I am the most hated one alive
A gun was fired another one expired
I represent the unwanted undesired
Wash my hands off it all then raise one and testified
To lyrical manslaughter Im guilty but justified nigga
I started running the streets when I was nine
When when I started running around at nine
I knew what I was gonna do when I was ten
Trust the vibe when its the fly sinister
Phillys certified finisher the prime minister
In Gods image the monument the homage is to
The problem is acknowledgin how to apply penance for the transgressions
That Ive accepted in acquiescence of my own presence
As I inspected my loaded weapons  Yall just dont get it 
So stream it at your own discretion every answered question
Investment in your own protection
They be like Black well who knew wed be receivin a new you
Thats part Zulu and Farrakhan meets Pharaoh Khufu
Misinterpret my level of genius and call it cuckoo
But the Swahili meaning of freedom is still uhuru
To the booth guru I deliver the truth to you
Who got the nerve to act as if this isnt proof to you
That I will mobilize a militia then troop to you
No tellin what I got in the system to shoot through you
If its too brutal look the other way like Im bribin you
But surrender all your valuables as if Im robbin you
As I slide the hassle to the side like a tassel
The facade of the place I reside is like a castle
Im the honorable Pense Noir my nom de guerre
Im the czar the PekingtoParis is my kinda car
Im the R Im the L Im the Kane
All correlated unadulterated power
The king been coronated wake up
No masquerade remove the makeup
Its no sleep but my eyes refuse to stay shut
Its gatekeepers responsible for this place
But historically the authorities been morally bankrupt
Enter the executioner speaking of retribution
I will send shots to Lucifer even to catch the future
Me and the best producers out again en route again
Airborne audio spores its like an allergen so
In conclusion I wanna clear the confusion
Any rumors the artist youre currently hearin is human
The shapeshifter weightlifter I hate Hitler
Im the great victor behind the bars state prisoner
