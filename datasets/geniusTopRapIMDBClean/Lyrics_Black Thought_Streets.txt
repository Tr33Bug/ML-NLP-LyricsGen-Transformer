Yeah that shit hard
I said my cranium is vibranium my brain is uranium and titanium
Fortyfives who aimin em Organize the stadium
Tell em Take cover I warned you not to play wit em
Them borderline war crimes you got away wit em
Who came to save the day and brought the K wit em
Tariq the peoples champ from the equal team
Tryna keep it clean long as all my people solid deen
Ive been in the music scene long as Allen Leeds
Make they salaries still accumulatin calories
Demonstratin how to breathe Senegalese Genovese
I been a reason to freeze reek Gs in the league
On my own gettin cheese
I will hurt Hercules I will merc most MCs
Im the last one to show up the first one to leave the crime scene
The obscene Salam theme the ridiculous rhyme scheme
The stick to the grind gene the hell with the hygiene
Its a dirty bomb word to seven thirty time
Disaster level nine eleven meets the eleven nine
Catastrophe beyond incredible I redefine the seventh sign
Faster scarier mass hysteria from Damascus Syria
To middle America school cafeterias and culdesacs
I told you that the boss is back know what Im sayin
In these streets that I call home
Unless youre blind youll see it all
In these streets its cold at night
Sirens screamin by gunshots all the time
Yo omert code meets the Hippocratic oath
Observin his whole circus from a diplomatic post
My word and his whole purpose a cinematic scope
The Earth and its whole surface I consider that his toast
Same as Sammy Davis Bellafonte Quincy Jones
Mahatma Gandhi James Balwdin Jesse Owens
Runnin from a cop car me and Akbar
I changed from a rock boy to a rock star
Hijack the elevator to the top floor
Im takin everything thats left like a southpaw
Crash and burn and learn through osmosis
And watch the word spread like Tuberculosis
I took a snapshot but it hurt to post it
I had a Black Thought and they called it wokeness
Overdoses water bugs and roaches
Forty Cals and holsters all halal and kosher
Twenty thousand jokers one aint playin
Im Claude Brown Manchild in the Promised Land
In these streets that I call home
Unless youre blind youll see it all
In these streets its cold at night
Sirens screamin by gunshots all the time
