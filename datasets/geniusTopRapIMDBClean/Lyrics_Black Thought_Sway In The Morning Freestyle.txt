Up steps the one and only in the flesh
Cynically Sierra Leonian fresh to death
Big homie and them reps the best
Knew you know me from somewhere
I get wrecked with Questlover
The brother get it on bring a song
More brutal than Genghis Khan
Whose name ring alarms to fakes
You couldnt place but know Im the truth
Thats before you recognize its the one from the Roots
Armed to the tooth trying to take a eye for another eye
Im from We hear gunfire for a lullaby
Yo forget it who the hell am I
Yo Im the reason these MCs lies became nullified
The stuff of legend so tell me whats tougher brethren
When Im the blast from the past that started the present
Vision of the future me and the super producer
And Im ten times smart as Im used to be
And Im still seeing the voice through the speakers
Porsche two seaters Jimmy Choo speakers
Real rap remedy man a true genius
I brought Yosemite Sam two heaters
Asking these bastards if its any last words
Besides what when why and all them adverbs
You bout to be the next fugitive captured
Just keep thinking you can lie and live after
Slow your roll playboy  rabbit ears
Cuz damn right its on sight like Vladimir
And by the moment in time you will be outta there
Strapped getting slapped for acting so cavalier
I come from Philly and them cowards dont travel there
Brothers let the heat rattle there they dont battle there
Itching to leave you in a pool like Mike Phelps
Learning to fight might help but thats light help
Because if bullets make flack melt
Then imagine just what itd do to you even if you a black belt
Ayo my brother still concealing with a Gat held
On a block where it used to be a lot of crack dealt
Lo and behold this is information overload
I put the crowd in a trance like Paul Oakenfold
I used to be the lowest on the totem pole
Until I reconstructed my goals left a broken mold
Setting sights on a open road
I hit up anywhere and everywhere
That realness is bought and sold
Ayo they got me on an honor roll
That means whenever speaking my name
Begin that with The Honorable
TAR one I like a monocle
I bring the riot through and laugh cuz youre comical
Look get in that ass like your father do
Hit that catatonic chronic out in Bonnaroo
Im psychological jump like Geronimo
Probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
Whoa if I dont work then I wont eat
No I dont Facebook but I might Tweet
The industry is out of control like OC
So take this L on the chin like its a goatee
Im kinda like a cellar door Im lowkey
I used to mix bottles of Champale with OE
Im Aristotle I cant fail Im OG
I came through to get free like no fee
Hey yo they got me on a pedestal trophy
Got em singing damn Riq cheating like adultery
Sycamore sitting on paper like upholstery
Noam Chomsky Im on an organized rhyme spree
Messing with this is a borderline robbery
And thats what it is Im Jimbrowski
Certain circles call me The Big Lebowski
It would behoove you to find out about me
