Uhhuh yeah twofifteen
I get on my jawn when I perform I grab the bull by the horns
You probably should try to do it I body you maricns
My dynasty alliance full of firearms carriers
Kings who pull strings like a Stradivarius
His imperial highness is smart as smart appliances
Sharper than the academy of arts and sciences
Thoughts a scientist plus what tragedy to triumph is
Try try again I rule the night with an iron fist
An indication that youre close to dying I am this
The black Moses black roses black violins
When niggas go up against the choir the sire wins
It aint no way to try and cleanse true leviathans
Im hardwired but its barbed wire
I took that vanity threw it into the bonfire
Some iffy shit transpire them guns gon fire
I never see my reflection Im like a vampire
Your empire expired dont test the Esquire
Im blessed the messiah no less than fresh
I am the best you just tired the fuck is you stupid
This is true grit Ima call it the new shit
