Thought is Like  Freestyle  LyricsThought is like
Kato 808 in my rhymes the Green Hornet
At times I lean on it yall just fiend on it
Im cold fronting throughout the metro
Piloting baby the globe is my area
Yeah the most feared villain in America
Toss the trigger I use to hit the sheriff up
Now Im convincing these dudes to get their lyrics up
Yall niggas bull too much yall niggas said enough
Sickin competitors heavily stressing this with ya
My medicine Yall finna go see the therapist
I gotta settle it black metal to metal
With these brothers on that bullshit pot calling the kettle crisp
What could be better bitch Im rocking the flag with the green black and red
And youre on the confederate boy you work for Merill Lynch
Yall aint fucking with a brother hell bent on success Im living evidence
See its really all about sensation and the fascination
We got to chase it dreams
Im trying to be the champ youre in to racing
Cause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize
Something undetectable to yall naked eyes
Still its probably more real than yall recognize
I specialize in raw carnivorous rhyming
Better silence it yall you couldnt size it
The fourth horseman give rise over the blade
Its going to cut you to a different size
In the days of guerrilla warfare
Making a change like carfare
I want these chumps taken off here
Sip my morning coffee kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend Im gone until I save the world
Jump in my hotrod wheel looking super thorough
Rocking an all black cape like the Duke of Earl
The essence of a movement on some smooth shit
Langston Hughes mixed in with some Stanley Kubrick
Sick still yet Im savvy penning a nasty masterpiece
That convey my sentiment exactly
Black Im that nice son from Michaelango or Michael Eric Dyson
Slicing like a viking dog Im white lightning
Im caught with a bone with a slight tick in my mind
Its tight frightening
The flow is part Mozart and part Malcom
Clearly you aint fearing you already know the outcome
Another victory were making history
Im stronger than the walls in the penitentiary
