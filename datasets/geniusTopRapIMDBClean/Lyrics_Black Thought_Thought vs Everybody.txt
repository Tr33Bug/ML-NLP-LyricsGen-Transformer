In just a few moments
We will hear from the most powerful black man in America today
Uh  Everybody 
I dont think you heard me  Ayo
The most powerful black man in the world
Ayo they ask why I seem so solemn
On the throne between three stone columns
You know the name fuckin up the game no condoms
Everybody got damn first world problem
The truth is inconvenient as nonbelievers
Fearing DACA dreamers instead of FEMA
Bentley Benz or a Beamer Fiji or Aquafina  Everybody every goddamn body 
We fuck around and be the next Iwo Jima
The tides risin at the same time like they synchronized
For makin art for makin love for makin Hajj
The home is where the hatred lies they takin lives
But everybody just so saved and sanctified
Then they rely upon we the few defiant ones  Everybody every goddamn body 
Communicating in higher forms than Viacom
To dialogue before the roar of the riot horn
I wonder on which side of the lines I belong
Lady Liberty face full of concealer
Im half Masta Killa and half Hugh Masekela
Latrophobia thats a fear of the healer
Kaepernick is an activist yall in fear of the kneeler
Everythings obtuse nothin is obscene
Another young life was lost on live stream
Another great fell from grace in high esteem
Then the clock struck thirteen we in some kind of dream
First Im handling first things decipher what it means
To a planet of earthlings where the question remains
Am I a journal or journalist Herbal eternalist
Olympic tournament level genius author affirmative
Though turnin back and returnin Im not concerned with it
The permanent ink paved the way out the turbulence
My hands against the wall outside a billiards hall
I hear police discussin whether to try and kill us all
I questioned if thatd matter life is like a tree that falls
In the woods even with iPhone footage to see it fall
Great men chose the Papermate Pen or State Pen
The firin pin of a pistol aimed at a playpen
We go from musket to a missile to a revelation  Everybody every goddamn body 
Between Heaven and Satan while Im steady creatin
And try to separate the truth from the lies that they told us
I even heard the Soviets the 45th POTUS
That aint the photo they showed us or acceptin the onus
Did they Washington us My condolence to yall diplomas
Heres a bonus the point of view to make things see through
If Im a walking institution Im a HBCU
Face the music keepin it movings one of the great things we do
Yo the devils tryna put together his gang me too
And whether you come from Lagos or Trinidad and Tobago
You can either stay broke or be wealthy as Jeff Bezos
If you just stay woke I was in the dark then day broke  Everybody every goddamn body 
Directin questions to my ancestors until they spoke now
Inherently rockin the disco currently
Bars is cryptocurrency hypnotherapy
Shittin on everything 59 64 lyrically
Crystal clarity wonder how I spit so thoroughly
Stay so hungry rappers cant get no mercy  Everybody every goddamn body 
Thats the reason any other one who spit wont versus me
Its so lonely in my own class Formerly known as
And the inscription that your headstone has
On my own path in my own world like Disneys
I feel the fuckin system fail just like kidneys
Up steps the one who upsets all carriages
Cause its imperative we change the narrative
Everybody  Yeah and thats Thought vs Everybody
Everybody  Listen check it out that go to everybody
Everybody  Yo I got myself over everybody
Everybody every goddamn body  Yeah every goddamn body
