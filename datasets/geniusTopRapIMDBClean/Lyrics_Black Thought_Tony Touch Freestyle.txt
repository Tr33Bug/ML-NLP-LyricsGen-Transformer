To the best of my knowledge I guess that Im fresh
When I manifest
Hold up dog
Yo Tone its the Jawn
Its the professional
I make your girl get extra low
Im from south with a border like Mexico
Jaws talking bout they love me like x and o
Cause their man pop early like Plaxico
Not conceptual unexceptional hundred dollar bills filled of cocaine residue
Got you off your deed Im ten steps ahead of you
Fresher than a 1985 fresh festival live
One time for my hoods and my barrios
Bloods Crips Latin Kings Trinitarios
In the hood staying dipped like Oreos
Even with a Moms on their shit like Marios
From the Illadelph valley side of things
And embalmed in my words in the Valley of the Kings
When I finish yall I ring alarms like Tenor Saw
And rage war with a Renascence yall better get it far
Rest in Peace J Dilla
The Legendary Roots Crew from the city of Philla
Yup mines the math
Though I rocks the mic and never got to past
But I got your ass
Listen uh
Well Im a legend in my own time
Look at yall just a legend in your own mind
I let the drum talk to me cause it dont lie
A lot of rappers try to kill it but they dont die
Keep them coming back and feel it like a throatpie
La vida loca from something toke to this
Grand Imperial hall of fame material
Black general 215 name rank and cereal
My thing highly flammable
I bang like a hammer do
Swine flu bird flu and every type of animal
Im immune to Tamiflu
Ill be God Damn if you
Insane and bananas too
My bling is intangible
Well its the Jet Li
Im working on your requiem
Step in a party everybody scream Thats him
I push a fast BM
Black gray Gatsby and
My gats be in the
Belfry that the bats be in
A box is what you never gonna catch me in
If this the last day and times nigga
Cash in
Yep
Looks like a job for a conquerer
Top mr third Mr swerve mr popular
You kinda finished
Cant see it with binoculars
Rather have a fish bone lodged in your esophogus
You ever heard of the world
Im on top of this
Still the most properest
Yall know what the gospel is
Bless the child
I aint wind up a xfile
After  self imposed exile
I reimerged cut from a different textile
They say im just wild
Waiting on my next trial
Ive always been the nigga with the most fresh style
In 98 I rocked what you copped just now
I had dreams like Akira Kurosawa
And realized my meteoric rise to power
They say I drive 220 miles per hour
Sixteen bars 220 thousand dollars
About it
Reliant hypnotic
The game full of too many funny clowns and cowards
Look
Son of aslam aleikum
Im an abomination
A marijuana patient
With Grammy nominations
If everything and everybody in their proper places
Black Thought is out his mind he on that outer space shit
Spotted on the red carpet steppin out a space ship
With a glass of shiraz and two around the way chicks
Nowadays dont nobody say shit
You dont want to see me get up on my modern day shit
Try to tell you Thoughts dangerous
Cant nobody hang with this Great
Translated into 80 different languages
Websters and Cambridges
Every day the chamber switch
Grownass man
I dont know who the fuck you playing with
I Leave with heads in my
Takeawayfromdinner bag
Wicked grin like Mahmoud Ahmedinijad
Never been a nice nigga cuz they finish last
Im a menace
Thats what ima be remembered as
Fresh
Dont even worry bout it
My legendary stylin
Between Harry Belafonte and Harry Allen
Im from a city where its violent and its overcrowded
I put it on the map yall aint even know about it
I brought the poet out it
The soul flowin out it
Make it hard to figure how yall managed to go without it
A mic with a cord I never do a show without it
When dealin with fraud I lift em up and throw it out
I know the way to go the route
Show you what a soldier bout
Big boy arms Im holdin out
Clips foldin out
Used to be a little snotnose but Im older now
You can try what you want Ill tell you what I dont allow
Fuck all the running round
You on a hunting ground
You spit a hundred bars
I spit a hundred rounds
You run a hundred yards
Trynna get outta bounds
Thats when I tackle yall and show you how the thunder sounds
Bang ya as we approach the danger
Rhymes that invoke your anger
And I aint know the music was supposed to change us
But when I start spitting it is so contagious
It smokes the pages
I literally spoke to sages
They said its no hope to save us
Because we the bad guys you supposed to blame us
Cause nowadays everybody close to famous
But stop modellin
The wild scholars in the wind like an halogen
Yall motherfuckers can forget about challengin
I blind rappers like a magnified Halogen
You trynna tussle with the truth how about it then
I am lightyears beyond not behind the line
I will separate store from truly divine
Give me a crystal head vodka with a twist of lime
And watch rappers get smoked like a nick of time
I will put you in a body bag pick a time
I will bring it to your doorstep kick a rhyme
Niggas sick but they aint near sick as I am
Rappers is slick but they aint near slick as I am
I dont give a fly
Niggas stop signifying
Stop cowering be a man and die dignified
Im that insecticide pesticide genocide
You in the morgue absolutely identified
But nope I wont do it in the name of love
Until Ive given it my all and it just aint enough
See even winters gettin realer than they say it was
Straighten up who afraid of what
Play your good and ball
Yeah
You work hard til youre better off
247 365 never off
Look at me Im nocturnal I dont sleep
Eyes heavy bags and crows feet we wont be
Stopped I dont work then I wont sleep
Time keep flowing like a river that dont cease
In the mind of a super nigga theres no peace
Cant stop running like Im ducking the police
Yeah
Cruely how they try to do me like cochise
Flow so obese Im springing a slow leak
I keep a crowd satisfied like bringing them cold heat
Yo youre the pitsPitts like Angela Jolie
Stop stop
You know the cameras is goin see
Wolves lookin at me like them cannons aint on me
Please you aint dealin with no amateurs homie
Philly aint known for cheesesteak sandwiches only
Yeah
Climbed to the top man I was lonely
Everybody didnt need mugging like Nick Nolte
But no I wont stop wont drop wont retire
Im my own supplier selling goods to the buyer
The torch to the eye of the storm on fire
Jawns trynna give me birthday sex like Jeremiah
Hittin me up on Facebook
I replied denied
Tell me Im in the top 5
They aint never lie
Picture me in that Peking to Paris with a ride
It cost 2 to 5
Them doors suicide
Yeah
Testing Thought that will be your suicide
No matter which corner of the globe you reside
Listen
215 dumb shit aside
When it come to the job getting done what am I
Im the god of the microphone praise the lord
Anybody disagree with me come raise your sword
Im agent orange poisonous amazing pawns
And the band keeps raging on
Well listen
And yo I dont stop
No I dont quit
No I dont stop
No I dont quit
No I dont stop
No I dont quit
