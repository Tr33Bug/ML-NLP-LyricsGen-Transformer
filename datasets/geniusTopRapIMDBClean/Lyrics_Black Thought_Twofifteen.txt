Hey dis
Cest pas vrai dis
Pincemoi dis  Twofifteen 
Cest comme si je navais jamais dans avant
Yo the big wheel keep turnin like Ikes and Anna Maes
The church kitchen hustlin dinners every Saturday
Pull over let me grab a plate I tend to gravitate
Towards how fish dinners from a styrofoam platter taste
My granddaddy sported plaid Donny Hathaways
Hustlin for everything we had til he passed away
When I would ask him bout what path to take
He used to laugh and say No man is an island but Im a castaway
Casualties I seen em like the French Foreign Legion
On the streets they used to carry out bizarre procedures
In jean jackets and Jabbar Adidas
Back when local RB was just as soulful as orthopedics
Me and my man twistin up some reefer and wishin
We knew all the town hitmen and the likes of Sam Christian
On the edge of existence man listen
Understand respect and fear was the allAmerican ambition
For badass kids in the laundromat foldin a load
Well lo and behold a whole nother fork in the road
My wish for them is that the truth is eventually told
Out on the corner where whatever you can sell is sold
I heard murder ran this vast deserted land
Since back when Burning Man was blacks in Birmingham
Before the presidential election diversion scam
Matter fact before they clapped Franz Ferdinand
You gossip on Jay and Beyonc or Kim and Kanye
But keep risin to the top what my mind say
Picture my daughter drinkin water where the sign
Say For colored girls I aint talkin Ntozake Shange
Who said its Senegal I was a king in general
Rich in every resource precious metal and mineral
Before the devil entered the land of the plentiful
With that Jamaican funk gotta get it into who
For generations under God indivisible
Psych ward patients vampires in a interview
Become institutionalized what a nigga do
But what we had to do to survive none of them could do
Who the technical culprit I dont mess with no vultures
Im electrical voltage not the regular dosage
Too obsessive compulsive Im a fuckin explosive
Mixed message in a bottle I left with the postman
Im that arachnophobia black petroleum
Ceremoniously holy when at the podium
Even though its hotter than weaponsgrade plutonium
The people tryna check for the return of the Ichiban
ObiWan universe you owe me one solid
My homie Gonzalez only know gun violence
On the corner where they probably on they 21 Savage
Catch two in your cabbage Young Cesar Chavez
Division one yo wait a min where we get our rhythm from
Continuum still swingin like a pendulum
Here the women come sing it like Sarah Vaughan
Heard 9th up in a house from North Carilon
Aint no mannequin challenge but yall paralyzed
Its gettin cold outside a word from the wise
Yall niggas better bundle up
But I bet it be a hotter summer not for nothin
Yo the cops get down especially when it come to us
Nigga better be a Rockefeller
Get that out your pocket fella sang acapella
Aint a damn thing really changed as far as I can tell it
Another soul with no name the helicopters hunted
Look like a couple of days before the doctor comin
But thats my little cousin watch him for me
I think the world tryna sock it to me
It kinda feel like everything is out of pocket for me
Who keep it a hundred when everythings partial
Dignity and sanity is what the game cost you
Wake up to the paddles on your chest we had lost you
Im just paintin a picture like Kerry James Marshall
Im just takin a picture like Carrie Mae Weems
So smile and say cheese we in 2018
In a pyramid scheme nightmares and day dreams
From the runaway slave to a modern day king
Hey dis
Cest pas vrai dis
