We Could Be Good  United  Lyrics
Im tired of this
What is it What are you tired of
Im tired of you not being here
Im here Im here right now Im here right now
The only time I connected with you is via social media
Listen all you gotta do
Are you never home
Im connected right now
You always down the streets all you do is work come home shower get dressed and go the hell out
Am I not a man or another man yeah
Just thought Id be yeah
All we can be
No one can always be kissin undr the mistletoe
Evntually youll be sendin each other missiles and wonderin just where this will go
Even considerin splittin but neither one of you wanna make it official though
That pressure build in the kettle until the whistle blow
I know if ever I left you Id only miss you though
Our love is in a place where theres no time or space
No time to waste on the outside of our divine embrace because of my mistakes
Sometimes we overcomplicate or undercompensate
I try to keep it namaste but youve just got complaints
I say you know me and you told me to get out your face
But you should know your crown is safe
And Im proud to say Id never just vanish without a trace
Whos countin arguments Theres too many to calculate
I know its a sweet and sour taste but when its good its great
Energy and chemistry gets out of symmetry but we can be
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain
Im like Johann Sebastian the Zohan of fashion
The slow mind really showin no signs of graspin
Go find the caption to explain the neutron and proton attraction thats
Got my wife at home jealous of my microphone
Tellin me shes really been missin the smell of my cologne
That Im too grown to be livin this life of Rock n Roll
That all the tension is really startin to take its toll
And not to mention I really should try to take control
Instead of breakin and takin her where she hates to go
I know its because of the memory she cringes
The door was off the hinges the curtain shredded to fringes
Its crazy seein the same image through different lenses
Id like to say the price we pay shouldnt be that expensive
If somethin isnt righteous its making you apprehensive
But time is workin with us not against us and we can be
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain
We both going to feel but we aint gotta fight
You can be real fuck tryin to be right
You can be straight with me never tell lies
Easy as cake baby we could be pi
Instead of us trippin you flippin all night
We could be trippin jumpin on flights
And we should just listen  Just listen 
We gon disagree shit baby we different
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be we could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain
My soul can really feel your soul you know what I mean
Spirits or no spirits and our spirits agree
