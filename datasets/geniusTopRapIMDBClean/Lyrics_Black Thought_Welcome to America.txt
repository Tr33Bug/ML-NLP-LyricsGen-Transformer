Welcome to America
Where you can dream as long as you can breathe
You can be the muhfuckin President of United States
And get murdered right on these streets
Welcome to America
The sins of the father my pop gave me to suffer
The friends I would follow was crack babies and hustlers
Its steel sharpen steel in the block made me a cutler
My pen is from the future like Octavia Butler  Wlcome to America oh 
My grandmother suturd a flag from bloody cotton
The fruits of her labor alas already rotten  Welcome to America yeah ayy 
My man said Yo its crazy how fast that weve forgotten
That we used to pull boxes and plows like we were oxen
And cows without an option and now its this glorious
Victorious story only pitched
For me to shut it down they sold some of us down the rivers
Its such a poor level of thought I get the shivers
Its insidious and its always been hideous
I had to tread water and run be amphibious
They do you so dirty for one yo whats cleanliness
They make you wanna let off a gun into the emptiness like
Preach now lover preach now lover
That we runnin runnin runnin runnin runnin
Welcome to America
Yo Im illfated and hated Im hella melanated
Blackness is my religion to that Im dedicated  Welcome to America 
I follow the laws of nature by which Im regulated
The universe my university Im educated
This one is for my very revolutionaries
After keeping it a hundred even though the truth is heavy
Who stand firmly and see their life is a journey
That either God or the gurney my public defender burned me
So did the district attorney in a turbulent trial
They told me that time is master well Im serving it now
Tell my family Ill be making my return in a while
And every symbol of oppression Ill be burning it down
Welcome to America  Yeah 
Where you can dream as long as you can breathe  Long as you breathe 
You can be the muhfuckin President of United States  Thats right 
And get murdered right on these streets  Doo doo 
Welcome to America
Land of the brave  Yeah  and home of the free  Thats bullshit man 
You can be a saint or a sinner or a billionaire  Yeah 
Or just stand on your feet
Welcome to America  Keep on runnin runnin 
America oh Lord  Keep on runnin runnin 
Welcome to America  Keep on runnin runnin 
America oh yeah


Cause when its over the world aint over  The world aint over 
What they say is what well do  Its what we gon do now 
We outpowered still have power  Still got power 
And thats what we cannot lose
Runnin in the shadows got my eye on the sparrow
Tomorrow may not come at least my soul felt this love  Uh 
If I let you go at least my soul felt this love
Hey now hang now hey now hang now
Now a Black soul never passes alone
If its blood spilled on the ancestors ashes and bone
From a pure heart the Lord fashioned after His own
Went packaged and flown to the essence of his African throne
For every lost body crossed tarred feathered and tossed
Its no way I could measure the course or ever exhaust
But whether its yours or mine this American cloth
Has never been soft while history was running its course
I ran hard from Jamestown with slaves found Jesus
And foul demons that never be charged with malfeasance
I sat through they revival though I never found credence
I found that we had never known shit about freedom
Ive been charged with treason Ive been scarred and freezin
Ive been called a nigga and then called a heathen
When hounds found me they couldnt even tell if I was breathin
In America where on black men its open season
