Yellow money yellow women yellow taxis
The smell of the city thats coming at me
Pepper head heffers in New York are never happy
Rule of threes the main thing that attracts me is
Yellow sapphire yellow diamonds and gold
If loving her was the bing I guess Im out on parole
Out of control I was too sad to try to console
I took my hair out of my durag went out on a stroll
To hail a taxi a jitney a cabbie a gypsy a hack
Someone to get me down 125th street
Out on the corner lookin for a driver to lift me
To the height of a high yellow mama to kiss me
That old man minis probably gonna to miss me
But thats ancient history Im trying to get tipsy
Some middle mystery mix might come whistlin dixie
And drunk from corn liquor or some bootleg whiskey
In Harlem black girls are too high saditty now
I need somebody brand new to New York City now
I need a mama who walk talk and look pretty now
And if I could get the milk for free why would I buy the cow before my
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow money yellow woman yellow taxi
Uh Look
Whoever said black dont crack was wrong
I need me a saffran jawn to go platinum blonde
Matter fact big blue eyed AngloSaxon swan
With the forkedtongue or horns like a Capricorn
I need an amazon viking whos physically striking
She could start off yellow then deliberately lighten her skin
Until its brightened and visibly whitened
I mean the polar opposite of Cicely Tyson
If you need a black lover you can go head brother
I wont mess with anything less than cornbread color
Of the flesh she might see a tan but only in summer
Shes my number one and one is still the loneliest number
Without my hello mellow yellow amber waves of grain
I hope youre able to love me cause Ive been raising Cain
And God dont like no ugly so Ima change the game
Should I even change my name Nothing stays the same after
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow money yellow woman yellow taxi
Ayo the smell of the city thats coming at me
Yellow taxis taking me to my yellow honey
Exactly look at me smellin the yellow money
With my charm on my arm I dare you to take her from me
Ima make her love me ayo bunny listen to me  Ahem 
I beg borrow and steal to cop a meal
And dress with superior zest and proper zeal
I should say my middle name is Lets make a deal
Because gettin something for free in life is not for real
Last name Good first name is Dr Feel
If youre uptown let me know how much time you got to kill
If youre in for a thrill and got a couple dollar bills
We will give your money back if your dreams are not fulfilled
Me and my ominous lads was on Lennox Ave
The threads we were wearin cost an arm and a leg dont laugh
Pulled up at the honky tonk in a cab
I said Baby dont worry Im payin the tab
When I dug in my pocket for the gusto
Dug in my pocket for the gusto
When I dug in my pocket for the gusto
I had big bills and nothing low I had
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
Yellow money yellow woman yellow taxi
Uh Yellow women yellow taxi
Check it out
Now around this point Bunny his best friend
His home girl she walks up right
She looks him up and down
Shakes her head and says
Boy youre actin funnier than Groucho and Harpo Marx
But youre a shark who comes with lots of cargo
Raisin hell up in Harlem blowin money like Chicago
Lookin for you a Lillian Gish or Greta Garbo
To come between us when youre darker than Uncle Remus
Actin like being green is the ultimate inconvenience
Like youre some kind of genius youre hoping to find you
An octoroon a quadroon a mulatto or mongrel
What does it take to remind you theres an ax held above you
And Max I hate to tell you but shell probably never love you
But heaven knows youre wildest desires Im not denying so go on
Try some candies and pluck you a dandelion
But yellow teeth for tarter yellow eyes is jaundice
Thats a fine performance but youre not an Adonis
Even if you find yourself an Aphrodite or Athena
Youll never see Nefertiti or the true queen of Sheba
With your yellow money
