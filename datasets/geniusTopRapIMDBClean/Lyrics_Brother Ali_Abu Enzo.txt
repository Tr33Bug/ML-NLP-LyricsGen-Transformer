Ay dont let the hat and shoes fool you sir
I grew up with this anarchy let me school you sir
Baboons are sure to move on you if you unsure
Truth is elusive you could loosen up to Lucifer
You dont survive where Ive been halfblind and my grin
Different environments without knowing the signs of violence
All that nonsense is not where Ive been tryin to go
But your boys just gotta know not to think that I the ho
If my eyes are closed and I start nodding slow
I aint blow no kind of dro
Im trying to get my drumsticks to rock and roll
Leafing through the cosmos read it like its Cosmo
Everything I see I know is deposited inside my soul
It pushed me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
Break the scale Im only playing the best notes
From distress to effervesce mode
MPC by Abu Enzo
Uh huh yeah
Twinkle in the ivories
You know what a twinkle in my eye could mean
And what defines my dreams
The second they describe the scene I bought it sight unseen
And provide the means for driving with the highest beams
Uh I revealed it in the silent stillness
Uh I dry my shield and then they fought me fearless
Uh I read about it til I finally feel it
Uh inside the secrets of my life experience
Uh them ones I thought were masters go and show they ass aroma
If I dont back up off you then Im after smashing on ya
Dont be sad because the magics over
Im still on the path and better than I had been if I hadnt known ya
As a teacher you mastered it all
Taught us how to climb and showed us how to fall
If you should drop a line and I dont grab the call
Ill catch you on the other side when youre standing tall
Yes yall
It pushed me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
So alive close the eyes and let the breath flow
Give and forgive or get and get forgetful
Sample of speech in Arabic 
Push me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
Human being is created in the best mold
