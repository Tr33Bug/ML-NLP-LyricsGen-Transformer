All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
God willing I can love you til theres nothing but you
Disappear inside you every time I clutch you
Tears shed in your presence render walls humble
They separate me from you until I become you
Let em fall to rubble let the darkness crumble
Let your light penetrate me til my heart is trustful
Im afflicted with my chest constricted
And your description is the best prescription
Crack the stone in my chest and let it beat again
Til every artery become a pharmacy
Let it deliver your love to every part of me
Until the splendor of your presence is all I see
My death wish is to decorate my every inch
With remembrance of your preciousness
Until theres no longer evidence I ever existed
Because until I knew your love I never did
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
These two eyes inside of my head have never seen clearly
A whole team of geniuses couldnt seem to cure me
A lot of the time I just resign and just close them completely
And relied on whats inside me to guide me sincerely
Let the heart navigate and pray that the path is straight
Lead me directly to your threshold standing at the gate
I breathed in a sweet breath that you had let go
And somewhere in the distance heard your echo
My soul began to tremble
You resemble every mercy Ive ever known
Overwhelmed me so that I began to let it flow
My lenses started welcoming the guests of tears
And suddenly the world revealed itself crystal clear
Colors grew vibrant and the decoration vivid
In that very instant I knew every thing was living
Then they released and made their way down my cheek
And here I am at the beginning starting to seek


All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
Its the only way I see you right
