At what point did poor European people that used to rebel
Against the ones that forced them to work land they didnt own and die with nothing of their own
What was it that turned their hearts so that theyd start to identify with power even though theyre powerless
Identify with wealth even though theyre broke
Its the invention of whiteness
They call you white by white standards
Damn what theyre talking bout you man first
Stand and curse the dirty hand that first crafted the plan
Spread it through the land and shattered the damn Earth
This is sickest system that ever existed
Since this Earths beginning commenced its twisted
How you convince man with red blood to bleed
Completely devalue what a human being means
Nobody called themselves white several centuries ago
They were living off the land with the trees
They were Dutch they were Irish they were German
They were Greek with culture families tradition and beliefs
And rich blood suckers saw new soil to seize
And they aint bout to get their hands dirty cracker please
Swindled you to trade in your identity
Showed you pie in the sky and promised you a piece
With symbolic image in the scripture that youre readin
White holy angels and black evil demons
You were so starving that you started to believe it
Now youll die colonizing for somebody elses greed
Dont you see the overseers are still in the field
Every breath a warden breathe is still in the jail
You will never own that farm or the prison for real
Terrified of the time when your victims rebel
Listen you dont fear them you fear the blood on your hand
All the ugly you done to that man
That woman that child that land
That sea that sky that theyd look you in the eye
And demand that you tell them why
All them years whipping and lying and killing
Generations of poison and bombing and drilling
All designed to turn the hearts of your children to stone
Got post traumatic slave master syndrome
How the hell are yall going to heal be made whole
You identifying with the people in control
You cant throw a human in the bottom of a boat
Unless somebody got a damn chain around your soul
In that middle passage asking who got stole
A hot auction block where your blood ran cold
Every day a cop let them shots explode
You gon have to find a way to regain your soul
I said the eye cant see itself
It cant sit back critique itself and peep itself
It need help
Take the sword for example
No matter how hard it cant carve its own handle
Said the eye cant see itself
It cant sit back critique itself and peep itself
It needs help
Take the sword for example
No matter how hard it cant carve its own handle
The inner city of our cities is like another country The rules are different Its almost like you need a passport there The police treat people differently When I lived out in the suburbs if my car broke down on the highway and a state trooper pulled up behind me I wouldnt have been scared Id have been glad But young man after young man after young man had been beaten by the police and the only way you know youve got to be with the people and we live separated We go in air conditioned cars and we stick on your interstates and hang out with people just like us Well by Gods grace I was brought into this and seeing how race plays a part and how poverty plays a part and my job is to go out to the American people
