Get yourself together now because its hit time
Youre known as the hit makers
Record breakers party makers
Theyll make your back crack your liver quiver
For all you cats who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut more glide in your stride
If you dont dig that you got a hole in your soul
If you dont dig this mess you came to the wrong address
We gon sing mighty loud and clear
Ayo the music made em jump back
Fuck that how yall gonna contrast somethin fat without lettin Ali touch that
Nothin whack leaves his lips youre not serious
I got few equals and no superiors  so here he is 
A seasoned veteran of ego reckin
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Yall aint fuckin with the ahk so quit your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening so you heed the lessons
So no
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it somebodys bound to catch it no breakage
Never that we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Slug or even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
Fuck that sucka jump back 
I hold the game like Notre Dame I know your dame
We call her hunch back  Ali run that
From cats lips to gods ears
We line yall punk bastards in crosshairs
Applying our thug tactics till yall scared
Dont stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs  ohh yeah 
Fuck that jump back yo whats that
Drippin off her nuts wait why she got a nut sack
You fuckin rappers are shemales
From the retail to the email defeat felt cause you need help
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Slug 
Rappers steppin to 
Ah yeah they get their shit spun
I throw a roll of quarters in cyphers and bet I hit one
Yo I dont care were you represent son wheres your chick from 
Well take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run
Listen I know your mission some type of magician that likes to go fishin
On the mic with air tight precision elitism keeping tradition
When you aint even keeping the rhythm the DJ is spinnin
Calm down little camper Ive got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesnt matter turn it up what the fuck you think that amps for
I right wrongs write rhymes write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead Ill just pay the waiter and go
But if I didnt have a wife yo your kidsd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs Ill go on without it
I wear my toilet paper so that yall can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it
Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles self taught
Communication mutilation holding pictures of your sister naked
Ha ha You too drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name as if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there
Brother Ali 
I make a room full of punk rocks stop and do wop
Wrestle shots from a cop and ask him whos your pops
Whos you daddy Fuck that Jump back and act happy
Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in your face 
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
Yall need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for yall its still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
