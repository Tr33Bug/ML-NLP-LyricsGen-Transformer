Hmmmmmmm 
Ha ha ha
Hey hey heeey
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha  another day  ha
Hey hey heeey ah  Lord I just gotta find a way 
Old master had a leper for a child
Left him out to fend for his self in the wild
They laughed at him anytime he went to town
So he kept to his self and he seldom came around
Loved life and he loved his kin
But he couldnt understand why they aint love him
Slept out in the shed all alone
And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own
The field hands saved him took him in and raised him
Taught him about love and struggle and patience
Gave him the family comfort he was cravin
He worked when they work and he sang when they sang
He sang so clear and so loud
That the masters of the children could hear him from the house
They recognized his voice and ran out
Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about yall
2X
Preach on Mr Preacher Man they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall speak loud boy thats the way
Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day
Ha ha  another day  ha
Hey hey heeey ah  Lord I just gotta find a way 
See good Lord Ive been waitin so long
For yall to come out here and take me in the home
The worlds so cold with no place to belong
They said come on in boy sing your song
He stepped inside and to his surprise
It was so damn fly he cant believe his eyes
Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied
Til he sat by the window and he glanced outside
Loved ones out workin
Eyes got full and his heart started hurtin
Cause them folk been singin for years
But aint any one of them set foot up in here
Hold up how you get so much
Livin off folk like us that got it so rough
The way you hold em in your cold clutch
Makes me think that you dont love your own soul enough


Preach on Mr Preacher Man they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall speak loud boy thats the way
Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day
Preach on Mr Preacher Man they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall speak loud boy thats the way
Them songs of yours give us a brand new day
Closed his eyes as he sang every note
The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote
Stood up cleared his throat grabbed his coat
In those last moments a few words were spoke
I used to peek at this old house in awe
Imaginin what it must be like and all
And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw
But I dont mind sayin I feel sorry for yall
All that gettin so little givin
Led a lot of yall to forget whats missin
Built you a big pretty prison to sit in
Strut around here convinced that thats livin
But we gonna keep on singin
Keep on solderin keep on buildin
Keep on teachin and keep on listenin
And keep keepin on til the whole things different
In the shed the sun start to set
Said all his prayers and laid down his head
Everything said that he needed to say
And one of these mornings well wake up to a brand new
