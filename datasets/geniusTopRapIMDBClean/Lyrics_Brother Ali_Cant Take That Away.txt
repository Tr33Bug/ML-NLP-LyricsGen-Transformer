I loved you fore I knew that you existed
It isnt really anybodys business
Not asking for permission or a witness
It honestly doesnt make any difference
Living in this insane mess
Theres only one person that can make me make sense
Ive got troubles and my own fears
But as long as youre alive Im not alone here
My mirror when Im right near you
Your guiding light shines to see my life clearer
Youre so woven inside my spirit
Even when youre not around I feel you
Lord knows they dont come no realer
My soul road dog my healer
The only reason I believe in me
Im trying to be what you seem to see
When the highs get low and the joys turn woes
Ill be close forever and a day
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
Right  When your world start falling I can read about it all in your face
You aint even gotta say
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
When you make your mistakes my heart is a place
Where youre safe I never would betray
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
And what you made mine is true
Lifetime full of treasures Ill never repay
They cant take that away
I love you and theres nothing you can do about it
I love you right through all your human problems
I mightve got excited at you and shouted
But you never let me down when it truly counted
Nothing could ever break the bond
Whatever page youre on
Celebrate or mourn babies born or parents gone
No matter how crazy the storm you wont face it alone
The best part of me is drawn to you
Me and anything I own belong to you
I treasure everything important to you
Any secret I ever had I show them to you
I owe you nothing but the whole truth
I wouldnt want to meet the me that doesnt know you
The only reason I believe in me
Im trying to be what you seem to see


When the highs get low and joys turn woes
Ill be close forever and a day
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
When your world start falling I can read about it all in your face
You aint even gotta say
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
When you make your mistakes my heart is a place
Where youre safe I never would betray
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
And what you made mine is a true  ah its love 
Lifetime full of treasures Ill never repay
They cant take that away they can t take that away
Oh my God now
These are wounds not scars
It will only be a scar when it stops bleeding stops hurting
You can forget about scars
But you cannot forget about wounds
Everyone meets the injured with sympathy or disgust
Do you need a tissue
No I need stitches
