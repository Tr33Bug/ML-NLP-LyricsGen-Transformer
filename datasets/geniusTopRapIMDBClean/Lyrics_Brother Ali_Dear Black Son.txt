Dear Black Son theres people youve never met
Who fear and hate you for something that you never did
And these people are so selfconvinced
Sometimes they pull the trigger call that selfdefense
And in that sad insanity
Their fear is realer to them than your humanity
But thats their problem its not yours
Listen to your pop for a second
These are the confessions of a father broken hearted
Who dont know how to pull his only son out of a target
They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started
You were a king long before them ships departed
You are not defined by anybody elses crimes
You dont need to answer for what happens in their minds
You are not confined by their imaginary lines
You dont need permission to exist with the divine
In fact you dont need permission from no one including me
You need not do anything but be just breathe
Whatever you dream let it mean youre free
Tears on your cheek never made nobody weak
Sometimes we got to grieve let it burn let it bleed
Then let yourself heal pray to God that it will
Youve got a spirit that a bullet cant kill
That doesnt make it any less real
They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Dear Black Son
Dear Black Son I cant protect you like I want to
I never judge you all I can do is love you
And thats all anyone can ever do is love you
All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you
They recognize divine in you
So they try to find themselves by defining you
Theyre living in a myth that they dont want to lose
And now theyre too terrified to face your kind of truth
But every single time you shine its proof that they mightve threw a chain around your body never conquered you
They dont always honor you but they love your culture
Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you
Its best to keep your hands where they can see them
And try to understand that youre not even what theyre peeping
They dont see a sweet kid that loves his little sister
Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures
In fact they dont visualize a kid
They see grown man imagery mythic masculinity
But you are not their fetishes or fears
Nor my ambition and tears nothing can interfere
Weve got to trust our seeds once we sow them
We hold them when theyre growing
But we never really own them
We love up on them play with em pray for them
And cling very closely to them moments


They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And her I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Dear black son
