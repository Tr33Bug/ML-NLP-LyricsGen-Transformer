Here we are in the apartment corridor
Dorian right yeah I been meaning to speak to you
I dont get up in my neighbours business normally right
But yo these thin ass walls got everything leakin through
Now first things first I dont judge you for the weed smoke
But I can hear your daughter yellin daddy please dont
And its not once or twice but every damn night
Man theres somethin goin on up in here that aint right
Now man to man I can understand
They like to stress a brotha out man we cuss each other out
But you crossin the line by puttin your hands on em
And nobody ever told you not to hit a damn woman
Boy I can tell that my presence was painful
Breathin truth down his neck it must have felt like a strangle
His eyes flashed confusion wavin his hands around
Hes used to raisin his voice on people to back em down
See this is specifically why I left the pistol in the linen closet
Pullin this shit if he was taller I woulda went and got it
Damnit man Im in the right and Im civilized
But little boys really aint used to bein criticized
First off scooter take the bass out your voice
Im respectful with mine and yo you makin a choice
Here and understand its only once that I warn you
Make a move make a threat Ill make it rain knuckles on you
I aint a woman or a baby dawg Im out of your league
My wife heard us gettin loud so shes prayin for peace
She stuck her head out on some keep your temper shit
Little man gon say Close the door mind your business bitch
Ha now thats sweet just what I needed it it seemed that
He invited my right fist for a party on his left cheek
I didnt mean to seem rude so I accepted
But arrived a half a second early right cross connected 
Oh staggered him just by taggin him
Mr tough guy one punch bring out the fag in him
Little man could make moves that I couldnt
He cut and tried to foot it now how should I put it
I stood at full posture and swatted him down the staircase
Bare knuckles to bare face all punches knew their place
Airport style the second one take off the next one land
Learn some respect young man
He glanced down for the brick on the ground
Fist still clenched up Im still stickin his crown
Hes in the jaws of the most turbulant blitz in the world
So fuck hittin ya girl tonight youre hittin the ground
I said somebody need to beat your ass
And then teach your ass and Im sorry I can only do half
And while his mellon swell up a police cruiser pull up
He hopped out all puffed up with the holster of his gun up
Ready to protect and serve
And its in his nature to 38 ya if youre testin his nerves
He helped the wifebeater stand up
But not before he helped Brother Ali into some handcuffs
And you can imagine my surprise
When his girl came down the stairs with tears in her eyes
And a phone in her hand holdin her man
Damn that was not the plan
