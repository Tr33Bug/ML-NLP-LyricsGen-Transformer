Its very important to me that whatever I have to say is worth saying
Truth teller truth yeller
Proof Evidence yes yes
Its very important to me that whatever I have to say is worth saying
Uhhuh
Full grown father of four still in search of father figures
Hard to feel at home here in the body that my trauma lives in
Selfhatred still my opposition
I chop a parcel out the wisdom Ive been given out atop the rhythm
Im not a victim or a liar and Im not afraid
Offer me a kingdom if its wrong Ill walk away
I know my talent versus fame isnt adding up
Folk that know me throwin shade said I aint wanted it bad enough
Seen so many change and get strange for the spotlight
If thats what you mean brother you couldnt be more right
Id rather feel shame than an atoms weight of arrogance
Mention deaths name prepared for it aint fearing it
Atheists describe the God that they dont believe in
See we aint even at odds cause I dont feel that neither
I know we come from a source thats much realer
A cause that all the sleepers keep concealing seekers overcome the amnesia
Feel the heartbreak bleeding all through my songs
My Atmosphere brothers brought me along
I carry on for the love of love and for the hope of hope
I feel it from above and hold the moment close
Soak up the rawness floating all through my songs
The Al Tawam twins kept me strong I soldier on
For the love of love and for the hope of hope
I catch a sudden buzz an overdose
I got a knock up on my door it was the FBI
Cant come inside without a warrant but Ill talk here on the steps awhile
They want to question my travelin whats the harassment
Power obsessed authoritarians to test what Im channelin
He said his mission keep the innocent from dying
Had to laugh a little bit to keep from crying
I sigh as if we dont know about the COINTELPRO
And devilish drones that rain hell into homes
Never an empire rose without blood on its hands and face
They hate the poets for exposing to channel the rage
Sacred space whether Im in Iran or Lebanon
Or the southside of Chicago or Sudan
The power in the song is the truth not the performer
My question for you is wheres the honor
In bothering a father in his home in pajamas on his birthday
In front of all his daughters next time call the lawyer
Im part of this resistance blistering through my song
The great Chuck D kept me strong
Sound the alarm for the love of love and the hope of hope
This is what justice does put you in their scope
My steadfastness blastin this dope ass song
Cornel West never led me wrong
I soldier on for the love of love and for the hope of hope
For every one of us that hold the rope that wont be broke nope
Truth yeller truth yeller
Bring it back though let me finish
Im from a long line of writers and teachers
And spend all of my time with guides and seekers
And criminals and preachers
Sifting through the secrets just to kick em through your speakers
These tears just flowing my whole life long
Look in the mirror still see my mom
Im writing songs for the love of love and for the hope of hope
This is from dusk to dusk and pray they hold me close ghost
Truth teller truth yeller
Proof Evidence yes yes
Manifest in the flesh to be the best of the best
Uh true living proof giving
