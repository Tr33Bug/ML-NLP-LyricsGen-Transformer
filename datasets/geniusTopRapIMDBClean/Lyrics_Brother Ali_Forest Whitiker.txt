And yo whatever comes up comes out
We dont put our hands over our mouth
And whatever comes up comes out
We dont put our hands over our mouth
Whatever comes up comes out
Please mister bassman lay it on me 
Ayo depending on the day and depending on what I ate
Im anywhere from twenty to thirtyfive pounds overweight
I got red eyes and one of ems lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines so I look crazy
Im albino man I know Im pink and pale
And Im hairy as hell everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that aint quite shaped right
Face type shiny I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like and what I wear to work
Im knockkneed and got a neck full of razor bumps
Im not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think Im depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror I see sexy ass me
And if thats somethin that you cant respect then thats peace
My lifes better without you actually
To everyone out there whos a little different
I say damn a magazine these is Gods fingerprints
You can call me ugly but cant take nothing from me
I am what I am doctor you aint gotta love me
If you would please turn in your bible
To beauty tips according to Forest Whitiker
In the third chapter of the third line
Brother Ali would you please read to the choir for me son
Imma be all right you aint gotta be my friend tonight
You aint gotta love me 
An Imma be okay you would probably bore me anyway
You aint gotta love me 
Imma be all right you aint gotta be my friend tonight
You aint gotta love me 
An Imma be okay you would probably bore me anyway
You aint gotta love me 
Imma be all right you aint gotta be my friend tonight
You aint gotta love me 
An Imma be okay you would probably bore me anyway
You aint gotta love me 
Its Forest Whitiker yall

You must be crazy

You must be crazy
