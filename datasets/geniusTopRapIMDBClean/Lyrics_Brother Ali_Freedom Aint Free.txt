Aint nowhere to run to
There aint nothing here for free
If I dont like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Quran until he breathed
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Aint asked nobody for a mother fuckin hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger aint never look back
What he know about how the world spin
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he trying to replace it
Youll find in him a heart thats second to none
But I know also that his lessons aint done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done
Aint no where to run to
There aint nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom aint free lord
Aint no where to run to
There aint nothing here for free
Youll see what I see and know that freedom aint free
One half of all the two leggeds on the scene
Are too timid to dream cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take whats given
Thats your decison I just dont consider that living
If Im to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
Im hot knife through butter in the nights sky
It shouldnt take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cos this cold world couldnt give a fuck if Im fed
I aint curled up in my bed
If I dont set the world ablaze trust it aint cos of nothing I did
Listen I dont think Gods obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til the end Im a one man army friend
