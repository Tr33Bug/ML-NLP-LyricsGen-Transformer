Ant check this out
Im the luckiest son of a bitch that ever lived I spend life doin shit I love
Got the worlds most beautiful kids and dont nobody do it like us
Sunday morning play Al Green make pancakes and watch cartoons
Sometimes get to change that scene catch a plane and see somewhere new
Plus got married last year treated so good that it aint even fair
Already got a boy now the baby girls here bought us a house like the Berenstain Bears
Not two years ago I was homeless I mean crashin on the couch of my homies
Now Im crashin on the couch with Conan signed a mortgage and bought my home shit
Should of seen when they handed me the keys I still couldnt believe that it was mine
Like baby hurry up lets leave before these damn people change their mind
Ha and shit what can I say I would have made these damn songs anyway
Some of yall still listen to em everyday beautiful thing I bow my hand and pray
2X  w ad libs
I love the life I live my laughter and my tears
I dont know where its goin but I like it like it is
Uh I get a lot of love in my hometown twin cities yall know how it go down
Same club where Prince shot Purple Rain advertise my name and its sold out
Im surrounded by greatness my loved ones are amazin
Sometimes I look in their faces and just think of the lives theyre changin
And I dont just mean Rhymesayers my sons grandmother quit freebasin
Desiree got eight years straight now that right there cause for celebration
Ah Im so happy for her we used to fight like cats and dogs
But she aint even mad that I left her daughter
She calls me her son so thats my mama
w ad libs
Ah keep it goin now
All my life I had this music my heroes have all saluted
I dont need yall to like my new shit them dudes are the reason I do this
I done did so much cool shit lived a lifetime in the last two years
Got the memories to prove it look what a dude who aint even graduate high school did
Ha used to always be the new kid laughed at cause I never used to pull chicks
Now I turn down more girls than them rich ass pretty football playin fools get
Sometimes I smile so wide I think about the dreams that Ive lived
Shit even if I died tonight yall Im the luckiest son bitch that ever lived
w ad libs until the end
