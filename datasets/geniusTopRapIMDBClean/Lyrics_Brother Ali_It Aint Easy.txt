I did it again huh Yeah I know
Im writing you a song though
It goes something like this
You said one love you cant unlove
I dont know what it is youre trying to run from
Like you just you tryna unfriend me in real life
I want it all real nothing fake please
I dont want to wonder what your handshake means
I dont need to say everything I think I must
My egos trying to ruin everything I touch
What I mean though or what my point is
That youre much more important than my point is
If I win an argument and lose your heart Lord
Hit the bullseye on the wrong dart board
Want to thank everyone for being patient with me
Its a journey that Im on I pray you take it with me
And to quote myself thats what this is about
We live learn and figure it out
Oh my God now
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it
I want the real love not the false kind
Not the one that need perfectness at all times
When it seems most difficult to keep me close
Is probably the time that I need you most
I let you down though I didnt mean to
Even the people who try we get weak too
And when you said we were family I believed you
Because I needed so bad for it to be true
Now is my heart that way Would I try to betray
Is there any such thing as an honest mistake
If what you need and what I have dont match
Thats when we need the love thing to fill those gaps up
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it


You tryna save the world right 
Yo Im a hot mess and if Im honest
Its not just one event but a process
If Im tryna get out here and protest
Let me first save the world from my foolishness
Let me guard my heart from its harshness
Try to rid my truth of its falseness
If your beauty is closer than an arms length
Youd be hard pressed to tell me that its far fetched
I know I hurt you though you took it personal
But whats love if the essence isnt merciful
And I see no need for us to live with regrets
Id rather just forgive and forget
Oh my God now
It aint easy when its real
Just dont leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It aint easy when its real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it
I was thinking maybe not debate politics in the pool
Nah just because its your daughters birthday party I just You  know
No I feel you
Yeah word up email me about that
You said one love cant unlove
I dont know what you think youre tryna run from
You said one love cant unlove tryna run from
Said one love love love
Said one love love love
Said one love love love
