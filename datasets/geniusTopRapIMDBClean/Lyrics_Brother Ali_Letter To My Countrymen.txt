Sooner or later
I used to think I hated this place
Couldnt wait to tell the president straight to his face
But lately I changed nowadays I embrace it all
Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws
Got to care enough to give a testament
Bout the deeply depressing mess were in
Its home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living color
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Whos ever above us wont just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
Were up against an ugly trend
Everybodys hustling dont nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands and
Instead they give you a handheld
And make you shoulder lifes burden by your damn self
One thing that cant be debated
Power never changed on its own you got to make it
Thats why community is so sacred
Thats the symbol that we make when we raise fists
Chorus Sooner or later
We dont really like to talk about the race thing
The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing
Pat ourselves on the back in February
Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King
But the real pictures much more embarrassing
Were still not even close to really sharing things
The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American
I think the struggle to be free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantage is given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
Thats the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think Im entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world wont be saved by the passive type
This is a letter to my countrymen
Not from a Democrat or a Republican
But one among ya
Thats why you call me Brother
Aint scared to tell you were in trouble cause I love you

ChorusSooner or later
They tell me Im a dreamer they ridicule
They feel defeated old bitter and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So
I wrote a letter to my countrymen
Ill be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live ALI your brother
Mourning in America dreaming in color
My dear Brother AliI think you know deep down in your soul that something something just aint rightYou dont want to be just well adjusted to injustice and well adapted to indifference You want to be a person with integrity who leaves a mark on the worldPeople can say when you go that you left the world just a little better than you found it I understand I want to be like that too
