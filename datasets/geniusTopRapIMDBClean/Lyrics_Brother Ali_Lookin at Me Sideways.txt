Now baby you gon get a crook in your neck looking at me sideways
I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
Must be something on my face
Yelling out that youre not telling what they spelling on MySpace dot com
Bold type face rhetoric
You gon clickety click and get your head split
What the hell you look like on a message board
Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
I aint got to prove to any of you
That anything I ever said was is the truth but Im ready to do it
And do it leisurely Ant give 10 beats a week
So fuck it Ill put the record how it needs to be
I understand I aint perfect alright
I been a thugged out nerd all my life
Thank God I aint got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
I feed people with the verses I write
And I fill them with my personal strife
Had some of yall concerned for my life
For what Ive had the nerve to recite
I cut my grass low bring the surface to light
Now baby you aint never heard me Im tight
And Im surgical like with this bitch
Jake you know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and Im old fashioned
Trying to figure how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
Its just so tragic
But it aint impossible to solve
I aint learned jack shit from Dorian at all
Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
Ill come across the hall and get involved like this here
Im just here to play my part and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I aint way out yall you just dont get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog it aint my fault
And they love the way I talk
Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
I aint way out yall you just dont get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog it aint my fault
Tabernacle my hand expand to the size of a big black granite statue
Devide it by the lightning speed that they can move
It aint an autograph do that math Imma smack you
I like to pull up my pants and lean back too
Organic vegetables mix em with fast food
Im Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn
How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too
I take it back for you when possible
If your hear this then Im confiding in you
Pop call me Ali whats bothering you
Dont you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool
NOYou got more exs than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
But that aint my problem with you
Truth is youre just an impossible dude
You get hostile with fools when theyre honest with you
I could make me a snide little comment or two
But I dont see what that nonsense would prove
I dont give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
I just do what the Quran says to do and respect him
Now I aint even here to get clandestine
But best believe Imma get whats destined
Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
Its better than this bus best friend believe that
I aint got a free minute to lean back
SpiderMan 2 coming out and Faheem need that
Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad
Shining bike smiling like look at me dad
Thats the shit that Im in to I defend to the death
That Im every bit as gangster as them fools
If I wasnt G I wouldnt flow like this
If you were really a G you wouldnt know I exist you bitch
I dont understand what theyre sayin
But little did they know they could get a smack for that man 
So Id advise you to shut the fuck up
Silly muhfucka

I said clap your hand to the beat yall
Cause the beat make you clap your hands
I said clap your hand to the beat yall
Cause the beat make you clap your hands
