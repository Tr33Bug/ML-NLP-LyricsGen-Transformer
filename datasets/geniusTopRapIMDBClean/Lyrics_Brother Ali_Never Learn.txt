I dont know where to turn
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
I dont know where to turn  Where to turn 
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn  Never learn 
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
My goodness good morning 
Youre still an apprentice
Every generation of MC  with me so Im ill by consensus
You see what I speak
You touch it and feel it all six of your senses
My mission is endless Ive been in this tent and Im still as relentless
Now build you a fence if youre feelin defensive
My power comes from the most high
Lord God of the globe sky
Soul vibration is so fly I can walk on water no lie
Champion author
Small fry rock of Gibraltar Northside
Serving this culture
Might I confide that Im here to assault ya
I got some money in the bank that I did not have when I start
Got a little money up in my hand I do not have money in my heart
Im standing on champion greatness
I cannot claim it cause thats the creator
I stand up and state it
Thats not braggin its prayin
Thats what Im sayin
I dont know where to turn
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
I dont know where to turn  Where to turn 
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn  Never learn 
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
Ya Hafidh ya Wadud 


I was standin onstage when my hero died
Feel the heartbeat of my peoples cry
Nation nineteen thirtythree bow ties
Light of the Dn gleaming in your eyes
Even when the tears flow down both sides you know why I sacrificed your whole life
You can go ahead let your soul fly cause the whole tribe bloodline flow through mine
Listen we love to fight cause we fight for love
The poor righteous sons where the diamonds from
Libraries are transcribin us and our ancestors are more alive than us
Put down everything youre tryna clutch your undying lust to see the climate just
Baby we ride til our time is up
Thats just the divine in us
I dont know where to turn
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
I dont know where to turn  Where to turn 
I hit my head I guess Ill never learn  Never learn 
But they tell me I should let it bleed let it sting let it burn
Get my head firm
My goodness good morning 
I dont know where
Let it bleed
Get my head firm
Hit my head I guess Ill never learn
Get my head firm
