Okay so it might appear
To an outsider that you found your way up out of here
Theyre saying you died of suicide
Thats the last thing I want to hear
They tell me that its hardly fair to blame myself
What a hell of a cross to bare
You didnt say it in your letter
But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear
Found out the amount of fear
You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror
And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare
I left you playing solitaire and I promise you that Im sincere
If youre looking for some judgment you wont find it here
Lets be honest here
I cant say Ive never known that kind of despair
When the clouds appear hows life fair
I just want to draw you near
Not to make it about me but how could you check out
Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear
I think I wouldve listened
Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it
You sang your swan song we all dismissed it
Because you filled the room with laughter
I watched when you thought no one was looking at you
In hind sight I wonder where your smile went
When the party ended and you swallowed it
I saw you swallow it
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer
Ive had car accidents
Where everything is slow motion no matter how fast its happening
Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling
But cant always react to it
Your whole life might flash before your eyes
The minute when you transition to the other side
But what can actually happen in that time
Inbetween the leaping and the moment you collide
Inbetween the trigger and the blast
Inbetween you let go of the wheel and you crash
Inbetween the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle
Turn out the lights roll the dice on tomorrow
Is there a moment to reflect can there be regret
Is there a wait not yet let me reset
Or is it just too painful to accept
That maybe death just seemed best


Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
If you not winning you can go down swinging
Even if it doesnt feel like theyre fighting fair
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
Im trying not to resent you
But you left me defenseless in the life we share
Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands
How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan
When nobody who grows old stands a chance
What about this mysterious dance
Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance
But these are questions I can only ask
The person looking back in the looking glass
