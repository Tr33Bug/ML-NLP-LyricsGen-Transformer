Own Light  What Hearts Are For  LyricsYoure not using your heart for
What hearts are for
Theyve been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
Thank God for listening listen
Youve been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
I thank God Im living
Sometime I feel like a stranger maybe I aint from here
World going crazy how could that be unclear
Know that Im a soldier hearts are my battleground
Sword in the holster had to come back around
I aint trying to hide away I just had to meditate
I aint got a lot to say but the ancestors may
Speaking to the whole globe numbers dont occur to me
You can listen solo cause youre the whole world to me
I jump in with both feet nothing low key
You can find me where Im sposed be where my folks be
If you listen very closely you know who chose me
Nothing that I own owns me and so Im so free
I remember being hungry needing groceries
Nighttime getting no sleep til my nose bleed
Got a message to the police
Youre not using your heart for what hearts are for
Theyve been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
Thank God for listening listen
Youve been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
I thank God Im living


Not for one second I believe what youre telling me
I know you invented disease and sell the remedy
Universe is sending me centuries of memories
So the very breath that I breathe is all I ever need
I got that Muhammad Ali up in my pedigree
Yes I be speaking my peace up in my seventies
Aint worry bout ya threatening me Im just being honest
I aint buying fear just because its all you got left
We just want to make love til we wake up
I believe whoever made us envisioned greatness
And you know they want to paint us with the same brush
Wanna interchain us til we fill our grave up
Alright okay but when its all said and its all done
And I look back at the trophies I won
I will only count one
Im using my heart for what hearts are for
Theyve been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
Thank God for listening listen
Youve been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
I thank God Im living
And I know who I am
I know whose I am
On your wings I fly
And in your shoes I stand
Im animated by love I dont move by chance
Any stage I touch or any place I stand
There yall land living in the world as it is
Cracked vessel I am no more and no less than a man
Any posessions that I have are just in my hand
Im balancing the best that I can
Im not making no claims but
Im using my heart for what hearts are for
All the beauty in this whole life  uh 
I thank God for healing
And You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
I thank God for listening listen
Youve been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You aint got to get me lit I got my own light
I thank God Im living
Just reflecting all the beauty in this whole life
