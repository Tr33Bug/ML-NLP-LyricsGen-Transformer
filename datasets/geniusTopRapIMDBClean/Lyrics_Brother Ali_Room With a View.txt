One side of the street is Malones Funeral Home and the
Other side the library try very hard to picture this shit
Walk through where I live at
Where parents are embarassed to tell you they raise they kids at
Youll need some half and half of an 8ball you can get that
Fuck with Little Rodney and youll get all of your ribs cracked
In a location where slanging crack rock is not seen as a fuckin recreation but a vocation
And the sellers and smokers are both pacing
Got one eye on Minneapolis PT they both racin
3 for 50 is the supply and demand and the
Twin Cities American heartland and they
Been busy masterminds tearing apart plans
And hoop dreamers ballin with blisters on they hands
With chains danglin from the rims
Pain strangles em from within
Till the belt around the arm makes the veins stand at attention
I try to block it out with a bed sheet the moonlights as a curtain
Cause Im not comforted by red and blue lights when Im hurtin
Mommy loves you yeah I knew but I wasnt certain
Cause the lenses through which she views life wasnt workin
As a boy she told me wait til your father to come home
Im 24 still waitin for my father to come home
And some parents only touch they children when a whips brought
Thats why bad kids do bad shit just so they could get caught
And get touched this growing up shits rough
Thats a big part of why were so mixed up
Shit we dont have Bar Mitzvahs
We become men the first time our father hits us
And we dont open gifts up
Sister Regina from across the street is beautiful
But for 50 bucks aint nothing she wont do to you
Used to be premium pussy now she used up
For that same 50 bucks she got to do some new stuff
Whatever it takes for you to pull the dollars out
If you dont intervene then theres a day shell turn her daughter out
Speaking of kids Im fixing lunch for my first born
I had the windows wide open cause the weathers warm
Thats when the greatest hits of Donnie Hathaway
Got interrupted by a driveby shooting half a block away
Faheem was in the window he didnt get hit though
All praise to Allah
3x 
I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on its own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell
I paint a picture of the spot well
