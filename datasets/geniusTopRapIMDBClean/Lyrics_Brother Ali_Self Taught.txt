Im home
Uh yeah
They always ask me 
Ali what you so angry for man Why you always so upset 
I tell em  Shit theres a thin line between anger and hunger my man
And I ride a unicycle down the middle you might catch me touchin feet down on both sides 
Ever since day number one its just me and where Im coming from
Rites of Passage and Shadows on the Sun
My people I stand before you As a man with more true shit
Than he knows what to do with
I give it all to you long as you can promise me this
When its time you will ball up a fist  like this 
Me and Anthony we fill all the gaps in
And are proud of what we make regardless what happens
Fuck rappin I sing off key
One thing you should never do is dis Ali
Cause motherfucker there aint nothin rougher
Then tryin to climb from the rug you get swept under
I can run through every one of your blunders
Mistake number one is that your crew dont love ya
Ill take a bullet for the core of the Sayers
When me and my dogs out tourin the nation
I spit with an intensity you have to witness
Look close my blood on the back of the tickets
Its that religious its what I teach my son
How to read the Quran and how a party is won
We like  Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We selftaught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We selftaught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
When line meets mine we bend ya girls spine
Figureeight status she got back for days
The same old magic will not crack the maze
The lights changed since we anted up pot has been raised
And Im fucking with the hand I was dealt
Live twentyfive years to experience what Lazarus felt
If you drop three crumbs Ill eat one
Feed one to the family restll get invested in my freedom
I battle through carton of shit
With a wrist full of broken tooth picks tryin to carve out a niche
You can either choose the heart or the fist but you will connect with me
If your path ever intersect with me
The fire in the eye could never be held back  its the same 
Pressure that made the liberty bell crack  its the same 
Pressure that made my brother E sell crack  in the name 
Quran holy Rest in Peace
My back is bein watched by the only one on high
We stride in the party hoods up crossed eyes
Broke as what but dont give a fuck
Cause I feel I got the world by the nuts Uhh


We like Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Homeboy understand I aint mad at you
Theres just very few things in life I know how to do
And this is one of them right here
And whatever comes up comes out
We dont put our hands on our mouths I stand for what Im about
Unknown but Im still a soldier
Cant let em go home till I win em over
My youth was training its very clear
Every year new city new rules to play with  true shit 
New kid in school didnt rule nothin
To this day I rap like Im trying to prove something
Little bit aggressive when I spit a sentence
Till you get the message
You couldnt pay me to quit professin
Rock sixtyone sold out shows came home and caught a bus to the
Sixtysecond
Shirt sweated full of work ethic
Been in love with the shit since I first met it
Rhymesayers is the first to come last to leave
Aint no tricks up our sleeve this is what we believe
We like  Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor dont get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught its as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
