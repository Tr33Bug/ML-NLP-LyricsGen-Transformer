To the beat yall
Check this out 
This announcement Im about to make is very important 
Yes
Now listen 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit 
To the beat yall
Sensitive about my shit 
Cant believe Im still doing this
I thought my political views might ruin this
I figured you mightve moved on to these newer kids
My extra extended hiatuses
Who wouldve thought you woulda let me get away with this
I mean no ones waiting to see what an aging hater thinks
I kinda wanted to be finished
I didnt wanna pull my heart out let you see in it
I just wanna grow privately be free a minute
Plus my soul dont always have peace within it
I tell the truth but I can see that Im conceited with it
I make a whole lot of mistakes please dont be offended
I used to have this recurring nightmare
Im on stage with the whole city inside here
I start choking and my lungs wont provide air
Then I dropped an album they reacted to it
Started selling out First Avenue
Now all the bad dreams I have are that you no longer care for dude
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist

Sensitive about my shit 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit  Say that then
Sensitive about my shit 
I love rappers with the big voices
They put the power in their lyrics so you live for it
And spit it boisterous the ignorant cant ignore it
I put the preachers style in my delivery
And I remember vividly somebody tweeted Chuck D
And asked him who the best voices are and he mentioned me
I did seven shows a week for like five years
And used to scream on that mic to make it sound clearer
Now Im staring down my most profound fear
Started catching up with my vocal cords
Im not so sure that I should perform no more
Back of my mind wonder what youre applauding for
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit  Feel like the wrestler
Sensitive about my shit 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist  Yes maam
And Im sensitive about my shit 
Sensitive about my shit 
Huh flying to New York to do some press
I just imagine that these people wont be too impressed
The loot he getting all at once is how they view success
But then the writers like Brother Ali sir
Ive been so excited just for writing this feature
He asking all these dope questions and did his research
And then I meet the editor and staff
And everybody got their cell phone camera to flash
And a story about how my music helped em in the past
I gotta ask yall an honest question
I mean Im beyond honored by this warm reception
But since you got respect and an obvious connection
And every time you bless us with the tiniest little speck
Of an online mention our fans all shower you with affection
And just blow up your comment section
Well what the hell I mean I aint complaining
But how come you dont place us in the hiphop conversation
They just look back with blank faces
Sample 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit  That joint got awkward fast
Sensitive about my shit 
Keep in my mind that Im an artist 
And Im sensitive about my shit 
Sensitive about my shit
