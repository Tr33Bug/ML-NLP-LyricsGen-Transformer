 Wed like to capture your minds right now 
What you say 
Take you a little bit higher 
What you say   3X 
I like the snares loud enough to make your eyes blink from it
Only male with the Holy Grail drink from it
I keep an eye on heaven and a ear to the street
And spread a thick layer of blood sweat and tears on the beats
My brain rest upon the hiphop lexicon
That I acquired in the decade of work that people slept upon
I dont rap I recite the prayers of the inner soul
Of the slave ships human cargo
Seemingly meaningless rappers flood the market
With shit that make me pace in my room until I rip the carpet
Im fit to start up this next millennium
Swingin the grappling hook at cackling crooks to finish em
The city dweller sendin telegrams from Neverland
The better man kind now kindly join the caravan
Were like a rock band that pack contraband
And wont hesitate to stomp a man into the rocks and sand
Brother Ali and if you havent heard about me
Im flyin just beneath your radar so yall can doubt me
Stay on the sonar with crowbars to open minds
Theres a ladder youre supposed to climb
Approach a Rhymesayer with a Buggsy Siegel sized ego
You gon get yourself snatched out the sky you know the steelo
By now where what why and how
We start the revolution real time right now
Yes leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall cast shadows on the sun
Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall my inner light shall
I rhyme for cats up in the harbor lights
Prayin they dont starve tonight
And stay positive in the face of a harder life
My chorus light the torch for those on whom the sun set
Verses meant to speak for the voiceless
So let us never be dismayed or afraid
The ground were walkin on is stained
With the blood of those before us who came
Soldiers in this freedom movement are too numerous to name
Cause the human soul yearns to be free its all the same
I rhyme for runaways prayin that they see another day
You gotta make it through the winter to feel some summer days
Its for my natives its history in the way their hair is braided
Elephants never forget thats how they say it
Tell my man  in prison keep grinnin because hes innocent
And tell him that the tests we get are heavensent
Listen I rap for the ones that Johnny Cash wore the black for
Black and white women that were turned to crackhores
And I empty everything in the bank to give for it
I empty all the days of my life to live for it
And I empty all the blood in my veins to fight for it
So I empty all the ink in this pen to write for it


Yes leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall cast shadows on the sun
Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall my inner light shall
I glance in the sky and see the same cloud configuration
That Nat Turner saw the day they hanged him
Resisted in the face of adversity with a fist and it was raised
One finger extended meaning Allah be praised
Spent days in Heavens embassy
On Quran pages Allah explains this legacy
Angels doubted Adam Jacobs brothers clapped him
And ancient Pharaohs were too brutal to fathom
If all the earths oceans were ink and the trees were pens
You could never write the knowledge of God it never ends
And I know it feels like the whip wounds will never mend
But its the way of makin the oppressed prevalent men
We standin with humanity at destinys door
Chanting the war cry it goes Never no more
So if yall tryina talk about the horrors you see
Feel free to tell your stories through me
Yes leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall cast shadows on the sun
Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall my inner light shall
Theres only one God and hes not just above
Theres only one man and theres only one love
Till everybody gets what I instill in my seed
For that yall we willin to bleed
Theres only one God and hes not just above
Theres only one woman and theres only one love
We doin this till all of Adams children are freed
And for that yall we willin to bleed
