Dont pay me no mind baby
Shine shine shine
Dont pay me no mind sugar
Shine shine shine
I had seen you when the hosted seated you
In a station of mine still Im taking my time
Made sure the moment got seized made up my mind
Through a napkin over my sleeve straightened my tie
Mind if I behold you through the fold of your menu
Couture all up against you oh lord
How could I convince you I just met you
And Im instantly listening to your instrumental
Poor me I poured water inside your glass
For a brief moment our eyes had kind of met
I confess I felt that inside my chest
Almost made quite a mess yet I digress
I would guess youre meeting a date here
I offer she order hors doeuvres while she wait here
She brushed her bangs to clear off her face yeah
Parted her lips and turned crab cakes to Shakespeare
The way the lady bait a trap Im afraid to ask
My imagination act I run away with that
Run away with me I swear Im not a maniac
Ill give you that pretty diamond ring and last name to match
I aint saying that I practiced waiting in the back
I know I better make it fast before her date get back
Yeah I place her order grabbed the plate relaxed
Here let me fix my face get my game in tact
Fear I chased the clock as I cant make it stop
I played the waiter job made it to the table top
Time to play your cards ace got to take your shot
Before I could speak he showed up to devastate the plot
Her real server showed up my plan fell through
Sir are yall together Maam can I help you
She looking puzzled I stand without words
Im sorry I dont really work here  awkward
Let me explain you see I aint much for wait and see
So when I seen you take a seat I played maitre d
She replied angrily Mister I cant believe
Youd stand your grown ass in this place and play games with me
Crazy freak wait how did you get all that food
I ordered from the table around the corner and brought it to you
Cant say I thought it through maam its all sort of new
But when I saw you I sort of knew I had to talk to you
And nothing in my arsenal seemed possible
So I called an audible Serve you Im honoured to
I didnt mean to bother you I just want to watch a few
Moments of your life much like a fly on a wall would do
Never mind me the light from your unusually bright shine blinded me
So that was all I could see I understand if you dont want to talk to me
Ill just leave pardon me Ill just take this little broken heart and leave
Wait that was a stupid thing to do
But my date didnt show up and my tables set for two
I pulled on my coat like aw look at you
Thats all I really wanted maam enjoy your afternoon
Im through
