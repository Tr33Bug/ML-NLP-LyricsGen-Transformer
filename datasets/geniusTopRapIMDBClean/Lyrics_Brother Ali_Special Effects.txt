I dont want to see you in a screen
I want to feel you in the flesh and on the scene
I love all the words and what it mean
But its so much to say in the spaces in between
I dont want to watch dots disappear
Listen here first reaction is crystal clear
I want the uncut sentiment
Before you had a chance to second guess and edit it
I love you for the first draft you
All the technology on Earth cant improve
No special effects and no Santa Claus
Uncut acoustic and analog
A lifetime measured in breaths
The face is a mirror that the heart reflects
And when the eyes meet they directly connect
And thats what you call true special effects
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again
I dont want to watch your life in pictures
Im trying to be right there with ya
Well be so rich at the end of all of this
We can scroll through memories without any filter
Im trying to share life as it comes
No timeline from the night to the sun
Crme de la crme and the crust and the crumbs
Type of love you cant type with your thumbs
Let me not hear your voice in a speaker
Im tryna feel your breath when it leaves ya
Message received you best to believe
Your real life friend is requesting to see you
Im here to watch your story unfold
I dont really want to only be told
Everything I hold is pressed to my chest
Thats what you call special effects  yes 
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face again
Into me you see I see
Inherent in here I hear
I give fidelity free
See my peers appear my dear
Into me you see I see
Inherent in here I hear my dear
Just to see your face again just to see your face 
Groove to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words what
In other words huh
Move to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words what
In other words huh
