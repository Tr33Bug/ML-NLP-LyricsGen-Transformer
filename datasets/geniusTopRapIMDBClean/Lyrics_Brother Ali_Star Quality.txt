Yo its the Ahk in the flesh of course Im fresh
Yes Im livin for the funk like I was Lord Finesse
Last night I screamed till I lost my voice I guess
Had a few things left to get up off of my chest
Like Im facing the fact that Im not what my mom wanted
Only gold plaque that I got had the Quran on it
I flipped your eviction notice over wrote a song on it
Like to hear it here it go light your spirit clear your soul
If I wouldve known that tonight was Ladies Night
I wouldve stopped and swabbed my balls with the baby wipe
In the van Hold your sorry little life in my hand
Watch me toss it in the sky and swing right for the stands
Battling me is like trying to ride your bike in the sand
Imma eat one more helping then Im wiping my hands
And you frustrated rappers must hate the fact
That I walk in First Ave have so much ladies gaspin for breath
Tryin to catch me with the ass and the chest
I aint tryin to be rude lady Im just passin a test
Got enough hastle and stress with one woman cashing my checks
Ill take the compliment and pass on the sex

Brother Brother Brother how ya making em get down
Come straight to your town vibrating the ground
Keep the people out there scared of making a sound
Thats our policy we step out there on Star Quality

You aint hardcore you soft more than Shemar Moore
In a tight shirt sayin Lets slow this train down yall
You stink hoes spills a whole lot of nothing
Got the nerve to look Ahk in the eye you got it coming
While your woman nod her face to the beat you tasting defeat
Whiping the waste from my cleets between the space in your teeth
Irrigate your facial features all hung down
That little dumb frown is perfect for salt water to run down
Talk harder to some clowns cause they need it rough
Make sure they never sleeping deep enough to dream of beating me what
My styles a little belligerent isnt it
Considerin that Im belittling them with little more then
My pad and my pen and my sentiments
Weither its your chorus scratching or wack track blasting
Your whole approach to rapping is ass crack backwards
Catsll see me in the spot and act salty
Stressing you save hip hop you cant even save a wack party

Brother Ali is two hundred fifty pounds of Piss and Vinegar
Few try to sit me down they missing limbs and
I got nothing on but a lifestyle black tuxedo
An Arethra Franklin record and Im rockin Captain Ego like
Dun Dadda shit get done proper
Theres only three reasons Ali would need a Ramada
One to move the bowels two to steal the towels
Three Shave shower pray for my spiritual power
I can handle this if my man Ant would just
Give me a chance to splatter some antics across his canvisses
Damage is unavoidable at this point
I twist joints till they pop lock too loud and get ya knot rocked  
Im too proud to let you hop scotch through
The section of the Earth that I occupy without making you testify
Best that I could do for you is ignore you
Cause Id probably conquer you if I explore you
Words from the Brother
