Another one of them long ass breaks Damn Brother Ali where the hell you been What you disappear
Stop the presses give me couple seconds
Let me tell my friends whats up with big brethren
New year new beard a new record
Made a few adjustments I want to discuss it
In a life of pain and sadness
Never wouldve guessed that a taste of success
Wouldve been the first time I ever got depressed
I know Im blessed I just couldnt adjust
In life all I ever knew how to do is fight
Scrapped on the playground fighting for the mic
Trying to build a life with an insane wife
Fighting for a little bit of time in the light
Then I got a daughter a car and house
No one left to fight with but myself
Gained a lot of weight wasnt thinking about my health
Maybe the music Im making could help
I cant drive cause this albino shit
Told you I was legally blind thats legit
I aint want Ant to have to come scoop the kid
So I bought a crib a couple blocks from his
Thats the greatest friend I ever had
Like a brother to me a borderline dad
Maybe making a record will get me on track
Help fix whatevers wrong with my head
I jumped back in the basement at once
Made the album Us in a couple of months
But I cant lie to yall I felt lost
Energy I brought mightve been a bit off
Couple great moments though of course
Babygirl Puppy Love and The Travelers
I toured two years off that album
Was on the road ten months out of one of them

Did the globe with my brother BK
My life coach slash DJ
Literally been with me since day one
Had a lot of hard times had a lot of fun
Long story short he got hell of a wife
Catastrophe damn near ended her life
Brought our wifeys out to Hawaii
These fuckers got pregnant on Waikiki
He said I need to talk to you Ali
This is what you were born to do but not me
So after Soundset two thousand and ten
Say goodbye to my Deejay but not my friend
My career aint stop it just grew
I rock ed  the bells and Glastonbury too
Close enough to smell Beyonces perfume
But it just aint the same without dude
Couldnt slow me down no lord
Stayed on the planes and the busses and cars
Brought a young DJ into the squad
Sucker quit on me cause I toured too hard Wahhhh
On to the next one
Then me and Ant had trouble connecting
If I was here then he was always there
Touring or recording with Atmosphere
What the hells goin on with my career
Within a year my team disappeared
Got a phone call on the 4th of July
My dad died he committed suicide
Shit shouldve been there for him
Had to fly home from Europe to bury him
Im sorry I need a minute
Bismillah  Alright listen
Trying to hold this marriage together
But me and my baby barely see each other
Im in France with the fans taking pictures
Shes with the kids making dinner doing dishes
She aint got to worry bout me screwing other 
But that aint enough to make a woman feel precious
If we dont start to intersecting
We got no choice but grow in different directions Damn
I got that phone call again
You know the kind you never want to get
Mikeys mom couldnt get a hold of him
And found him dead in his apartment
Just drowning in tears
Probably wont get over that in all my years
Ill remember forever
A day later boarded a plane to Mecca
And the next month changed my life
Listening to God in the holy sites
Inklings I had all my life
Suddenly presented themselves in plain sight
Any doubts I had about the mic
And whether or not what I write is right
Fell out of sight like the tears on the floor
Now Im going harder than I ever did before
Got a couple of beat tapes from Jake
Genuine dude and his music is great
I told Zach to hold my tour dates
Roll the tape I got something to say
So Im gonna go make this album Let me start it off right though
