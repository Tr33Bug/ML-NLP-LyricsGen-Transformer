And I promise if you take me home
Ill sing you a song never leave me alone
Said cmon baby throw me a bone
Ill sing you a song never leave me alone
And I promise if you take me home
Ill sing you a song never leave me alone
Said cmon baby throw me a bone
Ill sing you a song never leave you alone
Imma tell you something about me
Thats my favourite subject I dont know whether you picked up on that yet or not
I never said I had a business mind
I just dont believe that quitting time exists aint no finish line to this
You got to give me mine I really shine my given time is this
Live and die by the grind driven by the fist
Where do you place my name if I never played your game
We dont race the same I dont run inside no painted lane
Plus yall pacin strange yall either stop or you sprint
Run when its sunny and hide if it change to rain
I wouldnt be half the Ali that I am
If I slowed myself up and tried competing with these people fam
Im every bit as unconcerned as they are unprepared
Market flooded needless to say I wasnt scared
Lets all drop they same day I dont fuckin care
Put listening stations in the store and let the public hear
Better yet lets have an instore performance
Make it oranges to oranges me dwarfing your endurance
After that well shoot the shit with our supporters
And see how many more discs of yours the indie stores order
Shit you already knew I out rap em
On the low we out work out think and out class em
Nobodys doing this thing exactly like we do
They do it they just aint doing it like us you know what Im sayin
Sucker ass mother fuckers
My personal pedigrees so bona fide
Cause a man of my stature aint born overnight
The undisputed king of where poor folks reside
Because every time I speak it be hope vocalized
And you sit and bitch with your chickens about it isnt fair
The sound system aint shit but I was crystal clear
We first name basis sound men  we give em beer
Plus I tipped em 50 last semester when the clique was here
Listen here I aint gonna give you all my secrets
Just these few examples help me illustrate my pretense
Our strength is unrelated to your weakness
Cause youll never be a worthy pool of peers to be competed with
I see my shit with Son House and Syl Johnson
And always loose I done lost face too but Im sporting their shoes
So let me remind you them little kicks you trying to fit
We outgrew them shits in high school man
I dont think Im arrogant man I think I just
You know I dos what the fuck I does man if thats just
Kiss my ass for all I care
Its of foremost importance there is none like unto the brother
Out this motherfucker regardless
So stop all the nonsense
You see me lounging call Rhymesayers office
Ive officially lost it
They say my reputation precedes me
I dont know the meaning of offseason I aint taking it easy
Aint taking a day off never had an offnight
Never been laid off I live on the job site
It all pays off though when I squint in the spotlight
And see your lips are moving to the true shit that I write
And we gon be alright every night of my life
Its my night cause I view the future like its hindsight
I aint waiting Im patiently persevering
I see greatness in the person in the mirror very clearly
And thats why I take this seriously
Baby come near to me and truly truly hear me
