Shackles are heavy on the wrist
Stacked like sardines belly of a ship
Live in your own piss and shit and being seasick
Cracked across your back with a thick leather whip
Salt water burns through your wounds
Women are starving with babies in their wombs
On your hands and knees trying to cry God please
Exhausted your voice is too weak to speak
Neighbors and strangers are dying beside you
Their decaying bodies youre tied to
Cling tight to your fight for survival
Wonder if your tribe will ever try to find you
Arrive somewhere strange the air is cold
You can see your breath and youre barely clothed
Your first time ever seeing snow
Sleeping next to it on a hard dirt floor
Go from cant seeing see in the morning to cant see at night
You work till your hands bleed white
Your native language you cant recite
Murdered on sight if you try to read or write
When you bend all of your life and cant see the light
It gets painful to stand upright
Right
And your eyes bear the sight of your wife
Being being pulled out your shack and brutalized at night
You only taste joy when babies are born
Which becomes an occasion to mourn
Separated torn from your celebrating arms
Then as quickly as they came they were gone
Sold away from your farm this is all theyve known
Never heard stories from home
They forget your name
The culture from which you came
Teaching itll get you slain
Praying to your God will get you the same
Tortured to near death lest you complain
No choice left you sing through the pain
And pray that your suffering wasnt in vain
End of your chain end of your life
Your grandchildren born with no end in sight
So you muster up all of your might
And your last breath comes out  fight 
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine thats you
Now stop imagining unravel the truth and ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do
The driver experience too
So if humanity is one
Then we all get burned when its hell that were traveling through
Youve got to save my soul
Put me back together make me whole
Said we dont know which way to go
Take my hand and place me on that road
Trapped in a history we dont understand
Cant remember how this blood got on our hands
Never been taught about the ugly past
Expecting God not to punish man
Our ancestors brought us control
We realize now that the cost was our soul
Got me feeling like an empty shell
Prison guard that inherited a cell
Im desperate to find my place
Emptiness lies behind my face
Flowers only die in a vase
A heart only dies encased in a lie we call race
I hear the song but I cant sing along
Somethings really wrong I cant put my finger on
Terrified to admit its wrong
Cause Im hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on
Our identity is hinged upon the miserable myth weve been taught since were born
Until we mend what was torn
The debt of a sin lingers long after the vicitims moans
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine thats you
Now stop imagine and unravel the truth
And ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do the driver experience too
So if humanity is one then we all get burned when its hell that were traveling through
