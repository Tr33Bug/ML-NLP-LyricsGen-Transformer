Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here
I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it Im back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it Im back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em on
And none of yall will take my place when Im gone
Im the pure raw uncut who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts whats the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
Its got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like Im already free
Im a rebel in my own right
Yall dont want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it Im exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech let it go let it be
X2
I want more
We need more
I want more god damn it Im back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more
I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day itll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood sweat love hate life death joy pain
Little child running wild stripped to the raw veins
Rabid junkyard dog off the chain barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe
X2
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when yall teach em
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and whos leading
I truly believe every word Ive ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong life go on but it wasnt nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not we gon burn this bitch to the ground
X2
I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is
