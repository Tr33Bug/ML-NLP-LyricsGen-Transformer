Mmhmm
Uncle Usi taught me
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
You know me Im a globe traveler soul ambassador
Reporting live from the world wide massacre
No mask for the truth that animates me
See it and I speak it wherever it takes me
Im in the Republic of Iran at a conference
Talkin bout the cops and their nonsense
And how they like to hunt black folk with no conscience
And how they want to preach human rights its preposterous
Request from the audience spit that Uncle Sam Goddamn
Drawing out the round of applauses
I was rocking a capella before this
Because I know that rapping in Iran is lawless
Ahh sh you know me though anything for the people
The clapping kind of tapped in to my fat rapper ego
I fell into the trap plugged in my Mac and let the beat go
Didnt think that nobody would hear though here we go
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
Oh here he go
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
This is how it go
Friday we greet each other at the mosque
But here theres only one and the government preacher talks
Which struck me as odd but nothing could prepare me for
A big ass mob chanting Death to America
It felt like somebody talking bout my mama wait
Its all real but Ima still feel some type of way
You mean the system and Im with you on that
But you got to be more specific than that
You aint talkin bout the families getting whipped in the back
Im trippin cause Ive never felt defensive like that
Okay so meanwhile footage of me spitting these raps
Is playing on every TV station they have
They jail people for that
The local rappers all start clapping back
Death threats all in my social media apps hm
I started lookin at the people that brought me here
Like what the hell yall got me on man Im out of here
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
Oh here yall go
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
This is how it go
This that international gang banging and
My homeland hit Iran with the sanctions
And my credit cards and telephone aint happening
But I cant imagine a better land to be stranded in
Almost everyone that see me coming
Want to take me home and they trying to feed me something
But I took the last forty dollars that I had
And headed to the airport in a cab and there I sat
Starving cause theres only one flight a day
I cant even buy a ticket tryna find a way
Somebody seen me on TV and recognized my face
And let me write an email to my wife in the states
Im in the airport three days wondering if Im even safe
Finally got a seat on the plane
Now imagine my exhausted embarrassment
Got back to America they interrogate me like a terrorist
Really
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
Watch where you go
Cant teach what you dont know
Cant lead where you dont go
Cant reap what you dont sow
Cant fool the people no more
