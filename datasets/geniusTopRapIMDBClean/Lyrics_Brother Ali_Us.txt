Started rhymin just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not be just the new kid thats Albino
Make em say
Yeah I know but have you heard him rhyme though
Now take that same party around the globe
And my story connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause thats the only thing that I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye so I see you with my heart
And to me all yall look exactly the same
Fear faith compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask it remains
Such as your religion or your past or your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The Worlds getting too small to stand in one place
Its like were roommates just sharing a space
Cant separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from them chains
You see what remains just a human being end of the day
Dont matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and youll see what Im sayin
Uh I started rhymin just to be somebody
I found out that I already was
Cause cant nobody be free unless were all free
Theres no me and no you its just us
Street Preacher what a fan once called me
Ive been called worse and tried to live up
Hope you dont mind a few more stories
I swear to God yall I tell em with love
