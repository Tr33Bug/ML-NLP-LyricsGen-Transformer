Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I cant say I blame you either
Cause if you made records you aint gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know I didnt make this to hurt you
God knows you done hurt enough
Just I dont know try to make some real shit you know
Bye you aint never gonna see me again
If I can help it little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Aint never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms instead you infected me
Im not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then its time for you to scram
PS you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin
It was never enough your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didnt think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head
I dont love you I dont think I ever did
And if you hadnt tried to kill me Id stayed for the kid
X 2
Theres nothinmore for us to say
Got my mind made up Im walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday
Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread I know
If Im such a bastard and mistreated you so
Then how is it youre losing your mind to see me go
Truth be told I held you together
For all them years and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim
Baby youre not wicked hard bull fish you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that youll ever be blessed with
Unless youre twisted demented and depressed and shit
And alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships
