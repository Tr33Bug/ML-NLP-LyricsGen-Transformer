Here we are together
Watching the world come down around us
I know my baby girl she counting on us
If she ask me about it I got be honest
Either they forgot about us or they got a target on us
And my niece is shooting amateur porno
Police shoot my nephews in the street like its normal
But theyve been doing that a century or like four though
Its horrible still pains me to my core though
I know that when the dust settles and the smoke clears
And the wretched of the earth living with no fears
All we need is someone here who can remind us of how great it was
Before these people had their way with us
I know when I was on the street and struggling
You know you took me in to feed my hunger pain
And now you put me on my feet look what I became
Even when we disagree that love remains
Listen these people they aint trying to save our soul
So why we bickering about which way to go
You know the words are incidental
The hearts are instrumental
As long as were connected we can make it though
We got
Love
Should I ever call your name
I know that you can feel my pain
Youll be on your way to see me through
We got this
Love
Should you ever call my name
You know that I feel the same
Ill be on my way to see you through
We got this
Im not grinning cause Im at a loss of opposition
Lot of them dont want me livin
Thank God its not your decision
I dont hate for a minute
A drop in the infinite
Cause hate got a small percentage of envy in it
My enemies are not my teachers
Im not seeking to adopt your features
I dont want or need you
My heart has been broken into but Im not broken in two
Dont need you to acknowledge the piece of me that lives in you
The truth was never yours to give us its always in us
You cut your roots off youre finished
Hearts missing and youre looking at the raw authentic
Yall been listening but yall dont get it just mimic
Im grinning cause I hear my echo in it
When you whisper to your infant
Im glad I could be of some benefit
God bless but the voice aint the sound coming out of the hole
Thats from deep down inside of our soul
Something yall need to know
Late at night I find it harder to rest easy bruh
Its like this heartache has no intention of easin up
Cause every twenty four hours is another homicide
And they keep telling me that being emotional is unreasonable
Now Im just trying to find a way that I can maintain
So I turned this love affair with words into my main thing
Putting all the hope I got left in the vocal expression
And maybe the message will make the world amazing
And finally my daddy can understand me a little better
See why I gave up my BA for another set of letters
Cause if he knew to what degree I sacrifice for this road
He might be prouder of the life I chose to go get us
But times too precious to be wasted on the grudge between us
Aint no bond greater than the share of flesh and blood between us
And we can make it through the toughest times together
If we let our guards down and just allow our love to lead us right
