Damn man Im broker than an old VCR man I need a job
Are they hiring at your job
I got a stack of red bills at my house It looks like Valentines Day at the crib
My kids are eating leftover leftovers man I cant fool them no more Its job time
Every day every day
Got to work every day
Every day every day
Got to work every day
My God theres got to be more to life than this
Theres got to be a bigger reason that I exist
Work to eat to earn my keep
To ensure somewhere to sleep and spend the weekend buying shit
Dont need economists to know I need pot to piss
Follow politics man I aint got time to think
What I got to set aside for my retirement
Cop a double shift pay somebody to watch the kids
Sick of all this but cant take an off day
Doctors office I cant swing the co pay
Trapped in a network lucky just to get work
They celebrate every week nobody gets hurt
Greed could never leave well enough alone
They keep on squeezing till we bleed from every bone
And well strive hard and stress about the rent
Probably still die poor and in debt without a cent but
I guess Ill carry my ass down to the county and see what theyre talking about But
You know they treat you like you shot somebody just because you need a little help
Youre telling me you aint never been down on your luck
Never tried to make them ends meet but just got stuck
Never slaved at a gig like a bum with a cup
Added all your pennies up and you still aint had enough
And the jobs full up they aint hiring
Im barely surviving not enough to get by with
Hunger is a constant problem stomach steady growling
People getting shot in my environment
Study go to college is what them people hollering
Too many road blocks in the way its not an option
To say that its impossible I would be lying
But you aint got a chance if youre not up in that top ten
A couple got a scholarship but I am not them
Aint got the skills to pay the bills so my pockets are thin
So until I cop a gig and my hardship ends
Fixing to line my self up at your welfare office again
And I expect to be accepted as the man that I am
Respectfully and appreciatively Maam
God damn you must be out of your mind
Do you see this Tea Party stuff man Them people look broke their damn self Are they serious
People stressing heres the question
How they get people drinking tea in a recession
Its deception how absurd is this
How are so many poor people conservative
A pro artist I put it in the good music
A con artist jobs to make you look stupid
Lookie here Ill teach you how to look through it
First thing you need to know every con got a hook to it
They seduce you with a little wealth
Say you could have some of these crumbs for yourself
If the government doesnt make us help anyone else
You stuck a red sign on your foreclosed house
Make you think youre taking back your nation
Then they turn it over to a major corporation
Those companies took the jobs overseas
And you handed them the wallet out your pocket for free
Youre staring in the sky with dollar signs for eyes
The blind right wing of a bird that cant fly
Just a peacock with a poked out gut
Whos too fat to fly so his ass just strut but
Theyre so criminal minded weve been blinded
Looking for an honest job and cant find it
They got a job bill we got a light bill
If we dont pay ours our life is quite real
