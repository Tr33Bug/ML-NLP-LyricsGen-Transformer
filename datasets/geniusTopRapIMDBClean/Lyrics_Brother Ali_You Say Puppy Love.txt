You Say  Puppy Love  Lyrics
You say I made you fall in love with me
Wish I could make you fall in love with you
You believed in the magic that us could be
And what that you and I means one could do
Every instinct you had said run from me
That this newfound touch is uncomfortable
And to truly stand naked in front of me
Or yourself for that then matter is something new
I take no pride knowing that
You avoid the mirror to shun what you despise
Never knew the beauty you came here with
Till the first time you caught your reflection in my eyes
Never you mind what I see in you
Grow because youre beautiful not because I need you to
Grow till you outstretch every single piece of you
Heaven will see you through but you got to believe its true
Go write your story
Even if in the end you might outgrow me
Ill always treasure the chapter that was mine
And twist through time with a smile knowing youre free
Puppy love is real to a puppy
I still want to feel you touch me
Im not saying leave me please just be free
I love you so much I dont want you to need me
Puppy loves real to a puppy
I still want to feel you up under me
Not saying leave me please just be free
I love you so much I dont want you to need me
The sky all alone is glorious
We behold it but we cant hold it up
When god says thats it and hits the switch
Itll all come tumbling down when its bored with us
Sweet you and all your radiance
I can please you but I cant save you sis
I adore you and might even open up
But even I cant love you enough for both of us
Cant hold you close enough
Cant enter the holes youve boarded up
Close your eyes concentrate on my voice
Want to make your love for me pure make it a choice


The sky is there to behold
You just want to be held when youre cold
Just grow stretch out your soul
And if you still want me Ill watch you grow old
