Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
They say its always darkest before the dawn  before the dawn 
And that you dont know what you got until its gone  until its gone 
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong
And thats why I gots to write this song now cmon  now cmon 
Say man I thought it would of been a long time for us  time for us 
And many more years on the grind for us  grind for us 
I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter
We were super tight but finna be super tighter  super tighter 
I guess I just assumed we had more time
For us to make more music  music  and write more rhymes  rhymes 
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team  for real 
You take away the glitter the gold and the gleam
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean
Nothin without the people you love
Say man I miss my brother but I know hes lookin down from above
And theres an angel
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin off in the den
Makin beats and puttin paper to pen
We was determined to win and you couldnt tell us different
Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippin  he kept trippin 
It seems just like yesterday sometimes
Sittin in ya bedroom  huh  writin dumb rhymes  man 
You makin beats on the insonic  sonic 
And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasnt no chronic  wasnt no chronic 
I still remember when we started the crew
It was me Mitchell Queen Jamal Jackson and you
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two
Thats when we introduced the world to the U
To the G to the K Underground Kings DJ Byrd
Pimp C and Bun B we kept it G say word  say word 
Who woulda known back in 92
In 2008 Id have to write a song sayin I miss you but its true
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh


Just for the record let me go ahead and say
I love my brother Pimp C and man I miss him every day
Yeah my heart still hurts  hurts  and the pains still fresh  fresh 
But Imma put God first to keep that pressure off my chest
And remind me that Im blessed to have had him as a friend  friend 
A ride or die homie that was with me til the end  til the end 
Real talk man we was closer than kin
And I know that Ill never have a partner like that again  like that again 
So Chad Butler I just want you to know
I keep ya memory close Im never lettin it go  lettin it go 
And they gon always remember that you was here mayne  mayne 
Cause Imma make em remember thats why Im here mayne  mayne 
Yeah its still hard  hard  and I still cry  cry 
But you and God keep me strong so Imma still try  try 
Reppin this UGK now wont I  huh 
Cause through your music you live forever so Trill  Trill  dont die
I know youre watchin over me
Last night I saw you in my dream
At the crossroads Ill see you there
At the crossroads Ill see you there
My friend my brother til the end
Cant wait to see you again
Save a place in heaven for me
Save a place in heaven for me
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
Theres an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh oohoohoooooh
