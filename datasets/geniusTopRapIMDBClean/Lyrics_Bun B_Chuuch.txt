Ah yeah two thousand and ten and we still rollin
You know Bun my dad used to tell me
Every time he thought he knew it all something new would come up
So at this time lets welcome  Drake  uh 
The newest member to the family
Whom my son Jas Prince discovered
Make no mistake the armys behind him

But Ive been watchin a genius at work on this album
And without further adieu yo Pimp give us your blessings
