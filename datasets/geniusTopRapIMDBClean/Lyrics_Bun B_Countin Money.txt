Say mayne no matter where I go  I go  no matter what I do  I do 
If chillin with myself  myself  or ballin with my crew  my crew 
If skies is lookin cloudy or Bahama water blue
I got that money on my mind  my mind  so tell me what it do  it do 
And if you be like me then you already knew it  knew it 
We goin for the money then we goin right through it  through it 
We take it to the table baby chop it up and screw it  screw it 
Cause it aint nothin to it where I come from but to do it  do it 
We get it in our hands and then it go right through the fingers  fingers 
We spend it on a system and a fresh set of swangers  swangers 
We pop a couple tags put some fresh up on our hangers  hangers 
That everyday struggle and cant nam nigga change us  change us 
Believe that I was famous fore I ever did a song  song 
Believe I had a poppin fore a label put me on  on 
Its 2010 and I aint seein nothin wrong  wrong 
With niggas countin money all day fuckin long  long 
Count money all day count money all day
Count money all day count money all money all
Count money all day count money all day
Count money all money all money all day
Money toting pistol carrying young nigga thugged out
Very first song I ever dropped was in a drug house
Razor blades sandwich bags Louis shoes stupid swag
Rubber bands duffle bags small bills trash bags
A chain on my neck you know that cost stupid cash
Maserati for the watch thats that foolish cash
Penitentiary chances sixes on a muscle car
Bun told me keep it real and watch it take me far

Talk money all day count money all night
Trust no one with my paper so I count my paper twice
I be lonely without my paper so I sleep with it at night
Now I wake up to my paper so I start my day off right
