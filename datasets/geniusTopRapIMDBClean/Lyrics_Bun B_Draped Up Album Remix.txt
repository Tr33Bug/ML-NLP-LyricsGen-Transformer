Draped Up  Album Remix  Lyrics
Big terrible Texas
Its where legends are born
Im Lil Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
Its a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat Big Mello Big Steve
Feel it
Draped up and dripped out know what Im talking about  x4 
Im draped up and dripped out the truth has just slipped out
84s red doors candy apple flipflop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple cup screw us up thats what keep the streets hot
Donke  Bun B please free Pimp C
Hydro Super Flow know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston Texas and see swangaz and lacs
And dont forget to tell the people that the legends are back
Yeah
Its Slim Thug showing HTown love
Used to hit the club on dubs acting bad on scrubs
Mad spokes and leather 24s or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for competitors when they see the two letters
Theyll never ever ever ever ever get on my level
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out know what Im talking about
The city is back just look at the map
Thought we wouldnt get in the game
Im sticking my dick up in the game
And bustin in that like a train Im hitting that mayne
Look at this grain Im grippin Im fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasnt my bang
I turn up the beat and Im cracking the street
The city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne
Just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show em your grill
And pick up some drank and watch how they do the same
Hold up mayne
What it do baby Its Paul Wall
Players rise while haters fall
Got fos crawling in the 54
On the service road Im evading the law
I stay shining like headlights
And I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice
Them twos and threes aint nuttin nice
Them threes and fours Imma roll fo sho
Fos and vogues we call em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain
Wanna know what I rep Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang on South Lee that 59
He dippin oil he drippin candy
From PA to HTown it goes down
Ice Age Mike Jones
I stay draped up dripped out drop the top when Im flipping out
Candy low on 84  how you know they fos  They poking out
Ice Age and RapALot pimping hoes in the parking lot
Ice Age and RapALot pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill you can see em in the dark at night
When Im out in the limelight I make sure I shine bright
Im in the drop with the Glock cocked
You know I keep that iron tight
Im getting brain from a tight dame
On North Maine in the turning lane
Im young and rich talking a lot of shit
I guess its because Im having thangs
Im still draped up and dripped out know what Im talking bout
Fighting over parking spots bustin in the parking lot
Tu sabes vatos raised off tacos parse
Te mato sin ningun contrato vamos
Now put your blocks up now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take em with a clip out with the click out
Dont give a shit bout Till he gets out free Pimp C
We draped up and dripped out
I told Bun when you need a verse just holla
You know how we do it you aint gotta spend no dollars
Im puffin dro bangin screw and riding fos
Middle fingers in the air you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it Candy paint with flakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it you know Im blowed
Four row diamond chain you know Im throwed
Johnny got me right huh 80 carats bright huh
Hit the button pop the trunk watch the neon light jump
Imma keep folding bread till Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw man I hate you dead
Down to ride red but Imma ride blue
In the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy dont think they doors
Everybody know ZRos flow is ferocious
I keep a Robert Davis in the deck
Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup
My Cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up
Hell naw this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up
Now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a SmithnWesson in buss
Cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real is it a blessing or what
Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up
This is HTown Texas tell me how does it look
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Chefing up some fresh hard for you out of town geekers
We got 3rd Ward 4th Ward and Southside Gs
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin 83s
Its Screwston Texas motherfucker you know the name
Well see you in February for the AllStar Game
