Draped up and dripped out Know what Im talking about
Draped up and dripped out Know what Im talking about
Draped up and dripped out Know what Im talking about
Draped up and dripped out Know what Im talking about
Im draped up and dripped out the truth has just slipped out
84s Red Doors Candy Apple FlipFlop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple Cup Screw Us Up thats what keep the streets hot
Don P Bun B Please Free Pimp C
Hydro Super Flow know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston Texas and see swangaz and lacs
And dont forget to tell the people that the legends are back yeah
Its Slim Thug showing HTown love
Used to hit the club on dubs acting bad on scrubs  thats right 
Mad spokes and leather 24s or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for compeitors when they see the two letters
Theyll never ever ever ever ever get on my level  thats right 
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out know what Im talking about


The city is back just look at the map thought we wouldnt get in the game
Im sticking my dick up in the game and bustin in that like a train
Im hitting that mayne look at this grain Im grippin Im fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasnt my bang
I turn up the beat and Im cracking the street the city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show em your grill and pick up some drank and watch how they do the same Hold up mayne
What it do baby Its Paul Wall Players rise while haters fall
Got Fos crawling in the 54 on the service road Im obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights and I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice them twos and threes aint nuttin nice
Them threes and fours Ima roll fo sho fos and vogues we call em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain Wanna know what I rep Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang On South Lee that 59
He dippin oil He drippin candy From PA to HTown It goes down
I stay draped up dripped out Drop the top when Im flipping out
Candy low on 84  How you know they Fos  they poking out
Ice Age and RapALot Pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill you can see em if its dark or not
When Im out in the limelight I make sure I shine bright
Im in the drop with the Glock cocked you know I keep that iron tight
Im getting brain from a tight dame on North Maine in the turning lane
Im young and rich talking alot of shit I guess its because Im having thangs
Im still draped up and dripped out know what Im talking bout
Fighting over parking spots bustin in the parking lot
Next two lines in Spanish 
Now put your blocks up Now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take em with a clip out with the click out dont give a shit bout
Til he gets out Free Pimp C we draped up and dripped out
I told Bun when you need a verse just holla
You know how we do it you dont gotta spend no dollars
Im puffin dro bangin screw and riding fos
Middle fingers in the air you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it Candy paint with blakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it you know Im blowed
Four row diamond chain you know Im pro
Johnny got me right huh 80 karats bright huh
Hit the button pop the trunk watch the neon light jump
Ima keep folding bread til Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw man I hate you dead
Down to ride red but Ima ride blue in the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy dont think they doors Everybody know ZRos flow is ferocious
I keep a ride with daytons in the deck Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup My cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up Hell naw this is playa from the chest to the nut
If Screw would be here he said I would come up now the radio station requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a smif n wesson to buss cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real is it a blessing or what Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up
This is HTown Texas tell me how does it look
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Stepping up some fresh hard for you out of town peakers
We got 3rd Ward 4th Ward and Southside Gs
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin 83s
Its Houston Texas motherfucker you know the name
Well see you in February for the AllStar Game
repeat 2X
