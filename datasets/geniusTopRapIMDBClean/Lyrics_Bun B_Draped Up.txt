Well its big Bun B now baby Mr Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And Im smoking on some good mayn the color purple
Not the movie but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like Face I got the money the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundredthousand round my neck
Im looking real shiny you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk break you off chunk a deuce
And Im Cadillac turning mayn  Im gone 
Little swang to the left big swang to the right
My plates scraping and Im sliding the pipe its super tight
So dont try to knock us baby dont try to hate
Thats how we do it in that Lone star state get it straight

Draped up and dripped out know what Im talking bout  x4 
Now if you never been to Texas theres a picture to paint
Cause we doing it real big in case you thinking we aint
Its lots of money on these streets being spent and being made
All it take is one look to see these boys getting paid
They living laid in big houses with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches bracelets chains
Pieces teeth mayn we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest visors in the ceiling
On chrome 83s and fours and Vogue peeling
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button and my car is waiving bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin on syrup and  banging the Screw 
We slab swangin comin down and through I thought you knew
Back in the days all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house and they cant do nothing about us

Draped up and dripped out know what Im talking bout  x4 
One time for my trill niggas reppin the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keeping it cocked
They hold it down for they hood throw it up let em see it
So they can know how you G it if they hating so be it
We aint playing where Im staying cause its way too real
No matter the situation we gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride cause Im ready
I got 2010 vision and my trigger finger steady
Im an Underground King homeboy and not a simp
And I gots to represent til they decide to free the Pimp
Im down for my click just like Im down for my block
And Im a stand up for my partner til they let him off of lock
So go on body rock Southside or lean back
Twostep with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole dirty South fittin to show they naked ass
