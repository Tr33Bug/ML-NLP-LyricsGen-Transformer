Its its its its its Serani and Bun B
When the heat is on we burn hotter than  fire 
People will burn up on we burn hotter than  fire 
Turn my enemies to dust burn them up with  fire 
Whether life or death guess were far from  fire 
Murder murder redrum  mami I done dead them
Rude boy like Ashanti take his motherfucking head from
His shoulders this is Bedlam  mayhem chaos
Competition cease and seckle already they lost
Thinking they boss like the Triple Cs CEO
Fuck them they would be DOA ASAP you see me ho
Me you and DOG thats why the fuck they ducking me
Rude boy now deal with the fuckery we bucking G
The ghetto red hot the youth and the care play
Pussy and lit up match shots now in the air
Motherfucker beware til I retire or expire
Cyanide in them know that we are coming with more fire
When the heat is on we burn hotter than  fire 
People will burn up on we burn hotter than  fire 
Turn my enemies to dust burn them up with  fire 
Whether life or death guess were far from  fire 
Big belly man big belly man man
Big belly man Im that big belly man
Big black benz 20 tints
100 niggas on my team 20 friends
After four or five lines you know this organized crime
Me still buying jewels I got on more than last time
This not a past time this a landslide
And Im bringing more fire better get your hands up
Get out my beamer you know I like my trigga finger crew
Get with a boss and maybe you could get a beamer too
Burning down the strip from Texas to Kingston
As a dime stand in line just dying to squeeze in

When the heat is on we burn hotter than  fire 
People will burn up on we burn hotter than  fire 
Turn my enemies to dust burn them up with  fire

Who want to test this Titty 2 necklace
Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe
Balling like the ESPYs drinking on that Texas
Sexting texting aggravated flexing
Did it for the money and the fame came with it
Connect from the island and the caine came with her
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey Mariah Carey you get carried off
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and Ill Dash like Damon
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz but today I got on three chainz
When the heat is on we burn hotter than  fire 
People will burn up on we burn hotter than  fire 
Turn my enemies to dust burn them up with  fire 
Whether life or death guess were far from  fire
