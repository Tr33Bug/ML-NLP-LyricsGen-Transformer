Pimp C PA trill nigga
Polo fuck that Hilfiger
Made myself a ghetto star
On the slab sippin barre
Smokin weed sellin white
Them other niggas shit dont come back right
Thats how niggas get popped
Tryna get the cheaper price
Watch yo paper guard your life
Cause most these niggas aint livin right
Keep yo pistol fuck a fight
Cause niggas out here jack every night
I keep my mind on my money nigga fuck the fame
Big face hunerds keepin the game
Hittin the corner in the candy thang
Sittin on leather grippin the grain
Good weed good drink big money mayne  Aye 
Rollin in somethin foreign on leather grippin grain  Yeeeah 
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed throwed
Well I came in the door I said it befo
I never fuck a ho without head no more
I never pour up with nothing less than a four
And I smoke cigars it aint just for the show
Im blessed from the do and known for my stidile
I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile
You can have the bitch nigga I aint sentimental
Smoke weed and freestyle no instrumental
Been out lived through the wicked streets of PA
Motherfuck the judge prosecutor and the DA
Head to the H where the hoes will fuck threeway
Two way four way anyway the Pro say
Never hear a ho say no I wont no I cant
Stop it and no I dont
Cause a bitch know that I might just explode
And slap her in the face with a Pie  la Mode
Cause a nigga gettin throwed
Good weed good drink big money mayne  Aye 
Rollin in somethin foreign on leather grippin grain  Yeeeah 
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed throwed
Good weed good drink big money mayne  Aye 
Rollin in somethin foreign on leather grippin grain  Yeeeah

Break out the pot  YUP  heat up the water  DAMN 
Swear to God the minivan do tricks
Hit the brakes hit the lights and voila there go them bricks
Slide through the hood  HOOD  sittin on some big wheels
Niggas coppin white and turn flips like cartwheels
Trapstar my Nextel chirp all day  AYE

But the flows like dope  So its on again
Started with the block hit it brick by brick
Then I charted with the Roc nigga hit by hit
Im retarded with the Glock nigga clip by clip
The competition is none they deceased to exist
Let it breathe a little bit
