All my friends have gone away
So long to them but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Wont change my soul cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Wont change my soul cause I have to go
Now my brother was loud but my brother was proud
And my brother made sure that he stood out in a crowd
Yeah my brother wore glasses but he saw so clear
And my brother knew God so he had no fear
No fear of these haters no fear of these clones
My brother wasnt concerned and he made that known
Yeah my brother was spoiled but my brother was loyal
Late nights of hard work me and my brother would toil
Yeah my brother made me laugh cause my brother was funny
But you best not ever fuck around with my brothers money
Cause my brother would snap and then thats all that she wrote
And its a line under that as my brother would quote
Yeah my brothers a mothafucka if Im tellin the truth
But man he kept it 100 in and out of the booth
So when I talk about my brother I smile and I cry
Because I know hes watchin over me sittin on high
All my friends have gone away
So long to them but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Wont change my soul cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Wont change my soul cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Wont change my soul cause I have to go
