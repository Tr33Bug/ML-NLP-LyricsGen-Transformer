Hey hey we keepin it trill
Songbook baby
If you need love Im lovin if you need a thug Im thuggin
If you need a hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
Need a lil dough we flippin got somewhere to go Im whippin
Be a love hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
Bun B Ima man amongst men
My chain is white gold my steel is tungsten
Im made of tough skin you gon respect me
Take more than a average nigga to check me
Im a rider til the wheels go ballin they blow out
One hundred and one percent G and its no doubt
That if you need a man to make you feel secure
Then baby you aint gotta look no more I got the cure
You want money and jewels you want clothes and cars
Wanna live VIP rubbin shoulders with stars
Wanna fly in G4s or sail the seas
Then your wish is my command you can do what ya please
The lap of luxury is what youll be layin in
Just respect the player and the game that hes playin in
I can show you a side of life you never seen
Cause even the king of the trill need a separate queen
If you need love Im lovin if you need a thug Im thuggin
If you need a hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
Need a lil dough we flippin got somewhere to go Im whippin
Be a love hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
See all that listenin to them hoes in your ear gotta quit
I see they smile when Im around when I leave they talk shit
They just mad cause I got you flippin jagos poppin tags
Brand new clothes you cant tell by the tag
I dont mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hatin
They just waitin on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with Nathan
Then when I do that they gon back door and try to holla
Hopin Ima do them like you and drop them off some dollas
But I aint cause I cant afford to go back down that road
Id rather stay on my J O and stack a bankroll
But I aint cause I cant afford to go back down that road
Id rather stay on my J O and stack a bankroll
But if you real and you down and in public you dont clown
Holla at me Ill be around Mike Jones
But if you real and you down and in public you dont clown
Holla at me Ill be around yeah
If you need love Im lovin if you need a thug Im thuggin
If you need a hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
Need a lil dough we flippin got somewhere to go Im whippin
Be a love hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down


I been puttin it down nigga and holdin my grounds nigga
From off the mound nigga we duckin them clowns nigga
Takin they crown nigga we shovin the town nigga
Rocks off the ground got the kush by the pounds nigga
Ankle blingin baby wrist on freeze
Got the pinky on the ice love a bitch with gold teeths
Hot girl nigga lovin the G
Keep the work under the seat she do it for me
Take a trip to port her off to the beach
Tell her homie hold it down cause we hustle to eat
And got me feelin like I lost my Jones
I done lost my home so H town its on
And nuttin change cause the palms got chrome
Nigga do this in the early cause we gettin it on
And baby girl you could shop alone
And fly the 4 to France and take a hundred bones
If you need love Im lovin if you need a thug Im thuggin
If you need a hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
Need a lil dough we flippin got somewhere to go Im whippin
Be a love hustla whatever you need girl Ima hold you down
