Ohohhhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain

Or comin up on the side of me side of me
Ohhhh if a nigga die tonight

Man Im a real trill nigga  nigga  I been out on them blocks
With them hustlers  hustlers  them dealers  dealers  and killers sellin rocks
Put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down
til it came back up and night came back around  around 
I did a lot of shit them late nights for the dough
Robbin niggas on the low  low  laughed at em then I go  go 
Sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt
And sometimes I had to leave a niggas dick up in the dirt
I aint proud of what I did and if I could go back in time  time 
Id try to find another way instead of packin nines
Totin Ks and holdin macs  macs 
But we know time aint rollin back
And hungry hyenas they aint foldin jack
So on these cold and black streets wolves keep huntin
And a young black man can lose his life over nothin
If I gotta go please let it be for somethin real
Cause this bullshit hood shit is gettin niggas killed on the real
Ohohhhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
Ohhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
Well if a deal goes dirty or the counts dont match  match 
Or if I catch a motherfucker dippin in the back  dippin in the back 
Say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam
And we take it to the streets and let the guns go blam
I dont really give a damn  damn  or really know whatevers gon come  come 
And Imma represent where Im from  represent where Im from 
Man I dont wanna die  die  but I aint scared to  I aint scared to 
Shit I just wanna make sure that Im prepared to  Im prepared to 
Cant leave without a couple tickets in the stands
So my wife and my momma and my chilren got cans  chilren got cans 
Cause once Im gone who gon take care of my kids  take care of my kids 
And do the same thangs for em that I did
Man Id rather do a bid  bid 
At the least they can see me behind the glass  glass 
Instead Im reminiscin bout the past  about the past 
Nigga dont know what he got until he passes on
So let him tell em that he love em fore his ass is gone


If a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
Ohhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
We trappin hard right across from the graveyard
I just pray to God I dont have to work a day job
Niggas gettin robbed so Im ridin with my AR
They are not finna take what I done paid for  no 
Walkin through the bricks on my Jena 6 shit
Like if you aint from around here you was gettin hit  cmon 
Send a OG some flicks make they time go by quick  hey 
You surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did  yeah 
We survived but most of us die for some bullshit
Go to church but the devils standin on the pulpit  damn 
Niggas lied just to kick it  what  swear to God they got a meal ticket
Then they call you and they bout to get evicted  I know 
A Underground King Ive been one ever since I was sixteen  cmon 
Pimp and Bunll tell you just what Buck mean  whats up 
A street nigga livin the street dream I seen  for sho 
My whole team go to the feds or get a hole in the head
This what I said  yeah 
If a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
Ohhhh if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didnt die in vain and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
Or comin up on the side of me side of me
