One hundred percent gangsta dont smile and dont laugh
In a 3X shirt nigga 38 waist
I aint small motherfucker Im takin up some space
Wit a size 11 shoe thatll kick ya in ya face
Bitch Im all about a crime embedded and catch a case
I aint scared to kick in ya door and look around ya place
I aint scared to count back to four and put one in ya face
K steel nigga favorite deucedeuce and a third
Teflon coat and ya body juice loose on the curb
I serve you like a tennis ball straight up diminish yall
I position the competition and when Im finished
Yall can clear the calendar call authority and tell they next of kin
We shot em like a crackhead stabbed em up like a Mexican

I see these niggas do a lot of talkin but they never back it up
Thought the work that they movin all the paper they stackin up
You niggas got me crackin up
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets and we aint buyin them so pack it up

From Westside to the East we keep it G and thats a promise
Bunch of black Osamas Americas Most Wanted
We criminal backgrounds we ready to straight flaunt it
All it take is a sawed drop a ho and instigator
Messy motherfuckers got to make it for an instant hater
Imma lay ya down like a baby ready to nap
Cause Imma trill nigga ready to clap now washap
I slap a nigga stupid with a back hand wraith
And continue til nobody from your wack clan left
Bitch you might cheat death and you might cheat the dealer
But you never cheat the king of the underground on the realer
