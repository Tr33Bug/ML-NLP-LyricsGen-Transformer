Get your shit together clone build a better prototype
You lookin like a mop  mop  and Im lookin for a flo to wipe

Another gangster fairytale and for that shit we aint fallin
All youre talkin bout it is slangin bangin bussin and ballin
But I aint seen yo scary ass at All Star in New Orleans  All Star at New Orleans nigga 
Im tired mayne this shit is gettin older than Moses
Pussy niggas always poutin with poses
But mayne all it really shows is how hard you aint
A nigga bust yo ass in the mouth you probably faint
Not from the power of the punch but the shock  but the shock 
Cause you a coward and niggas gon devour your lunch
A bunch of niggas done tried  tried  but aint too many done it like me

Keep it 100 All day and all night
Nigga any time you see me Imma keep it super tight
Im an Underground King repping UGK
Dont give a damn what a motherfucker say Imma keep it
Keep it 100 All night and all day
Nigga any time you see me mayne Im reppin PA
This is UGK for life long live Pimp C
And Imma never let a nigga pimp me Imma keep it

Leave you leakin till you moult in your meal dude for real dude
I got the skill to dont make me have to show it
Cause itll be over before you know it
You get one shot and I suggest you dont blow it
If I do it I overdo it reap that you gon sew it  you reap that you gon sew it 
Im a revolutionary black fister
You fuckin with fire fuck around and get a blister
I fuck with a father then fuck around and hit a sister
Underground King motherfucker call me Mister  Mister what 
Kilogram Mister Woodgrain Mister Brick  brick 
And unless you the misses get of the mister dick  dick
