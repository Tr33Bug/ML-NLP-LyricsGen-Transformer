Woodgrain wheel and the candy paint mandatory
If youre from that Texas you already understand the story
Money cups and swangas  swangas  tops chopped with that trunk lit
Chunk a deuce with fingers  fingers  boy we aint on that punk shit
Gulfway veteran that aint too many better than
Say he wanna dance with the devil then fuck it let him in
We dont bar niggas droppin bars while we on barre
Yeah you might be on bitch but you know you aint on par
When I pull up on a pussy nigga with that chrome boy
Shut his slab down he gon have to call up OnStar

Martin Luther call him the king cause this is playground
Slab doors leather and 4s this why they hatin now
