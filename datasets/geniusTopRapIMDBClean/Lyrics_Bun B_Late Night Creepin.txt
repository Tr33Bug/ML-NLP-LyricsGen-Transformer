Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
And the street lights start comin on in the town
When the kids go inside and old foks go to sleep
Thats when real Gs come out on the creep
Midnight movin through the city on the low
Sippin on some sizurp and smokin on some dro
Got the TVs on both my screens on flow
Pop trunk on dis bitch and Im ready to go
You never know what the night might hold
After hours motherfuckers act way too cold
You see work gettin bought and work gettin sold
If you real you can roll but if you fake you might fold
Now a days its a struggle to survive
Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin
Cause we dont come out till after dark
With nothing less than 28 grams of spark
And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip
Everytime that its time to flip
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin
We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin
In the late night
Thats w thats w
Thats when real Gs c come out on the creep
I got my two 45s and they loaded and locked
Keep em both on cock for I step on the block
Its the grave yard shit cause we out on the grind
And we dont care about time cause its money on mind
We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread
We aint worried bout sleep fuck goin to bed
We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs
Take it back to the boulevard with fours on swang
I do my thing and you cant tell me different
Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it
Im programmed automatic with this G shit
And that go for every other cat you see me with
Glock turned on with the burn on the hip
Im blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin

  2X
In the late night better get your face right
Everything sells bitches to the bass pipe
I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light
Blood shot 20 20 through the guage sight
Im in a gold lac bought it all from sold sacks
I aint braggin homie these are just the cold facts
We known to hold gats and nobody hold back
Fuck a cheap shot ill take out your whole back
So bring your whole pack better bring an extra clip
Aint nobody walk away cause aint nobody give a shit
Bitch Im livin and I love it its beautiful
Somethin like the smell of crap when Im watchin your noodle blow
We famous pharmisuticals and breakin the bits
We blazin two up in the cuticals to breakin the bread
Dont give a shit you never heard of us
We known among the murderous
For toatin heavy metal push the good shit pour the purple up
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin
We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin
