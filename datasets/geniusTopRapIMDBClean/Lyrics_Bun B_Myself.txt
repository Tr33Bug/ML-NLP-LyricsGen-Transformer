Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Whoo whoo whoo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Had a dream I was still sixteen
But still me when I seen myself  Myself 
I was so bullheaded down the road I was headed
Had to slow down and walk with myself
Had to talk to myself argue and fought myself
Yeah I had told myself
The road never stroll down there
And I told me shit Ima keep it G
You lookin aight Big Mike
Big money big car big house big booty wife
Shit nigga thats your life
Thats your car your house your wife
Im just sayin you can have that
Without the strife of the life that a nigga endured
You aint gotta drop outta college
And watch your grand mama ask the law Lord why did he do it
You aint gotta make love to the girl
You dont really love yall have a baby and go through it
Whats really so bad The game that Im givin is golden
Cause it was gotten straight from dad
Did you listen to him Mike Wish I had
Its my life it aint that bad  Yeah 
Keep this conversation locked in your head
Put you first stack your bread
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone
And the folk that need me to be strong
I got to hold my own I got to right my wrongs
I got to let God steer
I got to take myself I got to help myself to live
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own I got to right my wrongs
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own I got to right my wrongs
Protect myself
Now who woulda thought that a nigga
Woulda made it to a penthouse  Made it to a penthouse 
Man I been thinkin bout when Pimp came home
Went straight to the Bent Lot  Straight to the Bent lot 
Now thats a long way
From a pot on the stove with the gram  Gram 
But when I was comin up all I had
In the pot was some Ramen noodles and Spam
And I was like damn and this is some bullshit
I dont want to live like this
I just want a chain that rains and nice wrists
Why the hell cant I have me some nice shit
But instead of complainin I started aimin higher
My passion matched my desire now I just spit out that fire
And never get tired you can put that on a choir
Yeah man I got me suppliers
And made some mistakes but guess what
That shit dont define me  Define me 
Thats why you find me grindin
From the 90s until Im in my nineties  Nineties 
Shinin no need to rewind me
Said it before and they scared to repeat it
I came to give the people game they needed
Until my life is depleted  Life is depleted 
Your life is a bitch and its best to be mindful
Of how you gon treat it  How you gon treat it 
Cause if you catch a case with the Devil my nigga
Im down for your beatin  Im down for your beatin 
Cant get away from the choices you make
And the way you behavin  The way you behavin 
So dont be surprised when the throne that you sit in
Is startin to cavein


I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone
And the folk that need me to be strong

I got to let God steer
I got to take myself I got to help myself to live
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own I got to write my wrongs
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues

Protect myself
Hey I got a foot trapped in quicksand  Ay 
I got my hand stuck in blender  Ay 
Walk with a heart that been bruised up
Still got a couple of beats left in
What a surprise Im not dead yet
Got a couple of friends that cant claim that
They throwin the bones that got 11
Eyes of the State no fun fun
Woke up in the dawn alone the mood hung there yawnin
I dont see calm that often
Lit the stick in her hair with no coughed
Im walkin the Earth again better get poppin
Check the old gold watch I ride often
It dont mean much but its mine I copped it
Have it on my wrist til my heart starts stoppin
Good to remind then Im lyin inside coffins
I dont advise who am I to act wise
Nine out of ten times the swine had arised so I lie
It aint aokay
Eh you get nine bucks they want eight
Tryna chase you and parade around Mace
Try to remind myself they will pay
You dont got shit take a bit of mind games
Stick around maybe bring your pain to these lames
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone
And the folk that need me to be strong
I got to hold my own I got to write my wrongs
I got to let God steer
I got to take myself I got to help myself to live
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own I got to write my wrongs
I got to make these moves I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own I got to write my wrongs
Protect myself
