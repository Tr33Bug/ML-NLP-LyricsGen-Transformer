Pushin keep on pushin

Say man I dont give a fuck about the feds
DEA ATF Task Force Jumpout boys
Or your local neighborhood robbers

Well its the king of the hubba trade and the sergeant of snow  snow 
They call me Mr Killa Gram in case yo ass aint know  Know 
Im the boss baller of blow when you come to the Gulf  Gulf 
Other cats holdin some weight but they aint holdin enough
Ive been around way before the Interstate was on fire  Fire 
Before they hid it in the gas or the tire  Tire 
Before a motherfucker even knew about a stash box
We just put work in the back of the car  Man  and mashed out  For real 
Now ask a nigga that was doin it in ninethree
On the Interstate in a rental car you can find me
Suitcase is stuffed like a holiday turkey  Turkey 
Chopper right beside in case a nigga try to jerk me  Jerk me 
I did the city thing plus I played it out of state
Either way a nigga was known for havin a lot of weight
Try to knock me down but it only made me bigger
Haters wanna see me fall but a nigga gotta keep on pushin
I feel you Bun I feel you Young I mean I feel you
Im on the corner from sun up to sun down
Competition gettin hectic Im headed for out of town

So Im bout to take it to drastic measurements for my ends
My partner Rob in seventeen and in the Benz
And me Im in a bucket but fuck it thats how it is shit
I got an ounce about to cut it into stones
Next stop Port Arthur Texas I work it in the Lones
Im a little nigga on his hustle bout to rise
I was cuttin seventeen and I was only payin five
A week went by and a nigga took that dry
Back to HTown with reup about to score me nine
A Pyrex bulb and the whoop so throwed
I cooked it for nine then I stretched it for nine more
Whoa Im that nigga bakin with holes in his door
Crummy niggas sellin that ether but fuck it shit sold
