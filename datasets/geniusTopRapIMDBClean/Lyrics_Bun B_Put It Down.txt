Now when it come to makin money Im a printing press  Press 
And when it come to bein trill Im the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test  Test 
And when it come to making history Im like Joes son  Son 
A million ways to die and you already chose one  One 
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning  Ginning 
We on the top now go back and tell the hood we winning  Winning 
And while youre there let em know I did it just for them  Them 
I made em cough the cash up and left em just the phlegm  Phlegm

We on a level those before us never even thought of  Thought of 
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father  Father 
I helped the blind to see and kept it G just like I oughta  Oughta 
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water  Water 
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire  Xpire 
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire  Tire 
My flow is still official and I still got the fire  Fire 
Cant take your eyes off me  Off me 
Like when you watch The Wire  Wire 
And in ohten  Ten  we finna go in  In 
So let the opposition know that there is no win  Win 
And I am no friend  Friend  so put your hand down  Down 
And tell em Stand down  Down  before its Man down  Down 
Ugh Since youre telling on me tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me shell probably tell you that I

Round I gotta hundred girls in each phone

Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time every day we switching zones
Drizzy Hendrix Im just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later man a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard nigga Im quoted more nigga
Results are in I guess you shouldve voted more nigga
Swimming in the money yall just float ashore nigga
Never drowning what the fuck you think this boat is for nigga
Yeah Im quick to take a RB diva out
I bring some friends she bring some friends that know what we about
And when its done I put my slippers on and see em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But Im just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler every day Im riding clean damn
Ugh Since youre telling on me tell the world about me
