Hustle meticulous so concerned with particulars
Hard as hell makin millions and still remain inconspicuous
Bitches be so adventurous they get wet when you mention us
Even the white ones daddy hear bout it they think of lynchin us
Government plans fencin us in life in the pen
For sellin shit you put in our hood no I did not do it
We desperate starvin and dyin to eat die in the street
For a fraction of what I get now for a soundin fly on the beat
Hmm Im the anomaly honestly you should honor me
But how can I act like Im the shit like wasnt no one in front of me
How can I not acknowledge all the pimpin Bun had done for me
Okay listen fella never ever disrespect the predecessor
