Oh I
Bless and youll be respected  respect 
Respect the ways of the old
Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance  has no place for acceptance 
The day Selassie I come

Check check check out my melody
I got the killer flow call it lyrical felony  lyrical felony 
I got more melanin than Melanie
So mothafuck what a fuckboy is tellin me
Im lit so they inhalin me
Since Im iller no man be triller
No woman no cry fuck her I didnt feel love  didnt feel love 
Past the plantain take a shot of tequila
Selecta come back rewind now wheel up

Cause me not deal with the fuckery of Babylon

So mandem back off when we walk by Selassie I come
Bless and youll be respected  respect 
Respect the ways of the old
Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance  has no place for acceptance 
The day Selassie I come

And its designed for the mind of my brother man

Hit you from your blindside got goons in your peripheral
