Oh I
Bless and youll be respected  respect 
Respect the ways of the old
Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance  has no place for acceptance 
The day Selassie I come

Check check check out my melody
I got the killer flow call it lyrical felony  lyrical felony 
I got more melanin than Melanie
So mothafuck what a fuckboy is tellin me
Im lit so they inhalin me
Since Im iller no man be triller
No woman no cry fuck her I didnt feel love  didnt feel love 
Past the plantain take a shot of tequila
Selecta come back rewind now wheel up

Cause me not deal with the fuckery of Babylon

So mandem back off when we walk by Selassie I come
Bless and youll be respected  respect 
Respect the ways of the old
Cause when a rudeboy has no place for acceptance  has no place for acceptance

And its designed for the mind of my brother man

Hit you from your blindside got goons in your peripheral
