Im the oneman army Bun B
Ive never been taken out
I keep emcees breaking out
Im bringing real rap back and taking the faking out
Im clearing all the bullshit out the way to make a vacant route
OK now let the real niggas roll through
Its going for you new niggas and the old too
It was some bullshit then and its some bullshit now
So Im just tryna keep the bullshit down
They say the rap game needs balance to keep it level
Just like the EQ with the bass mid and treble
And yeah thats true but if you wanna point blame
Just be careful about the motherfucking way you aim
You blame radio internet and politics
But see we all really know its just a pile of shit
You not playing cause your music aint hitting
The people dont like you stop hating start quitting muthafucka
You saying you the man thats the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didnt do
Its not the shit you say Its the shit you not saying
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
Niggas be lying talking about they bust a heater
Once I see him they be more like Justin Bieber
Leave it my rivals underground like Skyzoos how I do
I have em laying on the ground bleeding
Butt naked with a bullet in his motherfucking head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in being in the place where
Im wearing Gucci mane getting white boy wasted
I tell a nigga break bread or take lead
Im trying to get rid of this weight KFed
Me and Bun got the gangsta bond
We like that onceinalifetime fame to you that aint the prom
Im not a fan of no man Im not Stan
Flow like Niagra thats why they go God damn
I whip it up in the kitchen like pots and pans
Im Godlike when Im praying I should stand
You saying you the man thats the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didnt do
Its not the shit you say Its the shit you not saying
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
No rapper can rap quite like I can
Now take your bestknown rapper and make him a fan
Im the man homeboy been running the block
I make you say Go Reggie and do the wop ha ha
And Im Doc the niggas are hating
My flow and your swag it dont relate
Cause Im grrreat jewels like Frosted Flakes
Lightskinned just one shade darker than Drake
I hold weight when the camera rolling
Its like golf how I got the US Open
Nigga Im nice I see you scoping
Think twice before you move that close in
Thats my dosage call me tomorrow
Look so fly when you call me a barber
Everything I write call me the author
Baby Im back sorry I lost you
You saying you the man thats the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didnt do
Its not the shit you say Its the shit you not saying
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
Stop playing
Stop playing
You know better show better step it up and stop playing
