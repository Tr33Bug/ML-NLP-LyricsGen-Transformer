Ladies and Gentlemen of the Southern States of America
We gather here today to bring you the beginning of the new era
And now the speaker of the South J Prince
Aww yeah RapALot back in the house once again
With the trillest of the trill Bun B
The new President of the South
Yo Bun its your time
And we dedicate this one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffered at the hands of the enemy
Its been a long time comin but it finally came
For Bun B to get his motherfuckin shot in the game
I put mo work in than an average trill nigga can put
And Imma gangsta from my head to my foot
Blacker than soot I got the hood behind me
The streets cosigned me
Head ported in the ghetto  man  you know where to find me
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment I run the South and everything down here
From the corners and cuts trap spots and blocks
Whether its rappin or work I got the shit on lock
I aint wit all that back talkin sneak dissin or plexin
Imma tell ya how I feel cause Imma god damn Texan
Bout time for me to start eliminatin the fraud
Cause this a White House of cards filled wit nuthin but broads
We gon run them hoes out and put some trill niggas in
Cause what happened in New Orleans should never happen again
They been sittin on they ass doin much about nuthin
For too god damn long and Im tired of the frontin
Imma instigate a change from the motherfuckin top
Cause this bullshit they pullin on my people gotta stop
So Im here to make a stand  stand  and take up the slack
Dirty South Prince Deezy I got ya motherfuckin back
Its a new king on the throne and his crown is a hat
It say Free Pimp C now whats fuckin wit that
Hail to the chief echoes
