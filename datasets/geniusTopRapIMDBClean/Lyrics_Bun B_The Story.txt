Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
CL Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met we wasnt on the same page
From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put PA on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Bigtyme put down a few songs
Everybody cosigned saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live
Shit next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped Too Hard to Swallow A Pocket Full of Stones
Put the remix on Menace shit we had it going on
Got love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair
Had to separate ourself bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side aint always what it seems
We dropped Super Tight a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didnt realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on to what homey was doing
But by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes
The next thing you know IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it dropped Ridin Dirty instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth
Got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets and we cant keep the people waiting
He made a call or two to some folks tellin em man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan Bun got the drawl
RapALot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the NY
Its JayZ saying yall niggas getting fly
He doing Volume 3 and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure
But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated cant believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and well be on the way
Shit it sounded okay but me I had to ask
If we dont do Big Pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggas on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put Dirty Money together and it was aces
But thats around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation said fuck you hoes
We finish the album got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty
Album got released big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggas with masks on vests and all black
Its Christmas 2001 bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block nobody could budge
And then he violated now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th he aint been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
In stead of coCEO now Im the fuckin boss
Had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water thats trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son dont worry
Cause its not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and to C
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before Im breaking em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming Free Pimp C
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You aint gotta worry about nothing the world is yours
Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife
I kept it real because to me its UGK for life
