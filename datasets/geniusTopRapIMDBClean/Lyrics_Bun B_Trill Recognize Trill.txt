I still  x7 
Tote steel
I still tote steel  x2 
I still ha
I still tote steel give a fuck how you feel
We some southern OGs Trill Recognize Trill
All my hustlers keep quiet and my dealers dont slip
Money speaks for itself so we aint gotta say shit 
Bun B is the name UGK is the click
PAT is the city so if you hate suck a dick
Im from the land of the trill from the home of the hard
Where niggas dont wait to see ya they bring it to your yard
We aint never been fraud we aint never been lame
So if you wanna get it crackin every nigga is game
So we can catch a corner we can catch a square
Any place any time Ill be waiting right there
See I give you a bad one and shoot you in the spine
But as soon as you hit your back my dogsll eat you alive
All we know is survive we aint taking no ails
So before you play with us you best play with yourself
Cause Im tired of the tough talk tired of the mean mug
Im bout ready to give these buck niggas a clean slug
Cock back the hammer on the god damn steel
Put a hollow in the middle of his god damn breel fuck it
Talking about the karats in my watch diamonds in my chain
Whos baddest on the block What my status in the game
The records that Ive sold Bobby V going gold
And all them number one chart positions that I hold
The money and the wealth well Ill keep it to myself
But Im always willing to share the firepower on the shelf
Im shiny star spanglin dingaling danglin
Luda the sheet swisha broke the record of Wilt Chamberlin
Im College Park rangering Houston Tex mangering
So get down or lay down and see these middle finger rings
Im banging in the east west south all over the map boy
I do it for myself my daughter and all these trap boyz
Lac boyz candy and paint paper we stack boy
Semiautomatic so make the click get back boy
Click since I was born I been the shit
And money speaks for itself so I aint never said sheit


Niggas best to start running hiding dodging and ducking
Cause them trill niggas comin riding cocking and bucking
Bitch you fucking with a monster a beast like no other
The hardest nigga living since my motherfucking brother
So duck and cover duck and roll hit the deck
We coming for money and your motherfucking respect
We aint taking no checks money orders or visas
Your life is on the line so dont motherfucking tease us
You gonna need Jesus to hold you and help ya
Cause you fucking with me bitch you gonna see helter skelter
That heat gon melt ya this steel gon gut ya
You lame ass nigga know ya nolia then fuck ya
Bitch I stopped giving a damn when Pimp went to the pen
So not everyones associates and nobodys friends
Just make sure to get my ends and nobody gets hurt
Before I put somebodys children under motherfucking dirt fuck it
