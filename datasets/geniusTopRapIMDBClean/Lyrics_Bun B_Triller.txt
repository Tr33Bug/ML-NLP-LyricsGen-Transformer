Triller
Say aint nobody triller
Im a motherfuckin killer
Say aint nobody triller
And you know its for real
Wake up in the morning give thanks to the Lord
For giving me another day so I can go hard
Never been fraud always kept it true
Get dressed hit the street try ta see what it do
Cut a few corners chunk a few dubs
Get em jump back trill niggas show love
Some try to hate I dont pay it no mind
Either get with me or get like me  thats on the grind
Candy paint shine as I flip through the city
Ridin 84s and them hoes look pretty
Had dirty money way before P Diddy
Im just tryna squeeze a little more milk up out the titty
Is ya with me
Imma put it down my nigga
Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga
Boys talking down on a nigga
But since day one Ive been a killer
Mayne and aint nobody triller
Say aint nobody triller
Im a motherfucking killer
HTown in this bitch
And you know its for real
Riding drop top in the Fleetwood Lac
The sun is shining down on my Astros hat
Im all about the cheese but I never been a wreck
Gotta keep it to yo self what part of the game is that
You see me rollin 4s on them foes just flipping
Leaning on the leather through the Southside dipping
You know I got the gat up on my lap with the clip in
Cock back ready but these boys aint tripping
Who run this bitch Dont even bother
My granddaddy did he passed it to my father
My father did his thing like a G
He passed it down to me
Now the neighborhood belong to Bun B OG
Imma put it down my nigga
Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga
Boys talking down on a nigga
But since day one Ive been a killer
Mayne and aint nobody triller
Say aint nobody triller
Im a motherfucking killer
PA in this bitch
And you know its for real
Pussy niggas need to stay off in they lane
Sitting sidelines want to quarterback the game
Back seat drivers get to talking too much
But not when Im around cause they know they get touched
Its the city called Clutch and thats how we come through
Fake niggas runnin up What the fuck they gon do
PA trill nigga no Hilfiger
Put it on yo ass before when we still wheel nigga
New niggas in the game get your share
Long as you aint touching mine bitch I really dont care
Sets in the air twist yo fingers til they break
Trill recognize trill we never roll fake
For the game
Imma put it down my nigga
Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga
Boys talking down on a nigga
But since day one Ive been a killer
Mayne and aint nobody triller
Say aint nobody triller
Im a motherfucking killer
HTown in this bitch
And you know its for real
