Pourin mo bottles with my family and uh stackin up paper this paper high as the uhh you know Ozone you know yeah already You know so thats what its really about but uh all this old shit here If I wasnt rappin Id still be doin this old shit here you know This aint nothin but materialistic you know Knowledge is power Im about makin some money man you know Lets put this shit together get some real paper
I been a real street nigga way longer than I remember
Grindin on the block from January to December
I been in this game damn near since it began
With nothin but reputation and skills with my hands  hands 
Know a whole lotta fools started when I did
Known for bein fuck boys pullin some sly shit
Shoulda got laid out but somehow slid through
Extensions and bitches nigga I do not kid you  kid you 
Hit the highway with that work and got jammed up
Either tell on somebody or get you ten slammed up
He aint got the heart for it so guess what he do
He start recordin for that part mane and tell on his crew
He was the boss of the operation livin it large  large 
Now he tellin on the workers like they ass was in charge  charge 
Soon as the pressures applied you immediately switch  switch 
Man just do us all a favor and stop bein a bitch
You a bitch
As far as the police was concerned I had some problems with some laws now You know I run into wrecks with laws that didnt like what I stood for or didnt like rap music or just didnt like black folks in general Man the Lord was lookin after me this whole time Every time there was one that was dangerous that could get me I had five or six that was on my side that kept that kept that motherfucker in check man
I know alotta people locked up sittin in cells  cells 
Either for shit that they did or shit they didnt do well  well 
But for every cat thats locked up definitely guilty  guilty 
Theres another brother innocent in prison you feel me  feel me 
See this country we live in is really all about the bottom line
And when they see these young black men they see dollar signs
So prisons go from bein run by the state
To a private industry nigga tell me can you relate
See when education in the schools is geared for the testin
They cant keep up the fundin cause kids cant keep up the lesson
They get frustrated with the process and head to the streets
And find some alternative ways to get em somethin to eat
You got draconian laws in place thats mandated by the state
Probation terms you cant meet so you know you gon violate
Now you makin license plates scratchin the ten year itch
Your prison an industrial complex man stop bein a bitch
You a bitch
You see a lotta people in the penitentiary make statements like I aint never comin back here you know And I made statements when I was on the street that I was never goin So I dont say never anymore You dont know what you dont know whats in store What I will say is this Ima stay positive out here Ima do the right thing You know Im not gonna uh make no moves to put myself in the crosshairs where these people can just cross me out and 
This nigga told me he sold dope I said what do that mean
He said I sell you some white or I could sell you some green  green 
Gotta pocket full of pills and a cup of that lean  lean 
Man Im just keepin it trill I slap the hat off his bean  bean 
You niggas kill me runnin round talkin bout you sell drugs  drugs 
Moved a couple quarter pounds now you swear you the plug  plug 
Oh my bad you got them birds that fly away every month  month 
You keep them kis Nigga please why you tryna front  front 
See you can have all the coca leaves that they grow in Columbia
Then serve up all the snorters and the smokers and numb em up
With stacks up to the ceilin big doggin like you Marmaduke
Still wont see a tenth of the paper that big Pharma do
They dont care about the cure they just wanna sell a treatment
Keep you alive by keepin you high now thats some street shit
Usin peoples pain for profit gettin rich
Hey yo pharmaceutical companies stop bein a bitch
Cause you a bitch


But but at the same time I aint gon let nobody hurt me Im not gon let nobody hurt my family and I will kill you if you come around my kids with that bullshit
