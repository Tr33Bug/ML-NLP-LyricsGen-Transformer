Man freal I love bein from the Dirty South mayne
It made me the G I am today made me the hustler I am today
The grinder the baller the gangster I am today mayne
Lot of people got opinions and issues and problems with
What they see comin from the South and who doin what in the South mayne
But Imma tell you like this  FUCK YOU DAWG This the South nigga
We gon be here we been here and aint goin no motherfuckin where
Take it how you like it hate it or love it ho
Its that candy paint 84s belts and buckles chrome and grill
Leather seats stitch and tuck TV screens and wooden wheels
Suede roof neon lights Vogue tire swang and bang
Tops drop blades chop fifth wheel just hangin mayne
White Ts fitted hats Jordans under dickies  dickies 
That Swisher sweet cigarillos filled up with the sticky  sticky 
The fifteens bamn and the bass kickkickin
Cadillac dos slammin on them popos tippin
We aint trippin just flippin these haters dip when they see us  dip when they see us 
Cause they could never beat us best us or be us
