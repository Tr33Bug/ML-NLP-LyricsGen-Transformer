Arab Money  Remix  Lyrics
Ayo somebody tell Steven Spielberg and George Lucas thank you for directing this movie
Hashi Miki Hallah Means Its The Remix
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
Oh We gettin Arab money We gettin Arab money
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
Oh We gettin Arab money We gettin Arab money
Look you can talk about your money but I really dont care
Im into copping strange shit now Im trying to buy air  gasps 
As the first black nigga thats a rap trillionaire
I control heat Im about to buy the ozone layer
Im into copping minerals now diamonds and granite
So much paper I could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million Janets
Respect my accomplishments
As Salam Alaykoum Wa Rahmatoullah Wa Barakatouh 
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
Oh We gettin Arab money We gettin Arab money
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
Oh We gettin Arab money We gettin Arab money
Hamdoullilah with my billions pilin
Im just wyling bought 2 islands
Lakshmi Mittalin diamonds is salmon
Bout to buy 5th Ave bitch Im just stylin
Money insane while Jay was popping bottles
I was buying out planes just to fly around Spain
Fuck a recession Im still invested
Bout to buy Dubai and swim in a shark section
Fuck it the dark section

Bitch thats the Barack section
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
We gettin Bad Boy money We gettin Bad Boy money
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi LHalamine
Oh We gettin Arab money We gettin Arab money
You might catch me in a coup that cost 100 thous

Haka hashahi means shorty dumb ugly
Find me on the dance floor doing the duggy
