You be up on everything other hoes aint never on it

Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it till she give it up

Sex Love Pain baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I coul prolly sell a blank disc
When my album drop bitchesll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl the money aint the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes but I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiiiistle
Like the Andy Griffith them song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on

Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in ya slot till the nigga hit the jackpot

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She made me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
