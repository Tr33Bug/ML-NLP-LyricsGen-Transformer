Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up
Ready on the right  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the left  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the right  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the left  Fuck it blackout niggas
Oh my Lord  Lower the casket down  Down 
Sprinkle the ash or get your ass kicked pow  Pow 
Frown while I shit on your crown skip town  Town 
Ground zero Shapiro the king cash cow  CowCow 
Do I make em say Wow Strip  Ow 
Bow I sit with the pound Click  Blaow  Blaow
Click click  Blaow  Click  Blaow 
Stop traffic dropping them classics flip now
Bitches Im making them skip with thou
Art you dont really want start when I growl  Growl 
Rawr rawr rawr 
Let me come and mop up the knockoffs
When I pop off and never stop cause
When we do come through you better lock doors  Pause 
The wolves wanna eat peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke you see We cop raw
And if you aint had enough
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergngen fuck is going on
Back with the BA Baracus callous bang on another song
Imma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them nibble them like sunflower seed shells
See these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
And I shit on these males till its stinkin
Fouler than a weed smell nigga your tree fell
See how they Twitter Facebook and Instagramming an email
Talking Im sick I got them shook and I bang em at retail
Until they cripple see I cook like Im slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bred and whoop em and drag em like females  Gasp Oh see well these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up minus the details the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut its going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit like Im sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attacking
Like apes in the cut Im waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck like a bracelet  Fuck 
Its kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking til Im blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga  What 
Keeping em open and blacking until Im leaving em stuck
And got em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck
While Im chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up like boots
When Im pushing they face in the mud  Ahh 
Missiles I fling while I spit live wire
Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit thatll cause a quick worship
And gather around its certain this shitll splatter cliques
Painful and make em scatter  Blink 
Shameful the way I shatter  Split 
Shit apart it doesnt matter  Rip 
Your head up off your shoulders  With 
Bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break em and they know its  Classic 
And the way its going you could easily get your  asskicked 
See me and Shady together were crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake like a pastry bitch
We that sick  Like I come from Haiti
Im suggesting you pay me dont make me wanna spaz
Allala  Like Im a crazy Israeli  Bastards 
While I bite the beat up and Im starting to heat up  Yack 
Im chopping your foot off
Now its mine and Im putting my feet up  Black 
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And Im hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died nah
But the beat is fried
Yo
Ready on the right  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the left  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on 
Yo chill manchill 
Ready on the right  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the left  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the right  Ayo calm down nigga
Ready on the left  Fuck it blackout niggas
Apparently theres a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled Cause Im litnarrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Daviss driveway
With his personal memoir saying Hes bi
Waving a nine a picket sign egging his ride
Making him cry Rapethen arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
Yay YippeeKiYay cause here I
Wait did the world just pee on my leg
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take em back into time  Shady 
I stuck out like a sore thumb so I gave em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy youre wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste fuck making a bad impression
Thats the worst impersonation Ive ever seen and
Who raps nasally Eyes hazely
Rhymes crazily but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when hes speaking
What kind of stupid question is that
Hey Mrs Abraham Lincoln
Other than your husbands fucking brains that were leaking
Howd you think that play was this weekend
You aint the real Slim Shady sit your ass down faggot  Ew 
See me on a ballot Im running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch so Im just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age I ameight
So lets get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed covered in BandAids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this aint up for debate this is undebatable
Shady for president ho dont make me go take it back
To the days of old with Sway  Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me fools
I was rippin shop raisin hell up in Drews
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
Youre fucking with vets dog fucking internet bloggers
I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything Im an expert on everything Everything sucksplay the next song
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you Id be dead wrong
Son of God Im the SOG
Like a wet log pores never get clogged
Cause Im so full of selfesteem that I sweat fog
Yes yes yall  Wah steady on the left yall
Step off fore you get stepped on
Soft Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousyll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that youre visibly upset dog
Alert alert girlalert
Once you enter in my house of pain youre in a world of hurt
So  Jump around Jump Jump 
Get that ass shaking  Jump around Jump 
Came to hit you with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and  Jump 
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya
That on a grand scale I dont give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing
Yo chill manchill
