Now its finna be some energy we got the remedy
Im in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause its too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggas with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now Im back to beat you in the head Ill bring another banger
With my nigga Twist everything we do be up to wanger
You dont really really wanna see the way that I come
And Ill give it to you get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it till I make another nigga drop
I put my money on it homie Im the one
Go on here pick it up carry it the way you wanna carry it
Do whatever you wanna do
Show the competition how we gunning too when we coming through
Better never let a nigga never get in front of you
I wanna be up in the front wanna get in
The race Im so fast they call me Flash
Dont nobody really wanna
We can hit em like a couple of millimeters
Woopin a niggas ass
Skibbedy boop skibbedy bop skibbedy beep
Im skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit
Now I know a lot of yall been sitting waiting and wondering
Was we ever gonna do this shit
And then we came to hit em with another flow
Pop champagne celebrate and kill another show
Gotta campaign the greatest niggas yall already know that
To ever do this kinda shit Twista get em gotta go
Now I gotta ask yall
Can you keep up

Now try to catch me if you can
Can you keep up

Now try to catch  Now try to catch me 
Kill everybody cause Im gunning outta stress
If Im running outta breath he gonna pick up where I left off
Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness
Im a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look why dont everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause Imma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts
Now Im sailing on the beat the way Im sailing on the boat
The way I gotta kill em and the way I gotta flow
You dont really wanna test me boy cause Ill pop ya
When Im in the spot you know you cant leave
I spit every word till damn I cant breathe
You never heard till you nosebleed
Twista please

Now I gotta ask yall

Now try to catch  Now try to catch me 
You can talk about it with a bunch of people
They all say that Im a lyrical manifestation of rhythm
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang em
And get em and do it every single time I hit em
When I do it it just gotta be accurate
I am attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking in back and in front
Cause every time we in the place we fill it to capacity
I be coming with it he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid it gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey the prodigy and Imma be the one to prove it
Dont you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit in alphabetical order
We coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it
Can you keep up
Can you keep up
Can you keep up
Can you keep up
Can you keep up
Can you keep up
Now try to catch me if you can
Can you keep up

Now try to catch  Now try to catch me
