Doctor yeah
I think we got some shit for em  FLIPMODE 
Yeah Imma rub these sticks together
Check it and start a bonfire
And if you dont see it yall niggas cant fuck with our
Flipmode Movement  bounce in your truck to us
Yall get stupid  dont try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away yeah youll get carried away
Now Im subtle once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal ridin through every ghetto
Analyze the shit Im seein when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip struttin in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello when my Lambo is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ahJello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas Im a hustler nigga
Gnac guzzler nigga rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when its dark
Cause when I pull up and park is when Im makin my mark
See the facts that Im tryin to strive and capitalize in
Start to maxamimize and bbuild a entterprise
And whwhile Im stockin this bread keep ahstockin the lead
And leave a permanent dot on the top of your head
And if you dont see it yall niggas cant fuck with our
Flipmode Movement  bounce in your truck to us
Yall get stupid  dont try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away yeah youll get carried away
Ill Will Flipmooode
Im the Enigma there is none harder smarter
Martyr Godfather my entrance your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster catchy
Like sleepin under open windows thats drafty
Then wakin up my throat scratchy thats how I spit it nasty
They short a few inches North of a dwarf
My flows Murcilago ghostin them narcos
Toastin the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist Mt Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn no creepin on me whenever Im bent
My mind spray my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin keep pushin them drops
Nas runnin with hot Busta Bust we dont stop


And if you dont see it yall niggas cant fuck with our
Flipmode Movement  bounce in your truck to us
Yall get stupid  dont try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away yeah youll get carried away
Now Im hot and we runnin the block
Watch me run in your spot fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when Im cookin the pot
DRUGS BITCH I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot love totin the Glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop while I harvest the crop
My hot shit bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head kill a snitch for the feds
Lets go for the streets Im always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril
And if you dont see it yall niggas cant fuck with our
Flipmode Movement  bounce in your truck to us
Yall get stupid  dont try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away yeah youll get carried away
