ELE 2 The Wrath of God Lyrics
What up  What up 
Im sorry your time has come
No God is present today
They need to be afraid
You need to be afraid today because the God of justice is present now
Thats why he said Vengeance is mine
The battle is not yours the battle is the Lords and God has come
The battle is on and the plagues are coming down
And no Im not afraid but you need to be and especially when you see whats coming up
Because as a man soweth the same shall he also reap
And when you have done the evil that youve done to us
And done it to others
Did you never think that there would come a day
When you would have to pay for all that crap that you have done
Thomas Jefferson said it right brother
He said I had trembled for my country
When I reflect that God is just
And that his justice cannot sleep forever
Well his justice has awakened
And all over the world the nations are turning right before our eyes
And thats why Trump is saying We gotta make America great how when Again
Because shes not great today
People are not afraid
The world has taken enough of Americas evil so death is sweeter
The son been continuing to live under white supremacy and under tyranny
So in all I dont care nothing about them investigating me
Or arresting me or even killing me
But Ill tell you what
Ill tell you what Ill give you a little warning
You killed your last man when you killed Dr King you will not get that chance to do that to me
And if it pleases God that you do kill me right after you kill me all of you gon die
Cause Im not here by myself Im not here of myself
You can see that God must be backin me
Otherwise where would I get the strength to say and do what I do
No man its our time now
God has sent me to make you all feel the wrath and cometh
Im here to heat up and beat the street up Im back to punish
While Trump is present with a mouth screamin louder than trumpets
While you bow to the puppets Ima stand and stick around for the judgment
Use the world stage with a God crown to put it down for the public
The Earths in pain with a large pound of demonic indulgence
These devil consultants when our streets whine I read minds of the culprits
Kind of repulsive to expose em through rhymes that Im pumpin
Shits kind of disruptive when I talk now line up the subjects
Im tired of injustice from the popes politicians and judges
When you witness the abuse of power sometimes its seductive
Then I question God why create a creature that is so destructive
Hold all your grudges and focus while you create expenses
Every man is free of choice but no man is free of consequences
Hold your suggestions and listen closely I study lessons
Causing rain hail snow and earthquake and travel dimensions
The groundll rattle the Earth will rumble like a stampede of cattle
Eleven hundred twenty feet per second faster than sound travel
How many more protests How many more marches
Zero results its so grotesque dont even get me started
Then count on my mama she knows best fight for the dearly departed
God is the armor we so blessed lets zoom in on a target
From a certificate a merit down to a felony
For ones actions of these justices will reward a penalty
Pants too tight nigga its been part of the plan fool
They fucked around and made the demasculinization of man cool
Appreciate my pop never stop til the death of me
Raise the silly men and Ill never disgrace my legacy
Fuck following trends that dont make us men is the recipe
Care for your women your mother and children its necessity
In the last couple of years you niggas look like you need therapy
Mentally it appears as if the imbalance is chemically
How you gon try to stop Gods work
That could never happen even after Im back in the Lords dirt
Im here to present the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2
Im only here to present and bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2


Hail Busta Rhymes
I saw him at the Grammys
He spoke with passion  With passion with passion with passion
