Word up let me just fuck with your mind please  Ay 
Ayoyoyo Yo Let me fuck up your mind
On time showin you

Yeah I be the man comin off that be raw
Its Busta Rhymes givin you much more so
Yo yall  Yall  one more time I come  Come 
Knucklehead flow that make you act real dumb  Ha 
Yo  Yo  I burn your food like Florence  Hahaha 
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants  Haha 
Shut your mouth nigga dont you complain  Ha 
Fix you up mix you with cut like procaines
Oh Insane to your brain  Ha 
Right on your subconscious I leave my shit stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamozes
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus  Focus  while I display flows ferocious  Ha 
Weak niggas just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like Im hand to hand herb hustling  Ha 
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw  Ha 
Fuck what you heard you aint heard this before  Ha Ha 
I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw
I make sure everything remains raw

Yo When I step in the place I leave damages  Haha 
Nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages  Ha 
Yo watch me bring the newest recipe  Ha 
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy  Haha 
Let me hit you with flows  Ha  that come various  Hah 
Send you home and make you lie bout your alias  Hahhah 
Niggas cant see my routine
When I round up my Flipmode niggas and get cream
Hey you You know what the fuck I mean
Now Im on the scene stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now Im making you feel the extreme  Ha 
Til I black you out then turn on my real high beam
Oh shit Now I got your brains fried
Once you inhale smoke from my flow carbon monoxide
Use your imagination let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes Earth Wind  Fire  Haa 
Yo hit the dirt get on the floor
Im that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet  Yeah word up 
All movin targets  Word up  I got you open like supermarkets  Word up 
Yoyo theres only five years left  What nigga 
While niggas is scared to death they breathe they last breath  Ha 
Days of my life goes on  Ha  word is bond
I make you feel my proton neutron and electron
Yo I be the number one icon
Word to the holy Quran I rock on and on
On and on hey on and on and on
You wont understand when I form Voltron  Uhhuh
