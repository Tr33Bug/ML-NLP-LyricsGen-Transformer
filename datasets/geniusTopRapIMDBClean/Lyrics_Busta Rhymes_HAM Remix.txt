HAM  Remix  Lyrics
Excuse me
Tell me who you really really really think is more lyrical
Cause everytime I go somebody gotta see the medical
And everytime I come Im eating everything thats edible
And if you aint already know then who be more incredible
They wanna call me crazy like Im borderline cynical
Cause how I do it and I kill em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you dont like it then you can suck up on my genitals
Tatatatal tatatatatals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me you better salute the general
Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
Slurp slurp slurp slurp 
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that hes uncomparable again  okay
Killing everything I think we bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I dont even know what to call it just sound terrible
Lower down the coffin see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I aint hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my BI
When it come to other rappers niggas know that I be scarin them
Chop chop chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and throw a shot back put my feet up
Every beat that Imma touch Imma lace
Imma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When Im finished with this sissy Imma leave without a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM
