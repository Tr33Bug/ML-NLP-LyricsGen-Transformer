Yeah guess who it is
Ayo Dre I think they in trouble  Whoo 
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to em
Feels like a new day
Listen
Now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas aint got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you aint never even gotta question who
Cause you know that Im the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo
Then I come and I spit ccrazy shshshshit
And mmmmake nnniggas do exactly what I want em to
From my point of view instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second check it I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded thats why your shit is through  Whoo 
You fuckin idiot I dont think you get it
Im one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true
Now if you aint blind
And you aint handicapped in your vision
I think its simple enough think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause Ill hurt you and I will learn you a thing or two
And Ill hurt you and Ill finish your career for you Ill
Shit on a mic and doodoo
My doodoo you do not have a fightin chance to move
You were covered in my poopoo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid dodododododo ggggoobers are glued to you
You dont have a clue as to what were about to do do you
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an achew
You just made me sneeze Im allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
Youre probably wonderin why theres thunder
And everyone is runnin and duckin up
Under everything up on the block
Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted we might as well have a party
So gather round everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you aint got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet put something on and get to the club


Now if you aint blind
And you aint handicapped in your vision
I think its simple enough think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause Ill hurt you and I will learn you a thing or two
And Ill hurt you and Ill finish your career for you Ill
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin fools
Who got me rumblin dudes all the way down the block
Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin out of time see Im tired of all yall
MMMMumblin mmmumblin nnnigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while Ill keep on fumblin
While I got you trtrtremblin
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While Im climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
Now if you aint blind
And you aint handicapped in your vision
I think its simple enough think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause Ill hurt you and I will learn you a thing or two
And Ill hurt you and Ill finish your career for you Ill
