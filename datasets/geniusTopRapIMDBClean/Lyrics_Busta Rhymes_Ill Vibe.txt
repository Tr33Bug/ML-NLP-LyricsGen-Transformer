My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say Yo Im feelin these
Flows make you shit in your drawers change your dungarees
Smokin trees gettin cottonmouth wild munchies
Bounce down the block eat food at Luigis
Ass constipated  too much extra cheese
But anyway while I was coolin down at Luigis
I met some Siamese twins from overseas Lebanese
Lesbians with friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend she was straight BlackPortuguese
Pretty palmolivesoaped skin Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick that youd kill for to get between the knees
Yo I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fuckin house keys Rob me for my Gs
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my PhDs
Got yo face on camera  motherfucker say Cheese
You better get with your friends quick before I start to squeeze
Gettin caught up in that freaky golddigger Jamborees
I caught that ill vibe Tip Word Bus Yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip Yo word Bus Yo yo word  Uh 
Cause when Im in the place you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Bus Word Tip Yo yo word
That ill vibe Bus Word Tip Yo yo word
So when I hold the mic you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Bus Word Tip Yo yo word
Uh uh uhuh uh uh uh uh
I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Aint nothin sweet on the street for good deeds I compete
Come on complete and unique so get back in your stance
We enhance and were playin the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff lye
Positive to comply dont screw face and act rah
Progress dont fall back we cant have that
Ill hold your hand Black we cant wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward when I play this life
Cause this world is bound to get you like a doubleedged knife
In the jam we regulate cause we organize
Logically thinkin with Allahs enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto  Uh  got the gift of gab  Uh 
Peace to the West Coast and the East we fab
Oh need I make mention that the crew weve got
Make things get hot like the 44 shot  Blaow 
No we dont promote no guns but dont turn that cheek
In the world that we live kindness is viewed as weak
So we gotta stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends
Whys that  So we can live right until time ends
Yo whys that  Amalgamate so we can get these ends
Yo true that  Busta and Tip you know we make minds bend
