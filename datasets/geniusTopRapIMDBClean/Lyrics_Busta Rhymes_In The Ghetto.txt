You know my homey Treach from Naughty By Nature once said
If you aint from the ghetto dont come to the fucking ghetto
But Imma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto  my nigga Rick James

When I was a young boy growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble or anyone wholl give me some
I was young and crazy  In the ghetto 
Didnt know what my life would be  In the ghetto 
I was dumb and oh so lazy  In the ghetto 
Something had a spell on me  In the ghetto 
You all know what Im talking about  Talking about ghetto life 
Talking about ghetto life 
You all know what Im singing about  Talking about ghetto life 
Ghetto life  Talking about ghetto life 
In the ghetto  Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry  hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto but you cant take it from me
Gotta love it

In the ghetto  Thats where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard try to get money quick  In the ghetto 
Thats where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from  In the ghetto 
Thats where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could  In the ghetto 
Until your cake stacking shitll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood  In the ghetto 
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators til the lobby all smelly  In the ghetto 
Thats where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Aint nothing like the hood nigga I dont care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it


To my East coast niggas  rep your ghetto
West coast niggas  rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas  rep your ghetto
Down South niggas  rep your ghetto
To my East coast niggas  rep your ghetto
West coast niggas  rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas  rep your ghetto
To my Dirty South niggas  rep your ghetto
In the ghetto  Even though they act rude
Youll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street and live by the rules  In the ghetto 
Is where all of the hoods at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people I love that
Come mon
