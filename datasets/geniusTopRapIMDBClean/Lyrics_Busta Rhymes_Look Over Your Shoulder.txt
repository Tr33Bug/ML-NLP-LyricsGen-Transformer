Just look over your shoulders honey

Dont you know
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey
Yeah you need me  Woo 
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles nigga
I lead this new generation boy dont argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors authors and novel spitters
And its all for the literature
And its all for the hideous the nastiest flows the Chlamydia uh
I aint afraid to say I need you ah yeah  Hiphop hiphop hiphop 
I promise Id never leave you ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees my prototype for every
My share of deeds and RIPs
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen  Look over your shoulder 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Im posed to shine remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros the cons the diamond rings
Im full with time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines the gold the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals  Scream 
For hiphop look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks baby you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over its love
I know ya  Woo 
Dont you know baby
Dont you know baby
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey
Yeah yeah you need me  Woo 
Shhh look over your shoulder get me
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes I see the game is a little different niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way yo
Woahohohohoh  Woo 
I am the Buddha the Ali Baba the believerer maker
So pristine the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder the martyr the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga believe me
Graffiti your armor you heebie you jeebie
Bikini your broad up  You guinea pig 
See me now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak have a seat it was deep
I was sleep now the gods up hmm
Upholding the fundamentals while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder  Woo 
Dont you know baby  Ooh woah 
Dont you know baby  Mhm oh yeah 
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me  When you need me
