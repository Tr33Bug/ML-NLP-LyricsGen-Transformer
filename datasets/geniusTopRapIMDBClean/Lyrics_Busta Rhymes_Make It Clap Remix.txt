Back with the remix with Spliff and SeanAPaul on the corner
Cant believe when we do it we smack it down how we wanna
Keepin it comin keepin it goin cause we aint playin
Im talkin to all my people cause what Im sayin is
In case you aint know and in case you aint heard
And if you want us to set it just give me the word
This one goes out to my soldiers that be flippin them birds
To all my shorties wigglin they shakin they curves
We make it clap we make it clap we make it clap we make it clap
Poor snapper lookin at shorty shakin it and makin it clap
Booty big pokin out like twenties on the lap
When I give it to her shorty know how to throw it back
Booty bangin to the beat sometimes we overlapsing
Gal peel out your blouse and your tightjeans
Let me lick you down dip you with some icecream
Gal holla holla my name when I slidein
Thunderstorm rain sleet and lightning
Hold me tight feel the triniman grinding and grinding and grinding
Gal dip and bounce start whinning
You see Spliff Sean Paul and Busta Rhymes seen
Busta Rhymes We got dough  You could tell by what we driving
Busta Rhymes Lookin to chose  How its different and blinding
And blinding and blinding its like that make it clap now


We make it clap we make it clap we make it clap we make it clap
Flipmode a roll wid all di hottest set a gal dem inna di dance
And Dutty Cup we deyah mek di gal dem jump up and prance
Busta Rhymes and SeanAPaul di lyrical magician
There fi mek dem switch and jump up wave up dem hands
Flipmode a roll wid all di hottest set a gal dem inna di dance
And Dutty Cup we deyah mek di gal dem jump up and prance
Busta Rhymes and SeanAPaul di lyrical magician
There fi mek dem switch and jump up wave up dem hands
We make it clap deh keep it a clap gal wiggle yuh body
Mi waan fi see all a di style weh yuh a pack deh
Listen di lyrics a weh mi dun mi all a chat seh
Rotate yuh body then non stop like apache
Dawn and Karyn or Angie and Patsy
Inna di videolight just like a big sunday matinee
Nuff fi gimme di light mi blow di smoke like apache
Mashin up di dance and mi flatten it we make it clap
Who a call me the abominal snowman
Put it down make em say its such a phenominal show man
Unbelievable how you be stackin the dough man
When we rollin a thousand headcracks in a row man
The way we start the show and how we constantly flow man
Regular paper comin watch me properly blow man
Come on keepin it comin keepin it goin cause we aint playin
Im talkin to all of my people because what Im sayin is
We make it clap we make it clap we make it clap we make it clap
We make it clap we make it clap we make it clap we make it clap
