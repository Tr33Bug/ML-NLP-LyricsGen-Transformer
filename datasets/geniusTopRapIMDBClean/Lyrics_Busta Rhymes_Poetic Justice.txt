Look tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video Whats it Gonna Be
I had to say it wowing my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet why you doing this to me
At the time I couldnt believe we both were starring in this movie
Youre in my video you know a nigga loved it
I spent 24 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded see how the kid was on
First rap nigga album youve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is I cant believe this dream
Shot a solo scene I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together and we rubbed up on each other
But Im a little jealous Tip your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie from what I can account
You know what we be bout
Any time huh
Any place baby
Now you know at the time I was really
I really had my crush on shorty man you know what I mean
Yeah I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit you know what I mean
Ayo Kamaal yous a fucked up dude for doing that to me man
You broke my heart with that man
Come on Buss you know how many dudes say that to me Like
You know you foul 
Once a day girl truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didnt have much but dare said Im having her
Shorty was the joint heres my case and point
Me and Pac rollin Ls in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle butt to the makeup truck so ill I gave her my code
We kissed I took her control we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon we kept this good thing going sunset the moon it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen the scene was deaded but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going two pros with credit
A memorable summer in 92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly to that I had to answer
Negative but Id give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady I used to be her baby
Good Times they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice
At any time and any place I dont care whos around
At any time and any place I dont care whos around
In the thunder and rain you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
