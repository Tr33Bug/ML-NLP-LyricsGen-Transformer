Hope you can hear me loud and clear while I give you this talk  This talk 
I hope I leave enough fuel for all the minds I will spark  Will spark 
And while I come to share with you the realest words from my heart  My heart 
I hope youre ready for this truth cause its bout to get dark  Get dark 
Yo  Yo 
Yo  Yo 
Yo  Yo 
They say the world bout to end right  End right 
Well let me get this shit off before it do  Before it do 
Look I had to compile this shit in a song
Its so intriguing all this fuckin satanic shit goin on
Playin with symbols and signs devil worshippin
People talk like thy prayin to Lucifer but what happened to Jsus Walks
Yeah we have demented thoughts then you conversate with your savior
Askin for forgiveness while displayin blasphemous behavior
At first we seen it subtle now niggas display it major
And goin out they way like they doin Satan a favor
And gamble with they life like rattlin dice in a shaker
Another life forsaken turnin your back on your maker
Im only tryna cater to the facts and shit
Im seein a lot of questionable shit like the fuck these niggas believe in
But now we dont figure the same your music is lifeless
And your visuals lookin like rituals and sacrifices
Makin deals with the Devil in exchange to be the nicest
You dead like your flesh was eaten by maggots and lices
Weve all witnessed the change now nobody wanna be righteous
The days we live is dark and unquestionably a crisis
The Devil tried to plant the fear from when we was in diapers
And some grew up possessed staring in the Eye of Osiris
Now I know you see this shit while you sit and wonder what happened
Its strange how niggas brandish devil worship like a fashion
The signs of the times clouds from the heavens open
Where birds fall from the sky and fish die in the ocean
Now who you think you foolin We seein the way youre movin
I hope you take the time to start thinkin bout what youre doin
Youre playin with a match that can grow into an inferno
Undescribable the burn when the fires feelin eternal
I hope you document this and write it down in your journal
And read it back to yourself while overcomin your hurdles
Now trust me and be careful of who you let in your circle
Cause the Devil fucks a life and will breed the pussy thats fertile
I know its gettin cold and youre fightin the war internal
Body decayin turnin all grey and blue even purple
You portray a lotta shit with no rehearsal
But in life we dont rehearse what you do can come back and hurt you
And until then watch how the Devil will work through
Look at what youve become and what the Devil gave birth to
And when it hits the fan youll be wonderin where your folks went
Your niggasll disappear when the science gets kinda potent
Im just buildin I aint mean to give an earful
Just carryin out my duty everybody just be careful  Be careful
