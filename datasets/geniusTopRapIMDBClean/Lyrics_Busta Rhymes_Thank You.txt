Woo Welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money
And and you get Cash Money
Im Tunechi the boss
And live from the vault is BusaBus
Yeah yeah yeah yo
Swag mania pop that goes most carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close gross when we give them a dose
Got them ODing leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze take notes rock Rolls diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter who fucking with us
We coming to give them the shivers watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas get up when we show up
Uhh shit
Please dont throw up hold your liquor grow up
If you robbing niggas we gon show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars its the Rap Czar tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin my chagrin
You never win model thin walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on talk shit while we ball so whats cracking with yall
Native New Yorker the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily God Im stupid so undisputed
Act fool back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street blocking them off locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up maintaining composure stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles twenty waitresses bring them over
See how we light up shit nigga call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper cause you can get it
I want to thank You Heavenly Father
Yeah it feel good dont it Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good dont it Uhh
I want to thank You Heavenly Father
Ay I want to let yall know
Ay ay I want to let yall know this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to QTip


Settle up stiletto up saddle up and lets go
Good times only difference niggas making it though
Chatter is up peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain folding the ladder up
You dead and done rip up your paper cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page whether chopper or gauge
Youre just a single cause you wouldnt engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup you keep the goblets with us
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff
Beat him in the head boopbededeboff zippityboof
Beat him in the head again Stop killing me wolf
Whop beat a nigga till he drop piggitypoof
Ock see him he puss he dont want no problem with niggas
Fuck it lets get to drinking poison our livers
Dammit we sinners when me and Abstract together see we deliver
She got me touching it fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners pillar of this rap shit homie they know
Kill everything until its time for me to go
Thats when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding you should take it from me
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music iTune it YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
Its gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and inbetweeners blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas drink Aliz liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
Shes begging to eat us and her mans attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus were prone to handle
Were gentlemen
Not to mention were veterans second he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly you pelican idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless its never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons see how I come and bring out the betterness
Time is with it I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates sized private plane that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating see we all in this bitch like we aint never left
I want to thank You Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I want to thank You Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I know it couldnt have happened without You
Oohooh without You
Ooohh without You
Ooohh without You
