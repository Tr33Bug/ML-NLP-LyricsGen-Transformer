Yeah 96 for my Nostrand Ave niggas
My Fulton Street niggas  Hardcore for 96 
Dangerous MCs
Uhh  Check it out  uhh
Diamonds on my neck chrome droptop
Chillin on the scene smokin pounds of green
Oohwee you see the ugliest
Moneyhungriest Brooklyn LochNess
Nine millimeter cock test wan fi test
And the winner is not that thinner kid
Bandanas tattoos my fist never bruise
Land still cruise Frank White paid his dues
Ask whos the raw bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden now everybody Big Willie
Done did it come with it get your head splitted
Or get your neck slitted admit it you overdid it
Your shit it just aint got that loud
Gold tooth shine like tadow
Biggie Smalls the illest and how frays raise your eyebrow
By now you figure he talkin bout that nigga
But your weakass assumptions lead lead to dumpin
IV to pumpin youre feeling something
Catch my drift or catch my fourfifth lift
At least six inches above project fences
Turn meat to minces jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches your talk is senseless
Actor needs chiropractor for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your chatterbox
Dangerous youre not I gets down
Twist your body round and round upside down
Is the love really there  Is it 
Do a thug shed the same tear  Never know 
Throw your ice in the the air we here
And we all gon ball til the courts up here
Dont give a fuck what them niggas think we toting in here  Come on 
Is the love really there  Is it 
Do a thug shed the same tear  Never know 
Throw your ice in the the air we here
And we all gon ball til the courts up here
Dont give a fuck what them niggas think we toting in here
Uh smoke a little then we cut coke a little
And we skim a little off of the top
Taking you back when niggas use to snort coke
And toast through the hood and cry up to
Be the richest folk to float through the hood
Niggas doin real good it was evident in the testament
Was coke flow was good when Ronald Reagan was president
The say no to drugs slogan growing greatly irrelevant
Niggas gettin caught with bricks but still reaching the settlement
Niggas a get a one to three and come home in twelve months
Run up and take a niggas shit and eave em with twelve lumps
Ive never been so willin to put the thoughts of mo killin
Into manufacturing a flow so bone chillin
Icy with a pistol nigga
Shit glitter like ballroom chandelier crystal nigga
Stack money as we live life simple
In the corner of the club sippin on a Harveys Bristol nigga
Cmon modern day gangsta shit
And die slow as we give you niggas cancer shit cmon
Is the love really there  Is it 
Do a thug shed the same tear  Never know 
Throw your ice in the the air we here
And we all gon ball til the courts up here
Dont give a fuck what them niggas think we toting in here  Come on 
Is the love really there  Is it 
Do a thug shed the same tear  Never know 
Throw your ice in the the air we here
And we all gon ball til the courts up here
Dont give a fuck what them niggas think we toting in here
What you know about a nigga murder I got no chemical
Than courts in Miami water got shit federal
Time for that ass I rather go to Little Haiti
Buy some bricks and then stash it
Head back north cross 8 line to become the boss
Enforce the Laws 
You want some motherfuckin wholesale keep it steppin
No discount player no fuckin credit
No shorts I came to govern the laws  damn 
And you paying the price so you dying by the sword
You had a devil smokin with them rebels
We kill for money and power
Extortionin my own hood and that shits power
A black man crime call em a coward
A black man with knowledge we kill em tomorrow
Its sickenin thats how our people live
We disrespect our elders and curse our Church Members
