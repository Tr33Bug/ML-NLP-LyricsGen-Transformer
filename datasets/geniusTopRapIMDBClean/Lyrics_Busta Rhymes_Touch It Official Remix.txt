Touch It  Official Remix  Lyrics
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Ayo Swizzy
I told these niggas I was coming back to bust that ass
Okay Remix Part two
See now you know who the God be
Back runnin the city and you know who the squad be
Flipmode bitch look see aint nothin changed
Now Im back with the remix with the Queens of the game  Turn it up 
When you see me in the spot you niggas better respect it
Yall already know where I rep aint no reason to check it
And I know that you aint fuckin with me just for the record
So instead Imma let Mary J Blige come and set it
Now get low Mary 
Maybe you can guess who it is  Uh huh 
Mary J Blige Im bout to handle my biz  Uh huh 
Im on my grown woman still I rep for the kids
In every hood and all my peoples doin a bid  Turn it up 
Now you know whos really the queen deliver the mail
Seven hundred thirty thousand first week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch lookin all pale
While Im on a yacht overseas doin my nails
Get low Digga 
Now he sittin there lookin stuck
He thinkin cause he spent a little dough Im gon fuck
If money aint a thing Im sayin let a bitch know
Type to empty an account how far you willin to go  Turn it up 
Now he hoppin on the jet he aint wastin no time
Told me all expense paid anyplace I could find
Hit the islands in the winter trickin all on his dime
Aint a shorty in the world pussy better than mine they wanna


Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Bus this is serious man
Get low Missy 
Im jinglin baby go head mami
Dont I look charmin put your lips up on me
Kiss it touch it good yes I wish you would  Turn it up 
You like to see me when I dip baby dip
Dont it look like I got Beyonces hips
Lookin like I could be like Nia Long
Boy you smokin that Cheech and Chong
Get low Banks 
I know it feels like I been gone for a minute
But Im back chinchilla ice on with a fitted
Everybody talk money everybody gone with it
With that bowl of bread smaller than the arm of a midget
Turn it up 
And you know Im doin my thing its blue in the ring
If you had it like this you probably do it the same
But you wont cause you broke all you do is complain
After the club Imma put a few in the range and let em
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Get low Papoose 
Five boroughs of death you dont understand
I got New York City in the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis  Turn it up 
I got Staten Island on my pinky Queens on my thumb dude
The Bronx on my middle finger screamin fuck you
Rock ice in Manhattan so theres the ring finger
You know I had to keep Brooklyn on the trigger finger
Get low X 
Swizz is the monster X is the beast
Fuckin with Bus everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets Im tired of talkin to yall niggas
Im a stick a fork in yall niggas  Turn it up 
When I hit em man that truck come get em man
Fucked up how I did em man
Aint no remorse for the corpse truth is
Cant ID the body nigga toothless
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Get low Bust 
You see me you love me the streets declare me God of the hood
You niggas is watchin and wishin you could
Be claimin the throne the way I got it lock it mufuckers
Whats good you tryin to stop it Im wishin you would  Turn it up 
Cause then Im glad to hit you with the fact that the God is immortal as spit
The way I be doin historical shit
In case you and your niggas act like you aint know when Im informin your click
I take your bitch while Im performin my shit
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it

Turn it leave it stop format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it stop format it
