Touch It  Remix 20  Lyrics
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it start  format it
Touch it bring it pay it watch it
Turn it leave it start  format it
Oh now you know who the God be
Back runnin the city
And you know who the squad
Flipmode
Look see aint nothin changed
Back with the remix
With the Queens
TURN IT UP 
When you see me in the spot
Better respect each other
Yall already know where Im rep
Aint no reason to check it
And I know that
You aint messing with me
Just for the record
So instead
Imma let Mary J Blige
Come and set it
Get Low Mary 
Maybe you can guess
Who it is
Mary J Blige Im bout to
Handle my biz
Im on my grown woman
Still I rep for the kids
In every hood and all my peoples
Doin a bid
TURN IT UP 
Now you know
Whos really the Queen deliver the mail
Seven Hundred Thirty Thousand
First week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch
Lookin all pale
While Im on a yacht overseas
Doin my nails
Get Low Digga 
Now he sittin there lookin stuck
He thinkin cause he spent
A little dough Im gon fuck
If money aint a thing
Im sayin let a chick know
Type to empty an account
How far you willin to go
TURN IT UP 
Now he hoppin on the jet
He aint wasting no time
Told me all expenses paid
Any place I could find
Hit the islands in the Winter
Trickin all on his dime
Aint no alpha in this world
Who is better than mine
They wanna
Im jinglin baby  Go Ahead Mami 
Dont I look charmin
Put your lips up on me
Kiss it touch it good
Yes I wish you would  TURN IT UP 
You like to see me
When I dip baby dip
Dont I look like I got Beyonces hips
Lookin like I could be Nia Long
Boy you smokin that
Cheech and Chong
I know what it feels like
I been gone for a minute
But Im back
Chinchilla on with a fitted
Everybody talk money
Everybody gon live it
That bowl of bread smaller
Than the arm
TURN IT UP 
And you know Im doin my thing
Its blue in the ring
If you had it like this
You probably do it the same
But you wont cause you broke
All you do is complain
After the club Imma put a few
In the range and let em
Five boroughs of death
You dont understand
I got New York City
In the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist
And let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world
With a New York Nemesis
TURN IT UP 
I got Staten Island on my pinky
Queens on my thumb dude
The Bronx on my middle
Finger screamin F you
Rock Ice in Manhattan
So theres the ring finger
You know I had to keep
Brooklyn on the trigger finger
Swizz is the monster X is the beast
Fuckin with Bus everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets
Im tired of talkin to yall niggas
Im stickin a fork in yall niggas
TURN IT UP 
When I hit em man
That truck come get em man
Roughed up how I did em man
Aint no remorse for the corpse truth is
Cant ID the body nigga toothless
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up wheel up bring it back come rewind
Powerful impact BOOM on the track
Contact  Shady  Guess whos back
Everybody in the place take a look at the face
I disappeared without a trace hes a little high aint he
New year ooh yeah whos here new gear
Full gear spookier AAH AAH AAH
Im bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I dont even know why Im screamin AAH AAH AAH
And Im screamin on the wrong part of the song
Bus you did it again lets turn it up more
Lets turn it up loud let em know we aint playin
And I dont even know what the chorus is sayin
Touch it bring it pay it 
Just give me the beat Bus with THE BIG BANG
