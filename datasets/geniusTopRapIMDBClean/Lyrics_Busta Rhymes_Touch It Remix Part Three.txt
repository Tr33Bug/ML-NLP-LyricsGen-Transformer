Lloyd Banks 
Aiyyo Swizz  It aint over  we sone created another epidemic for the streets nigga
Just when yall thought it was safe to poke your head out again lets go
I know you thought we was finished Flipmode bitch
GUnit  Yeah Street Sweet
REMIX PART THREE REMIX PART THREE REMIX PART THREE
Aiyyo just imagine if they cut the lights off in the club
Busta Rhymes 
Get low Banks  Who you know that got a flow this sick
Pump shotty nobody can hold his click
Them hoes eyein they probably on my dick
The chocolate would look good in my all white whip  TURN IT UP 
AND YOU KNOW I STAY WITH THE SKITS SO DONT EVEN TRY
KISS YO ASS BYE BYE YOU BE ALONE IN THE SKY
AND THE FIRST HUMAN BEING NOW TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
AND I BE LOW IN THE BM ON MY WAY OUT NY
Get low Banks  I know it feels like I been gone for a minute
But Im back chinchilla Ice on with a fitted
Everybody talk money everybody gonna run
With that bowl of bread smaller than the arm of a midget
TURN IT UP  AND YOU KNOW Im DOIN MY THING ITS BLUE IN THE RING
IF YOU HAD IT LIKE THIS YOU PROBABLY DO IT THE SAME
BUT YOU WONT CAUSE YOU BROKE ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN
AFTER THE CLUB Im A PUT A FEW IN THE RANGE AND LET EM
Touch it  bring it  babe  watch it 
Turn it  leave it  stop  format it
repeat 4X
Busta Rhymes 
Get low Papoose  Papoose Papoose had to get on this club banger
Smack you in your mouth make you swallow your pulp razor
Pop a couple bottles laugh about it with Bus later
Bare witness Im the young savior  TURN IT UP 
I GOT STATEN ISLAND ON MY PINKY QUEENS ON MY THUMB DUDE
THE BRONX ON MY MIDDLE FINGER SCREAMIN FUCK YOU
ROCK ICE IN MANHATTAN SO THERES THE RING FINGER
YOU KNOW I HAD TO KEEP BROOKLYN ON THE STRINGER FINGER
Get low Pap  Five boroughs of death you dont understand
I got New York City in the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis  TURN IT UP 
I FLIP THE MAG AND GET THE CLAPPIN IF IT HAPPENS RIP HIS JACKET
SPLIT HIS BACK AND LIFT HIS HEAD Im GETTIN AT HIM  Ha 
PICK UP A DIFFERENT MAG AND THEN ATTACK HIM WHEN I GRAB HIM SHIT IS BLASTIN
WITH A PASSION GET IT CRACKIN THE ASSASSIN YOU LET EM


Touch it  bring it  babe  watch it 
Turn it  leave it  stop  format it
repeat 4X
Get low Bus  You see me you love me the streets declare me God of the hood
You niggas is watchin and wishin you could
Be claimin the throne the way I got it lock it mufuckers
Whats good you tryin to stop it Im wishin you would  TURN IT UP 
CAUSE THEM Im GLAD TO HIT YOU WITH THE FACT THAT THE GOD IS IMMORTAL AS SPIT
THE WAY I BE DOIN HISTORICAL SHIT

The street with the heat now turn up the beat until you go deaf
I eat a nigga food until nothin left  TURN IT UP 
NOW THE WAY Im KILLIN AT THIS MASS LIKE Im DOIN   
RESPECT IT YOU BETTER GET TO SALUTIN ME WHEN YOU SEE ME
LLOYD BANKS PAPOOSE AND BUSTA BUS YEAH Im GREEDY

Touch it  bring it  babe  watch it 
Turn it  leave it  stop  format it
repeat 4X
