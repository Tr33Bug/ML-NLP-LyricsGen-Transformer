Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
See a nigga survived the worst but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and Im so victorious
Take a look Im a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin the win better believe Im so notorious
You know that Ive been bout my bread
Even though we rappin now  Yes 
And yes we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin now  Uh 
Superseded every one of my little struggles and  Huh 
Failure has never ever been an option  trust 
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And Im about to take the hood shoppin get it
Oh together we made it  You see we did it niggas 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
Cmon  Forever we waited  ha ha 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road  To the riches 
On the road  To the ghetto 
On the road  In the projects to this bangin instrumental 
On the road  ride with me 
On the road  we come to get it 
On the road  yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin rejected
It seemed like nothin we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said were pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just the way to connect it
I was fightin through every rhyme tightenin up every line
Never restin the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told em to let it ride
Sing it yeah
Oh together we made it  You see we did it niggas 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
Cmon  Forever we waited  ha ha 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road  To the riches 
On the road  To the ghetto 
On the road  In the projects to this bangin instrumental 
On the road  ride with me 
On the road  we come to get it 
On the road  yeah yeah yeah 


Look in case you misunderstand exactly what Im buildin
Shit that I can leave for my childrens childrens childrens children
Now on my wakeup I smile to see how far Ive come
Fightin for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin my muscles son
To countin money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream you see we finally did it
Lets make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it
Oh together we made it  You see we did it niggas 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
Cmon  Forever we waited  ha ha 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road  To the riches 
On the road  To the ghetto 
On the road  In the projects to this bangin instrumental 
On the road  ride with me 
On the road  we come to get it 
On the road  yeah yeah yeah 
Oh
