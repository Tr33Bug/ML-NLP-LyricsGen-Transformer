Turn ma fuckin beat up
Turn ma fuckin beat up  Turn my mic up too 
Turn ma fuckin beat up  Remix 
SAK PASE 
Uh yeah we can do anything  Remix 
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
Ill be chillin I aint worried bout anything  Remix 
Why stop now I can have everything  Part 2 
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Why stop now I can have everything
Ayo let me roll with my sleeves up real quick lets go 
Find the nearest exit
Everybody better find the nearest exit
See the way I kill every nigga in this bitch
Somebody please tell me where the forensics
Everybody know the God real
Looking like you work in a garage sale
While you hating on one of the greatest
I be in the crib digging in ya moms tail
Big old bitch Avatar
I got her sitting on the dick like a handle bar
Shawty love the way I beat it up
Beat the pretty pussy with a battle scar
Let a nigga eat it up like a caviar
Got her buggin now she wanna carry on
YMCMB gods of this rap shit that we are
But ya girl look like a little amateur
Wednesday night at the Apollo
But its okay cause she got a long neck
And I got a dick size only a giraffe could swallow
Sent her back cause they gonna ask tomorrow
Why baby girl did you have to gargle
And if I could have everything do me a favor
Send me 100 more bottles hahaha
Yeah we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
Ill be chillin I aint worried bout anything
Why stop now I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Why stop now I can have everything
Ayo let me reintroduce yall to my beautiful twin
Oh my God Missy

Hit em with hits in the head I spit
This shit is so ridiculous sick

Eat an emcee like Im finna have a feast

Hold up wait for it catch up like fake blood
