The Flipmode is the squad that controls your set
WooHah Got you all in check
We on some outta space shit like you watch Star Trek
WooHah Got you all in check
You better keep my music bangin til it disconnect
WooHah Got you all in check
Architects gettin money let me cash my check
WooHah Got you all in check
Busta Rhymes up in the place with the ODB
Busta Rhymes you rhyme first yeah you rhyme after me  Oh word 
The ODB was nominated for a Grammy
Congratulations Bust with your solo LP
Putting scratches in my lyrics like my name was Kid Capri
Blow up the spot regardless of your nationality
And Im the Dirty Dawg cant fuck with me
This this this nuh took Mariah on a fantasy
Yo I had a wet dream that I was bonin Jody Wately
Doin what children aint allowed to see
But we bout to blow up the spot momentarily
WooHah Ran stupid all throughout the country
And for youse to kill me That wasnt meants to be
I know it feel good Motherfuckers want the recipe
And whose the vigilante in the place to be
The ODB Busta Rhyme real qualityyy
My top priority is to be the voluntarily
Nigga that rip your ass for free  Ha Haha Ha 
Yah yah yahhh yah
Yah yah yahhh yah
Ooh baby I like it raw get with me
Baby its pure ecstasy
Yo everytime I design a flow you see in 3D
Flawless victory knock a nigga out One two three
Cause Flipmode is the squad that controls your set
WooHah Cause I got you all in check
We on some outta space shit like you watch Star Treeek
WooHah Got you all in check
You better keep my music bangin til it disconnect
WooHah I got you all in check
Architects gettin money let me cash my check
WooHah Got you all in check
Inhaling dibbydibbydah inhaling then I pass a lot
Inhaling let me get more hot inhaling represent the spot
A mad squad when it comes to the art of rapping
I gotta keeep your hands clapping
Yo when you look at me inhaling the type of guy I be
Im a dirty dancer making girlies panties move
Let them fly so I can blast up the twat
Girlies watch sayin God stop getting me hot
Niggas talk shit yo kill the yapping
Word is bond baby tell me how you look so smashin
Now I got your head hurt you need an aspirin
Bashin your head in the wall time for some action
If you want a small piece well heres a fraction
Of shit that will bust your head quick peep the transaction
Of how we keep motherfuckers constantly crashin
They flyest whips think no shifts now whose the champion
I bring the wicked flow like the latest fashion
Satisfaction baby keep your camera flashing
I was busting the sperm cells mixed with Old Gold
Fungus mold foreyoushouldlist slum gold
Played for a wild Irish rose
Fat ass nigga slim bitch with no clothes
In the backseat of a back sixtynine Oldsmoz
Are your soles and toes in the windows Oh my hoes
Hey believe me when I say so
Youre in need ofarealnigccacacacrambone
The Flipmode is the squad that controls your set
WooHah Cause I got you all in check
We on some outta space shit like you watch Star Treeek
WooHah Got you all in check
You better keep my music bangin til it disconnect
WooHah Cause I got you all in check
Architects gettin money let me cash my check
