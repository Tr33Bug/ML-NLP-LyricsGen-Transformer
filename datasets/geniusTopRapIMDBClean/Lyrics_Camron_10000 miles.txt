Lookin up out my Benz
Killa Cam nah nah nah
Killa Cam nah nah nah
I need to say sorry yall already knew it
But my pride wont let me do it though
Heard that its pride wont let me do it though
Best girl in the world I mightve blew it
Like a small condom Ill get through it though
Ill get through it though
Heard that we can do it though
I cheated another one in the books for me
She clean roll weed and cook for me
Aint hear from the kids she would look for me
Now she so mad that she wont even look at me
Damn iPhones and cameras nights in Atlanta
Tried to bring you gifts she said You aint Santa
Im just showin manners she reachin for the hammer
She aint got ears they replaced with antennas
Hard to believe I messed trust up
No good or bad just tough luck
I looked her in the eyes like I fucked up
Gripped up my life had to monetize
Made mistakes I apologize
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Dinner movie a date you know maybe that
Some dudes relate I want my baby back
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I tell you a million times Im sorry
Wild life right here no safari
Im dressed up I fess up
I messed up bad
Later on that night I bought a kilo
To sell it or sniff it man I dont know
Cause I got pulled over by popo
Oh noooooo
Daytoday life dealin with reality
Lawyer got me off on a technicality
All I think about we was Mickey and Mallory
Nothin left but increase my salary
Uh now money is the focus
Hustlin president POTUS
Anything else right now is bogus
Real estate opened up I gave notice
Murder was the case Calvin Broadus
Blue magic though hokus pokus
They forgot that my dopes the dopest
Made a mil in one week yeah its poppin
Retail therapy out shoppin
Pulled off the lot top droppin
No legs on the car but its boppin
Speakers in the door so its knockin
I got all the keys so Im locked in
Felt above the law Johnnie Cochran
And Im off the rebound Rodman
Woo Lets get this money baby
Lets get this money baby
Aint nothin funny baby
Lalalalala


Later on that night I laid in my bed
Them birds was chirpin so Im countin up bread
But I cant get her up out my head
Oh man  damn
