And what else  and I got hella gear
My earring is nice the price
Three town homes in Delaware
Uh tomato Porsche looking like tomato sauce
Hip hop hooray I got to get that yayo off
Thats blocks to the ave cops come blocking the ave
I put the Glock in the stash slabs and tops in the trash
Still stop and I laugh ma get them rocks in your ass
The rest Twat in ya bag dag hop in a cab
Play you for what You gonna play yourself
Aint nobody gon pay you like you pay yourself
And my way to the wealth was SK AK mayday payday
Dog dont play with your health
Mami she open she open

Grab her rope em and dope em
Oral choke em and choke em
I flip bundle to bundle trying to double my double
At the same time 
But the cops say Im 
I get fresh from Yankee stadium to the garden
I beg your pardon stop it

Pants shirts scarf phone if you check it
Get the scoop on the cologne belt and shoe section
Fur for fur baby baby youll go stir crazy
Got that David Yurman burning the bird gazey
Youll get hurt play me
Burp let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt want my chirp lately
I know some RNs that still strip
When I and this real dick in the clinic
Nurse suit and heels shit
Better than college after that students home
At least after your bid aint no student loans
To pay back jack ask What do you condone
Hit towns with coke a 45 blue as chrome
They done juiced my dome knock knock are you at home
Im Macaulay girls call the crib and ask are you alone

I flip bundle to bundle trying to double my double
