Ayo come on home with us man
Harlem World USA man
Take a walk with us on our block man
See how we live
Dipset
Yo yo uh
Come on home with me early 90s
It wasnt pearly and shiny I was certainly grimy
Cause I aint have no fresh clothes
Or jewelry with the XOs my house had asbestos
Im fixing up a sixty pack
Where the kitty cat Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home with me where my mother found my crack platter
Threw it away so I snapped at her back slapped her
She picked up a bat like McGwire
For that matter hit me I was back at her
Come home where I ducked the DTs
Line around the corner but Im getting the free cheese
Come on home with me where I stand on my post
Playing my toast dinner there was mayonnaise and toast and pepper
Many nights I done slept with a heifer
Any beef came it left on a stretcher Killa
Come on home with me where they rap and be flossin
Where I begged Kim to have the abortion
Money bring back extortion caution
Aint no tracking an orphan relax in a coffin
And the bitch know Im serious cause Im never scared ma
Unless you miss your period so come home with me
Where the girls wanna come home with me
They say Cam if you need dome hit me  Fuck out of here 
Love to see the chrome whippy
The car a quarter mil on the wheels I done blown fifty
Dice game blown fifty Jones loan sixty
Head cracks thrown swiftly took it home with me
So come home with me where a nigga make star bucks
Im about to cop a Starbucks I reversed all my hard luck
Now Im at the dealer buying cars trucks
Aw shucks
Come home with me
To the streets the slums the ghetto thats home to me
Every night my girl crying Come home to me
No come home with me where its so many cops
The block is boiling and the food is spoiled
But that pot with the rock is boiling
Same pot mommy cook with left the oil in
Come on home with me where these bitches is frauds
Niggas dont listen to broads
They have you sitting in court for kids that aint yours
Come home with me where every day the Glocks go pop
Where the front doors broke and them locks dont lock
Come home with me dog where the beef is seeking
Kids dont trick or treat they get tricked for treating
Come home with me where the pistol squeezing
Niggas twist ya cheek in rip to pieces
Our kids get even come home with me
Dont leave your condoms behind
Cause them bitches leave the martians behind
Pray to God that Im fine come on home with me
Come on zone with me come on walk through this cold city
Where these kids need food  Thats right 
Niggas need guidance and bitches need rules
Come on home with me where niggas living off they last bucks  What else 
Phone is off rent is backed up  Uhhuh 
Come home with me niggas strap up
Hit the street gats up clack up and get they money back up
Come home with me every block got a crack in it
Every hallway got a nigga with some crack in it  What else 
Dont get trapped in it
Uh come on home with me
Where my parents would um
Leave me alone so early I was free to just roam
Seven keys to the home Eleven trees to the dome
Thirteen I ran the streets with the chrome  Boom 
Come on home with me where the buses dont run
And my dogs stay busting they gun  Brra 
Think that getting caught by Justice is fun
Keep a blade up in they gums
This is Harlem where the fuck is you from
Uh come on home with me
Every few minutes was a knock at the door
Fiends coming copping the raw clothes kicks socks on the floor
Mommy like Be quiet cause I really think them cops at the door

Come on home with me where grandmothers is thirty
One gram of that butter is thirty
Four grand is my cut from the birdy
School cutting it early
Dont stutter motherfuckers you heard me uh
