Curtis  50 Cent Diss  Lyrics
The truck or the Lambi Cam be stuffed in some candy
This aint a label Curtis Im fuckin with family
See my squad done waited right behind them bars thats gated
Hopped out the casket bastard reincarnated
Yep so have a seat this gon be a masterpiece
I have to beef he look like a gorilla with rabbit teeth
Bugs monkey act hard with a crack god that mack broads
That video aint Queens its your backyard Connecticut 
Curtis its messin with your head bad
You that mad but dag thats security with red flags
You bangin five shootin rocks and signs my way
Fine play I keep it neutral but my familys nine trey
Soo woo my Aalikes that stay to fight from day to night
When I smack the Lighty brothers Dave and Mike
Huh believe me ho you cant be me though
Jimmy aint the President he the CEO
Zeek is the President Its evident hell cock and spray
Santana underboss I sign off like Dr Dre
I fuck with Zoe Pound too what up Sak Pase
Grab the coco my cock so zozo rockaway
I extended the clip never be friends with you pricks
Shout to a real Queens dude you know Kenneth McGriff
He ran from police you run with police
You aint from Southside you bout to get ya mouth wired
Curtis  Rewind it DJ 
Curtis  You aint 50 50 Cent from BK 
Curtis  Yep he deserve to be nervous 
Curtis  Damn show some courtesy Curtis 
Curtis  Uh Rewind it DJ 
Curtis  You aint 50 50 Cent from BK 
Curtis  Yep he deserve to be nervous 
Curtis  Damn show some courtesy Curtis 
Aiyyo check the tail girls break they neck and nails
Just for me to sex they tail but lets talk record sales
Juelz eight hundred Jim fo hundred
I copped more cribs more cars got more blunted
Yeah I rocked The Roc so stop it doc you coppertop
My niggas watch em ball your dudes I watched em flop
Yep so beware dog Im tryin to be clear
Banks bricked Mobb bricked Buck aint been out for three years
Let me be fair I hop up off a sweet Leer
Right to Lennox aint no sand but Im on my beach chair  What up Hov 
These are not tales and dog we not frail
You dont club in New York you party out in Scottsdale
Huh I cant be clowned beef dog God damn we down
How you livin You live in Tysons hand me down
Plus you cant be found Ill have you taped gagged and bound
Ask around I never liked the circus so I clap a clown
Aiyyo man thanks for all the shoutouts for my dudes
You keep shoutin em I love it baby them my brothers
I aint hear you say Banks name in a minute
Talkin bout Koch a graveyard you just signed off for Prodigy to go there
Aiyyo P he a sucker get away from that dude B
You aint got no swag with buck teeth
You know how you aint got no swag
Whoever let you sign off on them GUnit tank tops is stupid just like yo dumb ass
Them is brassiere tops whoever wore that outside was a homo gay ass nigga
Aiyyo stop callin my probation officer to why you talkin bout my probation
You tryin to get me locked up Curtis
Aiyyo Curtis you really tryin to get me up
You said somethin about my probation on your song
Next thing I know my probation officer call me today said he need to see me
Aiyyo if I go to jail Curtis put me in jail
Its crazy I gotta go report to probation next Thursday
I aint supposed to report for three weeks
I gotta go Thursday and he mention my probation
Aiyyo let me get off this mic now cause I know how you get down rat ass nigga
Thats true story thats not even a joke Im dead seriousProbation
