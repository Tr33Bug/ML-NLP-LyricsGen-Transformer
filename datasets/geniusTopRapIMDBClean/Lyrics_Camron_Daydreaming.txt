Look at my mind
Floating away

What I do Turned around asked you to cook me 
Boof my work with a jerk to tell the truth it hurts
Cause you even asked me to come through to church
What I do Act second rate
I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate
But Im ready to change you got my heart plus you smart and the sex is great
And you hate rap I like that girl
I argue with Keisha I aint like that girl
You jumped right out the car to fight that girl
You beat her  you aint have to bite that girl
And my baby got the best thighs
And my whip she aint never got to test drive
Copped her the X5
You paid attention when no one acknowledged me
This is my public apology holla B
