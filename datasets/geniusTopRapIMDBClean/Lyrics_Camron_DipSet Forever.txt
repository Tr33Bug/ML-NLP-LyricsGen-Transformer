How long we gon have this shit on lock man
Yes sir you gave me the right track Kanye
Listen I been coppin them Ps and
Maybe thats part of the reason
I feel like a boxer bobbin and weavin
But Im gettin head shes bobbin her weave and  yes sir 
Im grabbin her neck to stop her from breathin
Ima wild out until I part with my breathin
Until Im sparked up and leakin part of the cement
I need somethin pure like from the Garden of Eden  why 
Wouldnt mind makin her part of my achievements  what happened 
Cause when music discourage my pride  who was there 
Zeek the only one with courage to ride
The rides so dirty inside seems like we were playin in mud
Hazin it up grams gauge and a snub
Who ill A check for two mil
And a cheap case defaced blue steel true skills
I got stories that my soul can sing
Flip water like Poland Spring and Ima hold them things
Forever
Thats right yall
Diplomats yall we here
Forever yeayeah
Thats forever man
Look talk to em
Look my fella said you been coppin a lot
Latest caper Propellers on top of the drop
But fuck it who ever thought I would rock at the Roc  Killa 
Top a top on top of the top
But yo  nothing definite I chop up the rocks
And I stop up the drop Blocka Blocka the block
Hello mate yellow tape helicopter your spot
What you wanted is not what you got
And I pop up them cops
Cause dog it aint about Cam  it aint about me 
I got a son homeboy its about Cam  for that 
Its about being bout It
If youre not youre ass backwards
My mathematics cause cash matters  thats important 
Little niggas need to sit up and breathe
If the town too hot get up and leave
Niggas always got a trick up their sleeve  always 
Nigga like me  I always got a brick up my sleeve
And thats forever Killa
