To the day of a reign I aim and flame for your lame
The clips change obtain bricks exchange bricks
Bricks exchanged throw the kid some change
Look homeboy I aint trying to get no names
Must of sniffed cocaine looking at my Diplo chain
The biscuit turn you to bisquick mixed with shrimp lo mein
Old ladies just stop and say its yo thang

First kiss my ring ohh no well kiss my ass
Back in my zone homes get ya mind right
The 23 or 32 nah its the twilight

Ten in the hood ten thats besides night
And they tied tight my family ties tight
Ten town 200 bricks forget 5 mics
