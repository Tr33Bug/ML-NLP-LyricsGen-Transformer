Ugh Killa
Baby
Kanye this that 1970s Heron flow huh
Yeah lets speed it up
Ugh Im back in ugh ugh
They dont know we finna kill the game this year
Killa Ye Cmon
Ayo street mergers I legislated the nerve I never hated
On murders premeditatedabsurd I hesitated
Observe cock and spray hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer stupid stay in a suckers place
Pluck your ace take your girl fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking kitchen orders that Im cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You wouldve thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hardtangled grammar
Interior inferior StarSpangled Banner
Car game bananas mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere like the car came with hammers hes back
They trying to say he  Im down down 
I hear niggas saying he  Im down but not out 
But our flow is the truest  Oh  the games in the nooses  No no 
Our girls is the models  Oh  they coochies the juiciest  Ooooh 
Yeah they say he  Im down down 
Yeah they say he  Im down but not out 
Cause Im back on my grind  Oh  money back on my mind  No no 
Ye and Killa Cam the world is mine  Oooh 
I treat bitches straight up like Simon Says
Open vagina put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones hon lime and red
You got pets Me too mines are dead doggy
Fox minks gators thats necessary
Accessories my closets Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what Dog Id rather shoot
I go to war old Timbs battered boots
Hand grenade goggles and a parachute
Yall dont even know the name of my flip
It was Touch Me Tease Me when Case was the shit
You dont know bout the cases I get
Court case briefcase suitcase cases of Cris oww
They trying to say he  Im down down 
I hear niggas saying he  Im down but not out 
But our flow is the truest  Oh  the games in the nooses  No no 
Our girls is the models  Oh  they coochies the juiciest  Ooooh 
Yeah they say he  Im down down 
Yeah they say he  Im down but not out 
Cause Im back on my grind  Oh  money back on my mind  No no 
Ye and Killa Cam the world is mine  Oooh 
Ugh Killa yo yo ayo

Gatortoed Mauri three quarters skyblue
Look at mami eyes blue 52
I approached herHi boo how you
Pony skin Louie Oh you fly too
You a stewardess Good maI fly too
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake Nah Im in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake shaking the Jakes
Kill you shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture though you still taped in a lake
Im laughing you couldnt wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said I told you so
Ugh Killa
They trying to say he  Im down down 
I hear niggas saying he  Im down but not out 
But our flow is the truest  Oh  the games in the nooses  No no 
Our girls is the models  Oh  they coochies the juiciest  Ooooh 
Yeah they say he  Im down down 
Yeah they say he  Im down but not out 
Cause Im back on my grind  Oh  money back on my mind  No no
