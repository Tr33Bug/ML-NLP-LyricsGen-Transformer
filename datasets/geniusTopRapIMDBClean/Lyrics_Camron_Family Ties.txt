Man I spit that pimp talk you hang out where the pimps collide
Its a pimp in my ride no need to pimp the ride
This aint the pimp camp pimp limp pimp stance
Pimpslap a slim tramp order steak shrimp scamp
Okkkay you gggay
Ill souffl ya toupe and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay or where you stayed
That 45 trey deuce spade sprayed you stayed
Unload the clickclack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times SquareI got dimes here
By the Port Authority but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri checks she forge em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But its more to the story her daughter applaud me
We in a zone our soldiers like to stand by
Never alone we bout to make the drums cry

We hold our own dont think you can move us or push us
We step to the side thats why I call this family ties
