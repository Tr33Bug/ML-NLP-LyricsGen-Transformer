See the problem is I aint goin nowhere
Can shoot at me can stab at me
Take your best shot  this is the remix 
Suck a dick no homo

Hop out and shells exchange
I wanna see these niggas die die make they mom feel hella pain
Walk around like I got a broom in my pants

Man these cowards better stay in they lane
And if they aint getting the picture it aint in the frame
VVSs stay in my chain  bling  they in my ring  there they go 
You mustve wrote your will already if youre saying our names
