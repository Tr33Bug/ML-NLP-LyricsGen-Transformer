See the problem is I aint goin nowhere
Can shoot at me can stab at me
Take your best shot  this is the remix 
Suck a dick no homo
Dipset remix lets go
My flow is Novocaine my bars is hurricanes  Katrina 
I got hella caine MAC in the melon Range
Hop out and shells exchange
I wanna see these niggas die die make they mom feel hella pain
Walk around like I got a broom in my pants
Nah thats a fuckin AK heavy tool in my pants damn
Man these cowards better stay in they lane
And if they aint getting the picture it aint in the frame
VVSs stay in my chain  bling  they in my ring  there they go 
You mustve wrote your will already if youre saying our names
Hell Rell Mr Ruger Ruger Im a shooter shooter
You hung with the girls you double dutch or hulahooper  faggot 
Hop skip and jumping block clicking and jumping
Glock clicking and dumping its the mighty Dips
Listen Im quite known nice chrome a cyclone niggas
Your sight blown righto my white stones glitter
Left hand bling the right one shiver
Stallion medallion a ice cold picture
The white stone flipper
That white tone nights home getting rid of the weight like lipo mister
This psycho sicker

This aint nothing to me a scrapper at its best
No rapper could impress man Im crack right out the jects
You rapping indirect
But its looking like a movie shoot
How they sending all these damn actors at the Set

Soul niggas they sick and flabby  they washed up 
Young fly rich and every nigga with me pack heat  we balling 
Somebody snapping pictures at me  watching 
Plus I know I got the FBI sick of me
The cash the jewels and how we buy exquisite Vs
Dont get ya brains fried to a fricassee
My vest and my heater breath full of reefer
And ya boy stay fly like he was dressing for Easter
The big Pachorte Capo the heffe
Packing 44 court case to drop on expressway
