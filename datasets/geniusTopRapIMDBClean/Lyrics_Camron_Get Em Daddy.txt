They say beautys in the eye of the beholder
Thats why I look in the mirror every morning and realize how fly I am
They wanna know what fuckin label Im signing to
Im the CEO of Diplomat Records I sign myself
Getchya cake up
Im like a crack addict
With these Macs Ive got a bad habit
Clackclack in the pen back out Im back at it
Its like my lawyer know black magic black rabbit
Out the black hat black Back home to my Craftmatic
Next to it stash mattress Under it cash bastard
Had them bitches assbackwards fuck em like a jackrabbit
Is she crab status Call the girl a itchy twat
Stick me not I go and get dutches its a 50box
I got weed hash when I breeze past breathe fast
Eat ass on point like Steve Nash
But Im fixin to be OG Nixon in 3
Enough jewels you fools  Im cool  my kicks are a G
I got tramp whores Yours
Been VIP since BIG
I never seen a dance floor  Nope 
Behind the velvet rope pop bottles hella smoke
Girls with contacts want contact I tell em nope
You go Pon de River leave you in ponds and rivers
Don Juan a Long John the long arm of harmll hitchya
We like the March Of Dimes the way we march with dimes
Good help is hard to find
Soft white the art I twine
Art design archin mine Fresno to Clarke Im fine
Sun ill Gun Hill back to Central park its mine  Mine 
Til this day dude still followed by State troops
Gray Coupe whip in mommas name

In one ear yeah yeah 220 thou
PoPo wanna pick his brain hos wanna give him brain
We rose up to bigger fame glows from the tennis chain
Make foes wanna get him slain these hollows will twist a man
I left out of Clinton Max got picked up by Killa Cam fam
We on another level Im bout to pull that Porsche out
And flood the other bezel I get dug like shovels
Yall niggas fuck with pebbles I flip big boulders
Switch Rovers hit em with the gun thats in his holster
You could gargle cum ma why sip soda
These niggas wanna be Scarface Im with Sosa
You need to have my number if you wanna buy weight
Fuck a borough we floodin the whole TriState
20 thou on the arm more rocks on the charm
And I done copped from every damn haze spot on Audubon
Heavy weed smoker get ounces for free
Add up everything you got it aint amountin to me
Im in the Crown Victoria Mac in the back
See these little niggas rappin to rap man I just happen to rap
Know what I do manufacturing crack
Keep talking get you snatched for that scratch clapped with the Mac
Im bout to buy more guns bout to buy more trucks
And when we on the road bitches follow the tour bus
You mad cause you losing plus in the Bronx
Im responsible for most of the stabbings and the shootings
