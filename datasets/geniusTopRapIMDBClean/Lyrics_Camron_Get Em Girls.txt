Killa lets go

Yall get shot at call me I do the shooting

Ill tell you true stories how I coldly hold heat
When its repping time I get on extra grind
Fried to fricassee Pepperseed to Pepperdine

Stallion of the year medallions in my ear
Whips on my fists houses on my wrists
Your budget on my neck your spouse on my dick
