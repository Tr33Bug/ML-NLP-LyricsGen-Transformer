What up Midwest
They forgot about the fourth coast
It aint nothing though
What up Arkansas Minnesota Kansas
Kentucky Missouri everybody in the Lou
Thinking bout Guy Fisher
Never met him but God damn thats my nigga
I figure real estate invested pie flipper
Never snitch me Im in a bathrobe fly slippers  I80 
Left Chicago with good money for 5 drops
Westside did the Southside like the White Sox  What up Stony Island 
Van Buren Pulaski KTown is contra  Westside 
Theyll dearly depart ya in front of MacArthurs  What up Madison 
Im the author for gangsters tough guys
Did the whole Ohio but I started off a Buckeye
Columbus to Nati them towns I raped em
Few clowns was hatin moved my pounds to Dayton
And in Akron my niggas they would throw things
Not King James these were coke kings
And you acting grown doggy you aint back at home
The smack its on wrapped in chrome
You better get a chaperone
If you know like I know you should lie low
Killa I used to get it in Ohio
Dont forget the Chi though guns are like a pyro
You keep playing you will look like a gyro
Go head and hate me hater
Cause Im flyer than a aviator
Well youll get smacked with the radiator
And I get catered player Wanna talk Maybe later
Told her her time was up 88 her FlavorFlaved her
Need your neck choked rather your neck broke
You dead broke yes folks the jewels are like egg yolks
And youll get yoked up switchbladepoked up
Bitchmade since 6th grade he need his rope cut
Cowboy roped up yall boys sold what
Know what Dope crack and coke is in the coat tucked
Roll up hold up family this a hold up
Get close up soaked up Im KG post up
Ho slut no love turn beef to cold cuts
Family getting bread well he about to get his loaf cut
Yall doped up this game is sewed up
Malcolm X tell the white bitch Yo I want my toes sucked
If you know like I know you should lie low
Killa I used to get it in Ohio
Dont forget the Chi though guns are like a pyro
You keep playing you will look like a gyro


Id rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6
My 12 and 12  well they carry my bricks
And them 1212 fiends theyre married to sniff
And the V12 thats on various trips
Yall make a brother laugh me I took another path
Come into my habitat hovercrafts bubble baths
Duffle bags stuffed with cash fell in love with math
I got the green Benz red Range mustard Jag
White coke tan dope black gun trey deuce
Silver bullets purple piff blue pills Grey Goose
Pull out the rattattat
Duck duck say goose
Beige coupe suede roofs send him up to Jess  Jesus 
Hdeuce yea yea piss off the state troops
See me then they dont I disappear say poof
Play Zeus homeboy get a replaced tooth
Not Pac mean dust when a nigga say juice
Killa
