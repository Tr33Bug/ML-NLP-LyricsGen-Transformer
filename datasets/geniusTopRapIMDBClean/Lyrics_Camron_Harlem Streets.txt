Killa  Killa  Dipset man
Ayo you know Ive been all over the motherfucking world man
But aint no place like Harlem man
Let me break it down man
We tie dynamite to the rhino type wino might find yo sight
Sell the information for a dime of white that ChinaChina
Im behind the diner selling marijuana to a minorminer
Elder fella looking for that shine Ill shine ya
My mind designer You a dime Ill dine ya
Madonna momma body bottled youre fine Im finer
Time to climb her climb behind vagina
Then I hymengrind her til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her visions gone kiss her palm
Turn her arm lift her arm notice that her wrists is raw
Gotta get it right ma we gon get along
Said how dont trip but yo the trick is wrong
First vision day job tickatron
Nighttime Mr Mom bootleg Cris and Dom
Brother Chris and Don and their sister Carm
They sell yay youll say yay this shits the bomb
Ima hit my man tell em you my pick upon
The rest so yes youll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know kiss his mom she gave him wisdom charm
And their father come from a long list of dons
And I get it cheaper I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful its tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said be careful
Why I feel like Im losing weight
Why I aint got no money if Im moving weight
My lifes based upon what Ima do this year
Cop a boat cop a Lear
Now the army suits cute with my chocolate Airs
You aint gotta stare go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world  Killa 
Everybody like Cam got the recipe now
Not them 3 girls I got to be Destinys Child  gotta be me 
Specially equities reckon we smile
Interfere tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive receptive of fouls
Hectic Heckler  Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah I aint gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail dog
I broke bread with the whale fled from some seals  what else 
And the house I was the head of the hills shit
You get a dumb ho and get dumbhappy
Go to the gun show get gunhappy  who are we 
Stuck killed mugged milled
Tone flint sticks bo Chubs milk  what up yall 
Pucci baba but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel nigga  nigga 
Ya well just clap up your brains snatch up your chains
See dog Rap is my aim
But Im a hustler in my heart trapped is the game
Attached to my frame tapped to my brain the fact still remains
It wasnt rap it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog dont be asking for Dame see
Playboy I dont own that man
And anyway homeboy you a grownass man shit
And when I rap it aint no punchline  not at all 
I be on the highway dirty crunch time
No timeouts homeboy just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit theyll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road holding you up you cold as a fuck
They want that button lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it I run in the bushes
Thats how I play mine jump over the grapevine
Take my chances oneonone with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck yall if yall aint feeling the Dips  Killa Killa 


Why I feel like Im losing weight
Why I aint got no money if Im moving weight
My lifes based upon what Ima do this year
Cop a boat cop a Lear
Now the army suits cute with my chocolate Airs
You aint gotta stare go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world  Killa
