Yo I hate my boss
Dude think he know it all
And I know I know it all
But I follow protocol
Hope hes sittin in the casket
Got me sittin in traffic  word 
Its seven AM  yeah yeah yeah 
And I woke up late didnt even have a shower
Lunch break Give me a break a damn half an hour
All this bullshit for twelve bucks an hour  Im ready to quit 
Plug me to Chuck D wanna Fight the Power
Instead I light the sour before I go in the office
Being here eight hours sure will get you nauseous
Lady across from me telling me her problems  what the fuck 
Im look at her like yo  yeah yeah yeah 
How the fuck Im gonna solve em
You know our ethnicity
Car note rent dont forget electricity  thats all due 
Internet cable and the phone all connected
Food gas tolls oh now its getting hectic
Brand new clothes Naw youd rather see me naked
Yo check it I got my check now Im feel disrespected  what the fuck 
Why am I working here It aint working here
It aint worth it here never gonna persevere
Aint no money for new shoes or purses here
Shouldve done my first career  huh  nursing yeah
Now Im sitting here thinking bout the work I put in
This verse from the everyday working woman
Chorus 
I put on my pants put on my shoes
I pray to God paid all my dues
Im trying to win seems like I was born to lose
All I can say  yeah yeah yeah 
I say let me through but they dont let me through
You want to quit God damn Im ready to
Lifestyle Im living aint steady boo  Not at all 
All I can say  yeah yeah yeah 
Ayo Im lookin for a job aint nobody hiring
Then I ask the boss when yall doin firing
You Im admiring nice job family man
Car and looking at these want ads tiring
Shoulda been a fireman learn to do wiring
Then get retirement I blame my environment  its my hood 
I went in for an interview for delivery  for delivery 
Locked up felonies now the dudes quizzing me
You working on my future why you need to know my history
All he did was Google me no big mystery
He aint digging me politely he was dissin me
No were not hiring but thanks for the visit Please
He aint want me my grandmother warned me
Them God damn felonies will haunt me taunt me  I told you bout them felonies 
No second chance back to the same block
Go home my baby moms done changed locks  fuck is she doing 
This a game ma Okay the games on  okay 
Then she opened the door with the chain on  whats up 
Said she been reaching out for several days
I aint helping out we need to go our separate ways  oh word 
I was just amazed wanna go another route
Let me get my clothes said she took them to my mothers house
She was pissed off yeah POed
And said go head and wild out Ill call your PO

 Chorus
