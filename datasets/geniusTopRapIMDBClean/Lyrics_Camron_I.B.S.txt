IBS Lyrics
Let me tell yall a lil story about myself
This right here is a true story check it out though uhh
Ulcers hurt my salary alter my personality
Give it to you real I cant feed my culture no fallacy
You know my attitude arrogant cocky rude
Eating off papi food used to be a stocky dude
Weighed twotwenty with two honeys I move money
Its true dummy dunny need a new tummy
I become berserk it was no fun to work
Every day my stomach hurt ripping off my undershirt
The pain was no comparison stomach started cherishing
Throwing up in public yo fuck it it was embarrassing
Regurgitating green yellow burgundy boom
But came my urgency soon  what  the emergency room  oh 
In there no salvage treated like a cold savage
They said pimping symptoms huh a dope addict
There you have it but they aint find no heroin
Coke crack dope just weed but thats my medicine
My baby mama mama and my grandma
Say that Im too gaudy  too gaudy  word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain dont matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away uh oh here it come again
Never mind stunting dime puffin doc spent his time fronting
He like a bad detective he aint find nothing
Besides that though I cant enjoy a movie dinner  why is that 
My son growing up Im looking like the movie Thinner
Im thinking suicide do or die sit and cry  oh 
What hurt my baby moms asking if Im getting high
She gonna play me a thug I told the lady I love
If it aint hustling ma please dont relate me to drugs  at all 
Im losing weight though every day pounds of muscle
Gotta get off my ass hit some towns and hustle
Bein sick huh it get sickening you know
I was too sick to do shows but still equipped to move Os
You know my attitude get it how I get it
If I can shoot I turn around  then  Im off my pivot
And oops I thought I had it mapped
Weight started to gain again it was just a game my friend
Dame mane I pained again
My baby mama mama and my grandma
Say that Im too gaudy  too gaudy  word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain dont matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away uh oh here it come again
Killa
Ayo god body Im hard bodied word mommy vanishing
Had to go low The Mayo Clinic Minnesota
I couldnt get cake a rock in a hard place
For me thats a odd place Im only here by Gods grace
Like a lab rat them tests dishonor Cam
Ultrasound MIR CAT scan sonogram
Laparoscopy endoscopy I be stressed  I be stressed 
The prognosis diagnosed IBS
And thats irritable bowel child I had to spit it yall
Kick to yall so it aint my fault if I shit on yall
Get it get it get it get it
My baby mama mama and my grandma
Say that Im too gaudy  too gaudy  word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain dont matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away uh oh here it come again
My baby mama mama and my grandma
Say that Im too gaudy  too gaudy  word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain dont matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away uh oh here it come again
