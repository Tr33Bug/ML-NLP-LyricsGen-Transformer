Killa
You know I can talk about what I wanna talk about
Them statute of limitations is up for them drugs
Far as them murders I never knew nuttin anyway haha
I was sleep haha yo
Yo 97 huh drugs I moved a big amount
Chick in my crib her ribs Im bout to dig it out
Then Mae called said Yo Im stuck inside some bitchs house
Her boyfriend at the door could I hurry up and get him out
Aight whats the address Homie said Kingsbridge
That was great I had some niggas right on Bainbridge
Yeah we play but believe it aint no game kid
Hopped off the elevator aimed it at that lame lid
I aint give a damn yeah Cam I was gungho
Got this nigga home and he passed me a hundo  100 dollars 
Told him straight up I aint feeling him
Let me curve this nigga fore I end up killing him
I would make 80k on a lazy day
Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine
At this time Im moving heroin in Maryland
They both died and this nigga turned reverand
Had the hood hot FBI agents round
We need a referee shit that shit a flagrant foul
Fuck it kept it moving with my true manoeuvres
On the highway nigga moving that Eukanuba
When them drum fly when them drum fly
Make your son cry say hi to the bad guy
Nigga thats Killa nigga thats Killa
Motherfucker thats Killa motherfucker thats Killa
From your tour dates from your tour dates
To your court case dressed in the North Face
Nigga thats Killa nigga thats Killa
Motherfucker thats Killa motherfucker thats Killa
Yeah I smoke pounds you clown homie you heard the bluff
All your murder stuff man I heard enough
NFL murderers you heard of us
This when Herb McGruff used to serve the dust
Task force homicide DTs and other NARCs
My jewelry well thats frozen like my mothers heart
Bless her heart lord me Im some other shark
But the way I get money thats another art
Where should a brother start How I used to pump in parks
Or how I parked niggas on the side of the barber shop
Give me some Skittles beast mode Im hard to stop
My lifes cement not wood so its hard to knock
Niggas get knocked off get knocked the bill paid
From that 212 twotwelving with that 12 gauge
Gods child you owe me money See hells raised
You got two weeks and my two weeks is twelve days
When them drum fly when them drum fly
Make your son cry say hi to the bad guy
Nigga thats Killa nigga thats Killa
Motherfucker thats Killa motherfucker thats Killa
From your tour dates from your tour dates
To your court case dressed in the North Face
Nigga thats Killa nigga thats Killa
Motherfucker thats Killa motherfucker thats Killa
