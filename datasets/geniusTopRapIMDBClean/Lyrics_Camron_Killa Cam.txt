With the goons I spar stay in tune with ma  What up 
She like Damn this the realest since Kumbaya
Bomaye Killa Cam my Lord  My Lord 
Still the man with the pan scrilla fam on board
Now bitches they want to neuter me niggas they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihans maneuverings nothing new to me
Doggy Im from the land of grind panpan gram or dime
Not toes or MC when I say hammer time
Beef I hammer mine when I get my hands on nines
If I had on Bama line Corduroys Camll shine
Canary burgundy I call it Lemon Red  Red 
Yellow diamonds in my ear call em Lemonheads
Lemonhead end up dead ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone Flintstones you could say Im friends with Fred
You unhappy scrappy  Whats going on Scrappy 
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say Im Tacky Daddy Range look like Laffy Taffy

Killa  Yo
How dope is this
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want coke or piff
Got it all smoke or sniff  everything 
And you know my drift
Used to figures dough and shit  millions 
You a rooster nigga just a roaster bitch
And I roast ya bitch
Thats how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci Louis and Pucci men
Escada Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Birdseye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes
Its me sing Killa uhh
