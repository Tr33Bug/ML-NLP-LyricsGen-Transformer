Killa Season  Intro  Lyrics
Before we get into this Killa Season
Lets start this shit off with my man 40 Cal
Who am I 40 Cal motherfucker
Gat to your back get down motherfucker
Clown motherfucker
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
Let me try to explain
I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane
Give his Rover the new name the firin range
When we see you yell fire and aim
Cause when I fire them thangs its like
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
I gotta watch who with me watch too pretty
Drop twofitty on a hot new Bentley
But when it come to drops say he cop too many like damn
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
That whip wonderful Cal they make Hummers in brown
Nah I just shitted on you even haters lovin my style
Im a role model I make the hustlers proud
I make the customers smile
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
Catch me in them thangs with Jennifer BMs with Olivia
If it aint Vivica its somebody similar
Comin down the block the suspense is killin ya like wow
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
Thats Cal we see him  we see him  we leavin  we leavin 
He schemin he be beastin
Heard he kill people we believe him
Oh shit hes reachin
You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now 
Killa Killa
Dial Killa for murder once no redial
Just see child the OG style and how I used to be wild
This the story of Cameron Ezike Giles one way road to the penal
Yea the hoosegow ohh child you wasnt there
Zeek snitched If he did Id be doin a hundred years
Did the interstate big cities tiny ones
Took over niggas towns black tie tiny bums
Handsome hoods pretty thugs but we grimy dun
Cars cribs money had to find me some
Zeek right behind me dun dun he play by all the rules
Thats why the house is his the cars all the jewels
Yall niggas all are fools your regular married with children
Dog nine to five office pool
Couldnt live that life I need a loft and pool
I had too much class I aint report to school
If they report to school I caught the stool extort the fool
Took off his jewels thought he cool
Gun to mouth they often drool
Fuckin with this wolf this should be taught to you
Your money dont matter what you cant afford to do
Is fuck with me dawg that could be affordable
Hide ya mom police protection thats when Im cordial
Cars convertible TVs are portable
Fiends on line coke lines they come and snort a few
Killa
Killa 
Guns cars bitches and  Killa 
Weed smoke dope  Killa 
Glocks ox ockin Im cocked  Killa 
Cam fam damn its  Killa 
Season and the reason you breathin  Killa 
Who buy out the bar though  Killa 
Who far from a star but they car is Gallardo  Killa 
I was forced to eat anything you lost I keep
Shot the fifth and then like a Piston toss the Heat  Bye 
Now round the corner up the block cross the street
Up fifty flights iight where the bosses meet
And the Porsche is peach felt like Boston George
Left Boston Market did deals on Boston Beach
Now I bought the beach all because they applaud my speech
One nigga crossed the chief I know you heard he lost his teeth
And its Killa
Killa 
Guns cars bitches and  Killa 
Weed smoke dope  Killa 
Glocks ox ockin Im cocked  Killa 
Cam fam damn its  Killa 
Season and the reason you breathin  Killa 
Who buy out the bar though  Killa 
Who far from a star but they car is Gallardo  Killa
