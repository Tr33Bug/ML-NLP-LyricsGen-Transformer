Ima warn ya
In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance
And you cant knock that block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta I got that
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Lowlifes with no knives niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
Thats power I play my post one day
Youre the best thing since sliced bread the next day youre toast
I can never be toast hell no
I get money in lump sums yea I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it Keep going girl youre terrific
Yeah baby see Im Clyde and Im looking for a Bonnie mami
To get a Gucci ghost watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth humble beginnings hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice me or drugs he chose angel dust  damn 
And the mother some was living more dangerous
Tax season the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak this bracelet you could hold that
If Im needed know that you can
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
