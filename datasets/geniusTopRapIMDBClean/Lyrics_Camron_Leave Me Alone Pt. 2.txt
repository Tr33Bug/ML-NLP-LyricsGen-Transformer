Leave Me Alone Pt 2 Lyrics
I be like Move Get out the way
Cause I move bricks get out the yay
And its 2 clips I get out to play for
Few chips I get out and spray
Its more than shrimps its whores and pimps
The difference in our crimes yours attempts
Attempt burglary attempt theft you just begun
Im Grand Theft Auto
Racketeering larceny conspiracy murder one
Electric chair I dont deserve the fun
But I get the dough shit I might splurge on one
Now I know a lotta styles some see
But listen stop it child its a done D
I come to ya block stop its that one D
Gators straight from Crocodile Dundee
No rubber sole hardwood bastard
Fitted legitted hardwood classic
Killa Uh
Uh that shit you talk dont move me nada
The dudes with the Qs be proper
Uzi pop you news and choppers
Its truly liver who knew wed prosper
The games a bitch ooh we got her
Shoes Louis Prada groupie blah blah
Santana Zeke the kufi popper
We the movie Shottas
But its really rude bois and Rastas
With a trailer load of girls excuse me Shabba
I wish my homie could watch me
Live Happy Days like Joanie and Chachi
I stay lonely and cocky
Dice
Rollin and rollin em
Cars the repo are towin em
Ask black we totally total em
Even Blood he totally totaled it
Plus his life he totally totaled it
But any girl I get I totally open em
Brain and they legs coke and the dope in em
Killa
Talkin tough  Yo  smokin dust  whoa 
Fuck with us  No No No 
Get ya head bust
Get ya head bust
Fuck around dawg get ya head bust
He talkin fly  yo  I wonder why  whoa 
Fuck with us  No No No 
Get ya head bust
Get ya head bust
Fuck around dawg get ya head bust
I spend days on Kawasakis
Nights with Lewinsky
But Im like the Ice Man Michael Kuklinski
I style on New York pile up my fork
The Dips consulted by the son of Malachi York doggy
Cause I push weight plus I push tapes
God damn Im starvin and I just ate
I wouldnt say Im Nino at The Carter
Im more like the plant in Little Shop Of Horrors
But I dont say Feed me Seymour
I say Feed me Dame feed me Lyor  billions 
Epic they used to feed me detours
RocAFella they feed me C4
The way I blow up the VS just soars
You GS3 Im GS4
You in a Lexus Im Gulf Stream 4
Up in the sky on a gulf stream tour
You want beef Well start a Gulf Stream war
Lay ya ass down on Gods green floor
We playin golf in the Gulf of New Mexico
The cost to be the boss you gotta respect it ho
My gas game you gotta respect it though
I swear to god you think Im workin for Texaco
And ya section know when any day TECs could blow
Hit em from neck to toe when I come deck ya hoe Killa
Dipset bitch
