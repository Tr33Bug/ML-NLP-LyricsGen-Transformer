Live My Life  Leave Me Alone  Lyrics
Niggas be on  Uh  point game tight  Killa Killa uh 
Thug niggas be on point game tight
Thug niggas be on point game tight  Harlem Harlem ROC uh 
Thug niggas be on point game tight  We gon set this bitch off 
Thug niggas be on point game tight  My ambitions as a killer 
Yo  Huh 
Yo
Soon as I get here niggas wanna wrap the Roc up
Nah bag slab wrap the rocks up
Gats back the block up
Cop killers clap the coppers blast the choppers pass the vodka  Vodka 
Listen dont ever mention Dash or Hoffa  Never 
Its a Harlem thing dog you will clash with mobsters  Uptown 
Remember me Got jumped on TNT  Whats beef 
Next week back pump TNT  Whats beef 
All my niggas got M16s kid  Yeah 
And all we do is watch MTV Cribs  Why 
Learn not to infury the victim
Purely stick em break down your security system Killa  Uh 
Stop frontin you was never a menace
Never a hustler no we could never do business  Never 
Business is business money is money hustle is hustle  Hustle 
Stupid is stupid you the dumbest of dummies Killa
Leave me alone let me just live my life
Just leave me alone leave me alone
Let me just live my life  Yo 
Thats the sound of the police
All I do every day dog blunt after blunt
Stunt after stunt they all cunt after cunt
Like that Im shiesty look at his shoes like my Nikes
Know I got a girl like my wifey like that Im rude
Come here let me pick with your chest dick on your breast
All they say That niggas a mess
You heard me fam All worthy of this dirty man
Take it in your ass How about thirty grams ma  Huh 
Go upstate come back downstate
Next time around me you might get a pound cake  Do that 
Fuck it up she understand that I might slap her  Slap her 
Ill be damned if I worked for some white cracker  Shit 
White batter prize in the pack fiends hug it
They love it call it Cracker Jack Killa
Where the crack is at watch me get them dice
Throw em hard let me live my life Killa
Leave me alone let me just live my life
Just leave me alone leave me alone
Let me just live my life  Yo 
Thats the sound of the police
Fuck this life as a rap star you dealing with crack gods  Gods 
Cooking the crack hard lead the crack jars
All of the chips the crib with the backyard  Yard 
Pull out the gat pa a block of black cars  Uh 
And Im scary with the fifth compare me to a gift
Yellow diamonds canary on my wrist
Dust juice get wet up and weighed
Thatll be the day Killa Cam mess up some yay shit  Why 
Thug niggas be on point game tight  Game tight 
Cop a brick and reup in the same night  Uh 
And to get that trife I flick that knife  Knife 
Doggy dog let me live my life Killa
Leave me alone let me just live my life
Just leave me alone leave me alone
Let me just live my life
Thats the sound of the police
The block is hot niggas tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out they gon feel it
Witness the realest
Killa Killa
