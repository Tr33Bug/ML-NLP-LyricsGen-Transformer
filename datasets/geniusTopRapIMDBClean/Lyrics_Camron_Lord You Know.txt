Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
With my muscle youll be dazzled but hustlins a hassle
Percocet Demerol capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you they runnin with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man facetoface through the glass
On the phone 10 years he got chasin that cash
Cocaine he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasnt 911 but it was 911
Gave him 9 plus 1 dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in I had to find that dumb
Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
Ayo them niggas from the three two said I cant breeze through
The 40 if I cop bottles we cant believe you
Me who Please boo landin in that G2
Same color as beef stew favorite letters GQ
Thats me true peachblue Hebrew
Lawyer on my side keep me out of jail the fees stew steep Woo
But it might lead to that R2D2 the mobsters creep through
We the new PE shittin peeew
To the hood yall dont need me I need you
Cause my missions insane you couldnt vision the pain
Always a snitch in the game what you want prison or fame
Either one dun long as my digits the same
He lookin frigid dig it make sure them digits get changed
Cause I cant be in Hells cell shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell Zeek doin 3 he even fell hell
He comin home on 07 and 12 cells
Cause you must have known I cant trust the phones
For the dough youll be like Doe stuck at home
Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
Nowadays dog they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost ark
Im like a ballplayer shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box
More props RIP my poor pops
Cant see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers youll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches Nana to watch Grandma
In pajamas I snuck out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa you gon watch Santana
Now Lord you know just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know tell you I know
Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate little fence  I climbed over
Little scrapes little dents  I got over
That was just the beginning its not over
Its been a long time comin Cam
Its been a long time riding and a long time running man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino Gee Money The Carter and the DuhDuh Man
Its no longer a New Jack City
Its cop fast and move that quickly or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I aint talking rap man Im coming up this road
Im talking crack man and coming up with Os
Im coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go I receive it move it and roll
I was comin from the Q Zeek was comin from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the paperrun
Yeah waiting for a change to come
Now look the change has come
The 7Pick Up Yukon the Range is come
The day has come Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers
In this game we remain its a shame cuz
