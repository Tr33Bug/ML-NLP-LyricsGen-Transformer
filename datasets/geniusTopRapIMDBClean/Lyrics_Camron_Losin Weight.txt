Why I feel like Im losing weight
Why I aint got no money if Im moving weight
My life depend on what Ima do today
Why I cant move away
Just loot and me without the scrutiny
Niggas screwing me 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots 1 toolie G 1 eulogy
My mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world uh
When I was 11 got the toolie thick
My uncle pulled me to the side
And he schooled me quick told me some gooey shit
You cant get paid in an earth this big
You worthless kid nigga dont deserve to live
Go and get it motherfucker if you murder kids
Bottle up carbohydrates and preservatives
He got hit up that same night
But ever since my dough my flow and my ho game been tight
Puns of pearls yo tongue will twirl looka here
Booger bear Ill have you up in hooker gear I swear
I was doing Lex pursuing niggas be wired like Western Union
Short like next to Ewing head for truant only set was ruined
Phony checks was fluent listen hear me out
Im from a cocaine block with some plain clothes cops
And the sun dont rise but the rain dont stop
The pain dont stop but my brain dont stop
Aint no lockouts the game dont stop
Every month you change yo locks change yo spot
Get a little smart want to change yo tops
Rearrange yo rocks you got a gang of friends money
You got Bens arranged money have a Benz or Range money
But if I get knocked I aint got no bail
But I come on the weekends Pablo jail
See I came a long way thats living the wrong way
Thats sniffing the pona thats sipping the cogna hey
You wanna be a star you have ya own day
Where they play ball drink and get a buzz
Reminiscing what a good kid he was
I dont know what happened all he did is what he loved
Thats when you opposing me Killa get the rosary
Fuck this rap shit I die for mine motherfucker


Why I feel like Im losing weight
Why I aint got no money if Im moving weight
My life depend on what Ima do today
Why I cant move away
Just loot and me without the scrutiny
