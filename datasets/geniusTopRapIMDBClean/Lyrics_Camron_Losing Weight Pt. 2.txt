If you get lost push the OnStar you know what Im sayin
The directions get you straight there you know what I mean
Okay lets do it
Be careful put that shit away man you know what I mean
Be careful I love you alright You good
Call me on the cell if you got a problem
Ayo fuck losing weight
Im back on these highways moving cakes
Lifes based upon what Ima do today
Cop a car new estate
Nah fuck it get the beef and brocs blue and gray
Baby due today  Day 
I got to move an eighth  Eighth 
Fuck the scrutiny
Yall niggas screwing me  Fuck em 
Killa never let the drama slide
Yall gon hear a nigga mama die  Yo yo 
Yell out homicide
Eighteen months Please that aint facing time
Im stressed anyway need it for vacation time
Ima do the right thing though take shock anyway
Six months right back on the damn block anyway  Anyway 
But look money from across the street
Think its sweet think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And fiveoh they work for us  Us  walk the beat
Walk with heat cause talk is cheap  Cheap 
So dun stay silent  Shh 
Revolvers automatics guns stay silent  Silent 
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent  Talent 
Remember me ODB Im the one from Violence Killa
Digital ten shit get critical friend
I got eight hundred invisible men
That mean it could be the bank man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank fam
Lady at the frank stand  Stand 
Will rat poison your relish right in the center babe
Bitch is a renegade shell piss in your lemonade  Lemonade 
And yall dead now that you could bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now hate when I gotta rep clowns blow TEC rounds
In a collision I see their ambition  I see it 
But they dont know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was ninety I fried
Threefifty on the stove and its ninety outside  Side 
Ima get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died heron overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her older man fucking her sis
But love my music say I do nothing but hits
Shell do anything for me nothing but hits
Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke needed dope yeah I gave her a fix
So she went across the street gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out flirted played with his dick
You know Cam He said Yeah dont play with his chips  Chips 
Stood back blazed him with six amazing and shit
Huh Killa Killa Dipset nigga


Yo fuck losing weight  Uhhuh 
We back on these highways we moving cakes
Lifes based upon what Ima do today
Take my moms move away
Yeah I think Ima cop me that new estate  Uhhuh 
Baby due today  Come on 
I got to move an eighth  Thats right 
Fuck the scrutiny
Yall niggas screwing me  Yeah 
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block til the shots hit me  Yo 
Until the shots get me
Niggas wanna know why Im so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire
Its real dog I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie
In the midst of the fire
Break work put it in pots sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off Im hitting your tires
Hittin your doors while your cars spinning hitting the wall
Thats just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villainsll finish you off
Head in your chest brain
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC wave
Niggas like Fuck is he stupid  Yes I am 
Cops wanna cuff me do it
You wanna be a hero snuff me do it
Rush me do it
Shit like I aint been through the scars and bruises
Like I aint been through the bars seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot I done lost so much weight
Im telling Papi Front me a brick let me owe that cake
He telling me he aint got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
Im like At least give me a half Ill compress it and stretch it to one
Im on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops thats moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger dukell circle round your body like hulahoops  Woo 
Mami told me Son hold your own
And one day you gon grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block til the shots hit me
Ayo fuck losing weight
Im back on these highways moving cakes
Lifes based upon what Ima do today
Cop a car new estate
Nah fuck it get the beef and brocs blue and gray
Baby due today  Day 
I got to move an eighth  Eighth 
Fuck the scrutiny
Yall niggas screwing me  Fuck em 
Killa never let the drama slide
Yall gon hear a nigga mama die
Yell out homicide
Yo fuck losing weight  Uhhuh 
We back on these highways we moving cakes
Lifes based upon what Ima do today
Take my moms move away
Yeah I think Ima cop me that new estate
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth  Thats right 
Fuck the scrutiny
Yall niggas screwing me
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block til the shots hit me
Until the shots get me
