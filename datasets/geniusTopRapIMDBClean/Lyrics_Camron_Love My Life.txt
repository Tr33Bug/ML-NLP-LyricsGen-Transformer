Ayo I never claim to be hard tough no homo
Gangsta none of the above
Just a kid from 140th and Lenox Ave Harlem USA
Trying to make his way in the world ya heard
You know through the trials and tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends incarcerated some are gone forever
You know you cant expect everything from everybody
So get up get out and get something
Thats what I did
Before I had the hammer cocked or Santana rocked
Little Jerv Grandpa Terry Grandma Dot
Uncle Carl Uncle Ted Uncle Steve Uncle Bill
Cousin Steve Cousin Bill up on the hill now
My Aunt Normy I dont speak to my Aunt Dida
Or my Cousin Bathsheba love my mother Frederica
Neighbor Freda daughter Raven and Nicka
Down another doorbell was that nigga Wardnell
He gave birth to the best MC you never heard
Leather after leather and was clever with whatever words
Derek Armstead Bloodshed from COC
He did damage road managed by GOD
Aka DukeDaGod he was stupid hard
Sixteen a bitch dream had stupid cars
Cutlass 68 hooptie 75
Still drive some bullshit I dont know why
I love the nigga though for him put Cris in the air
First one dis em in here I swear Ill risk my career
Thats a fact dick aint talking no rap shit
Im talking that MAC clip niggas will backflip
Act sick my dude studied the Sabbath
No beef veggie nigga maybe some catfish
He could have my house he could keep my Mauris
He could drive my cars this a Eastside Story


Thats why my dudes love me I let them do them
You either gon be rich or famous fucking with meprobably both
If you happen to brush shoulders with me by accident play Lotto
9 out of 10 times you gon win nigga
Play the game sure to win
They all up on me know they wants my ends
I sacrifice I roll the dice
I love my hood I love my life
See a boss Im prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation
I aint scared of you Im scared of me
I got a gun  you dont so its flares youll see
After that a fivethousand volt chair for me
So I move carefully niggas dont care for me
Who care I dont you share I wont
Calm down breathe again
I dont do extortion unless Im on the receiving end
Talk to my money first time I heard her speak
Thats word to me told me I deserved to eat
Moved to a killer Ave right from a murder street
Rocked Adidas Forums even though they hurt my feet  thats fucked up 
I dont look in the sky never mind stars
Know some fine stars right behind bars
Snags Black Doe on house arrest
Zeek Sheek wont even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass right along side Zeek
Turn myself in Nope play hide and go seek
Im gone put the clip in the chrome
Yeah Im just like a fly see the shit that Im on
And hour after hour I would chill at the after hours
Where they flash the powder no bath or shower
In that same spot realized math is power
So I point at the mansion that is ours
Play the game sure to win
They all up on me know they wants my ends
I sacrifice I roll the dice
I love my hood I love my life
