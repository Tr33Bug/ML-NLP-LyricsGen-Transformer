Drug dealer scandalous nigga lous nigga lous nigga
Come again me say me
Yo I dont know what you heard but Im cool with the drama
Couple people still alive cause Im cool with their mama
Niggas thinking Im with JuJu because Im in love
She aint black man she Cuban her mother the plug
I can make cocaine  cocaine 
Crack too baking soda propane  propane 
No halves or quarters I do the whole thing  whole thing 
Take a sniff youll be on that Soul Plane oh mane  oh mane 
Money makers link up because we feel each other
Last name Giles but run it like the Felix brothers
Wanna bet Then lets deal it gets real
Over that Juice I play Bishop and press steel

Yo any beef man I muzzle it go
In the middle of the summer I be shoveling snow
What fight What fight you had Man you tussle with hoes
Before I met Terrence Howard Cam hustled and flowed
Be in meetings in my pajamas
Turn decimals into commas
You get it like I get it then meet me in the Bahamas
Island in Nassau Im building a Benihanas
Still in the hood though waiting on any drama
Or the projects parked waiting on your mama
Or the park in the projects to bating with piranhas
Call this an Apartheid baby Im from the far side
Trafficking nah its just a car ride
