Purple Haze  Advance Version  Lyrics
Tito crack that dutch
Roll that purple up
Niggas slacking in their macking
Simpin in their pimpin
Glad I got you baby
You the only one I can count on man
You my crutch man yo
We leave spots milked you get your top tilt
Mop filled my block leaves cops killed duck shots still
You not built you had zirconias those was zirconias
I kept it spot built I can ensemble linen
Grinning on rock silk Im hitting bitches like switches
Im a top Wilt thats Chamberlain mama became a friend
Said she had the lamest men wanted to learn the game Im in
I had to game her then you rearrange your friends
Then you change that Benz we need a Range with Rims
She bought a gravy Rover it had a pastry odor
Yes she made the quota cause Im like Ray Liotta
Fiends in a caskets leaning them bastards
But the meanest of fabrics when Im with Athena Onassis
Or Ms Trina the queen of the asses
Causes when it come to purple Ive seen it in masses
Woo Tito you almost finished  This aint purple neither Tito 
This blunt almost out right here  I dont know what this is 
I love you man  Im not smoking this 
Only thing I count on is you  Tito I want him I dont want him 
Tito just got the blunt  Dont fuck with nothing else but you 
Im reloaded now  God damn 
Tito roll me up another blunt something aint right with this 
And Im a nuisance child game in a stupor now
Plus Im stupid foul pulled a coupe to trial
I come through Canal and let the Luger style
In the DA mouth shit heres a root canal
Right on center street put em on front street
Next day the front page who gonna front on me
Girls deranked and chumped call em skank and cunt
Take a trip with the Dip bitch to the bank to stunt
Serena Williams down to Ivanka Trump
Who wanna bang her rump chump yes I bring the pump
Thats why Im kinda hyped because my moneys good
Which means my mind is right so I got time to write
How I grind at night Next tab china white
Army hat army jacket yes sir my line is right
Diminish his army we finished the Dom P
Now lets get purple like Grimace and Barney
Holla


I gotta come in now I dont know what Titos rolling up
I gotta roll it up my self  I dont know whats in them Dutch Masters 
If you dont crush your own weed up
And put it in the blunt yourself
Your own brotherll hand you some dust
Thats what time it is
I gotta come in
Give me two minutes yall Ill be back with yall in a minute
I gotta roll up
