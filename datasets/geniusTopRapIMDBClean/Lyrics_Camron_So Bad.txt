I really thought we couldve worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldnt stop playing around
Didnt understand but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
Its a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad baby
So sad
Look at all that we couldve had
Just too bad
Yo baby
Let me rescue you from the residue
I dont know what the restll do
But this is what the bestll do
Take you to a better view
Do things we never do
Pleasure you treasure you
Dont skimp and measure you girl
And they scrutinize cause you get the coupe to drive
But you caught me cheating and in stupid lies
Yeah we argued a little  no need to pout mama
I changed I aint about drama  Scouts honor
And you forgave me thats why I behaved b
You dont have to bathe me to love that you gave me its gravy
Grade me  would I get a A B
Maybe you my lady but you my baby
I really thought we couldve worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldnt stop playing around
Didnt understand but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
Its a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad baby
So sad
Look at all that we couldve had
Just too bad


Yeah we made love man I wish I aint acknowledge ya
Wish you aint acknowledge me  Wish I aint acknowledge ya
Acting like drugs  if I do I would have bottled ya
Bitter on Twitter following my followers
And I dont like a follower uh
I heard enough complaining
You getting chilly Imma let it burn Usher Raymond
Thats where game was served let me explain my words
You like a app in my iPhone a angry bird
Screaming Cam name cause I do the damn thing
Forget a low down dirty its a damn shame
Cause you a thug cutie Louis snug booty
Oohwee but the attitude on Judge Judy
I really thought we couldve worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldnt stop playing around
Didnt understand but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
Its a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad baby
So sad
Look at all that we couldve had
Just too bad
