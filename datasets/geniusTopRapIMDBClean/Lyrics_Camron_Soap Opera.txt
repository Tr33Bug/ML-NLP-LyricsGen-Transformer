If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you yeah
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Killa Uhh this the ghetto soap opera right here man
You from Harlem you already know
You on that hustlers mission you trying to get that paper
Wifey like it one minute next minute she dont man
You know they at home watching Lifetime or on the Internet
But you gotta do you I got it
Uhh yo my mommy Toy was my pride and joy
She would drive the toys plus ride the boy
To supply the boys I got it live from Croix
Yes a nine in boy wore a five in boys
Over the chick shit I shoot five with Roy
Now I load the 45 shoot five at Roy
Aint like my job or guys I employ
Lifestyle I enjoy but Im the livest doy  doy 
A hustler and Cam famous you damn anus
I dont know but I cant change it
Cant paint it pop it champagne it
Stop it car drop it  it look dull damn paint it
She would throw a pout how Im showing out
How Im outgoing but dont be going out
Its things to know about when you got dough and clout
Ways to move know the route Baby girl close your mouth
Cause I feed you well every sneaker hell
You eat Louie shit Gucci breathe Chanel
Karl Lagerfeld acting like Gargamel
For the car cop the cell in the bar stop at hell
Whats wrong with you She said whats wrong with you
Always got a song to do cant get along its true
So I skipped marriage bought her six karats
Rather die that nigga than to live average Killa  Killa 


If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you yeah
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Yo yo uhh
Looking back on school art and crafts
Fucked half the staff beat up half the class
I was like Dr Dre though I have to laugh
Nigga with a attitude meet me after math
Had a half and half
Not a drink  two chicks that flip acid fast
The half a tab
You could ask her ass I would dash and laugh
You after me huh Im after cash
Im on I80 though with my baby
Whole ride hazy tell her dont drive crazy
I got plans for you look in the sky baby
Fuck Sara Lee Mrs Smith you the pie lady
Fly lady G2 fly baby gee you why baby
Please boo whats your size crazy
Don Juaning when Im in a foreign
Almond drop top my charm is alarming
I was alerting her just to reinsert in her
That I will leave earth with her
Huh I cant interpret her
She got mad I leaned over Im nursing her
Said when I do dirt with her
The only time I flirt with her
Not to be VI but this is BI  BI 
Me and GI be watched by the PIs
See why we cant finish together
Id rather do business than pleasure
And thats real  Killa 
If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you yeah
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
Dont you wanna ride
