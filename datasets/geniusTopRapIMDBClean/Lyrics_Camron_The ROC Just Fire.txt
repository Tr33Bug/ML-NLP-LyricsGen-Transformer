The ROC  Just Fire  Lyrics
I wanna welcome you to extravaganza
Something incredible thats about to take place
World renowned
RocAFella holler

Just Blaze in this shit ya heard  Its your main man Im back niggas 
Holler  Yo yo 
My break Im fresh off it
I never change Im stuck in these ways Nike Airs sweats and Taurus  Huh 
But Ima do it for my enemies
They wanna end my chill wanna see what that villa be
Now what that sound like
Plus they know what a clip get down like
Turn bags from bladders legs to wheels pain and pills
Cause you fucking with a nigga thatll jump out wave the steel
I live this way its real dog its no joke
Blow smoke in your bitch face piss on your wheels
Slap your custies clap your worker dead the strip
Stick your connect yap your bitch
So let it be known Im back on my grizzly
The sergeant the cap the MAC holds sixty
For rookies and vets Ill bang til it click  Click 
So run and tell your dude that the Ruger come with two clips dog
MEasy wont leave my hood need me
Pop for sheezy who dont believe me
We all criminals but live like a diplomat
We get low when the dough low get it back
Here is something you cant understand
How I could just kill a man for Killa Cam
Me and my Roc killer fam top billers man  Man 
We run the spots drop ceilings fam  Fam 
Hit the wall drop ceiling fans  Uh 
Listen boy man I show you how to fill a van up with killers man
And line the trunk keep a stash box for the nine and the pump
The coach walk you through and he grind you up
What you want the dope or the weed
How you wan package it in the cap or the bag
How you want me packing with the MAC or the mag
Yeah that Bent get back but listen scrap act real fast
And keep a wack thatll gag your back
Block style from your swagger your swacks
Its the Broad Street Bully bitch
Bully niggas on the broadest streets
I house niggas on the narrowest block
Know my rules when the barrel get hot
When the gun blows and the shots fall and the smoke clear
Man I be hearin you were murdered  You aint here 
Nobody hit up in the cross cause Im observin  You aint here 
Nobody be missin your loss cause you deserved it
South Philly niggas kill at will
I keep my MACmilli chilly chill  Uh 
On the really real fore I make you niggas feel this steel  Killa Killa 


Go head stupid niggas go fuck with them chicks  Yeah 
Im the third little piggy Ima fuck with them bricks  Bricks 
Better yet the bakery I got pies and cakes  Cakes 
Nigga think doublin is turnin five to eight
I turn eight to twenty twenty to a hundred hundred to thousand
That to a hundred thousand  Thousand 
In front of housin  Housin 
Closed the mall down dog no ones allowed in  Allowed in 
Im coppin everything Im done with browsin  Give me that 
Its the top don Glock palm dot com
Get your shit rocked mon like Hasim Rahman  Rahman 
And Im extra scary
CEOs all the frontin aint necessary  Why 
I fuck your secretaries
All for information it aint necessary  Nah mon 
They in love like the 14th of February  Huh 
Play em like April 1st right before I slide off  Off 
It could be March 2nd sound like July 4th  Blatt 
Halloween or Memorial Day
At your memorial be one year from today  Today 
All yall think its peace and peachy

All my bitches rock Christian Dior BCBG  Uh 
Round phony niggas get the heebiejeebies
Hungry hoes say Killa feed me feed me
Calm down ma easy easy  Easy

Still rock Ellesses to squeeze appease me
