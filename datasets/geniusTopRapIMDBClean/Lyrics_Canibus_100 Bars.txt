Yeah Thats the beat right there
Im about to black out
With a hundred bars on some professional shit
So dont try this at home yo
Yo yo yo
My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans
Because I recognize its all about timin
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin African voodoo science
In front of twentyfoot bonfires
Lookin skyward calculatin May 5 2000
The nine planetsll be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit
Of a starship the size of the HaleBopp comet
With mercury ion rockets
And a bigass Canibus Comin Soon poster on the side of it
Im known geographically and intergalactically
Thats why I got extraterrestrials that wanna battle me
They even tried kidnappin me and they wouldve snatched me
If their craft didnt get trapped in the Earths gravity
Engines stalled and failed crashed into a farmers field
And thats really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives workin for COM 12
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal
Lyrically Im offscale so all hail
Or get tossed towards Hell whatever yall feel
Bruisin niggas confusin niggas like Chip Fu from the FuSchnickens
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds
Wack niggas wanna be down but its not allowed
Interrupt the cipher unannounced
And youll get punched in the mouth
With the southpaw southern fist
Ill bust your shit swell your lip bigger than Bubba Shrimp
For actin tough and shit what a wimp
You giant Goliath niggas get shot with a rubber sling
Im an experiment gone bad
My brainwaves on an encephalograph
Show that Im stark ravin mad
Your whole scientific staffll get killed in a nuclear blast
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode
And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft
Trained in chemical weapons class
Just to see how long a niggas breathll last
I put him in a leather mask spray his ass with a can of pepper gas
Then watch him grab his neck and gag
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh
You wanna battle is the type of question you should never ask
Nigga pick a tougher task see who the fuckll last
Whoever losell get a solderin iron up the ass
You need to recognize my hand is quicker than the eye
Quicker than the fivespeed Jamiroquai drives
A lifespan longer than nine lives infinite rhymes that cant die
A nigga with a divine mind
I dedicate this to the wise dedicate it to dimes
Dividin myself into hundred ten times
You cant deny the offerings I offer
Flows that glow with auroras that sparkle like water
Fly like a saucer with the torque of a Porsche
Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins
Been gettin it on since I been born and Imma live long
And Imma be gettin it on til Im gone
Look at all the stages I been on all the songs that I spit on
I took an oath to rip everythin I get on
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndrome
In the wrist bones from grippin microphones this long
Im just a small fish in a big pond
That gets pissed off whenever I get picked on
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on
My army march a million strong
Like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on
Extremely hostile
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles
A lyrical lynch mob shittin on niggas
Drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on
Duckin down low like we in Nam fightin the Viet Cong
Screamin Incoming when I see a bomb
Speak to your leader surrender your arms
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus 800000 to even consider a war
And 200000 more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors
And smash yall attach yall to the back of my horse
And drag yall across the motherfuckin asphalt
Nine out of ten niggas is frauds you know who you are
Always talkin about your bitches and your cars
Your jewelry and your girls its like we from two different worlds
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves
Cause Im beyond em on some futuristic cyborg shit
I close my eyes when I freestyle
So I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer
And cast a fireball into the audience
To barbecue your brain organs
You feel like youve been thrown in a microwave oven
I flame broil suckers then hit em with some more shit the raw shit
Call my reinforcements the Four Horsemen
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit
I dare a motherfucker to cross it
Ill even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin
Tell him its important
Tell him to call Sting threeway and sing a chorus
Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers cant record it
Call the news Ill kill your reporters
Start a lawsuit Ill kill your lawyers
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what yall think
My albums gold cause my album was the bomb shit
Yall niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys
You fuck em in the ass then you give em cash for it
Thats some sick shit homeboy
A hundred years ago theyd have took you to see Sigmund Freud
You fraudulent feminine fragile as a feather is
With an effortless blow Ill crack your whole skeleton
You think you better than Canibus Wheres the evidence
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
You need to shut the fuck up cause your breath stink
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Battlin me you never win
You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in
Nigga guess again
Cause after Im finished wreckin this shit
Imma drink a whole bottle of Henny and go fuck a lesbian
