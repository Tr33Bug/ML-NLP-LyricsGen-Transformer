4 3 2 1  Original Verse  LyricsMethod where the gods at Redman where the squad at
Yo L is that a mic on your arm Let me borrow that
Whos the God of rap you saying is nice
Ill beat a dead nigga to death and beat a dead nigga to life
If you look at me long enough Ill start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough and then Ill call your bluff
Lets see how many rhymes you got
I can go on for more Millenias than Mazdas got in a car lot
And theres nowhere to run to when I confront ya
Nigga Ill call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surfacetoair missile
I take them in all shapes sizes and forms spit on
Any emcees who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to 60 Im already doing a hundred when Im blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Your head will spin so fast youll catch whiplash
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
Make your hard drive crash the C colon backslash
And Ill go back to the booth to school your whack ass
Because the object of the game is to spark every cell in your brain
At degrees hotter than blue flames
Propane gasses it incinerate you into ashes
I got you breathin harder than girls in Lamaze classes
Stop bitchin about if its written or freestyle
Got the whole Spanish community saying Im muy mal
Charging niggas with booty styles 50 fines
In addition to 25 for whack punchlines
Cause Im the top dog running the yard
And I represent cause I never chained to the fence
Hence to battle me is impossible
Ill put your whole crew in the hospital with IVs all in their nostrils
Stop sleeping on me I aint a mattress
Put you through more drama than a soap opera actress
Dont even think about pulling out and opening fire
Gunshots wound but I remove bullets with pliers
I aspire to kick the fattest that youve ever witnessed
From a far side thats even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge
Ill make your head nod til your neck runs out of cartilage
I think its obvious that I can bring the ruckus
Scream on your crew like a military drill instructor
When I come through niggas stand stiller than statues
If I have to Ill battle your whole rap crew
Then Ill attack you with words thats absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves
