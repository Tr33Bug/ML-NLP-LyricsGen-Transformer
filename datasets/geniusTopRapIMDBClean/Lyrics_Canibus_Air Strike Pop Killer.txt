Air Strike  Pop Killer  Lyrics
Alright were about to blast the hell out of here
Rear    whats your position Got 36 down one two   
Okay
Here comes
Holy
But uh like honestly I dont let them have it yet you know His little Whatever like barely peeped my radar you know So hopefully hell do something better like get my attention or whatever
War Lab call us haters all you want
Fuck it call me a hater full blown instigator
Leavin niggas on intubators breathin like Darth Vader
I hate people that pack guns but they dont bust em
Or bitches that come back to my room but they aint fuckin
Pistol clutching the Dozen you heard it dont get is misconstrued
Whatever we doll hit the news once we get the tools
If youre an MC and you mention my name in the wrong way you draw first blood Im gonna come at you
You pushed D12 to the side to sign Voltron 5
If Proof was alive hed be dyin inside
You aint no hiphop messiah you a bitch cause you dissed Mariah
Shit like that supposed to be private
Ima fry you on behalf on Mariah and Michael
Put you back on them drugs make you suicidal
You cant shut the record down nigga its viral
When you use the word nigga just remember your idols
I got a question Im white can I join D12
Ill sell you four million records then Ill tell you go to hell
Leave Swifty in charge then remove all the stars
And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar
An assault lawyer stop the beat suing us all
I really do hope you know who get involved
Cause Im a fan and Ill get you for a Nick Cannon dissin
And you already know how fuckin sick Canibus is
I hate a bitchass nigga just as much as I hate fags
I love goin to war but I hate when they raise the flag
These niggas hittin the streets spittin venom on me
Then start renegin the beef I hate peace treaties
Forever yo enemy I increase beef as Amityvilles finest
Cause I dont believe in stoppin violence
Im a tyrant thatll snatch my respect and scram
I use a Uzi cause I hate a Tec when it jams
I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie
Usin rap as his excuse to do shit and they only move keys in the booth
I piss on niggas hands whoevers grown patches and tombstones
I hate em ass when I break into a home
Im barefaced I clap your cat ransack it
Thats what Im wearin black and I hate goin out the back
So call me a hater walkin detonator I aint afraid
To stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators


Youre an emcee big small it doesnt matter
No matter how big I get I just want people to know
You the devil in a red dress on MTV
You signed more black people than a basketball team
What you trying to say subconsciously You cant rock the beat like me
Consciously you know I rock you to sleep
Slim Shady you a coward cause you scared to rap with me
The only black man you respect is 50
And the greatest rapper of all time was dead right and dead wrong
You shouldnt have even been on that song
He fell off so hard this faggot broke his accent
Im flippin through the channels seein Bruno get his ass sniffed
And Im disgusted man what the fuck is wrong with you
Whyd you date Mariah Mariahs not a fuckin dude
You never even saw her nude and you busted too
Must have been thinkin bout your stepdad touchin you
But that aint nothin new I asked your ugly crew
They verified it so bitch quit lyin
I remember the first time we met I aint even liked you
Walkin around my video set like you was in high school
It must excite you seeing black people being tribal
Thats why Dr Dre signed you
I bet you right now you got a big rotten Rosenberg beside you
Trying to be just like your father inside you
Your Stan android fanboys need to kill that noise
I know what you thinking kill that boy
We leavin Elvis funny money makin pelvis shattered
Lets see you square dance now lets see you hold your bladder
Lets see you fire back Em wheres the fire at it
Suicide hotline time go dial that
Put on that 8 Mile hat and write a vile track
Get at some people that can actually diss you back
No more target practice on retarded actors
And pop stars Marshall youre not hard
Whatever happens to me in this game Ive always got my ear to the street
Whatever happens to me in this game Ive always got my ear to the street
Whatever happens to me in this game Ive always got my ear to the street
Renegade Schemenegade you pink like lemonade
Ive been better than you before Genesis was made
You aint better than Black Thought you aint better than Mos Def
You aint better than Canibus Professor Griff Hotep
So Renegade Schemenegade you pink like lemonade
I penetrate through Halleys Comet with metal blades
Yeah You and I both know why Im saying this
I hope Whoo Kid get fired for playing this
Get off Nikolai Volkoff mazel tov
Ready to show off fofoll blow your do off
Blowin off steam goin off the beam
Let the nine sing bitch this aint a dream
Bitch Im the king color me bad
Skinny jeans what happened to the sag You makin me mad
Yall a bunch of JJ Fags now who the fuck is bad
Motherfucker Im bad
Call me a hater
Im kinda doing this deliberately cause I wanted a reaction from him
Oh you want us to get him on you two can go at it
Well that would probably take up the whole hour and we dont have a lot of time so you can do that
Laughs 
Stink niggas and they go tattle
It tastes like when Eminem and Canibus had a battle
But you cant invade me though
