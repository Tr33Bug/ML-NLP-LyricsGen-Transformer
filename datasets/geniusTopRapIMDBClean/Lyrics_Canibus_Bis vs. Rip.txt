Bis vs Rip Lyrics
The Ripper echoes
Dear Boss
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track
Yo you fucking hate me you fucking lock me in the basement
And you still want me to protect you it doesnt make sense
CanIBitch I supported you like a weight bench
Without me youre defenceless you better face it
You aint show me love when you was at your apex
Getting paychecks up at the radio with DMX and Flex
Catching wreck while Noreaga was catching his breath
I had to keep the situation in check
Look at the varicose veins in my neck Germaine is the best
The industry fucked you Im just paying em back
Whats the matter with slaying jackers Thats all Ive been doing
Besides talking shit I aint done nothing to em
They just mad cause when I see em I dont run up to em
Between me and you yo you know I run right through em
Calm down
Who you telling to calm down nigga Im a ripper remember
I told you not to do Gone Til November
But you wouldnt listen I always had your best interests in mind
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
If it wasnt for me youd be writing pitiful lines
On stage if you was tired I was spitting sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
I would just be quiet stand to the side and let that shit ride
But Im getting tired of having to remind you Bis
If it wasnt for me nobody wouldve signed you Bis
What Rip Why you tripping you know its a crazy business
You a lying ass bitch and you know it
Group Home was part my company I coowned it
If its one thing I learned in show biz
Stay focused and dont quit Rip
Why you talking bout old shit
Germaine you fucking water brain
Dont you understand fuck the mainstream
You should just call out names
The industrys all about game I shit on em all the same and I leave spit stains on their brain
Like liquid chocolate spilling over their new white trainers
Insane is an understatement Im Satan
Canibus is a Mason I dont know what the fuck Germaine is
I just know that both of yall are trying my patience
I dont give a fuck about a beat Ive been rhyming for ages
Rippers are dangerous all jackers are afraid of us
You wanna face me Bis Kick a rhyme
Thats ridiculous  aight then listen to mine
I jump in a costume impromptu just to rob you
Put the nozzle to your eye ball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Bury you next to shark fossils make it impossible to find you
Depths that Jacques Cousteau himself wouldnt dare to dive to
With goggles oxygen bottles and Doppler effect modules
Lock you in a time capsule smash the console
Shit on you in reverse and suck you in a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
Youre nothing but a coward in the cold freezer with a hour to go
Watching my Casio stop watch counting it slow
Like drug lords checking to see if its talcum or coke
I can kill you by drowning the globe
Or I can just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
In battles Im a thousand  0 I silenced the Pope
Do you know how many rhymes Ive economically grossed
No I thought so neither do I
Its a dick between your mothers thighs divided by pi
Im the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
And probably in existence Whats your consensus
Study my own syntax statistics since 96 with CPA certified assistance
I made a decision that my standards are above precision
The only thing I can honestly say I love more than women are dope writtens
If it aint dope then dont spit it
Dont be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice your penmanship
If you cant spit at high temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to manufactures specs youll make a mess
And rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disk
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this Bitch
Welcome to the serpentine world where I spit
The world where I twist the world that I rip the world where I live


Okay Rip you made your point I cant outrap you
You said you was the illest I would never doubt that too
A lot of these rappers is jealous thats why they attack you
They think you the best thats why they wanna battle you
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
You are the illest alive thats a fact that you proved
Just a couple rappers dont want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didnt sell enough units to be honest with you
Nobody knows the truth you got talent out the gazoo
When niggas first heard you it was like Man on the Moon
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
So what if the ladies think hes more handsome than you
What happens if the rumours about being a faggot are true
Look what its running into
I dont feel like having this discussion with you Im tired of fucking with you
Niggas in the game dont wanna do nothing with you
Bussing with you going one on one with who
They wanna get rid of you Shit is too lyrical
Headhunters out to get you Thats why I had to protect you
I wouldnt disrespect you as another intellectual
Without you Im unsuccessful God bless you
What makes you think I left you or why Id ever be tempted to
Ever since my third album Ive been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm Im representing you
You Rip the Jacker I would never question you
I respect your opinion as a professional nigga
I just want you to listen to what Im telling you
What happened between L and you forget it
People know you won the battle they wont give you the credit
A lot of people dont want to admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
And be involved in sharing the merits Im forever indebted
I just need you to chill for a second
So I can send a positive message like 2Pac before he left us
The author of the work ethic Genesis
Has inspired me to write the ExeBis scripts as a constant reminder not to forget Bis
But Ive reached a precipice remember Rip
You cant rhyme forever theres always somebody with better shit
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
Youre a commodity Rip aint that how you wanna keep it
I keep your whereabouts secret
I bring bitches to the crib every weekend so why is you beefing
Aiyo stop patronizing me you despise me
All you wanna do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was a priority youd acknowledge me
You aint shit neither you aint got no college degree
You cant rhyme without me stop smiling at me
Give me the keys to the garage I need to borrow the Jeep
Get the fuck out my face Bis
