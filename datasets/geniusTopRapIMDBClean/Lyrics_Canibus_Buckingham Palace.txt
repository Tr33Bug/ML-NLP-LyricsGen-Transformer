Ayo I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace sellin reefer
Puffing the chalice with the Beefeaters
Getting so high that whenever I drop shit
Itll land on the window of your airplane cockpit
Canibus with the hot shit crazy eye clique
Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin they can stop this
Ill increase my strength to a superhuman extent
Nigga your rhyme aint worth sixpence
And if you can hear smell see touch and taste
Then you dont need six senses to feel me punch you in the face
From Brixton to Clapham Common
My lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin and murder niggas for rhyming
Spittin fire with gasoline for saliva
As drunk as Lady Dianas driver with reporters behind her
Alcohol in the hands of a minor
I got you panickin like bombs with thirty second timers
Clear the building evacuate women and children
Fuck what you feelin nigga I came here to kill em
Straight shitting from New York to Great Britain
And when we do shows we make the Queen pay admission
What
When I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus 
Yo when I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus 
Yo yo yo
Prepare for the worst this next verse is the face of death
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex
Illmatic my lyrical skills are Jurassic
With more flavor than Skittles when Im digitally mastered
I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet with no fear
Like them clothes white boys be wearin
Im tougher than denim lethal like venomous snake bites
The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights
There aint a party I couldnt rock believe that
There aint a microphone brave enough to give me feedback
Im strong my word is Bond like James
Niggas be tryin to test but they weak like seven days
MCs run away when I kick it
They act so chicken they should come with a large drink and a biscuit
My styles radioactive massive atomic
I plan to push the Earth in front of Halleys Comet
Breaking the facts of life down like Tootie Im raw like sushi
With more vocab than three fucking Fugees
So recognize or be hospitalized
Cause lyrically on a scale of one to ten Im twentyfive


When I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus 
Yo when I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus 
Yo yo
A little bit of weed and some Hennessy
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy
See I need much more energy then my enemies
If I wanna make more bills than Bellamy
So I could be on MTV
With women constantly telling me I resemble Billy Dee
I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene
Then when Im on the scene I do shows to get the green
Then I take the green buy a automobile machine
For that thing on page fortythree in Jet Magazine
Canibus is the ultimate executioners dream
Swinging the guillotine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it
Dont ever get it confused
Fuckin with Canibus the human Rubiks Cube like you got something to prove
Yo whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles to bar stools fruits and foods
You got a album out You get hit with your CD too
Runnin outside cryin lyin denyin
That you aint The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him
Whats the difference Yall niggas still aint in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
So wicked I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin white living the hype he ruined his life
But Im a MC of a different type yeah thats right
Make sure your shit is tight or Ima snatch your mic nigga
When I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus 
Yo when I say CanI you say Bus
CanI  Bus  CanI  Bus
