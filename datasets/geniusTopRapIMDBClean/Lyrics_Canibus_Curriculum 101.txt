Claims are being made that for me go far beyond the available evidence and in fact in many cases are contradicted by the evidence and that bothers me
Forensic psychologist Samuel Dubios explains
Youll probably never understand Germaine
Incoherent speeches puzzles in pieces
The subchemical deepness of his glandular excretions
Realms of Heaven and Hell
Glowing angelic gel spliced with bovine leukaemia cells
Demons in Hell they call to me I scream What can you offer me
They reply TechnoSorcery
They tell me the meek will never inherit the world
Cause theyre weak standing on two 12 inch feet
I dream quasiDraconian dreams when I sleep
Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest
In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease
Where the living eats the dead and the dead reek
Rock bottom transforms human beings to beasts
Why the fuck you think we got canine teeth
Its the optical stimuli of watching men cry
I hope Ive got time to repent before I die
Bury me at the beach if the sea is out of reach
Cause when I speak whats fluid becomes concrete
Like a falcon up in the sky ten thousand feet
Looking down at you bitches looking at me
Phase shifting to 45
Im too crooked to see I memorize the books that I read
Sucking from the breast of knowledge  constantly weaning
Unbeseemingly a genius without meaning
Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling
Handcuffed underwater without breathing
Near death on a fatal quest for air
But why should anyone care He put himself there
His career was based on facing his fears
To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs
He didnt mind the cold stares he got from his peers
They couldnt tell him where he was going or how to get there
Its better to be prepared and fail
Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed
Dont rhyme like I used to but I still got skills
More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt
Hunting MCs like hunting elk
Camouflaged in the dense brush for stealth determined as Hell
I dont do this for anybody except myself
Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf
Fuck the promo nigga I do this for dolo
Flow from the first hour to 2400
Round the clock as long as Ive got a cup of cocoa
But Ill be a noshow if my girl cries Dont go
And she gives me blow more than two times in a row
Id rather chill with her than kill you with a rhyme that I wrote
Count how many mics I smoke minus the GOAT
Bus is dope my battling average higher than most
When Im on the mic I release fire from throat
If you disagree please do it quietly folks
Anybody better than Bis must be a hoax
Black man No What about the Great White Hope
What Man you must be sniffing great white coke
Dont you know thats like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk
Still not even quite that close a great white
Biting your rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast
What the fuck is the Mathers with you
Ill beat you black and blue then Ill get a tat of you too
Better yet Ill put a tattoo of me on you
A ten by ten C logo  neon blue
The most theatrical MC battle of all time
I rip jackers like you you know my call sign
Killer cobras that hover over Jehovah
In motorized autogiros with sycamore rotors
Hydrogenperoxide gaseous vapors
Technically these words shouldnt even rhyme off paper
In theory for every soul that can hear me Ima blaze them
In practical practice my styles even greater
Cant you see what Im spitting Cant you hear the difference
Compared to me youre energetically inefficient
You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
Youve got to rewind every one of my lines
Do you know how to paraphrase
Do you even understand what the narrator is tryna say
The climax explodes nobody can foreshadow my flow
Figuratively the language is too dope
Academic journals print my lyrical quotes
They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote
On any track I come off strong automatically
Whether I write in an active or passive capacity
Poetry that I spit is synonymous to a glyph
Written on tablets of clay mortar mix
Superb truly superb Analyze the words
Its like observing the birds fly above the Earth
The Eye of Horus the miniature torii within a giant torus
With singularity on the chorus I still sound enormous
Borderline insanity trying to break through humanitys border
With a new curriculum every quarter
Im the porter of the portal of the Secret Mic Club Order
Baptize you with Jamaican white rum and water
If youve got a hundred bars then I know youre a warrior
Ill be the one who awards you and pins the medal on you
Dedicate a song to you because now youre honorable
You want a record deal
Explain the lyrical Grand Unified Field so I can test your skill
Do it in front of the class chart diagram it
And write it in Latin not Spanish god damn it
Step back so I can look at it
No puede entender las palabras que digo senior Williams 
Huh What the fuck is that wack shit
Youre clumsy and dumb like a hand with five thumbs
Welcome to Mic Club Curriculum 101
