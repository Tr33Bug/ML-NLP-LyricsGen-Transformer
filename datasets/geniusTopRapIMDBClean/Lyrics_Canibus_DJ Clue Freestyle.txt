Word up
Yo what up This is Canibus about to black out
Representin Group Home shout out to Lost Boyz Def Squad
Charles Suitt Mr Sexx DJ Clue and Desert Storm
Lets drop it
Haha Hoo Canibus freestyle niggas know Clue
Yo I speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin
Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineering
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Fly around the Earth twice without refuelin once
Aint too many categories I can fit in when it come to spittin
Cause Im overqualified for the position
The laserguided lyrical hybrid
Creatin scripts so sick I gotta armwrestle my pen to write it
Dont get excited cause if I ever catch one of you wannabes bitin
Were gonna be fistfightin
So motherfuckers what you want I got the shotgun pumped
You feel like a frog nigga Then jump
I posses the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warmblooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of ya crew
The type of MC you cant outdo
Ill battle you on the net Ill battle you in the flesh
Ill battle you over the phone you can call me collect
Ill battle you for the respect Ill battle you over a blank cheque
Ill battle you with a gun to my neck
Ill battle you standin over the toilet with my dick out
Ill battle you jugglin a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinkin a Guinness Stout doin a 360 spinout
I stay righteous like Farrakhan puffin on the marijuan
You understand where Im comin from
You number one Then Im negative two
Basically nigga that means Im still better than you
Basic mathematics the verbal mechanics of rhymin
Behold I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
On the microphone Im sicker than those
Whove AcquiredImmuneDeficiencySyndromes
And every word I utter for hiphop lovers
Will reflect forever like two mirrors facin each other
The baddest MOther FUcker
Let me break the style down so you dont have to wonder
I walk the BLock with GLock COcked
Tryin to get the DROp on the COps
Blow spots capsize boats shipwreck yachts
Headshots hit you at 300 nautical knots
You callin the cops complainin about the hiphop
Gettin Benjamins like The LOX it dont stop
Eheh eheh put away your burners you cant serve us
My whole camp is allergic to bein murdered
Metaphors is proof I got more than just a couple screws loose
Latinos call me the Black Jess
So for all who believe the telekinesis of Jesus
I touch a paraplegic and heal him
