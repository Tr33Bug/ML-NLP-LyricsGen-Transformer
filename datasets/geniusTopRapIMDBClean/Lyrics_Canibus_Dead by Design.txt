Canibus
Throwing melanated molotov cocktails
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Ripping the jacker aint nobody nastier
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
Canibus the lyrical adjective killer
My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets
Come take a walk with Canibus
Ardipithecus Ramidus what the fuck is Melatonin Magik Bis
I still aint understanding this shit
Okay my brain is a microchip
My two balls with a cane is a macrodick I rap so sick
I created swine ploo out of an infinite mix
You tried to diss but cant even spit you just stand there and wish
With your hand on your hips man you a bitch
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
You see thats my problem I spit a thousand bars yall was silent
I aint heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized cant nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children dont understand the concept of consequence
So yes its immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being misled
There are forces above them that feed off our stress suffering and debt
I am Dead by Design cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33 let me say it again
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
You tryna to plan a great escape Youre a coward
They gon march into a gas chamber make us think were taking a shower
Mommas and babies is crying
The children of Zion belong to Skynet nobody knows whos behind it
So if you dont care fine then I dont care either
But I aint spineless like you Im a true believer
In the metaphysical aether you listening to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher empirical speaker
After this album they gon call me a leader
But Im not Killuminati just gon murder me like Pac
Blood sacrifice or not I dont even wanna be alive
If its like that then fuck Tiamaat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standing there staring fuck everything on this planet
Including the evil spirits notwithstanding the aliens
Acting like they dont hear us theres no need to fear us
Just come done and help us I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that dont mean Im selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy crunchy black crawling out of Hells pit
You scream for hardcore I felt it
But what you gon do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit
You wont do a motherfucking thing
Cause let me tell you why you a coward and you dont know shit
Cause if my Brothers stand next to me the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they aint ready for their own freedom neither they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat em
Like thin crust pizza Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers good luck with Jesus
How many meters Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons just to get even
Thats where the biggest demon is
Its no secret but nobody else sees it so they wont believe it
But thats when I calm back down the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps wow
Knock knock whos home The black Dan Brown
I didnt mean what I said please dont kill me now
My ghostwriters not around plus it was just a freestyle
But at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile motherfuckers still mad I feel bad
Id apologize but you acting like a real fag
What the fuck Im supposed to feel like
Twelve years later I still dont get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I dont want to talk to you now
Itd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
They still ask me about Second Round even now
Interviewers voice  Canibus can you tell us of what happened again  Look at this fucking clown
Cant get over it they ask me a loaded question
And act like I was the one promoting it hang up on em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate twelve years later Im on some other shit
And so is the whole world look at the mother ships
And so is the whole world look at the mother ships
After this album they gon call me a leader but Im not
The Illuminati just gon murder me like they did Pac
Blood sacrifice or not
Its Professor Griff the exminister
Signing out
