Dr C PhD Lyrics
Doctor C
Yo I plan to build myself a facility before Im forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon14s
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name bombard your brain
With gamma Xrays til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
Its like trying to ride a bull
Lets have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice CedarsSinai room
So I can get sick as the flu spittin the truth
If you aint got this album you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though Im not in the mood
Motherfucker you didnt win cause I cant lose
Give the fans the chance to choose fuck you
Whos the illest Whos it really up to
Rapping fire you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis aint dope you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker my great grandfather was Irish
Lets roll the dices Ill break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man I dont need no hype man
Put a thousand on me put one on him
I tear off his limbs throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo I soak that sugarcoated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss turn that noise off
Call Detroits Mafia Boss
Tell him Yo I got a job for you I want you to bust his balls
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
Im the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood sweat and tears sucking it up
Yo you wonder where I am right now
Im probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin divine you cant get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C Ph D graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you cant see
Butcher on Broad Street wrapping CDs
In butcher paper doing artwork with Sharpies
If you dont like the quality then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep
Punching the keys remember that sound
Thats exactly what it sounds like when Im punching your teeth
Kick a rap bitch if youve got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man double the beef
To tell you the truth I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside blah blah et cetera et cetera
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
Nigga look this is all I got to say
Suck my PHDICK
