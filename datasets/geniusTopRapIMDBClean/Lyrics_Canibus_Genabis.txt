Genabis
This is Genabis remember this
In the beginning I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactics
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic and I couldnt kick the habit
I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle I had to take the day off
I was exhausted I guessed my work will never pay off
But if it happened it to Him it could happen to me
And if it happened to me it was destined to be
Yo Genabis Exobus Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet Im restricted to touch
I read the cosmos what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis Exobus Levitibus
There aint a mic on this planet Im restricted to touch
I read the cosmos what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
They backslide back to church and call a ministers bluff
They rather remain unenlightened then listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the Sun
One small step for man one huge step for mankind
I am the red giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second
Flow is untested those that Ive threatened fold under pressure
At 120 beta cycles high volts ignite your eyeballs
Until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cones rods melt one at a time till you realize you in Hell
Rip the Jackers not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me

First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew
Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru
The followable audio propagates the possible truth
For proof Im the illest so the choice is not unto you
See the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Puts Canibus in scholarly periodicals
The article is substantially impressive more than a message
A working thesis from several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap musics tentative
Entered apprentices this is Genabis
