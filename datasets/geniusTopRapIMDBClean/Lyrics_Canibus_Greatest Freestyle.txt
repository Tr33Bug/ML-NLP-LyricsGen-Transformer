I think fast switch fast quick fast quick as
Immigrants say No habla ingles at borderpatrol fences
Messin with Canibus is senseless
Divide my senses by six and youll end up with triple sixes
And triple the digits mean triple the spirits
My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics
Im triple the threat Im triple my physical flesh
Im telling you put your money on me then triple your bet
Cause I wont be satisfied til Im set
Til I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect
Rhyming is the ninetofive that I manipulate best
Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript
Called The Biography of Canibus subtitled The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit
How to tonguetwist how to enunciate certain shit
How to control your breath how to make your syllables spit
Yall niggas aint listen to Bis I kill em with shit
Im wicked with this I should be selling tickets to this
Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this
My fans in the street with signs tryin to picket for this
Saying We want Bis We want Bis
We want the rapper with the illest lyrics
My dedication and my commitments beginningless
I can go four quarters or nine innings for this
Go twelve rounds play two days of cricket for this
Lead crusades across Europe like the Christians for this
The notion Im dedicated is an understatement
My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian spacestation
Sneakattack rappers grab em and slash em
Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors
Hunt em like Jurassic Park actors
But spare Samuel Jacksons life
Cause he was the only black one
Actionpacked like Shaft the black assassin
Blastin the 753 backwards Magnum
Follow me down the road to Damascus
Do not follow these madmen poppin ecstasy pills like aspirin
I and I come fe manifest the most high
Drink a gallon of cyanide and still cannot die
Niggas want to lock the Chronicles of Canibus away forever
And put my book of rhymes through a shredder
Never Im way too clever the way I manoeuvre
Beat your ass like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua
In front of a hundredmillion payperviewers
Your career is ruined
Your face will be swollen like the Benihana Buddha
Bring it to ya prove youre a loser
Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future
Pounce upon you like a puma or some wild cougars
In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through em
Ima reprogram everything that youre doin
Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booin
Youre stupid you and your whole crew are extremely foolish
I cant cipher with you cause your breath is too putrid
Put your mic down and step away from it
Shut your motherfucking mouth and dont say nothin
You have the right to remain silent
Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestylin
I heard a rumor English women make love the best
Is that true Cause I aint had no justice yet
A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is
Bite the style but cant digest it
Til they get karatekicked in the mouth
And their teeth get ejected
Told you to watch who you beef with on the last record
Platinum teeth I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece
You buy one back and you get one free
Put it down in the East put it down in the West
Put it down on paper put the paper down on the desk
In the studio is where I put it down to the test
Its nothing but skullcrushing pressure down at them depths
Throw a rough mix down download it to disk
Give a copy to everybody thats down with Bis
Since 96 the Dogg Pound Remix
First time anybody put me down to spit
Its like Pac Man dont stop til I hear my voice
Banging up and down the block in a Magnavox
With a hundred watts
Creating ripples in the water like aquanauts
Breathing through their oxygenbox
I belong on top of the pops not on the bottom with rocks
I mean honest to God Im shocked
I thought the album was hot
I guess you cant write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind
Thats why rhymes like mine mystify mankind
A lot of rappers are ahead of their time
But when it comes to rhymes like mine
The word time doesnt apply
You see rhyming is the art
The microphone is the paintbrush
Responsible for getting the point across
The canvas is the street where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see
Nobody could rhyme this fluent
Nobody ever did what Im doin
Nobody ever spit what Im spewin
Im the illest alive and Ima prove it plus Ive got to show the people that Ive got mad love for Rap music
I bury MCs with rosary beads
A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me
Im as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt
Put some instrumentals on
And ask my pen to dance Im such a gentleman
Pull out chairs open doors never offend my fans
Unless they offend me and I lose my temper man
