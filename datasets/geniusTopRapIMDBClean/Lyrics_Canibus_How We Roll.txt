I never freestyle for free without chargin niggas a fee
Itll cost you a brain cell just to cypher with me
Im the type of MC that rocks for the glory
I dont give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me
Freestyle or written spittin with infinite ammunition
For anybody tryin to go the distance
I promise ya no less than a hundredthousand kilometers
My bomb threatsll have you evacuatin your continent
Im barbaric with the alphanumeric
Hittin you with lyrics that separate your body from your spirit
This is for wack niggas doin shows and shit
Cause Ill be in the crowd if you aint controllin it
Drop the mic you shouldnt be holdin it 
I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced niggas
We savages snatchin microphones from amateurs
Cause like women who get abortions I aint havin it
I rip you my metaphor content will split you
Into little powderlike crystals so I can sniff you
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian
Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias
Have you any idea what I do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career I ran through
Comin after ya blastin ya
With the shotgun like a front seat passenger
You must be askin for some sort of a massacre
Ill attack ya cardiovascular
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses
Rip your speaker to ashes and kick a hole in it
Cause Ill be in the crowd if you aint controllin it
You see I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced niggas
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced niggas
Im the illest lyricist in America
MCs cant see me cause Im too quick for the human retina to register
I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves
At a Speed that would confuse Keanu Reeves
So ask yourself who am I
Im the illest MC that you ever seen in your fuckin life
I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme
Till the meter says nine nine nine nine
Line for line I battle any kind of MC at any time
Whether they signed or unsigned
With many lines more lines than a million pair of Adidas
More lines than the Bible quoted from Jesus
More lines than a African herd of zebras
Niggas just aint fuckin with the Canibus sativa
This is for all you niggas doin shows and shit
Cause Ill be in the crowd if you aint controllin it
Drop the mic you shouldnt be holdin it 
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced niggas
See I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent chemically imbalanced nigga
