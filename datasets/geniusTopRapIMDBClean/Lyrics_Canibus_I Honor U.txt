Well never part through sickness and health
You are my heart I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep itll be alright
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep I held you tight
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
Ayo boy meets girl boy really likes her
Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her
Girl has no clue that boy is a liar
And he has no honor
So she dates him regardless cause she thought he was harmless
And he had her believin he was the man she wanted
To spend the rest of her life with
The words I love you are priceless unpredictable like rolling dices
Nonetheless in spite of the frightenin repercussions you might get
People still risk they necks
Of course its nice the feeling of courtship roses and stuff
Women never get it often enough
And the reason people love they mother so much
Besides the fact she carried you for nine months is trust
Its a five letter word that should only occur between him and her
Before the bees and the birds word
Well never part through sickness and health
You are my heart I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep itll be alright
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep I held you tight
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
I heard a soft moan in the middle of March
Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart
On your mark get set go I was off
Flagella was my propeller wigglin back and forth
Then I set a course for the border
Mother Natures karma callin me to the Rock of Gibraltar
The competition tried to be smart but I was smarter
My competitors were swimmin fast so I swam harder
Submerged in water prayin to my Heavenly Father
If I dont make it through Im a goner
Screamin out Death Before Dishonor
Because Im awesomely stronger my stamina lasts longer
I was destined to be a son instead of a daughter
XY is the male chromosomal order
Onell stay alive and survive the restll be dead
Cause Ima be the one to fertilize that egg
In the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep I held you tight
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
Ayo mommy Im up in your stomach buggin
Whenever you rub it I love it
Like a comforters covers you warm as a oven
Your husband  stubborn how can you love him
Smokin cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that Im comin
Bad move you hopin that daddy improves
Knowin in your heart thats bull because hes too cruel
Youve been abused used youve got wounds and scars
Think with your mind not with your heart lets go to Grandmas
Terminate the lease call the landlord
Give your job two weeks notice pack up the car and go to New York
What part They got a little borough called the Bronx mom
And I heard thats where hiphop is gonna start
Hell yeah I think we need to be right there
Four months in your stomach and I already chose a career
When you cry I hear and I wish I could dry your tears
But I cant cause Im stuck in here
Five months from bein able to lay against your chest
I cant even hold you in my arms cause they aint developed yet
But I swear to you as to Gods Almighty Truth
Ima be there for you Ima be there for you
Well never part through sickness and health
You are my heart I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep itll be alright
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin in your sleep I held you tight
Ill be there for you if you tell me all your secrets
