Yeah Ill buss em and you punish em
Uhh yeah
Let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Ra let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Cmon Ra let me buss em  Yo Bis you can punish em 
Yo yo now on some battlin shit my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the ADAT when Im trackin my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits cause Im back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditatin on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign with a deeper conscience
Than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talkin but I ignore it
Cause its garbage and your rhymes boring
So keep standin on the corner
The trash manll collect you in the morning
Thug cats frontin wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the Raptor Wagon babblin about nothin
Fuck that real Rugrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at
So dark youll never see the blood splat
And you cant even react
Cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed cause you too scared to come back
You cant even breathe the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MCs haul ass like they runnin track
Where ever Canibus or Rakim is at what the fuck
Let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Ra let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Ra let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Cmon Ra let me buss em  Yo Bis let me punish em 
Be ready and at your best the Celebrity Match of Death
Heart snatched through your chest cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms catch your breath
Then I ask the ref How many cats is left
Oneonone who challengin Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishin kids
Abdomen punctured in look what I done to his wig
Wanna live Then I stab em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at any place any time
Get your snotbox smashed with a nine smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain what its like seein your brain
You insane whos gonna ID the remains
And then I reincarnate em and kill em again
Again and again again and again cmon
Let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Ra let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Ra let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Nah let me buss em  Nah Ima punish em 
Cmon Ra let me buss em  Yo Bis let me punish em 
Yo yo yo he started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
And chopped him in the Adams apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So Imma twist em up like a pretzel then Imma tag you
Im on some Stone Cold shit warn your whole clique
Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split
Who wanna spit Bang em quick strangle em wit his lip
Try to flip leave his body danglin by his hip
Ra you left him danglin I cant believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like Im dancin with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10
Seven birds make em swerve til they vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word Ill leave your DNA on the curb
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard
Let me finish em  Nah its time to pin em 
Ra let me finish em  Nah Ima pin em 
Nah let me finish em  Nah its time to pin em 
Cmon Ra lemme finish em  Nah Bis Ima put an end to em
