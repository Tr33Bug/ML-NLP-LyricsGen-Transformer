ML King had a dream Benjamin Franklin had a key
Complex had the illest programmer ever me
This is my favorite rapper of all time
Anakin brandishing hammers in the Radison
Sharpshooting savages Madison and Aderson
Beat beats and banish him damaging challengers
Use the Sword of Excalibur to smash the Mayan calendar
Burn down the Vatican cover the 
Wolf the sheep we fabric were Being John Malkovich
Spoke to me in Arabic couldnt understand his shit
Spoke back to him in African the nigga dropped his hands and shit
Told you something ravenous microphone master shit
Clones get out of line Sun duke theyre gonna handle it
Psychopath maniacal laugh one was flying too fast
Twofaced assassin behind two masks
First place reserved for last my first verse is mad
My second verse removed the earth from grass
The sunburst blasts its not fair
I only take cash you get the fuck out my cab
Postmillennium with Libyans on a sybian
Im in my robe feeling this here is a mercy killing
Take both hands break the planet in half
Then resculpture the plaster to resemble the master
Total disaster Ill mob in a flash

Soon as you move Im dooming you
Night owl broke his wings but he still climbed out
Ate that rat inside out let me find out
Look up in the sky and cry out what Im about
Before we start theres a couple things we gotta iron out
Hip Hop scalding hot dont care who know my name and not
I chose to kill a microphone on the block
Double barrel apparel pull back and cock it
Collaborate that where the fuck is the deposit
If it aint a threat then it must be a promise
You said my name so much they think you being honest
Its more than that we couldve recorded a track
You could give me a stack for a verse just like that
I dont know whats worse AIDS or cancer
Your stupid ass questions or your stupid ass answers

Let me introduce you to the master
