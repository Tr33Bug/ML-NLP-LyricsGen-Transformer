You want powerbut youre not big enough
So you steal it piece by piece tainted and spoiled
And youre weak step by step youll weaken and the power
I harness the power of the chakra remote viewing into darkness
Describing what I see in the process
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
Geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of polaramine makes it feel like a dream
The dream state is the playground for the supreme
Critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
To create a universe all I need
Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees
Sodium 22 betatrons and a cloud chamber
Keep the noise down so I dont arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened CocaCola can
Showed the whole plan in coded program
Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band
Hold up let me load it in
Put a curse on you
You want to take over
You clash with cyanide gas and die fast
Another mystery Are you gonna put a curse on me
Theres no need
Rhythmical equivalent of solids liquids and gas
I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
You diss me out of pride but when youre finished
Talking about money and bitches youre simply out of rhymes
Even my worst album was sublime
If I dont slow down Ill distort the timeline
Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again
A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon
The grand architect
Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet
No regrets you live and you learn
Im through giving advice I just give concern
Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs
And try to rebuild all the bridges Ive burned
I prefer modesty over controversy
But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me
Jealous because they cant rhyme like me
And they never had a scientific mind like me


Im above average with verbal semantics
The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad
They look at me like Poor bastard
Why cant you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic
No matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw I grabbed it obviously thats the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness
When I wrote that Stan shit
But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
And Ill come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls
If you can find a better flow
Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
Hey you shouldnt fall for the naivete
Lyrically Im the illest but my beats is okay
Food for thought nutrition for the whole brain
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
Im ahead of my time or so they say
I guess thats why I already feel old and grey
OK thats enough knowledge for today Im killing them
You better not forget it cause this is Levitibus
