Once more it has been done
That in order to save it you would have to raise the spectre again
I am going to tell them the truth about their ministry of justice
But if we didnt though it would surely be cause for war
OK its time to get started dont want to but the forces forced me
With incantatory allegory they translated for me
UMLOUT Umlaut
Thats the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit drooling out a very grotesque view at best
Burn through desks at the University of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
Concentrating looking at you
Freeze frame frozen at the very moment
The wormhole opens you know Canibus has spoken
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
To me Ezekiels Wheel was just a spare tire
My epithelial genetic fiber
Was forged in the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can described as a white iris
When the absolute began I dont know where I was
I must have just been a piece of micro dust
Thats why I the fuck love mics so much
My micro macro robotic rap flow
The Magna Carta of the entire Rap world
Mayflower 2002 Phase 1
Adapt to the pressure gravity has laid on my lungs
The theory of communication Claude Shannons dissertation
With a makeover in camouflage makeup
Light waves bend to the weight of Bus
Mics buckle with white knuckles metacarpals crush
Acid reflux all over your face you fuck
Grab heart with bare hands squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me Give me a call

Dear boss you mind if I share my thoughts
Psychotherapy is expensive can you share my costs
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Excessive roundedness no space between words
Excessive crossouts it must be my nerves
Rhymes that vaporize disablize and destabilize
Pray to God say Goodbye
Six minutes Vinnie Paz youre on

Im the God of War the resurrector of the Horrorcore
The carnivore destroying you wasnt hard at all
I started raw so the haters could see what could happen
I was Allah while the pagans were speaking in Latin
Im the origin of science and math
Im the origin of everything you trying to grasp
Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real
Well Ill let you in my mind and you decide how it feel
Im dying to kill and bring to you apocalypse
I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips
Fuck the head Im aiming right for your esophagus
Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips
I got the power of the lead a fucking shotty spits
And leave you weaker than the Mafia thats Gottiless
With Canibus get deep like psychoanalysts
Vinne Paz the fucking HandtoFistPhilanthropist


What Its fucking Vinnie Paz daddy
Yeah Jedi Mind baby
For the people of the world
Canibus baby
Let it now be noted
Mic Club whats the fucking deal
That here in our decision
This is what we stand for
Justice Truth and the value of a single human being
