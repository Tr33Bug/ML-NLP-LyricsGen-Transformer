Gimme some more slack on this rope
I run your boneyass throat over in a zodiac boat
46 degrees north 6 degrees east
The Large Hadron Collider gave birth to a beast that speaks
They quote my speech vocal motifs over dope beats
All lyricists know me
Thats why the industrys debunking my lyrics
With digital trunking equipment they dont want you to listen
The Rippers language wont appeal to the masses
Because they look past it
Only the masters know the seal of the scarab
Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances
You organic piece of shit you substandard
But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status
Its up to you to find the right questions and ask it
Research leads to results sometimes we find meaning after
Other times theyre just meaningless babblers
Dont believe these rappers fake unbelievable bastards
Comet Elenin is coming straight at us dont believe NASA
Take matters into your own hands
Stop being slow and acting like hoes get with the fucking program
Hip Hop is the greatest genre known to man
If we focus the poetry is so advanced
We can overthrow any plan and control man
You got soul Lets Jam Lyrical Law Im the Canibus Man
Whats the buyingminimum 88 sales program
And the number of stores I dont care no more
This is Lyrical Law Noir hardcore raw
Metaphors for you and yours you cant say you wasnt warned
Thousands of bars them dummies couldnt stomach my bars
They rather conform they throwing up their pompoms
You dont wanna wrestle with Armstrong
We sever blood vessels tryna mess with the gods poem
Damage any motherfucking beat that I rhyme on
Connect to the gods thoughts project your iPod I grind hard
Intellectual hardboard take it back to Hip Hop style wars
Grunting like a pack of wild boars
Power source Lyrical Law my bomb squad full force
Call em off we got too much torque
Nitrous Oxide Bars pull a bull off course
Pitchfork to your neck just to prove Im raw
Iron horse smack DVD battle rap boss
Slap you with the flat part of the sword now you back for more
Passing yourself off like a rap star but you support whack bars
Thats why rap is lost  fact
You a Cool J crack whore
You snitch like police labradors tryna sniff out Sasquatch
Man up no more lipservice and backwalls
Stand up Ima break off your back paws thors hammer crack jaws
Attack yall fracture your scull
Mountain man axe to your loins
Selfemployed like Donald Goines
Cash cows on steroids
I dont fall for deceptions or decoys
Im a beast and Im clairvoyant
Yo soy gon tear the beat up whether or not you appear on it
Double trouble dear promise
Fuck you and your comets
The chairman and Lyrical Law will be honored
The last man standing after the internet is abandoned
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
The cops brainwashed Hiphop
And they came from Saturn
They were the first alien race of rappers
They landed in NorthAfrica
Their teeth be gnashing
Their names look like acronyms
They released the kraken
They live in underground cabins
They sliver fast through the innerearth labyrinth
They move in Spatterns though deep planet chasms
I chase em and trap em
Detailing the action
For tryna desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master faggots
I laid them on top of each other like Abu Ghraib
They spacecraft look like the Eiffel tower in Paris
They pray for my downfall and orchestrated hiphops imbalance
They underestimated my talent
I hold the globe up like Atlas
They lied about Canibus  ask em
Im the worlds greatest motherfucking rapper
They slandered my character through the public propaganda
They tell the people Im Dr Doppelganger
They ask me shit did they know Im not gon answer
Extinction level event they cant stop the disaster
Cocksucker stop the camera cause you know that Im a miserable bastard
I crack lens break microchips and melt plastic
You Canibus  Whos asking
Thats Captain Cold Crush to you maggot You a lyrical hasbeen
Lyrical Laws a classic they cant get past it
The beats the rhymes the features every single facet
Lyrical Laws a classic they cant get past it
They beats the rhymes the features every single facet
The microphone assassin bout to get at em
The Dragon of Judah breathe fire til its last breath
Full battlerapper in action lyrical metal jackets
Coming through with several new attachments
Computers is crashing hackers is laughing
Rapid eye movement try to keep up with the captain
Whats happening
