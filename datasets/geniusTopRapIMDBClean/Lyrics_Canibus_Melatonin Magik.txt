Yes uh yeah
Professor Griff Public Enemy Number One
The Minister of Information
Yeah Canibus
Its Melatonin Magik yo
This is Melatonin Magik Sumerian Chinese Egyptian Latin
Nobody can match Canibus when Im rappin  What happened 
Captain Cold Crush get it crackin
Theres more than one person right now thats not laughin
Squash microphones with unknown chromosomes
To discover the codes that controls the brains frontal lobes
The pineal gland glows  Go go go go go 
Dont look back I got ya back bro
Hes a high profile target code name Sergeant Armpits
He was Rakim Allahs first artist
Lemme bus em nah Imma punish em Ra
Imma show you how the mothafuckin government lied
Got nothin to do with pride you must realize
Few of us will be alive by Solar Cycle TwentyFive
I tried to look for solutions thats not enough time
They wont be satisfied til every one of us die
Aight calm the fuck down and listen to my rhymes
The only way that you can free yourself is your mind
First thing you gotta do is put the antagonism behind
Then you gotta put ya life on the line
The reward is great the risk Even greater
Fellowship can only make a Braveheart braver
Watch who you followin watch who you praisin
Yes We Can backwards is Thank You Satan
Yes Im Jamaican Yes Im a patriot
No I will not forsake you for a paycheck
YES this is victory YES I can taste it
NO Im not a Mason Im followin my trainin
They monitor my body functions from central London
My heart rate is thumpin I suffer from numbness
A robot arm shoves the drugs in
My scrubs are disgustin and sullen I smell like cub skin
Funky funky funky odor Bridgewater South Dakota
My spit fizz like soda Im in a coma
In a pagoda nurse McLovin
Says she wouldnt fuck me if I was her husband dont trust the bitch
Im in a warehouse alone I hear doors open and close
No phone no Intercom controls
Wouldnt matter anyway Im in a paranormal zone
Goose bumps grow I could hear a few ghosts moan
Im a mastermind
Tryna amplify the frequency of the rhyme
So I can learn to fly
So yeah fuck a punchline
Im past that prime thats not a crime
So go find someone else to dick ride
Focus on the truth its long overdue
It woulda never happened if I told you what I wanted to do
The Inconvenient Truth is a convenient truth
2012 solar cycle 24 comin soon
I promise you Canibus achieved the impossible
Its only logical its time for the truth
Whether Im gonna be around to witness it or not
I spit this shit for hiphop
Twitter niggas type their hype they write Canibus smash the mic
Cause you cant blackball the light
They know my hands always been tied
You call that a fight
Give me the mic I call in an airstrike
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Theres some things in this world that money cant buy
Respect honor fuck it its all corrupted
The media can not be trusted
You shouldnt need a budget to rep Hip Hop
You dont have to suck dick just to get your shot
Just work with what you got dont be a robot be human
Influenced by hiphop music
It aint nothin like it aint nothin like
It aint nothin like hiphop music
It aint nothin like it aint nothin like
It aint nothin like hiphop music
50 plus bars is some new shit
Its called Melatonin Magik and music
Yeah 50 plus bars is some new shit
Its called Melatonin Magik and music no bullshit
Take it back to 1997 exclusive Clue shit
The most abusive MC in hiphop music
Lyrically you cant do shit
Uh
Melatonin Magik allows no MCs energy to escape
I seal their fate
Canibus the last MC at Gods gate
Melatonin Magik uh
Melatonin Magik the perfect absorber of light and all energy frequencies
I eat light to maintain and expand evolve matter frequently
Melatonin Magik uh
Melatonin Magik Im the Energizer battery
Magik I sent Duracells to hell I increase the charge the way I spell
Melatonin Magik
Canibus drop it come on
