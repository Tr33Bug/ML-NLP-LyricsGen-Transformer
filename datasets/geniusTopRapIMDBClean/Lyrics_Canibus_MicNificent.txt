Yo sittin on chrome sittin on low pro 20 inch Firestones
Grippin the road with the wickedest flow
Bis is a pro I zigzag through a slalom
Accelerate and decelerate in and out the cones
Poisonous poems travel through Walkman headphones
Into your dome Osteoperosis your bones
Whos the nicest nigga you know in the year 2triple0
Spit turn to icicles in the mid air and slit your throat
Drain your carcass dry rip out your heart bitch
I write rhymes using your blood for my ink cartridges
Paleoanthropologists polish the bones of rap artists
After I dip in my hydrochloric waters
CanIBus with the seams burstin perfect
Everyday the Earth spins I write verses
My sole purpose as a verbalist is to make my words twist
And connect em like letters when theyre in cursive
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
Yo yo 
Im faster than leopards running across the vast desert
At 22 yards per second to catch me the daily delicatessen
With 30 minutes to eat em 40 minutes to digest em
And 50 minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question Can the Canibus rhyme
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine
No time to make up your mind you wanna run or die
Clip you while you running by trip you up from behind
My rhymes confuse niggas like somebody tryna gangbang
Wearin a blue shirt and red pants
Throwin up signs with their left hand standin out on the corner at Wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband
God damn eggplants niggas gettin me vexed man
Cause Im surrounded by garbage like Fred Sanf
And I cant seem to get away from it I dreamt that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds in the life before that
I played trumpets to warn you that I was comin
Theres one billion ways to die and I already tried
Ninehundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steadily dying
That nigga CanIBus is still in his prime bust a rhyme
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warningI prey on em I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
Club Dodge  I wrecked that Limelight  cursed that
Envy  I murdered that Club SoHo  never heard of that
Wetlands  dried it up Cheetahs  inside the club fired up
Looking for a chicken to tie ya up
Club New York  I heard its hot there beats be rocking there
Too many niggas be getting stabbed and shot there
Speed  I slowed it down The Tunnel  they hold it down
Home of the underground why they always close it down
Century Club   the hot shit House of Blues  I rocked it
112 ATL  thats the Dirty South bomb shit
Synagogue  yeah I be there Caribbean City  roll deep there
Lyricist Lounge  they be some real MCs there
