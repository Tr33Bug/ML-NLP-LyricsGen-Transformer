Only Slaves DREAM Lyrics
Do you think that the powers that be
Are goin to let you do what you want to do for eternity
Of course you dont so what do you fear
Why you spazzin out why you so scared
Everybody wanna be first
Nobody wants to be last
Do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh
What happens when the money system crash
And theres no more value in the cash
You gon suck dick and sell ass
You gon try to fight back with ya hands
You probably change your money into gold
You gon use that to try and buy soul
Buy some drugs with it buy a piece of hole
Dont tell me I dont wanna know
You need to come up with a better plan
The Devil smash metal weapons like glass
Right now we outmatched and outclassed
We have to stay on a spiritual path
Cause in the absence of love we blastin one another with blood
Media shows up to capture the buzz
Im a child of God not a rapper from the gutter
Im six of one and half a dozen of the other
This is not one of those I told you so moments
This is just Canibus being open
Lower egoic minds brush aside
But cant nullify the high science that is coming from the rhymes
I couldnt believe it the day that I was told
That every person alive does not have a soul
And is not in control of these cotton pickin polls
Politicians declare the war of attrition on the globe
And stole all the fishin holes Grandma got the chitlins on the stove
Thatll overload the senses in your nose
Young folk cant even afford to get old
How many YouTube views before you go gold
How many albums last week you sold How many leaked downloads
Oh you still believe the Soundscan bro
Dont be discouraged write and produce and record and you love it
This is your art and thats the point of it
When you get paid from it things change people behave stubborn
And say rude things to judge it
They want you to thug it so they can have you like a test subject
Handcuffed and take mug shots of it
I told you before Im nobodys spit puppet
I say what I want you take what you want from it
This is a social experiment put on by the public
Hiphop is completely corrupted
You aint rappin bout that you aint rappin bout nothin
I aint never gon starve I been white tail huntin
Yall motherfuckers is buggin speakin with no substance
Hiphops the way it is because of you cousin
It aint my fault you locked me out of it
99 percent of my fans aint nothin
But scumbag scum buckets blood suckin cock fuckers
My lyrics too advanced for the average block hustler
You know my name Im deeply inspired
On a mountain lion meat diet eat and be quiet
Recycle the fire and deep fry it
That line is hot but you said it before you get a C minus
My shit is timeless like the Great Wall of China
Sick in the biggest way like a dinosaur virus
Spreadin through Verizon Wireless
Homeland Securitys tryin it just to see if you lyin Bis
They step to me never thought it would happen like this
You a flight risk we need that microphone back Bis
Diversionary tactics Magik madness
Canibus you cant leave this miserable prison planet God damnit
We dont care what your fans think
Cause 99 percent of all of this dont exist
The observer changes the properties of the observed
This is done with your mind not with your words
Word Yeah Im about to show you nerds
You bookworms really startin to get on my nerves
I cant talk like you but I can understand you
I know what this entire ordeal can expand to
I love hiphop Ive always been a fan too
Im a big fan of everything you do
I appreciate the purchases the online searches
I hope you enjoy the verses it was great to be of service
This was always my purpose
Im always workin to be a better person everyday
And still growin like the Earth is
Peace to the Gods and the Earths kid
