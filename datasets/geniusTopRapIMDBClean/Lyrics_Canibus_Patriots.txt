I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth to full then I feed you to the pit bulls
Dont even talk about guns
The only nine you got is a five dollar bill and four ones
So I dont give a fuck what none of yall niggas say
Cause anything that cant penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on a record
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when Im in wreck mode
Explode leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in
Is that all soldier
Yes sir
Is there anything you need
No sir
Report back to me before the briefing at ease
Are you a Navy SEAL
Yes sir 
Then say it like you mean it
Tell them who Free from the Navy Seal team is
Free be the one rocking shit special operatives
Specializing in weapons diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
Im strangling niggas with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldnt be 5 feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
How many gigabytes does your hard drive hold
Or does your hard drive fold once the signal hits the node
Beyond mission control the theory behind your thought
Marie Antoinette behead me I still rock
While you choking suffocating off your own testosterone
Im known for breaking levels down to the values unknown
A specimen with extraterrestrial estrogen
Kick your intestines in sell your testicles to Mexicans
I bring the force like a nutcracker
Annihilate rhyme hackers Navy Seal linebacker
The last Oedipus remains unclaimed
So if you buck against Free you better tattoo your name
On your teeth
I disintegrate those that oppose
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I suppose you wanna run your mouth like castanet
I put bitch niggas to rest in a bitch bassinet


Is that all soldier
Yes sir
Is there anything you need
No sir
Report back to me after the briefing At ease
Are you a patriot
Sir yes sir
Then say it like you mean it
Tell them who Canibus from the Navy SEAL Team is
Im the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitchass niggas and bitchass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 45th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual Im as different as anybodys fingerprint is
If boring is the norm Im the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging buttnaked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
Im the type of nigga that will prove it produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
Cause long after yall are dead and gone
Ill survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod
Is that all soldier
Sir yes sir
Is there anything you need
Sir no sir
Report back to me before the briefing At ease
