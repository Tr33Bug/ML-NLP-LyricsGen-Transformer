Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you
Okay fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you okay
Yo yo ayo nobody can flow with Bis rock a show with Bis
Or go toe to toe with Bis none of yall can coexist
We livin in an Ice Age and its cold as shit
A hundred thousand dollar price range niggas is frozen stiff
All I know is this my felt tip hotter than hell get
A hundred eightysix thousand miles per sec can melt flesh
Give a nigga a tan
Aerosol cans expand and explode in my hand
While I promote that new Canibus jam
Niggas feel it underground with stalactites hangin from the ceiling
Im out on tour with 30 city trips
Every state its like bitches be bulimic for dicks
Screamin the chorus halfunconscious I hold my cordless
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest
While the people go insane for us
I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us
Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I aint payin for it
I freestyle the whole set
Kickin a hundred bars nigga fuck whos on next
Fuck you
Fuck you fuck you
Okay fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you okay
Fuck  Them extra niggas thats always around you
Fuck  Niggas that talk about you and try to clown you
Fuck  Niggas you run into that never did nothin for you
Fuck  Niggas thats lyin tellin people they discovered you
Okay fuck  Niggas thats jealous cause you nicer than them
Dont give a  fuck  who you offend you gotta fight til the end
If you  fuck  a groupie chicken when you out on tour
Smoke a little bit of weed with her then  fuck  her some more
Tell her to bring three friends so you can  fuck  all four
Menageatrios what the  fuck  she expect you a dog
Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls
So if you like to  fuck  pussy that dont mean that you wrong
Unless you  fuck  it raw dog
I  fuck  a nappy dugout bust in her mouth
Kick her the  fuck  out
Shell cuss me out like
Fuck you fuck you
Okay fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you


Yo yo your superstar status dont mean shit to me
Lyrically sucker emcees still get fricasseed
Try to diss me now how you sound
Yo whoever signed you must be runnin the circus cause you a clown
You a rapper with a drug habit hidin the truth
Camouflaging ya needle tracks with some colorful tattoos
You was never equipped for this never equipped to spit with Bis
Im swift as shit let me point out the main differences
You magnificent Im micnificent
Yo Id even go out on a limb with it say you write a little bit
That dont make you a tight lyricist
Cause you dont practice or stick with it
Look at the 60 hour shifts I spend with this
I never quit I got a gift for the art
A low maintenance cost no physical movin parts
In 98 niggas thought I was God how the fuck did that change
Im still one of the illest niggas in the game
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see
If you see a hungry nigga then you lookin at me
And its aight if you dont trust me cause I dont trust you
As a matter of fact Ill probably buss you motherfucker
Fuck you
Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you
Okay fuck you  for real  fuck you  nigga  fuck you  bitch  fuck you okay
