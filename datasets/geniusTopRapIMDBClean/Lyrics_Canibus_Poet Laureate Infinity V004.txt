And this is where the the uh complexity comes in
Maybe we in modern uh civilization havent really connected with this
Understanding
This is never been done before with a rhyme outside the realm of time
Its the first of its kind
POET LAUREATE INFINITY
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
I procured a small piece of the treasure
Collections from a former era datin back to forever
The warrior became protector take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a hundred The Game spit three I said Fuck It
Im a have to show these niggas somethin
33 is the number that enlightens the Brother
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome what should we call it Mortars
I drive forward Sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force
Would give us all what we needed we were wrong
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
The results from SETI very interestin
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testin
You cannot contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose and throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime Chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lyin
SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop whinin
Instinct controls how you think before decidin so keep vibin
The Art of Rhyming Ive mastered it certainly
Surely Ill celebrate capturin it for my Taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To jungles in Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed Identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Movin at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
Nobody could hold me back my flow bloviates into a spiritual shape
And cocreate rap cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smokin a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
Systematic Global Geographic Systemic Neosynopsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
Clairvoyant Technique usin XRay refraction
Not only can you see into the future see past it
But I dont know what it means
I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say its more than a dream
Kill you with weed vapour then the Taser then the Laser then the Maser
Then somethin they call Scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Why Coupe de Grace for the Coupe d Etat
In a man made lodge the Moon Rays replace God
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
I have mastered The Art of Rhyming now I am so bored
I seen a mushroom to the north from a porch
It was odd every dog in the neighborhood barked
Cause Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions and
Reality
But what is attracting me
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Black List Registry
Observe the man with the microphone strand
Or 5th or 6th cause way more advanced
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorje come to me
Sittin down at the mixin board comfortably
They begin to study me by showin me worlds I would love to see
A stationary pulley drawin from a wishin well
The Genie gave me three more because I listen well
Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
Metaphoric Sun Worship pullin me like planet inertias
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
Rap Music Profession Immuno suppressants
One question per second one answer per session
You lazy and you wanna be the best You crazy
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spittin inside a Zero Vector System
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
Fuck a record deal my trainin is real
Look at the sword I wield you will taste my steel
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course
But the secret to creativity hidin your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them I hold their humanity hostage
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fightin the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where will we go
Are you food for the Moon Or are you in the mood for doom
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
Fuckin bummer no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfuckin Sandbag for cover
I ride on a flatbed chariot four ostriches carry it
Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I dont want it thats why Im rarely seen in public
If I were you I wouldnt waste time readin rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet NIGGA LOVER
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind Waves Bars and Rhymes
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of INFINITY
You lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Ive apologized but I cant change who I am
Tried to change the future cant budge the past
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip that is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shuttin your mouth
Agonizing the pain of the migraine bitin my brain
And everything inside it I cant explain but I am tryin
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone you cannot comfort me like my poems
THINK SO Youre a talkshow ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who can tell me that this poem is luck
Does it amaze me NO Does it faze me Maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate dough
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Williams you gotta go first
If you say so HALO High Altitude always stay low
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
1000 Bar race at an unrelentin pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War VIII
Food supply low they speak of goin above ground to find mo
I cry out NO  DO NOT GO
The window is closin from the other side it looks like its openin
Where am I tryna to go with this
Only the chosen find a way out
Everybody move out Make sure to stay off the main route
Arctic Geography is conducive to Astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
A good Psychological environment for science
Im memorizing and visualizing peace and quiet
Comparative image sharpness between artists
I dont think you know what youre about to get involved in
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
Tunnel borin and jackin water main tappin
I sat there draftin a new drainage plan laughin
Scientifically Quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style its like tryna to ride a Bull
The lyrical anaemical is miserable because Ive built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Creatively I have never been to this level
First Ill put you in a sideways 8 then a pretzel
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofin remediation
Any and All entry points have immigration
She asked me if I was followed I told her I wasnt
I didnt know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
Populace uniformed is a populace of slaves
Washington didnt say it quite that way
Musically still producin I got a couple new things cocoonin
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit
Pulsating Lights and Sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearin
The Electrical Optical Coupling Gear is effective
Ive almost perfected this
Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testin it
My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease
You cant Emcee take a seat
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you who wildebeest Williams is
You better be filming this
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missin
Spend the whole night out binge drinkin
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost which version is this Mozart
With a flowchart puttin together parts of an unknown art
Rhymes compartmentalized separatized to prevent bootleg Pirates
Be my guest keep tryin
Im hooked on HipHop I cant live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I dont doubt it
The Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
You said the best shouldnt ask for respect
Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES
Thats not possible thats sounds completely illogical
You mustve been kicked the fuck out of school
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You gotta take prudent and precautionary measures
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
A Luciferian web everyday we are buryin dead
Every color in America bled this is Empirical evidence
Of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin
Of nothin on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
The head of a Lion the legs of an Eagle
The wings of a Dragon and to the people
I hope the words reach you
There is strength in numbers there is numbers in strength
The ink I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
Everybody bow your heads say this prayer
From this moment HIPHOP IS UNITED EVERYWHERE
POET LAUREATE INFINITY
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
POET LAUREATE INFINITY
POET LAUREATE INFINITY
POET LAUREATE INFINITY
THIS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN HISTORY
Its all about becoming more
