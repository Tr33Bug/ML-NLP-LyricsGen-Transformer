Yo Houston to Earth watch the Ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm red alert nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat its obvious I cant eat what Im worth
Yall niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of yall suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with Sir
Critics went berserk they aint even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus but what did it cost
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like what the fuck he dissing him for
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
Im one of the top five nigga my shit is tight nigga
You heard it right nigga I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isnt where I belong
The top four dont even look in the mirror no more
If they did Id be in the mirror looking back at em
Ready to grab them kidnap them and put them on my album
I rip jackers Rip the timespace fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Keep firing at you till you trapped in
Noncombatants scramble for helicopter extraction
While Im back at Fort Bragg bragging
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press
With an imaginary address Canis the best
Untraceable your pictures unpaintable canvas thats wet
Let me dry you off wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like 14
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine OK
Im reloaded you fucking wit the wrong MC
CreutzfeldtJakob disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars aint impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fucking wrestle wit me
You aint better than me you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid the cake icing of rhymeness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining climate
Of earths environment Im entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they cant possibly interpret yet
Thats why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you rip on you
Then I defecate what I just digested on you
Im better than you Im better than you Im better than you
Just to get the chequered flag Ill put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you write a motherfucking letter to you
And your editors too threatening you
Detective check your mail and your messages too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
Im a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrue fame but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks enhanced advanced
One of a kind like modern mans retina scans
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first Your jaw or your grill
What type of spit you want from me Sparkling or still
Study law Yale draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania
To the flats of East Anglia give up you cant keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreading Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to incite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me keep fucking with me
Never under pressure I keep the pressure under me
Burn the weed
Drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mum getting DPd
Im one size away from 13 believe it she peed
Im the illest and its gonna be that way forever
Word of mouth is good but a mouth of words is better nigga
No body gets sicker than the Ripper
