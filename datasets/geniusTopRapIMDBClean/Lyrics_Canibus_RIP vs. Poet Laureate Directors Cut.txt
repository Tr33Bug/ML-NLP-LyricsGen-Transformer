RIP vs Poet Laureate  Directors Cut  Lyrics
You have proved your valor yet again
Let us hope for the last time
But theres no one left to fight sire 
There is always somebody left to fight
Are you an ego monster writing ten thousand bars
Ill melt your squid face with ten thousand stars
Your battle raps dried up like the ass of the Sphinx
And your brains fried up my verses make your ball shrink
Ill kill you like Marie Curie with Ionizing Radiation
You are facing termination by your own creation
My metaphors mechanics will toss you off the planet
You smoke too much chronic my vocab is volcanic
Infinite beings with black bars that eat through rap stars
Travel time in fast cars you fire past Mars
I ran back home to battle Rip on the phone
Right after I cracked CanIBitch with the Mayan Sun Stone
You say well live without fear for several millions years
If you hold hands with your peers like a bunch of queers
My Stryker Brigade driver strike a gay rapper
I leave Rip dehydrated with lines of hot lava
I tie you up with a snake shaped like a sideways eight
And watch you break and suffocate at an unrelenting pace
Mechanical skeletal structure was designed with a Heavy Mental
Your minds left behind its as light as a feathered quill
The Will of Knowledge God controls thoughts and movement
And force CanIBitch to eat atomic waste pollutant
LL crucified your career with The Ripper Strikes Back
I slice you from ear to ear whos the Jamaican in the body bag
Rip the Jacker quantum creator the quasar quaker
So many layers I cant demonstrate it on paper
My melodic emulators cut you down with trachea lasers
Of deeply deposited argon vapors
My every verse is a psychic institutional burst
I choose which layer to listen to first
At the peak of the Bell Curve earthquakes make me misspell words
But loud and clear my every verse is well heard
They barely understand you
The unseen hands that sample you and command you its quite puritanical
Henry Louis Gates Jr said I was a lyrical computer
A great leader of a spiritual movement
Homo Noeticus student the cosmic human
Homo Evolutis divine rulers from a digital future
Im a poet not a puppet I spit these rhymes without a budget
With more infinite rhymes than cousins
Nonperiodic comets halotolonian bubbles in solidified rock deposits
When you take the time to unearth what I did
You will witness infinity every verse is a bridge
Uneasy lies the head my crown is too heavy for your men
The mixing board got a thousand channels plugged in
Music generated user generated mixing board entertainment
For you mental entrainment
You rhyme til the meter says 9 9 9 9
I rhyme in a straight same line until the last trickle of time
I know that seems wrong but my conscience is long
Begone but silly call me tongue rippin
But Rippers got his own song
You could never hold me back Dr Frankensteins monster
Im so abundant so my story Rip the Jacker is not redundant
True Hollywood Story I battle for the glory
I will become the final chapter a Canibus allegory
I made a name killing jackers and washed up rappers
I dont care if you pull the trigger on the wounded
Mr Mathers have you had enough yet  check 
The devil creates that probably the best yet
But tell the Infinite Laureate
Couldnt even work the con solo your own time machine
100 years early when you exploded onto the scene
The tattoo on your arm now belongs to me
I will inscribe it with the words Laureate Infinity


The mic on my arm is symbolic for a knowledge bomb
Celestial arms spiral into viral columns
I was betrayed the moment you were born
And more often than not I say it in my songs
All day long I talk about Lyrical Law
I reserve the right to say whatever I want
If God kisses your face and the Devil kissed your ass
Then how come you aint got no goddamn cash
The breakaway civilization generation on blast
The human population is reduced to ten percent of the half
For those who love to laugh
Bolides collide with incoming craft
The geography is nanoscopic nanotypography
If you dont understand dont mock me
The midnight lyricist with a one thousand bar cylinders
A Rippers lyricism is unlimited
Laureate Infinity
Was the freestyle nigga thats me live
And for that youve gotta spend time on the green line
I destroy a whole city block then  hey a sturdy cock
Finger touches on the flintlock
Make sure they put you in the dock
Turn your back on your  fans
With Hip Hop for Sale
And so it became a total fail searching for the Holy Grail
I possess  with the rhyme control
I profess that it is my fate to swallow your soul whole
When you need a new fix you use an Infinity mix
And never give me the credit
I feel degraded and sick
I am the hip hop God inside and IronMan suit
Rhymes ricochet back bounce back
End up killing your own troops
Gettin tired of having to spend time with you
Rip you gotta go first Rip
You will become my mad bitch
2007 to infinity  on my enemy
I will forever be the illest lyrically
The opening mechanism for the Sphinx is behind the ears
But there is freedom behind your fears
I am the autistic King Ellipsis who broke the Ecliptic
But dont nobody wanna listen
After twelve I turned into a Rakim gremlin
Bear witness to my lyrical fitness
Paranoid chilling Bob Dylan Hip Hop villain
Lyrical Law from the heart of the Dark Lizard King still spitting
Kill a gilla reptile with poisonous venom
Giveem a pulmonary embolism when the rhythm hit em
Bus em punishes women and children whoever wit em
The illest alive still living still spitting
The audio master blast you with a vocal sample trigger
Im the illest Im the illest Im the illest
They got their plans and we got ours
Plus I got my own plans if something goes sour
Got cut by other emcees for saying they aint worthy
Got kicked the fuck off Universal
For smoking Ecstasy Purple
Rip the Jacker you are crazy
Williams is just lazy
Battle you 10 times on the same day
cause you never did amaze me
You got the parallel action write lyrics
Unbeliveable you got a parallel passion for leaking your material began using punches
Because your brain doesnt function
Since the night in the Rockies
With the military function
Producin bars
Of percision incredible 
Follow your  and intuition to finish the last mission
Buried on Mars 4 hours after spittin your last bars
Your spirit becomes infinite lyrics to the stars
If your face can melt
Fuck Rip the Jacker I appear courtesy of myself
From the North to the South Seond Round Knock Out easy
Fast acting bio hazard my verse is a surface burst
Blasting and attacking and backtracking through a massive magnet
Global area with a bio location for rappers
Vocals powered by zero point magic motors
How many times you done this before Bis
Created an album that some love but others dismiss
My heirapparent is trying to hijack Hip Hop
Using some fucked up mixing board spirits
Everything Ive written for my brothers and sisters who still listen
This aint no fricking fake reality vision
This a real mission the real wheels of steel still spinning
I laugh radio DJs ass kissing
How far would you go to be a rapper Ask em
Beyond the absence of light is only blackness
How far would you go to be a rapper Ask em
Beyond the absence of light is all blackness
Im cancerous
So when I diss you wouldnt want to answer this
I could bust Eminem in a minute
But you aint shit Canibus
If you mastered the final lesson
I could be your secret weapon blasting whoevers testing
In less than a half second
Killing bars by visionary lyricists
With a light saber channeling raw visuals forever digital
Darth Vader Rip the Jackers archnemesis
Specialist geneticist put you in a labyrinth
Then send them transcripts to Genesis
I said I said the best shouldnt have to take a breath
Thats correct yes you cant ever pass the test
The most powerful in the booth harness the power of PLOO
I cant rest until I decapitate a body
And prove youve taken a break for water
Is my signal to start slaughter
Creating heavenly ordered
With swords from border to border
Rip the Jacker is living off his speed
I kill rappers battle the last jackers
Feed on bloody cold cadavers
Two hundred bars eleven minutes eighteen bars per minute
Yeah I still got it can you fuck with it
Superior rhymes recorded in sidereal time
Uncontrived and alive by design
Tiger tooth Spiderman diving off the roof
Smile its the truth when Im rhyming over loops
Im in a spaceship minus the roof
Yeah a real spaceship something I designed in my youth
Let the world know the truth
That I designed iller records than you
I wrote produced and recorded and released a lot more records than you
Just thought that I should get more credit than you
Cause Im better than you
See you can lie to me but dont lie about me
Is that all you got No wonder you grouchy
My lyrics sound horrible your voice sounds lousy
So why you still be up on radio talking bout me
Catchphrase me if you can nobody rhyme like Javelin Fangz
I grab the mic with pure knowledge in my hand
Jump off the bridge you fake niggas scram
Ill strangle you with dreadlocks and my bare hands
Take you to the ground release no release Im a beast
Run out of wind Ill hit you with the piece
One two three deceased
Its already chaos going on in the streets its just you and me
Imma make you eat everything you said about the kid
Hip Hops one of those things Im proud I did
I respect your whole catalog and what youve said
And Imma share your legacy with the ones who care
They say Hip Hop is the greatest story never told
Imagine what itd look like at a hundred years old
You cant use mind control on a timeless soul
An emcees lyrics defines his role
Close encounters with the poetic Buddha
Outside Infinity City with programmable lifeform producers
The Grand Deception thats what it was
The idea of aliens or anatomical subs
For dinosaurs that feed off our flesh and blood
They worship the Sun put you to death if you run
The serpent from Eden at Glen Rose Texas museum
Whats the meaning They lived alongside human beings
Visible photography blends with lomography lens
They cant copy no matter how they pretend
The Canibus Man is just apocalypse in a can
But Rip the Jacker spreads soundscapes across the land
Constant to your death signals Hip Hop jingles
I could literally kill you with a Hip Hop single
SEI is now online the next verse reverse time
I can float a pound of steel with my mind
Tesla shield designed obsessed with unlocking my mind
Cause there is no stopping my kind
The photons of life phase conjugation on the mic
My rhymes rematerialize as light
The lost unified field theory of Maxwell
They know I rap but they didnt know I rap that well
I cant deceive you the truth is out there for the people
The lies are transparent to see through
I dream the galactic green the Northern Lights in the skies
Uninhibited by the jet stream
God is within me God is within you too
And together we will find the truth
They said You aint the same Rip Canibus Poet Laureate
But you never check what Germaine think
Project CCgate spit comet sized C spaceship
They so shocked they didnt say shit
Lyrical Law is all about the lyrics
And it goes a little something like this hit it
