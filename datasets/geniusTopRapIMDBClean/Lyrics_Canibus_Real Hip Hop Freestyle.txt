Canibus 
Yeah lets go
Yo yo
I put it to you so raw you probably OD on the floor
Thats what you get for disagreeing with God
The Lebron James Bond my aim with the arm is so long
That I can tag along with Socom
I spit to the beat flip like Swizz did to the beat
At sunrise I spit to the East
Niggas talk shit in the streets when they about to get released
They aint got no lip for the beast
Make you strip like police I point the heat
From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep
Got a pistol grip hawk with a chrome beak
Shit is so deep I check to make sure theres no leaks
Looking like Jada in a black Jagari
Half Jag half Ferrari the valet saw me
Shorty want to know how the flesh work
Whats under my sweatshirt thats why I hit the gym till my chest hurt
Next year summer Ima kill the conjecture
For now Im just a hustler trying to give you my best work
