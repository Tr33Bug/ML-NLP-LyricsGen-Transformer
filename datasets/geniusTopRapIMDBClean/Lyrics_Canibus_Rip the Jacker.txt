Calling all dogs calling all dogs
Be on the look out for a big homo nigga with dimples
And Imma let yall know somethin it aint just start here
Weve been preyin on that ass since Jack the Ripper
And now its time to rip the jacker
ahhhhhhhhhhh  
No rapper could rap quite like I can
You know who the fuck I am Im the Canibus man
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
That Im iller then the future the present and the old you
I told you wish you could take it all back dont you
Tried to smoke some cannabis but Canibus smoked you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you dont do
Cause after I humiliate you what will the GOAT do
You cant rap or act my main man
You goin end up as an intern working for Def Jam
See you was never bad enough to battle with Canibus
You out of luck I crushed you the minute I got tatted up
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasnt man enough
To be fair but Im mad as fuck and Ive had enough
Jack the ripper or Imma rip the jacker
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
Youre dead
Bitch
You told us everything
Niggas can catch you anywhere Todd
Yo theres a rumor going around that I got dropped
200000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
300000 albums were shipped you do the math
Thats 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
Guess what the GOAT aint platinum and neither is Clef
And Im still here inspite of all that shit them niggas said
The skinny kid the music industrys guinea pig
Tighter than ever worlds chief mic wrecka
Tougher than Reverend Runs muthafuckin leather
Im hardcore cum shot right in your wifes face
You soft porn you held hands on the first date
See when you was making records like I Need Love
Your homie Cornell was givin it to you up the butt
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
Nigga youre dead
You should have never fucked with the Canibus man
Yo you married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Youre probably mad as fuck wondering where I got the information from
Youre being watched even when you take a dump
Its impossible to front you cant hide
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
Youre living one big lie the world just dont know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The truth is Mr Smith you got a fucked up attitude
God knows that I pity your fans for backing you
Yo this be the realest shit I ever wrote
You should change your muthafuckin name from GOAT to GLOAT
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as Im alive
Your prime ended 8 months before 99
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Nigga youre dead
Thats why 2Pac said you was a bitch
If he was here you wouldnt have an acting job
I think you on that  too deep god
Yo Bus finish him off
I told you to leave it alone but you was too stubborn
Now youre in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
Your wife is scared cause she dont want to lose a husband
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You cant sleep at night thinking about the drama
Shit stains all up in your Phat Farm pyjamas
Even fubu gear looks hot until it touches you
Probably because your father undoubtedly buttfucked you
Mama said knock who out Ill punch that bitch in the mouth
Cause she dont know what she talking about
Ay yo do me a favor when you see your ghostwriters
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
You could have asked me Ill write you some lines
Ill do anything for the greatest loser of all time
You still drippin with wack juice cause you wack nigga
If you want the last word you can have it Im still iller
Youre dead
I think hes gonna need backup
I think hes gonna need platinum
See how it is nigga the same shit that make you laugh make you cry
And the worst part of it all you cant come back after you die
Youre dead
