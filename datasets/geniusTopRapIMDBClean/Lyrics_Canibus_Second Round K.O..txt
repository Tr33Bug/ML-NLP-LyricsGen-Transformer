Second Round KO Lyrics
Yo Canibus man whats up man
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man you were booming
But I caught these foul slouchass niggas you know I mean
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard man I wasnt with that
But I aint know you well enough to defend you though right
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game man theyve been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right you know what I mean
But they cant hurt us man we gonna do it
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You dont got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you man get up in there move that head man
Come on to me man but when you come man
You gotta come for blood man
Come up to me man come on bust that nigga whole
Man niggas talking that shit about you
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs for lunch breakfast
Hey man they been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they cant hurt us man
We gonna do it get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself man
Yo Ima let the world know the truth you dont want me to shine
You studied my rhyme then you laid your vocals after mine
Thats a bitch move somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum you only droppin clues
I studied your background read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drugfree role model you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you aint got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99 of your fans wear high heels
From IceT to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me You must be crazy
You drippin with wack juice and you cant get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start nigga
Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You dont want no bitchass niggas hanging out with me man
Were warriors man when we go into battle
We come out or dont come out at all
You better give me the respect that I deserve or Ima take it by force
Blast you with a 45 Colt make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war now you wanna talk
Its about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
Thats why I laugh when I hear that wackass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
Its because of him now at least I know what beef is
Its not what I would call this see this is somethin different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin off of dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin himself cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you somethin you might got more cash than me
But you aint got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
Ill let you kick a versefuck it Ill let you kick em all
Ill even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your first second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say Naw he started it he forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it man you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because its been a minute Ill forget it
Fuck that Cause like Common and Cube I See the Bitch in Yoo
And Ima make the world see it too motherfucker


Ladies and gentlemen we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds Canibus
Yo Canibus man you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man you inandout and youre agile with your flow man
But dig right you got to eat man
Thats your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you but dig right
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs
For lunch breakfast dinner thats your agenda baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence they cant exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever Mike Tyson on the def
