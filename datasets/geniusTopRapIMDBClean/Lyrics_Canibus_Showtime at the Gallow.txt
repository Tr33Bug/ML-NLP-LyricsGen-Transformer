This is Showtime at the Gallows
Rip The Jacker
Yo I dialogue with AmenRa til he gives me the nod
Or replaces me with a supercomputer automaton
I dont barter for time Im a martyr to rhymes
And a selfish soldier wit pride that was ordered to die
A burnin star in the sky my heart is warped wit a drive
Expressin thoughts through a rhyme my metaphors are alive
Its like Ive been crucified they hate me now like Nas
They punctured me through my side the bleeding was cauterized
I was revived after I died
Only then I saw how I was truly admired and worshipped like a god
Shitd mired up my mind they showed me a sign
I fell off the ocean liner someone throw me a line
Let the world know the truth but it became my demise
Motherfucker you know we even I dont owe you a dime
Sometimes I feel like killin myself theyve stolen my shine
I wanted to be the illest for a moment in time
From the ink to my pen to my pad to the ink in my arm
How can one diss song possibly last this long
Tyson aint the champ no more them days is gone
And Rip the Jacker aint too stubborn to say when hes wrong
I should get twenty dollars and go to Econo Lodge
And tie the sawedoff trigger around the doorknob
Call the police squad and tell them Im in room one oh five
And that a dirty bombs inside
Woke up in the cargo plane playin Christy Lane
For some entertainment while I train in the misty rain
One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus is playin
Im sittin there prayin you prolly cant believe what Im sayin
But the voice in the back of my head keeps sayin Germaine
This is the real deal man this is not a dream this is not a game
The only sixteen you got from now on is locked
And loaded and in your hand
Deploy or detach on land you the man
And the pain is the weakness leavin the body understand
I can reload wit a full pack call COMSAT
Tell them you need suppressive fire for troops in the back stat
Insurgence and counterinsurgence move wit a purpose
Absolutely mission critical you never get nervous
Applicate the shock tube to the surface
Standby blow it eyes open wit the scope on the terrorist
Tell him to go to hell in Arabic put a bullet through his narrow neck
Watch the wall behind him get wet
Im an animal Ill murder you and stare at your pets
Get the tape I know where the surveillance cameras is kept
If you want a confession you got it you want product Gimme 20 You want gossip Ill give you logic on any topic
Recordin the positive data
Rip is the best rapper go confirm the status
One million page dissertation written on paper
Cheap label from Pitney Bowes tree curator
My purification process is greater
But thinly tapered verbatim
My album is equal to over fifty acres
CanIBus before the Big Bang
And after the big crunch I only gotta say it once
Let there be light and I write a sentence
The greatest discovery since opethicus afarensis
Back to before Sumerians landed on the Canyon
In the Cambrian carryin bacteria with antigens
And Ninefoot stone mannequins
The key to nuclear power and Porta Libitinaria
Showtime at the gallow the Age of Aquarius
And Space Harriers lifes last barrier
