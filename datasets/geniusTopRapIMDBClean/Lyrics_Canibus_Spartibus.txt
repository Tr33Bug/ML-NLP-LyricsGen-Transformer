Spartibus
Yeah this is Spartibus
Yo yo yo
You wanna spar with Bus then lets get started cuz
Atomic thrusts turn you into cosmic dust
Bomb your borders with Japanese Spigot mortars
Recompose your composition to sawdust
Time is breath breath is life life is light
Light is no less than capital C on the mic
Beneath the mirage of night Ill attack you twice
Prepare the river sacrifice for my ritual rites
Reinforce my habitual likes and dislikes
Then diss you on the mic cause Im sick of the hype
No ones ever written what I write compare the calligraphy type
Tell me yo how can I not be nice
The royal semen of Caesar frozen in a cryofreezer
On sale for seven figures per milliliter
Lethally illegal I speak to the people
In the form of an eagle on top of the Thebes Cathedral
With boundless knowledge like hairless Dalai Lamas
With linen garments neatly wrapped around armpits
With monasteries in the mountains
Trumpets have already sounded you cant denounce my crown bitch
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Now tear it up yall and bless the mic for the gods
This game is Chinese chess
Countless issues need to be addressed before the East nukes the West
Totalitarianistic cause and effect
Run the words through a decompressor recompress the depth
Canibus is the most explosive next to meth
The inconsistency of the text makes me complex
Pay attention to Bis my intention is this
Leave you spatially adrift suspended in the abyss
Marijuana plant owner smell my aroma
Contract scirrhous carcinoma and retinoblastoma
Confederate federal general the electric general
FCC omnidirectional antenna poles
IFF identification friend or foe
This areas restricted dont let em through
Hell mock your style rock you to the ground
With the bite force of a Sarcosuchus crocodile
Travel a fiber optic mile before you can smile
So dont ask me why and dont ask how


Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Now tear it up yall and bless the mic for the gods
Until Im impressed with the print I can hear a pin drop like Sprint
Once it blends I can stop right then
Quantum coupling mechanisms and technical shit
Confuses you but I dont think youre any less of a dick
Just define what is poetry and what is rap
I demonstrate how to effectively bridge the gap
The answer is simple in fact
If the protons dont attack the retina all wed ever see is black
No ability no extraocular motility
Silly MCs cant see me lyrically or visually
Theyll never be better than me
Ill triple team em with a trinity severed in 3 and give em 9 enemies
Climb back to periscope depth in 2 hours
Surrender and throw in the towel
The amalgam of the ultimate album this is Spartibus power
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
Now tear it up yall and bless the mic for the gods
