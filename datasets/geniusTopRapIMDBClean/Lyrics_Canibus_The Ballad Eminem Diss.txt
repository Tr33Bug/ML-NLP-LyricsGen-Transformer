The Ballad  Eminem Diss  Lyrics
Canibus Canibus
Fuckin with Canibus fuckin with Canibus
Im about eight thousand miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an ad in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert out in Jersey last Thursday
A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
His rhyme was very weak I didnt know he had words for me
I bet hes probably never even heard of me
Ever since I met Stan he took me kinda personally
It didnt even occur to me he was involved personally
With Stan earlier than me now hes perturbed at me
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me
And anytime that Im ready that hes got a verse for me
Damn I didnt know he was that thirsty for me
I guess he aint the only emcee thats nervous of me
There aint a person in the game with more courage than me
From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef
What you want yo Red or white meat
Meet me in Petty Im with JRU and sightseeing
And man I got a nice feeling
Im working on my fourth album and now that I think about it Ive had a tight career
Havent I made it quite clear Lyrically Ill always be right here
And nobody can snatch my mic here
Rip the Jacker was a nightmare
Jack the Ripper truly reminds me of him and I dont really like that
What type of a life is that
Its like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap
Damn I can write raps Im good at it aint I
Niggas call my name out cause they want the mic back
But I raise the price so high that in fact
The market is collapsin niggas dont know how to act
I guess the worlds chaos is spinning over the raps
They make you sign a contract and con you out of your tracks
Dont act like you dont know Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit
I left you frozen stiff
With molten Aluminum and molded tip
Ill pierce a hole through a brick you know I can Rip
Say give me five Ill show you six quicker than you can blink
Probably quicker than you can think
As quick as ink drives my rhymes are contagious like pink eye
The hypnotize you to dickride
Im Illmatic like Nas and Stillmatic like Escobar
No Im not still at it with Todd
Dont blame me it aint my fault it never was
Before I even knew him I already had a buzz
But that was then and this is now
Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out
See Ive been there done that I dont even have to make a comeback
I move over to France where the loves at
Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks
Create a cure for AIDS with a device that connects to the nut sack
Capable of altering a mans blood pattern
Humanitarians will love that
I start a label with other acts get a couple plaques
And completely cover the map before I come back
I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss
Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis
Im an extremist when Im on some MC shit
And after this you could never not believe in Bis
Terry Stone UK clique keeping it thick
Use my name motherfuckers when you speaking to Bis
