Ill battle you on the net Ill battle you in the flesh
Ill battle you over the phone you can call me collect
Verbally vicious telekinetically gifted
Took a minute to exhibit that Im sick with it
Have you any idea what Ill do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career Ive ran through
At a thousand degrees Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Canibus is the type to fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beatin dead niggas to life
While you niggas is babblin
My lyrics is travelin like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen
The intellectual athlete accurately rappin so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically
I walk the BLock withe the GLock Cocked
Tryna get the DRop on the Cops
The Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin to damage you spittin understandable slang at you
Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns
Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for 10 seconds
Whats the matter with yall Ill spatter yall
Against the muthafuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
Ill hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
Til the meter says 9 9 9 9
Yea its the CQuel the CQuel Yo
Im hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
To every single pore in my skull
Hard from my mouth to my jaws
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my draws to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the third World War
So I can start World War IV and murder us all
I dont give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Dont give a fuck if you got ya picture in The Source or Forbes
I dont give a fuck who won an award
On stage tryna thank God Ill chop they tongue off with a sword
Let they blood pour all on the floor
If it aint a cordless they gettin punched in the jaw and hung wit the cord
Ill leave they corpse stiff as a board
Like frozen meat tryna thaw then bury em under the morgue
Gettin in my way is like jumpin in front of a car
Breakin the sound barrier that means the car is in front of the horn
By the time you hear it blowin its too late to respond
By the time you feel it hit you Im gone
Ill send ya to hell where you belong
So by the time ya body hits the floor
Ya spirit wont be in it no more
Who could flow for 4 minutes or more
Without breaks without mistakes without flaws
I got millions of styles and I mastered em all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall


Whoever grabs the mic after mell get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and ya crew
Im the illest nigga alive watch me prove it
Ill snatch ya crown with ya head still attached to it
I battle you for the respect Ill battle you over a blank check
Ill battle you with a gun to my neck
Ambushin emcees jumpin out the trees like Vietnamese
In fatigues covered with leaves
Next year youll be walkin around the How Can I Be Down
Conference with a laminate that said I Got ShittedOn By Canibus
Turn ya head round gimme the cheddar
Id rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever
Fuck yall you dont impress me and no one can test me
An emcee so ill I got AIDS scared to catch me
Canibus is what the hardcore niggas is waitin on
Debatin on what the fuck is takin so long
Well Im here now verbal ass whippins bout to get shared out
Wack niggas bout to get aired out
Faggot niggas get they ass teared out
Grab a wise man by his goatee and rip his fuckin beard out
Cold beat a niggas ass like Stout
Then bust a shot in the muthafuckin courtroom and watch it clear out
A hundred thousand mile warranty metaphorically
Ill use a hundred thousand styles and murder you orally
I took a lion on tour wit me made him respect authority
Smacked him in the head for tryna roar at me
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there aint nothin on this God damn planet thats worth more to me
In the name of HipHop niggas could corner me torture me
Slice me then stitch me up like embroidery
Way back before goldplated male and female
RCA jacks was used for crystal clear playback
I was tryna blaze ADATS and if a nigga said my demo was wack
Id beat his ass and took my tape back
Yeah nigga  What Yeah nigga take that
Anybody get outta line get they face slapped quick fast
The CanIBusll buss yo ass
Then Ill bust you wit a shotgun blast
Its not fun so I dont laugh
To me this rap shit is as serious as the death of a loved one
You know how you be feelin sad
Thats how I feel when I grab the microphone but niggas dont understand
Canibus is unequivocally the illest killin machine in the industry
For the 20th century
Trapped in a max security building
Sufferin from a severe illness called brilliance
