Yeah The Dragon of Judah
Melatonin Magik producer
Yeah
Mr Magoriums metaphor emporium
Vanglorious warriors with deep space euporia
The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia
Im still trying to build Gods army up
The pedagogy tried to call me a communist
And pacify my audience sprinkle them with zombie dust
The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon Hip Hop behemoth
Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus
Rearranging impossible pieces my quantum is increasing
I am sleeping in a Posturepedic deeply breathing
Dreaming a chakra sightseeing philosophically speaking
I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating
I saw police brutality beatings
I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving
I tried to search for possible meanings
But I couldnt see the logical reasoning
Said survival of the species no Macbook no PCs
No electricity no TV
No emcee battles no Christmas carols
Just international tablets
Brown produce consumed by sick cattle
Bone thin mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels
Collecting contaminated skin samples
This is not natural God damn you
Everybody on the planet dont deserve that not even the animals
You are completely culpable for everything youre supposed to do
Even if its not known to you
The weight of the language I spoke to you
The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you
Are so so emotional I dont even know what to do
So Imma leave the choice up to you
Dragon of Judah
I spit like a supernatural computer
Professor Bis Im with the Minister of Intelligence
Hold me down Professor Griff
Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines
Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy
You shouldve took Channel Zero more seriously
Professor Bis got a ghetto PhD in Chemistry
Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically
Now Im part of the Ministry
Put my name on the blacklist
Cause I dont dickride nobody in the industry
Wheres the fuckin empathy Ive been through so much treachery
Most of the best emcees disrespected me and tried to get the best of me
Never tried to rescue me or help me with the recipe
What do they expect from me
Stressin me questionin me to address the beef
I rep Hip Hop Hip Hop dont rep me
I never got a penny off that Beef DVD
You mean all that money went to QD3
I should have slammed the door in his face
If I was a different nigga Ida been caught a criminal case
The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is rape
Cause you dont care about Hip Hops fate
You sit around your tables and say grace
Eatin steak while you live like kings and treat kings like apes
For Michael Jackson money and still on the take
Even Tevin Campbells money the greed is so great
You probably dance around your mansion like Cirque Du Soleil
Everything is paid for you dont have to prorate
I aint hatin Im not hatin Im just sayin
You makin money off the next mans struggle Why you cant pay him
They made millions off them Beef DVDs
But didnt pay KSolo or Eazy E
Its called Blaxploitation
Another one of Canibus paranoid statements thats why Im famous
Im just tryin to tell niggas how the game is
Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment
If I shoot you Im blameless but if you shoot me you famous
Whats a nigga to do Now aint that the God damn truth
No matter what Hip Hop always lose
Wake the fuck up
