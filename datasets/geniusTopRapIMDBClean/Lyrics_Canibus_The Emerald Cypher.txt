Niggas listen to this shit right now
Got this shit goin down
That New World Order niggas is holdin it down
Niggas aint ready man everybody know what time it is man
Yall niggas listenin to this shit right now
All my niggas in the street
Man yall niggas know what time it is are they ready
Lets see it lets see if these niggas is ready man
My brain is a coliseum unfinished an art museum that none vision
A mausoleum before the Sun risen
Dark wisdom break the order of the magic witches
The tablet that we gifted fall in the hands of the music business
The sacred oath the snakish popes
He flinches I take his ghost
Shadow war we battle for
The emerald ring that unfold wings
When you enter the temple they sing hieroglyphs
Up a spiral cliff follow the monk for months
Close your eyes when his disciples is sent
Every morn the first satellite hit
I spit the prayer laws recite from scripts
Then its back to the silence
Patient observe the lotus bud I write the scroll on each clove
This is discipline before beast mode
Follow GOD code
Fondle my prayers beads under a pear tree this prepares me
Then a chair was formed by the bees
I bared the dare come around me
I wont speak for weeks I hold my tongue
Now I can hold the Sun  how is it I outnumber yall
And yall got me by 6 to 1  yall got me by 6 to 1 
The Elohim hold court in the ether
Decidin the fate of the human race I plead my case through the speakers
Sun the rapper who mastered the dark matter
The God particle mass created to smash atoms
Deal with energies that vibrate at higher frequencies
Your chakras gotta be in line to even speak to me
Journey through time and I doubt youll ever find
A shine on minds like mine that dwarf Einstein
See I confuse Confucius with a complex theory of evolution
With mind power that devoured Isaac Newton
Heaven on Earth Nah Its more like some sort of Hell
War with Satan ground shakin from the mortar shell
Escape the Matrix like Morpheus
Dodgin bullets in slow motion like we smokin some dust
But my third eyes bright enough to spar with the Dalai Lama
Verbal projectiles pierce spiritual body armor
Ima master builder from an enslaved mason
Tryna hide my true identity as my creation
Lines I scribed identify who Im facin
Its war And either you a God or a Satan
Lyrical Law draws the paper thin line between love and hate
Decide if you destroy or create
They think its verbal but this warfare is spiritual
We box em in apply pressure to his physical
Check one two who got more style than Sun do
None do solar flare your Earth duke son you
I body the mic I body the beat
I body the MC with the audacity to flow after me
My automated system got eight wicked concoctions
If that dont satisfy press nine for more options
BOOOOP  I cant believe you just did that
Twenty thousand wigs just concurrently slid back
Ha I blow flames in hot dosages
If I get too thirsty the Earthll be oceanless
Feelings dont move me I guess Im emotionless
Sick party host piata full of locustses
Bobbin for live grenades inside a bucket
I know the plural pronunciation is locust but fuck it
What are the percentages of a man actually choking to death
After swallowing phonetic images
I spit unlimited pandemics deliberately distributing
Millions of rappers skin grafts and cant spit it
As I child I would see and slay theyd check my room
And find my imaginary friends imaginary DNA
Its gutwrenching  my ultimate intention
Is to sit on top of The Tower of Infinite Ascension
KRino the agg jackal who ravages natural
Like V in the alphabet I keep comin after you
The judge said for the sake of my health
Ive been ordered to stay a hundred miles away from myself
You aint hard You a fake I wont stop until Ive blown his cover
You softer than the baby sister of a Jonas Brother
You aint a behavioural scientist why you dyin to spit
You try too hard when you rhymin with Bis try again
Approved this for public release fuck with the beast
With bucked teeth bust your guns or get rushed in the streets
Handcuffed to the back of the Jeep blindfolded
You hear a foreign language they speak you do not know it
Kidnapped to Kemet through Khartoum to parched sand dunes
To a dark room to witness your doom
Bash you in the face with the mag rope around your neck
Over a tree branch hoist you up with three sandbags
You shit yourself your pants sag
Global broadcast man thats sad they lynched him in the lab
Twentyfour apprentices for hardcore fellowship
Twentyfour masters twentyfour lyricists
Dead to the world alive to the hearts that are pure
If you endure your minds open doors
Complete the last step without crossin my rep
Whos next What possessed you to jump off a cliff
I spit darts once you stop the Hip Hop juggernaut
Kill you bloodclot you stink like jungle rot
Me llamo a Hermann Bushido Dogan Shotokan
The prototype of the first proto rhyme
With combined payloads my glide bombs provide flows
That cause World War II death tolls at live shows
Independently targeted bombin shit from so high up
In the atmosphere you lose consciousness
No oxygen only Canibus antioxidants
Think about it why spit into a bottomless pit
Im so isolated lyrically they put me in a desert facility
To test my abilities check out my melodies
Designed by Pratt  Whitney rap so swiftly
TAW50 following me cause youre with me
Your hot bars are lukewarm let me school yall
Intravenously cold blooded coolin coils are runnin through my jaws
The Suns hot  Im warmer the metaphor explorer
I give a order you cant cross the border
We aint religious dont talk about the Torah
Well crucify you on the cross for a quarter
Welcome to my House of Slaughter signing on the roster
Go downstairs put your stuff in the locker
And come back let me see what you got son I dropped him
Rappers steppin to me I aint the one
Spontaneous nucleonic you the opposite be honest
You produce reduced knowledge your discography is dishonest
Both promise change your name to MC Silence
Yes your album inspired me no I didnt buy it
Talk back nigga get fired
Ill erase your verse off the track so fast youll wake up tired
Candles go out darkness infiltrate the house
What the fuck he talkin bout He got a mental case mouth
I forced him to his knees told him to face South
Empty your PayPal bank account before I blow your brains out
Untouchable since the day I came out
Thats why these wack niggas keep callin my name out
How the fuck they gon change that now How they sound
Ima put him in the ground Lyrical Law style
How you liked at me then how you liked me now
How you liked me in the future when Im wearin that crown
The crown is invisible you dont have to be a loud individual
You act like Hip Hop is all you listen to
If thats true this is for you
Then Ima keep rippin you cause thats what Canibus do
If thats true this is for you
And Ima keep rippin you cause thats what Canibus do
