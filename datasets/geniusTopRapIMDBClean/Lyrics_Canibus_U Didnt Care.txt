You didnt care about me
And now this is how it has to be
I was lost but now I am free
Im happy cause I found a family
Whattup Em Its ya biggest fan
Its not even necessary to introduce who I am by now cause were good friends
Remember the letter I wrote before Atlanta on Up In Smoke
Thats the day I was gonna cut ya throat
I guess my watch was broke   cause by the time I woke
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But nonetheless Im glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident Ive been dying to speak to you
To tell you things have changed and Im a different man
A different level of understanding Im a different Stan
Things are a lot better I promise I wont harass you with any letters
Saying shit like We should be together
I meant we should start a group
The industrys full of homosexuals Slim but I dont wanna fuck you
I got a new attitude really I aint mad at you
I just wanted you to recognize I got talent too
When I say talented I dont mean battle kid
I mean storytelling kinda like how ya album is
I been attending counseling and taking medicine
They did some tests on me at NIH in Maryland
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remember that crazy night when I was being reckless
Driving with a deathwish on the bridge and I crashed into a Lexus
Right before I finished that last sentence
I was listenin to Xzibits album Restless
The next thing I knew I was under water and breathless
I was unconscious for a second literally dying to go to heaven
Till some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage
They started CPR then they called the paramedics
In retrospect I probably shoulda used a gun to end it
By the time the car sunk
My pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk
And I was still feelin kinda drunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
Hooked me up to the IV and checked my blood pressure
One of them was so concerned that they wouldnt leave
He hopped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some weed
My vision was blurry I couldnt really see
I just remember his voice talking to me
In the emergency room I needed surgery to get some glass removed
And fifty stitches for my wounds


After a couple months of therapy
I figured I was as ready as Id ever be  I wanted to be an emcee
He took me to shows wit him he let me flow wit him
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour wit him
I really believed in him I decided to team wit him
And now Im overseas wit him getting cheese wit him
And Im emceeing wit him Im having the best time of my life
And Im writing the best rhymes of my life
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He aint seethrough I cant see him fronting
Hes not the type to call you just because he needs something
Thats what I like about him
I wouldnt want to rock a mike without him
Hes got kahunas and hes not a coward
Matta fact I think he met you
It was the day you came to his video shoot with DJ Jimmys nephew
Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
That you was ghost writing for L but that wasnt true
You was looking at him the same way Im looking at you
Why cant we be friends Em I dont want nothing from you
You see theres a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawn from
Talking bout Britney and Christina Aguilera
Nsync too have you ever looked in a mirror
Your hair aint really blonde and ya eyes aint blue
So never diss me cuz when you diss me youre dissin you
So see what happens when you dont care
