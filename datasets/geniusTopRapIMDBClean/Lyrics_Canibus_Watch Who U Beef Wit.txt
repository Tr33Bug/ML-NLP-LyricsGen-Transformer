Yo you better watch who you beef wit
You might be walkin down the street then
Suddenly you hear tires screechin
Niggasll be hoppin out with heat and
Throw you in the car seat and leave your lady standin there screamin
The whole weekend you get blindfolded and beaten
Nose bleedin gaspin for air wheezin
You got kidnapped and you dont even know the reason
We even called your fam for ransom they said Keep him
Watch who you beef wit
Yeah it aint no secret
Talkin that street shitll get you in some deep shit
See niggas know who you be wit
Where you be at when you be gone when you be back
All of my niggas got doctor degrees in thuggonometry
We all know how to hold the heat properly
And how to conduct an armed robbery for personal property
And can go without food or water for 24 hours at least
We fugitives who aint doin a bid and shoot to live
Even if it means leavin you for dead
Cause niggas like you get scared look for loopholes
Pick the phone up and dial 9unouno
What happened to them crew of niggas that you talk about
Them crew of niggas that you never walk without
I know what happened yall heard about the doubleaction
Portable gatling and yall dont wanna get blasted
Yo you better watch who you beef wit
You might be walkin down the street then
Suddenly you hear tires screechin
Niggasll be hoppin out with heat and
Throw you in the car seat and leave your lady standin there screamin
The whole weekend you get blindfolded and beaten
Nose bleedin gaspin for air wheezin
You got kidnapped and you dont even know the reason
We even called your fam for ransom they said Keep him
Watch who you beef wit
Ayo we run up in radio stations on some unannounced shit
Catch the DJ off guard and roundhouse him
Duct tape his mouth then put a pound to his gut
And force him to play five cuts off the upandcomin album
Just the way I planned it niggasll start to panic
Brains get hijacked like planes and crash landed
Bitch niggas pray to the Lord the black box
That was supposed to record the pilots voice got destroyed
So watch who you beef wit
And watch who you suck your teeth at
Itll probably be somethin you regret
You get wet with horizontal rain droplets
Miniature rockets comin out barrels of metal objects
Niggas get shot in the face
On the ground shakin like tectonic plates that cause earthquakes
Now you got your grill in the ground how that dirt taste
You shouldnt have started this shit in the first place
Yo you better watch who you beef wit
You might be walkin down the street then
Suddenly you hear tires screechin
Niggasll be hoppin out with heat and
Throw you in the car seat and leave your lady standin there screamin
The whole weekend you get blindfolded and beaten
Nose bleedin gaspin for air wheezin
You got kidnapped and you dont even know the reason
We even called your fam for ransom they said Keep him
Watch who you beef wit
Cause niggas is comin to get you ready to rip you
With intercontinental ballistic missiles and pistols
Put a red dot on your head like you Hindu
Then put a hole in you big enough to put my open fist through
We could verbally diss you or we could get physical
Whatever niggas wanna do we could do it too
Cause you a sinner Im a sinner we all sinners
We rob niggas for they presents at they bar mitzvahs
We rob niggas for they body organs and sold em to the highest bidders
Things like hearts and livers
One and a half million in cash when its delivered
Then go to Yom Kippur and beg for God to forgive us
See you the type that finds violence real frightenin
Or hold your crucifix tighter when shells is firin
Sittin by your bed perspirin tryin to crawl underneath it
You need to watch who you beef wit
Yo you better watch who you beef wit
You might be walkin down the street then
Suddenly you hear tires screechin
Niggasll be hoppin out with heat and
Throw you in the car seat and leave your lady standin there screamin
The whole weekend you get blindfolded and beaten
Nose bleedin gaspin for air wheezin
You got kidnapped and you dont even know the reason
We even called your fam for ransom they said Keep him
