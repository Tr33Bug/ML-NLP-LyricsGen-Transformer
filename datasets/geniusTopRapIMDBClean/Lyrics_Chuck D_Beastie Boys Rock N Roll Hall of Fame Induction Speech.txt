Now heres a little story I got to tell about three bad brothers
You know so wellit started way back in historywith AdRock MCA and Number three Mike D
There is no adequate measure for the IMpact that the Beastie Boys had on Public Enemy during our formative years They were our ROLE models They gave us some of our richest support and
Uncharacteristic of many advisors in this game they led by EXAMPLE
The very first time the Beastie Boys headlined their own tour  the
Licensed to Ill tour that hit the road in January of 1987  they
Invited us to join the bill The lineup was the Beasties Public
Enemy and Murphys Law Watching them tear it up night after night I learned so MUCH about the importance of a great stage show THEY made me REthink what Public Enemy was supposed to be doing onstageand afFIRMED for me how imPORTANT our OWN Beastie Boy  who calls himself Flavor Flav  might be to our success In that way the Beastie Boys LITerally helped us to get OUR act together by MORE than living up to their name night after night on the road They were  and still ARE  one of the greatest live acts in music
How could we NOT Learn from way this group has CHALLENGED the conventions in the music businessHow they made their OWN rules about what it meant to be world class hip hop cats After Licensed to Ill the Beasties left the Def Jam label and broke with their producer Rick Rubin EVERYONE wondered  and many people were pessimistic  about how the HELL they were going to top their multiplatinum debut But their second album Pauls Boutique broke the mold With it they accomplished EVERYTHING theyd hoped for They kept their band together through a challenging period when most groups would have
Broken up and gone home They proved that they could produce
ThemSELVES when too many folks wrongly believed they were Ricks puppets And they inSISted on maturing as a band and as human beings when the easier thing would have been to come back with a formula that might have been Licensed to Ill 20 It was that COURAGE and SELFRESPECT that Public Enemy learned from and so like them we made SURE NEVER to take the easy way out just to repeat a hit record never to compromise our faith in ourSELVES and in our ARTISTRY
One of the MOST ADmirable qualities about the Beastie Boys is that theyve stayed so TRUE to the game over the years no matter WHAT was going on  with THEM or hiphop culture in GENERAL As far as IM concerned the trend towards individualism in hiphop has become a PLAGUE It has CRIPpled the art form Yet through it all the Beasties remain a TEAM of emcees in the STYLE of the groups that INSPIRED them the Treacherous Three the Crash Crew and the 2009 inductees RunDMC And let us not forget their DJs throughout the years Andre Doctor Dre Brown DJ Hurricane Mixmaster Mike and DJ Double R better known as Rick Rubin In rocknroll a band still gotta be a band Its the same thing with hiphop and the Beasties remain a model for us ALL BE together PLAY together STAY together ToGETHER forEVER
Time and again in word and in practice the Beastie Boys HONOR
Hiphops founding templates As true musicians they move beyond drum machines and repetitive samples and sometimes pick up their own instruments Its their way of paying TRIBUTE to the musicians who PRECEDED them who built the founDAtions for hiphop
More than many many groups The Beasties have evolved In
Particular Im thinking of someone who wasnt able to join us tonight  Adam Yauch better known as MCA But I feel him here tonight because he belongs here with the GREATEST It was MCA who COMMITTED the Beasties to their lengthy campaign for freedom for Tibet a campaign that not only helped to shine a light on Tibets struggle for independence but allowed the Beasties to move from fighting for their right to party to partying for their right to fight
No matter their lyrical subjects or their onstage parodies ONE thing The Beastie Boys never were was a joke They REMIND US that this is a CRAFT not a hustle I couldnt be more HONORED to INDUCT this group because they represent the BEST of the hip hop and rap music I dig love and always THANK them for doing the hard work of PAVING those roads for musicians all over the world to rock rap and roll on ESPECIALLY before people took us seriously as artists
May we ALL be as PROFESSIONAL DISTINCTIVE POWERFUL AND GROUND BREAKING as THIS group right here The BEASTIE BOYS are INDEED three bad brothers Who MADE history
Thank you
