Theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems
Who
Gots the damn nerve to pick a winner
Artillery ready to kill you and me who deliver
Ing this camp pain from the campaign
WTF OMG back to what the fuck they saying
Counted down aint listening to me
Check 12 gotcha vote media TV
But now after the math come the aftermath yall
Wall Street got ya streets by the balls
Beyond Trump Hill swallow this bitter pill
Political machine had its Listerine
Killer Mike informed to Bern the platform
Ran them jewels then them banksters swarmed
Secretary of Hate neocon Satan
Emails got the USA government mass debatin
Evolution meltdown fifty states
So the revolution just gotta wait
Bern Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned
I feel sorry sometimes for the young people you know believe this
Two system party is on its last leg
Bernie got burned yeah you heard what I said
Now we got Ms Killiry and Mr Daffy Dump
What the fuck is going on I smell a stink bomb
More trickery and thievery going on
Bernie had the people they was coming on strong
But they burned out that fire all a pack of liars
Trying to put the clamp on us like some pliers
Think its a game smoking that Democrack
Repulsive Republicrackas stay the hell back
Its war to the core more war on the poor
More put your hands up and get your ass on the floor
Bernie couldnt even save the day
Apple pie and politricks its the American way
Tax loopholes and emails what the hell
Had a better candidate but smell what I smell
Bern Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned

Welcome to the circus tell me how to jerk this lever to vote
Though I gotta wonder whats the purpose
I gotta choose between no choice at all
I cant call when they open their mouths and Im appalled
And Bernie got burnt and whos left in this
Like I gotta choose between two flavors of shit
On cant Miss TV the farce fillin my screen
And how did we get to a point this obscene wanna scream
My team got booted in the playoffs
So hear me cause I wanted Team Sanders playin in the World Series
Instead I gotta watch em run the country up the flagpole
Ones a politician and the other is an asshole
Neither can be trusted in the least
Election 2016 not between a beauty and the beast
For CommanderinChief as they lie to my eyeline
Imma take a stand for Sanders while Im standing on the sidelines
Burn
It is our job to figure out what happened and everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again
Let me get this straight in my head
You knew the questions before they were said
You knew the questions before they were heard
Politics be the Theater of the Absurd
Knew what to say before you took the stage
These kind of lies make America rage
Again and again we still havent learned
So we felt the heat when Bernie got burned
Our leaders seem to love playing with fire
But 100 percent wont admit they a liar
Perhaps they simply misremember
Fuck that Imma stay gone til November
Bern Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned Bernie got Berned
Bernie got Berned
When we say we you are stupid
