When I was a lad we had indentured bond servants Stout Cornish men and Scotsmen
Indeed sir indeed And if one of them runs away you couldnt tell em from any other Englishman
But take our black slave sir and no matter how far they run theyre always black
Now you wanna kill me that may be true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me cause my lyrics is true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Quiet as its kept some of yall slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black turn you back on yourself
I wouldnt trust some of yall if you was my right hand man
Id cut it off at the wrist like your name was Benedict
Enough lead to threaten fifty niggas dead you said
Cause niggas is back to perms and relaxers all up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh embarrass can you catch it
Nigga fever new season of modern day StepandFetchIts
1990s niggas be fraid of the noise I made
Bout their master crackers giving out disasters in the hood
Phonyhoneys be gone when they moneys be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests
Posin fake hair and high dresses
Now you wanna kill me that may be true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me cause my lyrics is true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me that may be true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me cause my lyrics is true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Mad niggas hittin shit but they health be quittin it
Clothes and car makin the men havin counterfeitin fit
Seizing niggas be praisin Benz and Beemers when they got em
Shined and Simonized foreclosed but they grills be rotten
Simon says Niggas jump and they jump for these Hilfigers
Tommy hates niggas high priced styles white as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin in hell and the negroes pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher he dont reach yo my nigga roll a seven
Niggas be forgettin trips about those slavery ships
Niggas wasnt there they claim
Fuck that nigga bring the pain
Niggas be dealin narcotic but dont get the money my nigga
Women or the fame my nigga or the motherfuckin game


Now you wanna kill me that may be true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me cause my lyrics is true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me that may be true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me cause my lyrics is true
One two but can you kill the nigga in you
