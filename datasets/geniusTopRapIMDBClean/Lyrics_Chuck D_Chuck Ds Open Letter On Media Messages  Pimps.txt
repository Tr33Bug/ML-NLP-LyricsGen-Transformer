I really dont know what constitutes for relevant coverage in HIPHOP news in America these days but I really want to give you all a heads up As you know Ive been through three passports 76 countries on the regular in the name of HipHop since 1987 and in 2010 although Ive never stopped traveling the earth this year Ive seen heard and felt some new things
As far as RAP and HIPHOP its like USA Olympic basketball the world has parity now and have surpassed the USA in ALL of the basic fundamentals of HIPHOP  TURNTABLISM BREAKING GRAFFITI and now EMCEEING with succinct mission  meaning and skill Skillwise rappers spitting three languages have created super rappers to move the crowd with intensity and passion The arrogant American comes in blackface but if there was a HIPHOP or Rap Olympics I really dont think the United States would get Gold Silver or Brass or even ass for that sake
Personally Public Enemy has been setting records in a record book that doesnt really exist The 20th year anniversary of FEAR OF A BLACK PLANET has become into a year and a half celebration of eights legs and five continents All the while looking at a HIPHOP Planet across 25 countries while still somewhat supportive of American rap the rest of the world has surpassed the US in skill in fundamentals and commitment to their communities Public Enemys mission is to set the path pave the road for cats to do their thing for a long time as long as they do it right
Because of the lack of support from local radio television and community in the United States the ability for local acts to thrive in their own radius has killed the ability to connect and grow into a proper development as a performer entertainer and artist Rappers trying to get put on to a national contract hustle from a NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES corporation has caused the artform to atrophy from the bottom while never getting signed to a top echelon that really doesnt exist but to a very few
HIPHOP NEWS spreads like any other mainstream NEWS in America The garbage thats unfit to print has now floated on websites and blogs like sht For example a rapper working in the community gets obscured while if that same rapper robbed a gas station hed get top coverage and be label a rapper while getting his upcoming or current music somewhat put on blast regardless of its quality which of course is subjective like any other art RAP sites and blogs are mimicking the New York POST
This is not mere complaint  this is truth and its coming down on Americans like rain without a raincoat with cats screaming how they aint wet This is real The other night upon finishing groundbreaking concert performances in Johannesburg we followed a special free concert in Soweto To make a point that our agenda was to show and encourage the HipHop community to be comfortable in its mind and skin without chasing valueless Amerikkkan values

It does the people of the planet little good to hear that an an artist is famous and rich will wear expensive jewelry straight from the mines show it off stay it the hotel ride in limos do the VIP with chilled champagne in the clubs ape and monkey the chicks  meaning not even talking  and keep the dudes away with slave paid bodyguards when real people come close The mimic of the VIACOMsanctioned video has run tired because it shows off does NOT inspire and it says NOTHING
Here in South Africa PUBLIC ENEMY has done crucial groundbreaking performances Its the same level of smashing the house that weve done this year in Moscow New York Paris London  Chicago and other places this year This is not news We are not trying to prove any point other than to show that a classic work is timeless and doesnt have a demographic per se The Rolling Stones and U2 are NOT measured by mere tracks they are measured by the allaround event they present The art of the performance has left HipHop whereas somebody has led artists to do more performing off the stage than on it The agenda here is to create artist exchange
This serves as a call to the infrastructureless HipHop game in Amerikkka We know what your hustle is but what is your work and job here Faking it until making it runs its course in a recession which is a depression for Black folks who increasingly are becoming more skillless as they become jobless

Since the music has so much power and image has become everything to the point that it can dictate the direction of a person in their life
It is my mission now to really become a freedom fighter and stop this radiation With JayZ and others who for years would faint their worth the statement of with great power comes great responsibility is more true Words are powerful and they can both start wars and bring peace This cannot be taken lightly Its important for the words to be body with the community If not one dime of 250 million doesnt benefit the people who contribute to it then why does that warrant coverage above the will and effort of many in the music who have done great things

I turned 50 this year Everyday I get the question whats up with HipHop today If nothing was wrong the question wouldnt be the dominating question I get I do massive interviews worldwide Im covered from varied aspects HipHop Public Enemy social issues musicology in general So my interactive world dialogue is deeper and more present than 140 characters
Never have so many been pimped by so few
I am tired of the silence of people that know better There is nothing worse than a person that knows better and does worse Or says nothing
And makes excuses for bullst
You know damn well HIPHOP in the USA has fell way the fuck off as the American dollar and much of America itself Held up and dictated by White business lawyers accountants in New York and Los Angeles offices
To dictate to a community and not even live or be with the people is offensive VIACOMs reach into Africa to turn HIPHOP in to Amerfrica which is as exploitative as those slavemakers who carried us across on boats The decisions made in a boardroom in New York City while these cats scurry to their high rises and suburban mansions from cultural profiteering must stop And Im going to do something about it
Never have so many been pimped by so few
My agenda of HipHop around the world is in line with its creators who followed Black Music The music had the peoples back It has never been my personal agenda Americans arrogantly have no back HipHop has followed this I am disturbed by the fact that I tell artists that doing work in their community will get them little or no buzz for their effort but in the same sense if they robbed or shot someone or did a bid they would get national and sometimes international attention

So many of your favorite people suck up to the NBA and NFL because it has order and when you make the game look bad David Stern or Robert Goddell is kicking their asses out  They are the indisputable HWIC and negroes are in line and silenced But here in HipHop the dysfunctionality reward makes the money that puts food on many tables
Its time because I hear too many excuses I wont allow whats in the USA fk up what I and others worked hard to instill I drive a 94 Montero a 97 Acura and have no expensive jewelry There is nothing on this planet materially that is better than myself This is what I instill in many doing HipHop that nothing is greater than what is given These games of people doing anything to get things has seeped into my way so therefore witness some radical virtual things coming from me in protecting the artform of HipHop
Never have so many been pimped by so few
So Im going after the few
Im tired of it
