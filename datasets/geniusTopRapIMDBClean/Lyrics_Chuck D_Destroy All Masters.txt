In the club see there aint no love lost
For those steady lookin for that rubadub  This is Ab normal 
Some only in it for the money
Fuckin twoheaded dog on the prowl hear the GROWLOWL
In the world turned upside down
A paralytical now stick around with a frown
What is a beef Beats the hell out of me
Flippin thangs to swang neither here or neither there yo
Its what they hear as a man the murder music
Interpretation invented the script who isnt Nations  This is Ab
Normal 
A back lash hit the black fast
The straw monsters will pursue to find out what a nigga wrote
But pull my people for a track
Look forward to the black reparations for us to get the money back
Cracked in the back dont give me no stress
Gonna make you accountable your crime is surmountable
A full chick without chicken just sucker you can stick it
Where the sun dont shine to kiss the back o mine

Crack ya in the back dont give me no stress hahahahahaha
Im fairly sure Im comin after destroyin all masters 
Crack ya in the back dont give me no stress hahahahahaha

Yo Chuck its time for rip down block lyrics get chopped vicious
My flow position like their waistline shiftin
Aint nuttin different yall pit fall the dungeon
Witness the drama comin focus splungin finishin wheres the lungs
Send a swifter hurricane frozen dope vein wicked
Minds get lifted like the cross nails is broke off
Ya flippin once its slow court the street talks we eat back
With poison on the track cant avoid that rhythm we bring noise at
Bring the noise  This chapter son is Melquans scripture
Vision adrift the mind kid is blinded but rhymes be on a science climate
Here he is BAM
My man Son Slaughter bout to slam
Proper the planet rocker
My brain fluid vodka lyrics influence the proper membrane
My first begin blended with strength vain to strike earth
My mic work wonder soul with thunder
The Son Slaughter mission will finish script
Strictly number number number number
Crack ya in the back dont give me no stress hahahahahaha

Crack ya in the back dont give me no stress hahahahahaha
