Yeah feedback back for your bad ass yeah
As you witness Im surrounded by two more emcees outta my war council
My Rottweiler of Rhymes BWyze aka Blast
Introducing my Doberman of Destruction Lyrical Destroyer
Dow Jonz aka John Connor Of Moruturi
My war council comin smashin through battle zones of microphones
Whatever goes whatever goes whatever goes whatever goes
Yo my man the rhymes I write they be the illest
And I be fucking up careers like those of Arnold Kimberly and Willis
Youll take the penicillin Run DMC  Jay say I be illin
My crew aint juicy I am not cold chillin
Im a super villain Id even room with Dr Doom and wed be killin
Id rip a bitch in London just for one shilling
Im on your cable Channel X Im causing strife
It make me wanna holler son the way they do my life check it
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
How I can make more for us whenever I bust
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues the everglades
Canteen full of liquor Im sitting on grenades
Little women squirming from the 12th down to 11th grades
When they peep me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page
But youre too young Ill take you mom
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in Vietnam
Battle two so what you gonna do 
Skillaskills the land of Endonesia
Battle two so what you gonna do 
Skillaskills the land of Endonesia
Rock em rock rock on Endonesia

Yo its A Low Down Dirty Shame
How Im Surviving The Game to get the Glory
Son this aint no West Side Story
Whos The Man that started with the Boyz In Da Hood
And The Five Heartbeats he would Shuffle Hollywood
Could it be the King Of New York
Up in the lights from them days in Crooklyn
To them Harlem Nights
In this New Jack City Im the man with the Juice
Meet me Uptown Saturday Night Bustin Loose
The Mack The Black Caesar and if Shes Gotta Have It
Ima Do The Right Thing and please her
Her man got a death wish cause he wanna fight
But I hold a Lethal Weapon on Judgement Night
Yo bring it on MCs aint ready for the battle
My Posse will leave you Sleepless In Seattle
48 Hours of nothin but Tales From The Hood
Gimme Dead Presidents Fella cause Im Good
Battle zones on and on

Yo this ahm KSUF KSUF period
And I am your only trackman
That like to think  been in my life oh shit
Motherfuckers is so bitch he brake it on
And aaah I wanna hear Dow Jonz
Ey yo Chuck Chuck
How you doin man 
You got your back off and BWyze
So he straight shit on man
Cmon cmon cmon
God damn like the 85ers eat the ham
Ill eat up weak MCs and that means shorty and his man
My name is Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Connor and perhaps Ill tell the reason why
While Hiroshima blackens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry as youre incinerated
Ill come around again forget me not
I had to shine with darkness for a minute that was hot yo
Semen in a women from the men without hats
Get your life split up like some KitKats
I seem to be triple teamed by gang green who dont listen
Blunts them must be hittin truck emission
I stress the position at the top of the slop
Crackas be droppin a lot like saltines out the box
I despise singin songs in the low rider duckin cynics
Fuck em and those Johnnycomecritics
