No mistako not some wacko from Waco
Crazy Ill plead insanity just to save humanity
Be good like no Johnny never liked no Giuliani
Cause they never could stop me not their imaginary Rocky
Get me then acquit me attack me what a shock to Pataki
Here here watch a brother duck the chair
I fear only the one upstairs who got no peers
Im not part of the clique its whatcha see is whatcha get
My realitys personal many times rhymers forget
Some aint heavy like others but they still be my brothers
And disgusted at the other folks laughin at us
With the ashes to the ashes the blunts to the blunts
A chip off the whole block I shock and get the word in
Maybe thats why a brother like me shoulders the burden
I smells between the white sheets a hell of a beast
In the back lurkin dont front step to the circle
A plan to that man no doubt
Although Im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie  yeah 
Cause to some its a dream
But to the rest its a nightmare
More time in the air than a flight attendant
The rhyme got winded on the way up on what I thought was a lay up
These twocent criticizers cant size
We dont realize we all under a microscope of a nation of other folk
So all this nigga callin is we fallin attitude
Have we forgotten Entertaining is todays way of picking cotton
So that the younger Gs and Bs think all we can be is a big dreamer
In order to get a Benz or a Beamer
Some stuck in that 96 Lexus per minute shit
Its that same old story that bores me ignores me
My metaphors be over that head of even heads
To some Im prophetic but to the rest Im pathetic
I led a movement of mentals against the feds and point spread
On beats mad noise and funky instrumentals
There once was a time we fought the power with a rhyme
Now the attitude goin round no use tryin


A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie  yeah 
Cause to some its a dream
But to the rest its a nightmare
Yeahahacmon aharight
Ride on ride on yeah
We dont need to be no Big Willie
Last verse check it out
To some its a dream but to the rest its a nightmare 
Got more hits than Pete Rose had for the Reds
Now they be on anything Deion intercepts
Except Im in a zone now get wreck I get around
Can I get down like Craig Mack how can I get down
Back like rock em sock em robots who forgot it was him
Who parlayed the styles of KRS  Rakim
And brought it to a different level against the so called devil
Who had the nerve to throw a bell curve and test me arrest me
Lemme go let it grow no ive been through the afro
Its been a long time so my childhoods retro
Unlike today as we be watchin us pay
The price that bugs me knowin that God dont like ugly
Got a free pair of lugs to run quicker from the slugs
But slipped from the mad dirt that was swept under the rug
A lil down but not out not what you thought it was
Its just peace no beefs I gets love
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie  yeah 
Cause for some its a dream
But to the rest its a nightmare
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
A plan to that man no doubt
Although im feelin alright
Its feelin funny feelin left out
Another one falls to Big Willie  yeah 
Cause for some its a dream
But to the rest its a nightmare
