Yeah Chuck this is Griff
That studio session you set up 24 extincts today
I already called to set it up
So I be there takin care of that aight
Give me a call let me know wsap
Peace Chuck this is Griff check this  wdap 
Brothers and sisters they slow gas
Sleepin notnot nappin
Snoozin and losin this war to this new world order war
Once more
It looks like to me
This beast prepared a horizontal feast
No least than a 666 corntale trips
This devil loves it man but check this
His enemy hes going public
He going public about this vertical snowflakes
Bakes at 33 and a third degrees
On her knees she begs please  please please 
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
This pain ease my pain
Brain on a wide soul train
Set a one way trip
To the hippest trip in America
Brought to you by the ultimate sin
Horizontal poses cloth and back sin
Horizontal heroin  watch it 
Peace this is Griff
And we bring it full circle
Black to the dome
Aight Chuck Im out

Yo ok I got your message and everything
Yo I kick in the ATL right
