I used to write a lot Ive been telling myself its time to write again But now here I am writing because its necessary because I have a reason at an unfortunate time in my life This piece is about my Father my Dad
My Superman
My Father is my hero my Dad is my Superhero He raised many boys and young men into confident caring human beings He shaped me for 55 years on Earth When I felt lost and a bit offtrack he had some Godgiven ability to untwist me and put me back into focus
He was never afraid of dying He would simply say that everyone goes to the same door of wherever that is He would say well either youre gonna go first or me unless were going to be in the same accident which we can make prayer to avoid Anyway he would add no parent should face burying their child So there you have it son and FYI you are not that far behind me in age  he was 22 years older than I am  so take care of yourself too
My father called me and my brother son He respected religion and Gods practices over them yet he observed a simple practicality and philosophy for the everyday man and woman He wanted everyone to have an equal chance
My Dad was as stand up a man as I ever seen He championed young fathers saying that they deserve more credit in todays society He stood up for women wives and mothers just as strongly Nearly everyone thinks their parent is amazing I told my father many times he is my Superhero with a heart The detailed moments I had have with this man are endlessall the way up to the fantastic night he my brother I my two nephews and a few friends sat over at his house watching Super Bowl 50
My Dad was rooting for Cam Newton because his uncle was my Dads friend and Cam is from nearby College Park Georgia We were loud  but not overboard  our team has always been the Jets my brothers team the Vikings We were in my Dads den where four years ago we were all screaming at each other when the Saints got it  my brother has a big voice too trust me it was high volume down there  I tweeted several times about my Dad during SB50 saying he wasnt for all them commercials and the halftime concert Tweeting the fact if people think I have a powerful voice it is nothing compared to my Dads voice for real
As I child I heard my Dads voice thunder off walls It was reminiscent of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and so many other famous orators but my Dad represented a strong family man I remember as a teen knowing when he stepped out the front door to call me my brother andor my sister to get inside no matter how far you were you couldnt say you didnt hear him yell Because everyone else did In fact if my father yelled hard at me it felt like half my face would melt back
The Dad things my father did he did so well And we bragged about him like the gift that he was In the seventies we had quite a few rough financial times as a Black family but he and Mom covered them so well we didnt notice The James EvansJohn Amos father on Good Times didnt come close to the very real thing There are thousands of moments I have to remember Sometimes we tested our father and he came back correcting But I never heard the man curse until I was grown he kept that side away from us his kids
Where other families figured it would cost too much to travel my father once found a way to take us on vacation He bought a car that had no reverse and he drove us to Canada My parents figured it out with minimum funds
My Dad drove a cab in dangerous 1970s NYC for a few years I was a teenager and I couldnt sleep until he came through the door around 3am I got my first jobs with him at 1718 years old working shipping and receiving departments for fabric warehouses I had 1415 jobs from 19791986 culminating in driving furniture in a UHaul across NYC a job all of Public Enemy and The Bomb Squad guys did at one time or another before records
My dad liked music a lot but he wasnt into the music he was a solid NY sports fanatic Born in Harlem in 1938 Lorenzo Douglas Ridenhour  for which the D in my name comes from  was naturally a Brooklyn Jackie Robinson Dodger fan My Dad was even scouted as a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox but by then the Marines wouldnt let him try out For him it became the Mets the Knicks the Jets and the Rangers that was it and understood We cried sport I got loud that way
The music the cultural side of me comes from my Mom who also didnt drive until she was in her forties which meant my Dad drove all of us everywhere Eventually he even acted as transportation and stage manager for the Roosevelt Community Theatre
My Dad always knew my artistic side but was surprised by the music thing He prided himself as a Black Man he demanded and gave Respect without effort He went fearlessly into places where the average head of a family would question Regardless of whatever I chose to do my Father knew hed raised a man in me who found a way and a means to bark back at the same hypocrisy he saw every day in so many different forms So my Dad didnt come to the award shows very few concerts and couldnt tell you the names of my albums and songs In fact we didnt talk about much music at all  ever Im not sure if he noticed the recent LeBron JamesTerrordome spot I had a commercial playing in the middle of all his gamesperhaps he did
But HE IS the lyrics
My brother E says he was THE epitome of 100 I agree
My dad was a very solid 100 straight up No bullsht
He drove everywhere like a road metronome and even when I was fortunate enough to help with flights to a few countries he and my stepMom drove that turf too My father met all people as equals was very stand up and gave everybody a chance to come right In 1979 we drove a Buick 225 across the country to San Francisco and back We blew a water pump on I80 at midnight in Lincoln Nebraska A town mechanic fixed it because of a conversation my dad had with a state trooper Dad said people are people but the system tricks em We repeated half that drive in 2012 in a truck I picked him up in Dallas and we talked and drove all the way into Georgia
Alas The details of the times with my father are endless to remember and perhaps they will attack my mind like black blizzard flakes and I will find a patch of road to weep at the wheel In recent years with my Dad in retirement I made it my obligation to get to Atlanta once a month no matter what Hed pick me up take me to the crib and to my car And after the trip was done hed drop me off back at the airport after we did breakfast I recently ordered the same NBA game package that Id initially gotten for him 3 years ago all so we could call each other on a play
Recently there was something calling in me After I spoke at UPenn on 2616 I went to sit all day in my Dads den to watch Super Bowl 50 It was the grandest of times After the game I offered to take my nephew and longtime PE founding member and SIW James Norman to their respective homes Before we left my Dad told us how in 1956 while he was in Marine Camp Lejeune the nearby restaurant told him they wouldnt serve Negroes He laughed remembering when Dick Gregory recalling a similar experience retorted that he didnt eat Negroes either My Dad also talked about how much he dug President Obama and never dug all the criticism about him My Dad proceeded to tell some other jokes hed heard on one of Dick Gregorys 1960s albums We laughed so much I kissed my Dad on both sides of his face rubbed his back and said I loved him much and he told me the same I was out the door
My Dad passed away alone at home the next afternoon while I was taking my mom to lunch with my sister and brotherinlaw My Superheroreal father real man and moreI never had no need for any cartoon sports singer avatar or filmfigure I had the real thing
In these millennial times my Dad saluted fathers Especially young black fathers where he said the props were not enough and society cast a bad onesided light against them He would continuously praise me as the best father he knew I always shook my head and told him I was a chip off the block of the greatest Hed pour it on me Fathers matter Yes Black fathers matter more than ever
Im missing his voice bellowing my name through my house Missing our gettogether breakfasttotheairport ritual Its a painful absence that can never be overstated
Peace resPEct Love Forever
Daddy
Your son and family
Chuck
