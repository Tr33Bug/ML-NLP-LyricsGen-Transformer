NiggativityDo I Dare Disturb The Universe Lyrics
No Buddha bliss she musta missed it
Still bangin with the anger kissed a soul sanger
Class of 78 Sunset Strip cause I been outta high twenty years
With thirty somethingish peers  Soul 
What a trip never drank beer with the boys
But the love we shared was the art of noise
Dump puffs a smoke make me cough  Baughaugh 
But Im not a chimney so you cant call that shit soft
What turned me off swore their breath stunk
Plus I never got outrhymed by a drunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said its getting suited  Suited  til your brains polluted
I aint playin this mainstain stayin rooted
Instead of bein pimped and then prostituted
Wont be the last time cause it aint the first
So do I dare disturb the universe  Universe 
Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Goin down down down
Diggydiggy down
You dont wanna get shocked 
No U turn I pump up hittin switches
But all this talk reflect the niggas  bitches
Where did that come from only labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what theyve done for me lately but hate me
Attack me might as well be damn Pataki
This hiphops in me so they cant stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin all elements destroyin all irrelevant  Yeah 
It all comes down to this
What good is talkin about the hood when you got motherfuckin madness  Madness 
Am I ringin those senses
Brothers drinkin worse shit than theyre be pourin in their Benzes
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe  Universe 


Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Goin down down down
Dididiggydiggy down
You dont wanna get shocked 
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind brain trained on the devil level
You dont measure a man by what he got
Its what he does what hes left and what hes takin care of
A brother like me annoys em
But Im cool G when I rap about em its poison
Everybody wanna be Big Willie chasin down loot
Dole and Newt who do you shoot
Im fingerin targets while ya figurin Figaro Figaro
Soap opera for the Niggaro
I aint chasin no movies like Jason
Or Lollapallooza cause I aint no loser
Rough stuff to the babies spread like rabies
To the heads of heads but I aint crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to the verse
But do I dare  Dare  to disturb the universe  Universe 
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Uh uh  Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down
