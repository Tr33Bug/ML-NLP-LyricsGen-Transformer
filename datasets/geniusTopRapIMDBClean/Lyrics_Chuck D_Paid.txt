Yeah Strong Isle Nassau in position 51
laughter 
Ya know I mean Im in this in yo desert word up
Yeah representin from the rough side
The Ride Dog The Forty Bandits check me out
I caught you peekin around the corner tryin to see if we left yet
We staked out your shit last night feeling the vibe for death
To make you strangle on you blood fluid you know it
Sleep walking with the machete saying them dogs made you do it true it
Mr Machete telling you bitches Im ready
Never nervous behind the barrel trigger finger stayin steady
So buckle up its the only way to survive the ride
Down to the Y we havin a party inside
I dedicated this to all you insects who deep on buggin me
Pushing my panic button needin trauma unit recovery
My tracks be fat got them attracting like crack
Even PE be screaming you Bring that beat back
Come one come all my shit be smoking like echo sauna
The Underground went with Digital now humpin around if you wanna go
Toe to toe or pussy to dick head chicken heads practice on carrot sticks
Or let you doo doo hole spread
Yall niggers chill cause we went there too
We change this shit from the rough side to the shithole crew
And were paid
x4
Goodness gracious
Gettin money
Tha papers
Gettin money
Get paid
Spinach flips my lips sit on top of crystal bottle tips
Sippin ready to flip do a hit
On a rapper that a serpent
Counterfeit criminal fakin jacks
Luxury in his raps aint facts
If a camouflage large niggas
Keep it on the low black
No raps or Kodak just stacking cheese
Freezers packed
Murdered human bodies executed vicious
Reputed business German lugers
Lift spitting  twist just
Flesh confronted nobody want it son
I come correct
Connect vocabulary that burry your rep yep
Son slaughter rip shit
On tracks that I eclipse with
Flowin showing Im wicked
Lyrics murderin myths with
No remorse a different flow continuous
Blends with no resemblance
Money  power till its vengeance
x4
Goodness gracious  BIG
Gettin money
Tha papers  BIG
Gettin money
Get paid  BIG
One of the seven they couldnt hang
Stepped to the six
The last brother alive
Of the startin fiveone of the ones
But you look dont acknowledge
The mix with a quickness
Suckers fall and crumble
To the sickness  sickness 
Of not baggin themselves
Not braggin helps
Your lil ass go figure
Why ya pants be saggin
Stare at my audacity
I aint from the city  strong ile 
No pitty no tears
Cause I aint from around here
Freestyle whats the use
Record companies get the money
And give you juice and end up cutting your ass loose  cut off 
While you style for free
They talk wild for a fee
And getcha ass souped
While you never ever recoup
Catchin wreck wit no check
Theyll never give ya respect
Ya blackself  my brother 
Getcha self some real yelp  yeah 
Accountant sharp businessman
Wholl sit down  show ya
Instead a some rich bitch lawyer
Who swear that he know yahe dont
Know ya as long as
Other folk in rap
Got it made
Fuck freestyle
I wanna stay paid  paid 
x7
Goodness gracious  BIG
Gettin money
Tha papers  BIG
Gettin money
Get paid  BIG
