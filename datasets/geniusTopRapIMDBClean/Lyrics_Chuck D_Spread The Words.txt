A wise man once said Keep the laws
Ill write the songs make the world applaud
To the word unheard social cause
Raptivism the evil on pause
Praise the loud pray the Lord
Spread the words spare the sword
System flawed lock all the doors
Here come these damn rappers so hit the floor
On art and artist theres a difference
Between censorship and senseless shit
And I swear to God some dont know the difference
And everybody swear they comin with that different shit
Bustin caps but aint captured it
Without really doin it and so they spit
Disturb socalled heads only hear the heads heard
Plus they spread the words
Chuck D is president hiphop is medicine
And Hot 97 it is never been a resident
We represent the president definite we the measurement
My right to be hostiles gospel the New Testament
Im a disciple of that Golden Era cycle
With PEs A Nation of Millions is like the Bible
2Pac taught me my Hail Marys
And Mobb Deep showed me that I was in hell already
Rakim told me that the third rail was deadly
A ghetto bastard in this treacherous world so we held machetes
Nas told me cut the grass low to see all snakes
So I dont need to check my Instagram to see yall fakes
Lines on composition paper that means we all straight
But whats a God MC to a evolved ape
In the beginning was the word so we spread the message
Honored Im at the table breakin bread with the legends
Jasiri X
Some spread word like germs let me get it disinfected
Misguided misdirected ears disrespected
Protect your dome and your children from the garbage
Words are seeds Im plantin a new harvest
Just because you make words rhyme that dont make you a MC
Digital clones in 3D
When I flow the power of Nommo word to Dogon
Some rappers need to pack up get up and get gone
No space and time for your fast food lines
Stinkin up the airwaves smellin swine
Verbal pollution without no solutions
Dancin to the beat of mayhem and confusion
My war cry over break beats
Eatin up bean pie readin up Mohammad Speaks
Teach them to flow snares and samples
Show em a better way and lead by example
