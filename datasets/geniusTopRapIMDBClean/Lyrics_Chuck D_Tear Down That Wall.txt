Somebodys souls been exposed in this house of blues
The real emperor without clothes has much to lose
Road weary troubadour
Maybe Im an ambassador not to be confused with some spook or bastard by the door
Before I got paid by the word now its deferred
New Dust Bowl poet you aint heard it now you heard
Showed yall I aint tired damn sure aint quiet
Plenty of things to teach about Im reaching to the choir
Damn my man one at a time
This beats fire face told me Brent you be bombing the place
The Bob to the Bob the Bob is back weaving bobbing and spilling
Like Womack Marley and Dylan
Deep songs front page of your life this is you
Invasion of your mental vacation and your crew
This aint brand new just because yall aint never knew
I spit politics on that wall where the people get screwed
Hiphop supporting nonstop sweatshops
So you can retail your ass off without fail
Then some of you get setback
Blame this immigration exploitation with your the lack of information by yelling Wetbacks
Somebody acting Forever 21
Cant hide cant cry cant run
Blame it on the crack or fight back without a passport
Millennium Gestapo border control the new contact sport
Yall call them immigrants and take them to court
But look at your hood and your lack of support
Some of these DJs have no idea what theyre playing
Some of these rhymers dont realize what the hell theyre saying
So I let them chase the cash honey without a plan
Forget Johnny was the man in black but Im the black in man
This is modern day slavery and part of the plan
With all due respect sir  Tear down that wall man 
Understand these pressures in this socalled recession
For the Black Brown Woman and Man its depression
Roster of the stricken Bernie made off with the money
Now the hidden hand is bitten and now it aint funny
I beg your pardon whos saving you Youre calling them laborers
Walk on by and never say hi or consider them neighbors
Some got the nerve to live in Texas Arizona Cali and not know
Even missing the cue in New Mexico
Diss the Brown brothers and sisters on what they done did
This side of the Earth they built pyramids
My passion comes and what I know and who I am
I refuse to lose or to be confused by this new scam
Scarred by sarcasm Uncle Sams racist orgasm
Was just a spasm scared of enthusiasm
Of the Black and Brown planet the jealous say Damn it
Stupid ass wall you cant stop us all
