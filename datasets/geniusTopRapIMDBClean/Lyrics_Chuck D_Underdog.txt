Little is known why I beckon and moan
I see whats comin
Madd brothers will be bumming
After the math the drug lords brought the wrath
Of those of us who once thought we needed to be weeded
Bust dust made that head bust
I remember came after
Cheba cheba had you wide like a receiver
What looks like fire is ice
Fall for the flame
Catch it twice like Jerry Rice
Nice 
Against odds I recognize it in the cards
Hard to be played back and black the jack of all spades
Ash to ashes blunts to blunts
Some of these geez aint real
I seen em once upon a time
So many rhymers and not enuff rhymes
I hope they around next year but I fear
Im all time and Im down for the ruffness
But what good is the rhyme without substance
Now back to the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Nobody savin the time
The rhyme never thanks
Who be givin
Ravin who on top of the charts
Grabbin the Gavin
Now I cant use my name
Half the body be dancing head swoll
But one thing I can do is finger roll
The hit list grows like Pete Rose
As I rise above who you recognize
I wanna know that disguise
Who are you
And wherd you come from 
I dont know where you come from now see how you run
First on a verse I gets vertical
Flip works like a grammatical gigolo
A head from many years ago
I brought the noise on the RB boys
The chronological
Or the ghetto celeb
Never claimed the best
Nor was I great at finesse
But everything is everything
And everything is real
It appears I shift gears
To the ears of my peers
No appeal
Id rather be the underdog


the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
BRIDGE x4
Ashes to ashes blunts to blunts
Some of these geez aint real
I seen em once
Its the underdog
Now whooooo
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Im low maintenance
The picture Im paintin
Is just intelligence
Not another nitwit you can get with
Self haters traitors
Thinking now that later
Turned they head
Dissin something that I said
I get ill on a beat track
Make me wanna go back
Way back
Where its not a trace of Babyface
Unplugged tempos from this undrugged temple catalog
I rather be the underdog
the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Its the underdog
Now whooooo

Live from New York
