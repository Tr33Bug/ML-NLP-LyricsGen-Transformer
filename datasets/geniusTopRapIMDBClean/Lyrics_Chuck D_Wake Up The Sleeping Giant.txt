Gather round us join with the band
Together were stronger together well stand
Say what can you do well weve got a plan
And were gonna take you to the promised land
Its time to remember its time to move on
Theyve pushed it too far they dont know what theyve done
If its a fight that they want then its a fight that theyll get
We never lose honey so place your bets
Long ago and far away
We had a voice you know that we had a say
We wont live for yesterday
Ready or not were gonna have our way
CHORUS
We got the numbers yeah we got the might
We got the strenght and we got the right
We got the reason yeah we got the night
So wake up the sleeping giant
Not one more minute not one more day
Weve waited too long cant let our chance slip away
We wont stop til we get it we wont stop til were done
Well bite and well claw until theyve lost and weve won
We took all were gonna take
Its got to stop you know theres too much at stake
Who the hell are they to say
What we can do and how we can play
REPEAT CHORUS
Whoa

REPEAT CHORUS
Whoa
