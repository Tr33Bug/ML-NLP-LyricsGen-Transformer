Still getting mine in the 1 9 9 9
Yo just relax take it easy slow down
I had thisI had this friend of mine
Who just you know he was moving too fast you know what Im sayin
I told him to slow down he said the sun dont chill
I said I said still I said still you gotta
Just appreciate life sit back dont let it fly right past you
No matter what go on Im still gettin mine
No matter the year no matter the place no matter the time
Check it
Its like Im fighting for freedom writing for freedom
These record company niggas I dont like when I see em
My ancestors when Im writing I see em and talk with em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with em
Shitted on so many rappers its like Im in the stall with em
Molest concepts stalk rhythms paid dues bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heavens call
Preachers daughters get fucked in the reverends hall
MCs reckless eyeball why yall wanna go and do that
Mustve thought I was solo the name just aint the UAc
No mo still together
Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say Im nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry my poetrys a penitentiary track is visitation
Sentences is life Im like chief up in this demonstration
Still
You squirm with discomfort wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
Imma show yall in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to always played the low
Its like a competition this mission here Im telling you
Slip up and rhymeass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses slow down you cant learn that quick
Cause Im the dead eye with the red eye from Chi to LI
I thought yall knew every year I grew Im still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girlll be showing
A male seed praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to thats why I chose this
Now is the glass halffull or halfempty
Common why they tempt me
The king of the simply bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know yall hate that why I feel I owe yall everyday
If yall hear it a thousand times its gon be the same way
The DatFather go farther why bother
Now Im a peaceful man I dont want no stress
You know Im still


Yo yo some get Range Rovers some religion changeover
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga games over aint no payola in freestyle
In battles Im warring like a GChild
Searching for the child in me this style in me
This release is like the piece thats now in me
They tried to sassinate me god like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on em cause Im the style Nitti
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
Told her my chambers like Wilt
Built with her for a sec let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck yo Im still getting mine
