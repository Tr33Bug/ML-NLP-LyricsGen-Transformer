Dem boy wanna talk like dem wanna gon come
But what you gon do if you got one gun
I sing a song for the hero unsung
With faces on the mural of the revolution
No looking back cause in back is whats done
Tell the preacher God got more than one son
Tell the law my Uzi weighs a ton
I walk like a warrior from them I wont run
On the streets they try to beat us like a drum
In Cincinnati another brother hung
Again he wont see the sun with his family stung
They want us to hold justice but you handin me none
The same they did Kobe and Michael Jackson
Make them the main attraction
Turn around and attack them
Black gem in the rough you rugged enough
Use your mind and non power get the government touch
Them boy chat chat on how him pop gun
I got the black strap to make the cops run
They watching me Im watching them
Them dick boys got a lotta cock in them
My people on the block got a lotta Pac in them
And when we roll together we be rocking them
To sleep
No time for that cause theres things to be done
Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come
From project building seen a fiend being hung
With that happening why they messing with Saddam
Burn a bush cause for peace he no push no button
Killing over oil and grease no weapons of destruction
How can we follow leader when this a corrupt one
The governments a GUnit and they might buck young
Black people in the urban area one
I hold up a peace sign but I carry a gun
Peace yall love
