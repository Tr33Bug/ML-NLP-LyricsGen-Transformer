In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed and all those in the struggle
Yeah yo check it
There were lights and sirens gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond trying to hold on
To life she thought shed live with no arm
Thats what it felt like got to the hospital eyes held tight
They moved her room to room she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head every word she got hit
Who shot the trooper they asked her
Put mace in her eyes threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes realized shes next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills they told her thats where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasnt for this German nurse they wouldve served her worse
I read this sisters story knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it yall
Im thinking of Assata yes
Listen to my love Assata yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkietalkies crackling I see them when theyre taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell one cot no window facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes
Shed exercise paint and begin to read
Two years in a hole her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her hoping shes lose her seed
Held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor from her stomach shed bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didnt exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah I often wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it people
Im thinking of Assata yes
Listen to my love Assata yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul
Yo from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldntve done
Medical evidence shown she couldnt have shot the gun
Its time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mothers side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But shes free with political asylum in Cuba
Im thinking of Assata yeah
Listen to my love Assata yeah
Were molded from the same mud Assata
We share the same blood Assata yeah
Your power and pride so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Freedom Youre asking me about freedom Youre asking me about freedom Ill be honest with you I know a whole more about what freedom isnt than about what it is because Ive never been free I can only share my vision with you of the future about what freedom is
The way I see it freedom is is the right to grow is the right to
Blossom Freedom is is the right to be yourself to be who you are to be who you wanna be to do what you wanna do
