Be  Intro  Lyrics
Yeah
Yes
I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left
Im talking Malcolm Coltrane my man Yusef
Through death grew conception new breath and resurrection
For moms new steps in a direction
In the right way told her Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights they stay on the mind
But I write many lives they lay on these lines
Wavin signs of the times many say the grinds on the mind
Shorties bluntedeyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies killers immortalized
We got arms but wont reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise I look into my daughters eyes
And realize Ima learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If Ima do it I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz Gramps wantin em
Demons and old friends Pops they hauntin him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back or too far in front of me
The present is a gift and I just wanna be  Be be be be
