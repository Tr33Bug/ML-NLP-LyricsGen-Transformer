Aston Martin king Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
Im like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada stay mellow like lala
Young fresh with dollars ladies go gaga
Im the cumlada top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask pure religion and cash
From the windows that open Im raising my glass
Daylight beams night life schemes
This is my inception Im writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh aint too high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
It all started with a dream I wanted to be RunDMC
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M dreams were spoken to him
Thats when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes yes sir this is what Im made for
To go hard in the paint like D Wade or
D Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care my music is the medicine
My name holds weight I am never hesitant
Different state resident this is hood elegance
SLS classic pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion now Im Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh aint too high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right


Aye ayeaye aye aye hey
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey  Ayeayeayeaye aye 
Aye ayeaye aye aye hey  Ayeayeaye aye aye aye 
Silhouettes of dreams that we had high huh
Even now it dont seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
Im gone now imagine what Im gonna be
Dirty to worthy now Im all wordy
My broad up in Paris looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldnt take that long to get me there
Keep running til I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how Im the one
Couldve been anywhere but Im sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh until high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right
