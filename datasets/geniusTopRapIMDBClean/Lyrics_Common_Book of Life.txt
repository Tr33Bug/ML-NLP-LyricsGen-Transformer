Heres a little that must be told
beat scratches 
From beginning to end  beat scratches 
Heres a little story that must be told  beat scratches 
From beginning to end
I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
To pray and I say now lay me down to sleep
Hopin that I keep my soul
Peep Im gettin old and this a cold cold world
And I aint even got a bomber
Livin with my momma its the same routine
Keep my room clean Im lookin to do some new things
But aint shit to do
Im twentytwo catch
In the prime of my life I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel disgruntled
Tryin to find me some light
In the rim of darkness I too sing
I may not be the darkest brother
But I was always told to act my age not my color
Not knowin that my color was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up stand up
Dont give up the fight
Its like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours
And its about to come down hard thank God
I found you
heres a little story that must be told  beat scratches 
sample my life my life my life my life
Double Trouble heres a little story that must be told
sample my life my life
Double Trouble from beginning to end
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin itll last til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the arab then on the way back
I stop at the liquor store grab me a six pack
Knowin that once Im done with that Ill be back
To get some more
Once I get started I dont wanna stop  ahh 
And I cant turn around brew I cant turn it down
Ironically I turn it up my liver I burn it up
Its my life I live it up the cup I gotta give it up
One day
Im cruisin down a oneway street
And I done passed fun day three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I aint lookin  how come 
I aint tryin to degrade myself bein nobodys Calvin Im a couch bum
What makes it bad I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I cant recall a day without bein intoxicated or blowed
Im dealin with a full deck at any day I can fold
What makes it bad I wasnt dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didnt go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you

Its like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin under I ponder
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor but I dont have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that Im into
Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience I reminisce
And wish I could go back in time to eightynine
When there was just sunshine
But now its like Im gettin older theres so much strain and stress
I dont think Ill ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind and find who I am
But thank God I found you
