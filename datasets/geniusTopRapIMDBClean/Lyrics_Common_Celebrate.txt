And I got all my niggas around

A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round

Exotic broads lobbying Spanish Somalian

We living in the night looking in the eye
On our paper til we get it like Dubai

Girls with the drastic butts that ask for bucks

My guys I used to hoop with is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight shell be giving conscious headlights
Beaming from the Bimmer that her momma bought her

Look where drama brought us look where karma brought us
Married to the game like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some RB broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlers from the go how far we done came
Celebrate

For the life getting bugged tonight

Told you its gonna be on like the business that we lean on
Put my team on get our heat on

Bills aint so bad celebrate that
Party in the yard til the lights come on
Aint nobody crying
Weve come so far been climbing

Cmon and raise your glass up high
Everybody home aint nobody gone

It feel good dont it Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
