And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
I rap with the passion of Christ nigga cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
Im back like a chiroprac with bboy survival rap
It aint ninetyfo Joe we cant go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired Imma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas breaks over
Im raw hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
Its a war goin on you cant fake bein a soldier
In the basement listening to tapes of Ultra
Magnetic to the fact the messiah is black
Ill turn the TV down we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin cutlasses dope and other traditions
In the conditions of the city the city
The city the city the city the city
Come on
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
A black figurein the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims surprised niggas aint become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell em fuck em like I do to police
The beast is runnin rampant
Im in between sheets tryin to have sex thats tantric
For the ghetto tryin to make a getup standup anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin for to get fame or get rich
I slap a nigga like you and tell him Rick James bitch
With your Hollywood stories on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit we wanna hit the same switch
You didnt know where to aim it you still remain bitch
Im forever puttin words together
Somell sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved wit run
Unless its DMC or runnin these broads to bein free
Im harder than the times you hardly scary
Holdin gats inside you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hiphop is goin its Chicagoan
Poetrys in motion like a picture now showin
Its the city the city yall the city
Uh the city yall come on
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
We dont stop naw we dont quit
And ya say ChiCity
Common Sense from the city of wind
