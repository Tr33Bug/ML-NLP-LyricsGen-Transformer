We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didnt matter
Kaclow boom pop Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I aint afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you I admit I had issues
Like ebony your essence your pedigree your presence
Its more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust lets shake off the dust
From the cloth
Oh youre worried about when people stop and stare
Thats just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same cloth you just want to wear
But thats just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la la la la la
This is tailormade love fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so lets have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you the good word I read with you
Looking at things that weve been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Lets stay in the present no time for second guessing
You said its this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it thats so unexpected
Yeah thats the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause whats inside of us no need to outsource
The cloth


Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights tight never smother
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Its two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Its the cloth
