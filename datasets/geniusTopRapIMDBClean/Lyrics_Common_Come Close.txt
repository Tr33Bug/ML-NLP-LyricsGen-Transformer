Its just a fly love song what
Its just a fly love song what
Are we living in a dream world
Are your eyes still green girl
I know youre sick and tired of arguing
But you cant keep it bottled in
Jealousy we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
Ima do the best I can do
Cause Im my best when Im with you
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
Whats it without you  Nothin nothin 
Put down your bags love

Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing with this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe with you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I cant hide from you
The pimp in me may have to die with you
Come close to me baby  Come close babe

The aftermath is you touching me
Its destiny that we connected girl
