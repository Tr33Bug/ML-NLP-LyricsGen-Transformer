Ohh
Walk up in the thing got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thang poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin
Campaign poppin champagne poppin
I wrote this on my born day it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat we gon do it gourmet
Im hearing fuckin voices like when porn play
Stay stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine you find a way
Stayed on porches backyards and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper pussy pride and ego
Born to fly call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and EazyE though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was fro
Thats Ice Cold like Dre triple three yo
Pinot noir style better with time
Im gambling with watches getting better with time
So Imma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say time is money forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo get this money put the diamonds on display


Ohh
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thang poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin
Campaign poppin champagne poppin
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin
Nooo
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Tryna get it every way every day day day
Tryna get it every way every day ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Tryna get it every way every day day day
Tryna get it every way every day ay ay
Tryna get it every way every day day day
Bars in alignment stars in alignment
Raw off consignment Gods in the diamonds
Evolve from the science power and refinement
Read between the lines hard to define us
Niggas thats behind us throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
Ive seen Len Bias that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time man precious like diamonds
Look through the glass see what I magnify man
Imma be shining til I die man
Im a rare diamond thats hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an AK
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity aint no disparity
Between peace and prosperity so marry me
Diamonds
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
Im rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say I need that fadeaway
Had a crush on whats her name the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang banging like an 808
Said you cant take his chain away
Real player you cant take this game away
Slang away walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you cant take my dame away
Devil in a red dress but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it daytodaytodaytoday
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court beating all kinds of cases
Weed money pussy liquor thats my favorite compilation
Diamonds
Diamonds
