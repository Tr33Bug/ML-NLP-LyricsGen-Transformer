Love is not a mystery its everything
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill uh like OK Go
Had a body A body that you cant pay fo
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasnt fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes tryin hard to be chose
They say its hard for a pimp but extra hard for these  hoes 
Readin Us and People mag tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild

Love is not a mystery its everything
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types da DDDame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebodyd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes thats athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
Its a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

Love is not a mystery its everything
They was one of them couples people said they were the it
Unbreakable like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and youre lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery its everything
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
Its this thing now thats drivin me wild
I gotta see whats up before it gets me down
