Faithful to the end  we got to be 
Faithful to the end  I want to be 
Faithful to the end  yes its for the people 
Id like to be her very best friend
God moves yeah 
I was rollin around in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her
Would I treat her the same Would I still be runnin game on her
In what type of ways would I want her
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body
Couldnt be out gettin bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit her would I still be wantin my ex
The lies the greed the weed the sex
Wouldnt be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin her cross I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi
Ride wit her cause I know for me shed die
Through good and bad call on her like Im chirpin her
Couldnt be jealous cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her glory Im grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Id like to be her very best friend
He worked with her she was his ladys best friend
Even if they dont try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig a wife a kid a decent home
One reason or another couldnt find peace at home
She asked Why do men always have to stray
He said Im bad not as bad as Eric Benet
I used to take em out to eat but they wasnt really eatin
Mighta got a little head but I wasnt really cheatin
Its hard when your lady dont believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought and said Im tryin to get my life together
Went home to his lady these were his confessions
Baby you a blessin and my best friend
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Id like to be her very best friend
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Im gonna be Im gonna be Im gonna be so faithful
Im gonna be Im gonna be so faithful
So so so
So so so
So faithful
So so so
So so so
Thats what Im gonna do
Faithful to the end
Thats what Im gonna do
Faithful to the end
Thats what Im gonna do
Faithful to the end
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
