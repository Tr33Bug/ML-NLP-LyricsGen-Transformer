GOD  Gaining Ones Definition  Lyrics
After bein 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl Who knows
Anyway just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin check it
Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devils White
Well the devil is wrong and God is whats right
I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain aint gone but I can still see clear
As a child given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
Quran and the Bible to me they all vital
And got truth within em gotta read them boys
You just cant skim em different branches of belief
But one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray aint right
Thats who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say in Jesus name or Hum do Allah
Long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
Cause when the trumpets blowin 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144000 gon get home
Only 144000 gon get home
Only 144000 gon get it baby
Ive lived and Ive learned
I have taken and Ive earned
I have laughed Ive cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
Damn something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil Im just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin elder advice read the Bible the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on this aint right Jesus wasnt White
Some leads were granted with insight
And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant follow your lesson
If a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown
If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own


Ive lived and Ive learned
I have taken and Ive earned
I have laughed Ive cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me
