From the hood
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake her titties aint fake
Fucking in the car cause we just cant wait
To get home early in the morn getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low money by her Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever shes strong
Hear Beyonces song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting we getting it on

I dont even say shit she can feel it
Eye talks the realest toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and its hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm the other is a skillet
Fried chicken macaroni raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince shes my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony Montana
Reminded me a me of my of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a niggas squares not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets aint closed
When the cameras start snapping shes ready to pose

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldnt mention
For me getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes congresswomen inflictin
Pain onto my game wanted and Im sadistic
They liked it they dyked it devices twisted
til I get a nice chick to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids Labrador behind the white fence
But Im still single looking for Cleopatra
African Queen yo look at me Im a bachelor
Yall niggas in trouble keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers be happy I havent chose yours
She love glamour bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette my manors
Half hood half class photographers cameras
Caught us out there the spotlight hope she can handle this
She can join me red carpet at my next nonprofit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
