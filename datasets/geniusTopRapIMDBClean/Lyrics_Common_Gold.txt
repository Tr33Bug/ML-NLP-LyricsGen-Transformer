So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my
Soul Ohh ohh Ohh ohh
Ashtrays and cigarretes last days indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success I want yall to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler one a king one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess its my addiction to women
I was in France in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like Im Tennessee Williams
Now its new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic victorious story is redemption
Im sitting at the top Im not alone
Im standing here with my
Soul Ohh
Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 50 but my creeds Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came I made the song cry for em
Lyrical gymnast you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo check my youth revival
Truth inside flow I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride well reign kill the game and watch it die slow
Ali MC I fight for more than the title
Your idol
So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my
Soul Ohh ohh Ohh
How I made it out with my
Soul Ohh ohh Ohh ohh
