One more try 
We have come too far to stop now 
Yeah Dilla
One more try 
It is all that we have got 
Two DJs one microphone
We freestyle we write at home
It dont it dont uhuh we go on
You the one I cant leave alone
You grown I know you groan
When Im in you I feel home
We in the house of love no lie
Appreciate you more as time goes by
When its truly true it dont die
I see you in LA I see you in NY
I see you in the A I see you in the Chi
I hear you when JAY still make the song cry
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one that gave me that confidence
You the one that told me bout consciousness
And said see beyond my metropolis
You put the boogabooga loop pop lockin this
We too far aint no stoppin this  Were too far now 
Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
Here here here here here here we go
They say that that love makes you grow
Youve been sensensensational
Instrumeeintational
In my life youve been vocal
But at times I felt like I didnt know you
Now I know you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you
We all change for what its worth
You an angel and still down to earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did to me you listen
Gangstas gods you hugged and kiss em
No matter you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten you talk vision of partyin
And gettin people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle
Thats why we all love you


Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
You gave me a voice in the world
Its been hard to choose another girl
They trip when you mumble they trip when you sing
But you gave us a chance to dream
In young thugs you see a future
You recognize little uzi aint here to shoot ya
At 21 you knew I was savage
But you said Common you will never be average
Its a cold world we need JAY
If you could dot com you could dot K
You rock two chains keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG
You told me Im the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave mills to the meek to inherit the Earth
Before me too you said Ladies first
Things get rocky you there ASAP
Rocky or Ferg you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic with words
With no name I was a hard MC
Love and hiphop on some Cardi B
Now you a part of me creatin Tyler style
A future aint odd to see
Free spirit with young will like Jaden
When I see you you never agin
Made in America for the world to see
You everybodys but you my girl to me
Im forever yours to the tictoc
Im still talking bout you hiphop
Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
Who knew Who knew that we would take it this far
I I love you so just be who you are
