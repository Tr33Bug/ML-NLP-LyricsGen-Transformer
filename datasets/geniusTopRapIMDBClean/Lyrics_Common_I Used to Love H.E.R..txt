I Used to Love HER Lyrics
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com Sensell be the sure shot come on
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh yo when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
ACom Sense yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
UAC yo we gotta be the sure shot
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me by not preachin to me
But speakin to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into RB hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
If you dont check it mmmm bust it bust it
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it but Im committed
Girl hes committed  But so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Imma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Mainframe yo they gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two Com Sense is gonna drop haha
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER
I used to love HER went and fucked up all the shit yall
You aint got your woman in check man
I think youre overstepping your bounds just a little bit
I cant do this anymore
