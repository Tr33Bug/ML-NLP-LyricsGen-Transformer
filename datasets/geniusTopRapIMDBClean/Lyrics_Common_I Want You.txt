Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout
Ive been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know its a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on
Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
They say you dont know know know what you got
Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you


We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
