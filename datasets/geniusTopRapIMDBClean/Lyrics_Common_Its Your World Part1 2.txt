Its Your World  Part 1  2  Lyrics
Night blows stoves dont work hoes at work
A warrior so I wear em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was I spend a day buzzed
Trippin off heights wishin for nights in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy shortbody Caddies
Uncles named Larry that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch Scoot or BaeBae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas stacked upon each other
Its the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang aint really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga same block same shit they on
Only thing different quicker they click that chrome
In my defense yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man Im good workin with my hands
My generation never understood workin for the man
And of being broke I aint a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world
Its your world
Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of herb from out of towners
Its hard to stay grounded
We stay high thats why old folks down us
Lost nobody found us the force that surrounds us
Aint with us they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin her body wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash lookin in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where its more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary amongst thieves and baseheads
Said it was her toes but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk growin up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike so her mother he strike
She got to like likeminded niggas who liked crimes and figures
Doin white lines and liquor see hard times had kicked her
In the ass it used to be thicker
Life is fast some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap blacks that lack
Selfesteem yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons yall but we forgot the theme
In the Chi we even rootin for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world
Its your world
I wanna be a pediatrician
I wanna be a governor
I want to be a artist
I wanna be a veterinarian
I wanna be a model
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a ballet dancer
I wanna be a football player
I wanna be a astronaut
I wanna be a obstetrician
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a nurse
I wanna be a fashion designer
I want to be a gym teacher
I wanna be a architect
I want to be a duck
I wanna be a wrestler
I wanna be a dancer
I wanna be the first AfricanAmerican female president
I wanna be a police officer
I wanna be a rock star
I wanna be a gymnastics teacher
I wanna be a captain of a police station
I wanna be a drummer
I wanna be an actress
I wanna be a superstar
Be be here be there be that be this
Be grateful for life be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday for being the best swimmer among 500000
Benign be you be moms mean pie
Be little black Sambo with bad hair
Be aware of Willie Lynchism
Be be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general be no one except I
Be a strong academic student be an A student in Sociology
Be food for thought to the growin mind be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited be longliving be forgiving be not forgetful
Be a proud run only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible but justice at any rate
Be high when you low be on time but know when to go
Be cautious of the road to college taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin
A nation built on free labor for reparation Be a cartopographer
A map maker be able to find AfroAmerican land
Search thoroughly it may be close to black land
Be amended 55ths be amended 55ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid to world government
Be found among the truth lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144000 be the resident of that twelfth house
Be eternal
