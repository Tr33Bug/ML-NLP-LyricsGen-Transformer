Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  yeah 
Ooh  sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  yeah 
Ooh
Ah yes my Lord Ah Oh
And the streets say 
And the people say 
And we all say 
Ah yes my Lord Ah Oh
And the streets say 
And the people say 
And we all say 
My money aint straight my fam aint straight
Aint wanna push kis heaven couldnt wait
I was hurtin couldnt get no work
You created me from dust thats why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now Im in a hearse whats this cash really worth
My whole life I had to worry about eatin
I aint have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon come
Im coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I dont want my waves following him the streets swallowing him
And I dont want no hollows in him his momma said she see his father in him
Hope its the good things til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates cause I know youve forgiven what Ive done
Im your son do I have the keys to get in
Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat eat whatevers on your plate
Save some for me the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven cause I couldnt get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes aint free
We still wading in the water cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell em talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse they wasnt for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day bare faced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you aint from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys
To the kingdom


Nas hit me up on the phone like Peace Isa
You know you need to preach how the pyramids of Giza
Alone condemn Easter
Instead of sniffing lines popping thongs in Ibiza Ether
Nigga are we not thy brothers keeper
Allahu Akbar abracadabra
We used what we had to stay alive like MacGyver
Started from the bottom now we really really here
Started kinda blurry now we really really clear
Its the Nat King unforgettable black king on a pedestal
The way he made words into edibles was incredible
Verbs and spices giving life out to the lifeless
Giving Christ out to the Christless
My handle with the dices been documented as priceless
I roll 7s naturally
Devils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally
Rappers I gave birth to shot at the God blasphemy
Told these motherfuckers to never Jimmy DeGrassi me
This goes out to those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on original Jews
The chosen people of God getting slandered and abused
In the streets and the news by the seed of Yakub
The synagogues of Satan wanna keep us confused
Thats how we lose niggas got the ill street blues
From Chiraq to England
Me and Common dropping bombs like the baby planes as we establish the kingdom
