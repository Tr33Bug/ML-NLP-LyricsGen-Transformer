I do dirt in search of a clear mind
Money talk somebodys gonna hear mine
Grind early before 930
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death you heard me
My world aint worldly any time could be my time
I get high but still aint seen Chicago skyline
In my prime stakes is high cause its beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents we want the same face
And to think me and the president we from the same place
Fourhundred and twentyone murders aint tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven will I make it through the main gate
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap he was about to get put on
At his funeral listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming I hurt for em
A cold world thats why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
Ima need to go back I gots to get em
Back and forth in these streets thats the rhythm
Revenge is posed to be the Lords but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch cost my man his life
I cant afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end


Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  Yeah

My money aint straight my fam aint straight
Aint wanna push kis Heaven couldnt wait
I was hurting couldnt get no work
You created me from dustthats why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now Im in a hearse whats this cash really worth
My whole life I had to worry bout eating
I aint have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the Kingdom for Chicago gon come
Im coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I dont want my ways following him
The streets swallowing him and I dont want no hollows in him
His mama say she see his father in him hope its the good things
Til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates cause I know youve forgiven what Ive done
Im your son do I have the keys to get in
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh  Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning fathers seed
Got a shipment by the sea see my niggas tryna eat
Eat whatevers on your plate save some for me
The worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to Heaven cause I couldnt get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes aint free
We still wading in the water
Cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell em Talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my mama though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles
Whoa littered with the abuse
They wasnt for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day barefaced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you aint from round here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh  Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom  Yeah
