Southern leaves southern trees we hung from
Barren souls heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating fathers from children
Institution aint just a building
But a method of having black and brown bodies fill them
We aint seen as human beings with feelings
Will the US ever be us Lord willing
For now we know the new Jim Crow
They stop search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
Americas moment to come to Jesus
Freedom  Freedom 
Freedom come  Freedom come 
Hold on  Hold on 
Wont be long  Wont be long 
Freedom  Freedom 
Freedom come  Freedom come 
Hold on  Hold on 
Wont be long  Wont be long 
The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being a pastoral scene
Slaverys still alive check Amendment 13
Now whips and chains are subliminal
Instead of nigga they use the word criminal
Sweet land of liberty incarcerated country
Shot me with your raygun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business Americas the company
Investing in injustice fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise its a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them so we can free us
Americas moment to come to Jesus
