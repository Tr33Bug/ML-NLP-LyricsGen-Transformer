How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldnt sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nigs real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam showing love and support
You and your babys mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
Thats why we dont know how til were older men
If love is a place Ima go again
At least now now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then youre home again
Ive seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he dont want to end yo
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Its all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping itd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that shed have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love em more when theyre relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin afraid
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so shed understand
What it is to be loved by a man


How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Some say that Im a dreamer cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it having broad limits
In the game of life its the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people love always yeah
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
