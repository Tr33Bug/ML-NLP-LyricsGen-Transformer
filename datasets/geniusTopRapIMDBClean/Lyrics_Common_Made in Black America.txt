Uh yeah
Made in Black America metaphor for a predator
Been to the Mediterranean on my papers like a editor
I flow like a reservoir dog
Rap Tarantino off the chain like Django
Still let the chain glow where they bang though
And niggas get shot like camera angles
In rap videos put up on Vimeo
Im where the buck 50 bicentennial perennial allstar
Fruit that dont fall far from Islam
When rap is dead I had the fluid that embalm
I speak you know Im in the building like an intercom
Enter Com the worlds most
Intricate integrated with imminent
Domain Im feeling myself like a sentimen
Tal letter written to myself
Aspirin for greatness wellness and wealth Im cold Im hard to melt
Uhh Im more than a hot song or a hot album
Ask my ex I still live on like Malcolm
My spirit and style done a transformation
Make room nigga I dont need reservations
You sweet as a hotel I stay presidential
Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you
To rearrange the mental Ive seen things weve been through
Its hard for a man to claim gentile let me change the tempo
I be with broads that got they shit together
Even if it aint meant forever still smoke the spliff together
The essence of the herbs the presence of the words
Yeah you got a chest but Im treasurin your curves
You walk past Ima look behind you
Look you up and down to find you
Can see I was designed to give you power and refine you
You fucking with me we can grind to
Gather the better Black America
Yeah made in Black America takin threats from a terrorist
We will never meet but the media feed hysteria
And I be inferior if I be in fear of ya
More godly than gluttonous but my suppers superior
You know the difference tween the kids with the lunch tickets
And the ones with the money in the cafeteria
I break bread with with my brethren like a pizzeria
Spinnin dough youll find red dots over cheese be a
Ware of your whereabouts dont be feeble
Im pissed off tinkle is the onomatopoeia
Yous just a little star  twinkle  sure aint me
Been a superstar since ma made me
My president is black  uhh 
I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast
I dont give a fuck shit my grandpa glad
They pass that gun law or not niggas still gon pop up dead


Yeah Im the Morpheus in this hiphop matrix exposin fake shit
Used to borrow dollars now my sense aint so common
Went across the whole nation screamin Hiiipower  HiiiPower 
Never been a racist but I love horsepower
Im hot thats why I got the fans in the stands
Em fans googlin enemies shakin hands
Restorin the balance detourin the malice
We kill you motherfuckin mice with a mallet  uhh 
This is Huey P Newton with a QP
Bobby with a Seale Fred Hampton on pills
In the Hamptons now thats ill whats happenin
Im just trying to teach my homies bout the Emerald tablets
Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal
Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia
To the nations capital Golf Wang radical
Black Lip Pastor tip the usher when he pass ya nigga
Welcome to Black America Soul
