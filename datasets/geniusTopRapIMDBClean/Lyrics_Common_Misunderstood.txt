Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that Im mad
No one can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
Well Im just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please dont let me be misunderstood
Yeah uh  Misunderstood 
We do this for the people that walk that path
Tryna get to their dream yeah uh  oh 
He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasnt the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs thats festerin
He knew the President wadnt addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People dont see how AIDS is affectin em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Cant find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin em
Cant believe they would be the ones bucking him
He on the ground he could feel God touching him
He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him
At heavens gate saying Lord please let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men
Misunderstood
Cause we are  Misunderstood
Misunderstood dont let me be misunderstood
Im just human oh
Uh yeah
She dancin she dance she dance for them
Her body move but her mind was manicn
Thinkin I dont know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always aint the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again


Misunderstood
Cause we are  Misunderstood
Misunderstood dont let me be misunderstood
Im just human oh
The life we lead will always lead us
And we pray that he will never leave us
Its the price we pay I guess thats the reason
Why my grandma sang we all need Jesus
The life we lead will always lead us
And we pray that he will never leave us
Its the price we pay I guess thats the reason
Why my grandma sang we all need Jesus
Misunderstood dont let me be misunderstood
Misunderstood dont let me be misunderstood
Im just human
