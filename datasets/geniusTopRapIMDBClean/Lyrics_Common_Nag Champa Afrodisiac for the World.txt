Nag Champa  Afrodisiac for the World  Lyrics
Exciteting enlightning inviteing
Im writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion cause Im the Earth Wind and Fire of hiphop
By Rakim and Short Ive been inspired
My shit knocks environments of cats with seventeens
Tint time is money the mind is funny how its spent on getting it
Im sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is money cash hoes
I went from bashful to asshole to international lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover its felt
Now deal with it
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
In this neverending battle to please
Niggas magazine writers emcees
Who request hot shit I freeze
And tell them where I was rose we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This neverwentgold nigga rocks shows caratless
You not gon respect self at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day I gotta carry this
And beats rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking RB broads it came true
Journalist I wreck shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice come to find out the angel was me
Some say You changing Rashid
Times are we still close
I rhyme far away away away
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday uhah
You know the dopechoppin gunpoppin homies dying
Im amongst it save the war stories for Private Ryan INI
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
Women cry children laugh men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprahs
My refrigerator poetrys magnetic like ultra
You couldnt hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
Its rumors of gay emcees just dont come around me with it
You still rockin hickies dont let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat lost weight but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a babys first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when its time to head home
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
We be that we be that
Afrodisiac disiac
