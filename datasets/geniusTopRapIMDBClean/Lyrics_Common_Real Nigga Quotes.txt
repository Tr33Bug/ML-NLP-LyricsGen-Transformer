Real nigga quotes I tote
Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote
Legendary like The Goat who got game
Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album niggas was expecting now my water broke
Before it I was sort of broke
Get the paper for the funnies sports and the horoscope
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still Imma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown Im in the end zone
You cant honor what Im on then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm my pen told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw
Dont talk to broads that are spoke for that provoke war
Stand out like cold sores claim you hard but you hocore
George Bush and CIA you moving Os for
I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours
Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real
ChickachickaM chickaC chickaM am I
People call me Com and collective with perspective
I draw crowds go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like Nam sound tell your bitch to calm down
Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
Im ill raps I spit as if I had a bad cough
This crank nigga stole a style and aint take the tag off
Playing yourself you cant come with it so you jack off
More heart than an artery jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony its gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down this aint comedy
Shit is real like a station property crew is forming colonies
Commonly I hear these rats thinking they mahogany
On every rap hook sounding like a dog to me
In a reservoir I flow and go
On and on like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion hit makers get blown
Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real
RB studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent them niggas whole style is silent
I hate to staple the singers together
But in my head its been ringing forever
And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
While all you singers booty this and freak me baby it gets me
Emcees be insecure like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a show in your town Im there with mob
Bukeing niggas and pulling broads is they apparent job
Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real
Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real
