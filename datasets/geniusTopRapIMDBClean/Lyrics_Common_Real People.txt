Yeah yeah you know how me and Ye do
Real People walk in the streets the streets is talkin
Often its beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
Its like a colored song that keep keepin on
I guess knowin Im weak is when Im really bein strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan thats why I write freedom songs
For the real people
I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
Were the children of a better God searchin for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin homework thats when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slaves mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that its drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief its the games nature
When youre glowin some will love and some will hate ya
Its real people
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface a persons a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin the sky talkin to themselves
Givin the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it some of it I do be in
I be showin niggas lives like UBN Its real people


Yeah
For you and yours
GOOD Music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh Yeah
Yeah yeah
The real
