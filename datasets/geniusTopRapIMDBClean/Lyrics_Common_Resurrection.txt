Resurrection
Yeah Ima get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago Chicago everywhere check it
Its like come on yall get live get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on yall get live get down
Common Sense is in your town
I stagger in the gatherin possessed by a patterin that be scatterin
Over the global my vocals be travelin unravelin my abdomen
Its slime thats babblin grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin everything Im readin
But my brain was bleedin needin feedin and exercise
I didnt seek the best of buys its a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
Im Nestle when its crunchtime
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy Id be sunshine
Cause I deliver like the SunTimes
Confined in oncemines on dumb rhymes I combine
Im hype like Im unsigned my diet I unswine
Eating beef sometimes  I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
Its the freestyle so now its out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense cause I was guilty in a sense
Resurrection
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe imaginations in flight
I send light like Bens kite Ive been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Dont hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite Ive been indicted as a freak of all trades
Doodoodoodoo doodoo  I got it made
I bathe in bass lines rinse in riffs dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we dont get no thicker
UAC got my back and we dont get no thicker
UAC got my back and we dont now check it
Im a ho but not a ho nigga aint scared of no nigga
When its my turn to go I gotta go
And Im gone with the storm
Resurrection
