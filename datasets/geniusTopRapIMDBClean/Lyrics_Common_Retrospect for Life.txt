Yo we gotta start respectin life more yall
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin
We losin too many of ours
Gotta recreate yall
Yo check it
Knowin you the best part of life do I have the right to take yours
Cause I created you irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of
The start of somethin Im not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin I was sterile
I look into mothers stomach wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin this womans womb into a tomb
But she and I agree a seed we dont need
You wouldve been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone I wouldve fed this information I read
To someone my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
Im sorry for takin your first breath first step and first cry
But I wasnt prepared mentally nor financially
Havin a child shouldnt have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I dont wanna go through the drama of havin a babys momma
Weekend visits and buyin Js aint gon make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on Ima use self control instead of birth control
Cause 315 dollars aint worth your soul
315 dollars aint worth your soul
315 dollars aint worth it
I never dreamed youd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didnt you stay
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations childs elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even thats a lie in less than two weeks we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say its lust
Bustin more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we dont trust each other enough
And believe havin this childll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin spendin the rest of our lives
Its too many black women that can say they mothers but cant say that they wives
I wouldnt chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
Its so much in my life thats undone
We gotta see eye to eye about family before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldnt run from
But Im walkin findin myself in my God
So I can discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names case our minds changed
You say your period hasnt came and lately Ive been sleepy
So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and lets have this boy
I never dreamed youd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didnt you stay
I never dreamed youd leave in summer
Now the situations made things change
Why didnt you stay
