La la la la la
And everybody say say
La la la la la
I know youI know you
I know you thinking thinking that it must be
ArmorAll flow cause it never get rusty
I aint gotta say it man dog trust me
Bust somebody head GLC where was we
Still rock the Pradafore that rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore em all up
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside side of the Chi
The broads the cars the halfmoons the stars
Im like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in 94 they called me Chitowns Nas
Now them niggas know Im one of Chitowns gods
We eating Joe you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mack like Steve Jobs
We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside side of the Chi
Your fly is open McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
Im back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep Im still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldnt cop a coupe with no coupons
Look at that Neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him Do you have any Grey Poupon


We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside side of the Chi
You in the building but the buildings falling
You wouldnt be balling if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school yall niggas you should call him August
Im the sun that goes down but Im still revolving
Southside wwwalk it out while still youre crawling
If rap was Harlem Id be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G Rap were calling
We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside Southside
South side of the Chi
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Cant wait til they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
Papa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gon love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters  Ayy 
We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside  Yeah 
Southside Southside  Ugh 
Southside side of the Chi
The unAmerican idol tower like the Eiffel
Lean with it rock with it Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery and beat it like Michael
Your career is a typo mine was written like a haiku
I write to do the right things like Spike do
Through conflicts thats Crucial and drama thats Psycho  Oh 
We coming from the Southside Southside
Southside Southside
Southside Southside
South side of the Chi
Lalalalala la
La lalalalala la
La lalalalala la
La lalalalala la
