My motto is Chicago bitch
Everybody know you sweet what the problem is
Dont play dumb Im the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch I imagine what your father is
She said How you make your opponent
The rapper of the moment His style he dont own it
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon mess around and make me catch a body like that
Awwww dont do it
Cause every song you make Joe is really ho music
I heard you said you wasnt a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch thats eighteen
Cant say my name but rap about a niggas wife
You so black and white trying to live a niggas life
Im taking too long with this amateur guy
You aint wet nobody nigga you Canada dry
Soft nigga Make no mistake Im talking to Drake
Its the remix Rick Ross Common and that hoass nigga
No mantoman dont hide behind them other niggas
Nah this mantoman You cant run behind them man
This is some real man shit right here
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
If you aint running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Why the sudden change
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
If you aint running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Better say my name
