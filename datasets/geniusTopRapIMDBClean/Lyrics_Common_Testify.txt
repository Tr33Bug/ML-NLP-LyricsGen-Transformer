She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he neednt hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him she screamed
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her mans back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if hes alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
The judge yelled for order the court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify


The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated he was guilty on all charges
Shes shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist she brought her face up laughing
Thats when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime the queenpin
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
You accuse me of a you accuse me of a you accuse
Please let me testify please let me testify
