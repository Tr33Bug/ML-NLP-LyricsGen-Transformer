The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah its Common Sense with DJ Premier
We gonna help yall see clear
Its real hiphop music from the soul yall
Yeah check it yo
The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
Its unseen or heard a king with words
Cant knock the hustle but Ive seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say Im too deep Im in too deep to sleep
Through me Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru thats untapped
Want to be in the rap race but aint ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you cant come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack forgot that
This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Heeeeyyyy heeeeeyyyy
This is rap This is rap for real
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
In front of twoinch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write I see my daughters eyes
Im the truth across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie Id be theme music
My music you either fight fuck or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme I try to scheme through it
Through my shell never knew what the divine would bring to it
Id be lying if I said I didnt want millions
More than money saved I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
Im Morpheus in this hiphop Matrix exposing fake shit
And you know yes you know
This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Heeeeyyyy heeeeeyyyy
This is rap This is rap for real
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th sat by this little girl
She recited raps I forgot where they was from
In em she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking how many souls hiphop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge ones perspective
Though some of that shit yall bop to it I aint relating
If I dont like it I dont like it that dont mean that Im hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know Im with em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes its like
And you know yes you know
Thi This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
Thi This is rap for real something you feel
Heeeeyyyy heeeeeyyyy
