I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
These are the words of a believer achiever leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and its process
Birth of a son death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told em whos in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
Its tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us
Look at the picture hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we havent taught them
Is it what we talking we really aint walking
Dues hustlers pay how much did it cost em
Find myself on the same corner that we lost em
Real talking in their ear like a Walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them I see my baby girl believe
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
The Lord lives among us the younguns hunger
Become a means to get it by any ways nece
ssary under pressure children feeling lesser
With the steel up on the dresser killing will aggressors
Destinys children survivors soldiers
In front of buildings their eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons sirens holsters
That aint the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning shawtys know to keep learning
Lessons in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors
Of a contest that seems beyond us
Even through the unseen I know that God watches
From one Kings dream he was able to Barack us
The prophets
Nothing can stop us


I believe in the light that shines and will never die  Believe 
Oh I believe the fire burns we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
