For your nation yeah  8x 
One two yeah
Coming through yeah
Fa sho
Ha Com Sense yeah
Southside yeah
Niggas be outside yeah
Now bust it out ChiTown
A bitch nigga with an attitude named Cube
Stepped to the Com with a feud
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast
You aint made shit dope since AmeriKKKas Most
Wanted deceased from the Midwest to the East
On the dick of the East for your first release
Your lease is up at the crib house niggas get evicted
In videos with white boys talking you get wicked
Natural born killa nigga you natural born God
Read rich got the nerve to say you rob
Hyprocrite Im filling out your death certificate
Slinging bean pies and St Ides in the same sentence
Shoulda repented on the 16th of October
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over
Rap career is over better off acting
What trouble I see in managing WC and Wack 10
You backed into a four corner hustla
Lying on your dick said you was fuckin her
Use higher learning dont take my words out of text
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX
Itll take the nation of millions to hold me back
From giving you mouth shots or hit with the pipe that Ralph got
Chris Tucker aint around its your Friday it was good
I wasnt salty she was with the Boyz N the Hood


I see the bitch in you when you dont speak your mind
The bitch in you looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you to be hard you trying
The bitch in you its coming out  BITCH 
The ump of this rap shit Cube Im calling out
I break in and smack niggas thats in the Slaughterhouse
This aint no East Coast West Coast none of the above
Im from Chi I went to Cali  and what  niggas gave me love
Theres a thin line between the fake and the real
Graftedass nigga I see through your Glass Shield
Had skills once upon a time on this project yo
Im a have to wreck a HOShea
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper
So what  so I had to slap her uh
And violate you  you  a Muslim drinking brew  brew 
Your nigga aint no Mack 10 hes a 22
I seen you  Mack 10  you aint say shit in ATL
Cube I like that diamond charm I might cuff it then sell
It out like you sold Kam and Threat
A year ago you wasnt talking shit about the West
Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable
Hoobangin You aint banging shit but the table
And the Circle MAAD aint got no choice but to fight
Aint none of yall motherfuckers got a chance on the mic
Any time you come out joe Ima talk about you
Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you
Any last words before I hit the switch
From the immortal words of one a bitch iz a
I see the bitch in you when you dont speak your mind
The bitch in you looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you simply hard you trying
The bitch in you for sho its coming out  BITCH 
Thats how the Eastside gets down word up
