Memories on corners with the fos and the mos
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and their soles niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed hoping for mo
With nowhere to go niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they aint knowin their goals
The streets aint safe cause they aint knowing the code
By the foes I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds with windows that dont roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling uhuh
Uhuhugh on the corners niggas robbing killing
Dying just to make a living huh
We overstated we underrated we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them
Street lights and deep nights cats trying to eat right
Riding noseatbikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head and they feet right
Desires of street life cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights days are thieflike
The beasts roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at its peak we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where niggas is sheeplike
Rappers and hoopers we strive to be like
Gs with three stripes seeds that need light
Cheese and recite needs and BE strife
The corner where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause its hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Realitys a bitch and I heard that she bites
The corner
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling uhuh
Uhuhugh on the corners niggas robbing killing
Dying just to make a living huh
The corner was our magic our music our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Black church services murderers Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isnt just fertile its people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
Its so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is where the money moving the determined live
We talk shit play lotto and buy German beers
Its so black packed with action thats affirmative
The corners
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling uhuh
Uhuhugh on the corners niggas robbing killing
Dying just to make a living huh
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal our monument
Our testimonial to freedom to peace and to love
Down on the corner
