Yeah Its been a long time comin
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion
I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late  uh oh uh oh uh oh 
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to get  duhough duhough duhough 
Im up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites  po po po po po po 
Now the money comin slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than  nooh nooh nooh 
You love to hear the story again and again
About these young brothers from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle titties and skin fifties and rims
Yall know the Sprewells and trucks thats detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide with em a system that tries victims
We livin in my man in the fast lane pivotin
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and em
On the block its hot you can feel it in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin
Eyes bright it seems like the fight is dim in em
Call my man Cuzo like Im kin to him
He tryin to stay straight the streets is bendin him
I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late  uh oh uh oh uh oh 
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to get  duhough duhough duhough 
Im up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites  po po po po po po 
Now the money comin slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than  nooh nooh nooh 


Its all good in the hood like rats in gyms
Throwbacks and Timbs blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
We never fall short with us its all Force like Air 1s
Some waves some air guns the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if its for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin to the grind
Po livin in more prisons pointin to my mind shine the light up
Clench my fists tight holdin the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations and jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up cmon
I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late  uh oh uh oh uh oh 
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to get  duhough duhough duhough 
Im up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites  po po po po po po 
Now the money comin slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than  nooh nooh nooh 
I I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
I no I cant let it ride
No no not tonight
See I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
Yeah I break bread with thieves and pastors OGs and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You aint killin it yo thats manslaughter
Though paper cant change a mans aura
It can feed a mans daughter
I stand for the blue collar on the side makin a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like
I I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
I no I cant let it ride
No no not tonight
See I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
I I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
I no I cant let it ride
No no not tonight
See I cant run away or put my gun away
You cant front on me
