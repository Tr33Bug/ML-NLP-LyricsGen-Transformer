Yeah doodoodoo
Doodooddoo diggydoo yo
I never knew a luhluhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close to the Most High
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Lets stick to understandin and we wont fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin
Friends well stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love aint simple
Why cant it be anythin worth havin you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It dont take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when its time to
Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you
Diggada diggada diggada diggadiggadada
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you peace
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Ill take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by oh darling
You need to look at the other side
Youll agree
