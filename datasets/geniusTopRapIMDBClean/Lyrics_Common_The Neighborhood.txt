Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didnt know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice headed back to the light
But be careful dont drown in the gold
I know it glows but its cold
Im from the other side of town out of bounds
To anybody who dont live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones
And Four CHs Vice Lords Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix street organizations
They gave violations hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases bad broads good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin that the feds dont get us
The era of Reagan the terror of Bush
Crack babies mamas apush we were the products of Bush
Im wishin for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to BBD Do Meyou heard of Flukey
Stokes It was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation diamonds blinding us
Some real shit we facing
Forties wasting on seats Dion making the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escaping the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed
You know what they dont see sometimesthat in the neighborhood its the exact same thing Its the same thing over and over again Feel me
Ohoh oohooh ooh


Have you ever heard of No Limit  Onethree  300 600  300 
Follyboy OBlock  Huh  Eastside  Yeah 
Where it aint no conversation they just let them heats ride  Them heats ride 
Aint nobody stop the violence why my city keep lying  They keep lying 
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying  They keep dying 
Used to post up on that strip I looked like a street sign  Im out here 
Ive been out there three days and I got shot at three times  Damn 
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind  Thats fucked up 
I know haters wanna clap me up watch the morgue wrap me up  What 
But they can catch me later I been cooling chasing paper  Bands 
Where I come from aint no hope if you was claimed then that was major  Major 
Small crib big fam Mom was working Granny raised us  Raised us 
No food in the frigerator I was banging pulling capersthats real shit  Real shit 
Same niggas from Day One boy yeah Im still with  Im still with 
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit  Swish 
Homie take your shorty lunchbox and wont feel shit
I came from a place where its basic but you dont make it  Nah 
Feds building cases judges who racist and full of hatred
I mean you aint never seen the shit that I seen  Huh
