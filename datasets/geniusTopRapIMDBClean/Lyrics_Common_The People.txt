Louder louder louder louder louder louder
Louder louder yeah
Louder louder louder louder louder louder
Louder louder yeah
Yeah its for the people
This is street radio for unsung hero
Riding in they regal trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo I found the new Preemo
Ye you know how we do we do it for the people
And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes the rougher I wrote times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end tryna ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce its all our culture
Everyday we hustlin tryna get them custom rims
Law we aint trusting them thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it I look on the bus at them
When I see em struggling I think how Im touching them
The people
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then youll find
This is street radio for unsung hero
Riding in they regal trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo I found the new Preemo
Ye you know how we do we do it for the people
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammys though they tried to IndiaArie me
Got back stage and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what the people gon see me
Cant leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe until I believe me
Now Im on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize music affected lives
A gift from the skies to be recognized
Im keeping my eyes on the people thats the prize
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then youll find
This is street radio for unsung hero
Riding in they regal trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo I found the new Preemo
Ye you know how we do we do it for the people
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the peoples sake
The People
The days have come
Now we are one
Just take your time
And then youll find
