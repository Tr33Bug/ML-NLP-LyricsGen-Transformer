I got a bonus for the bitch that wanna bone us

Uhh no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you dont eat
Gotta hold heat just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it aint aight wit me
Right gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what Im talking bout
Yup stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dicks out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down South
All the way to London to my nigga Common house right
Its like a game we never play out out out out
Nigga no doubt nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch Im on some grown shit
Its the Thelonious super microphonist
You know us this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it cause you can feel it in your throat say it
Im bout to let my mind float
Com say it 
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game I assemble dope
Ness a nigga thats fresh as the fess
Studied this rap shit no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I feel it in her breasts
Plus you rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I dont know nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin to God like Mae did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah yall you can feel it in your body


Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You dont want it need to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy niggas tryin to clone us
You know us Thelonious super microphone
You know this rap shit we bout to own it dun for real
Ay its like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace nevertheless I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
Thats what you ask for you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you dont wanna die
So pay attention to my word cause its the truth
Meditation ease the mind and brings the youth
Its like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art never go astray
Word is bond
Yo we do it and we dont quit
Sucka nigga you dont want it its Thelonious
Owning this rap shit super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
Im raw duke more juice than Sunkist
You want this see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime Off The Wall with mines
Im grabbing my balls when I rhyme ninenines busting plus
Ball all the time now stay on your mind like great sex
You aint on my mind Im thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket
Connant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they dont rhyme and ball they lyin to yall
They dyin to ball the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and yall short
My niggas bounce and full rise and yalls fall
You funny duke cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 thats really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
Im from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
Thats how they play dont let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a payback
