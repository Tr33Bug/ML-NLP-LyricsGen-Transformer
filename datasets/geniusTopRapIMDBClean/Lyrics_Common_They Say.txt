They say Whats happenin
We say the facts and if they lie
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
Im the black pill in the Matrix the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick Tell Cara get us a show
Little Com I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the nigga with dough
They say You ripped wow yeah thats what they say
My niggas couldnt tell it was me like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day wit focused crime broads and good wine
They say Dope is sour so its homework and hood crimes
I stood mine for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say tell em J
They say Whats happenin
We say the facts and if they lie
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know oh
Ah the sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask him How do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacay where it aint no channels
But its quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again


They say Whats happenin
We say the facts and if they lie  Uh ha 
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know oh
They say Dude think he righteous
I write just to free minds from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper whether its weed or Isis
They say life is a game so I play hard
Writin for my life cause Im scared of a day job
They say Sef kept the hood together
I tell the young We cant play the hood forever
Play my cards right they say I went too left
They showed me strange love like I was Mr F
Played chess in this game of pawns and knights
Now I claim King like Don or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed and resurrected twice
They say The crochet pants and the sweater was wack
Seen the corner now they say That niggas back uh
They say Whats happenin
We say the facts and if they lie
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know oh
