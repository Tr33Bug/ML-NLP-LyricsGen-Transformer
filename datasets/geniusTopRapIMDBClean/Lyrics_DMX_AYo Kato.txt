Started off two dogs with the same goal  Uh 
Nothing but two dogs walkin the same road  Uh 
Two different cultures but had the same heart  Yeah 
Enjoyed seeing the light but lived in the dark
Fifth album bumped heads in the parking lot  Aight 
Was a quiet brother didnt like to bark a lot
Came direct  Uh  when he came gained respect
So I gave respect  Uh  we shared the same respect
To name regret in our own circles  What 
Two brothers with good hearts but if you start
Two brothers thatll hurt you  Yeah
