What good is it for a man to gain the world
Yet lose his own soul in the process
God loves you yes he does said youre alright with him
I wonder
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
Im callin out to you Lord because I need your help
See once again Im havin difficulty savin myself
Behavin myself you told me what to do and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin friends day by day
Im in so much pain when Im here Lord please take me away
I put you here to do a job and your work aint done
To live is to suffer but youre still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there wont be a his or hers just ours
Then youll see what Ive been tryin to show you all these years
Do the right thing cause after the tears come the cheers
I will my Lord with my heart and my soul
Thats gonna be how I roll from now until I mold
Lead and Ill follow you take away the sorrow
Ima sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
I want you to know Lord that for what you given me Im thankful
Sincerely from the bottom of my heart Im grateful
You gave us power in our words so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak they know Im here to teach
Cant tell em nothin wrong cause I love em too much
I reach a lot of people and Lord Im lovin the touch
But deep inside Ive got somethin thats workin against
Everything I know is right what I know makes sense
Thats when you must fight harder than youve ever fought before
Cause what youve got goin on inside you is a war
Between good and evil be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
Cause when the time comes that onell let you die
Listen to me Im here but I can only help you
If you want me to help what do you want for yourself
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Youre alright with him
I said youre alright with him
My Lord my savior dont judge my behavior but instead
Take whats in my heart and put it in my head
See I guess I really never knew how proud I made you
My life is yours my soul I gave you
I dont know if Ill do good enough  Hes by your side 
And we both know the hood is rough  Right by your side 
Sometimes I dont know what to do  X dry your eyes 
But I know what I gotta do  Itll be alright 
You keep givin me the word and Ill put it to song
Talk to me Ill talk to them and we cant go wrong
This is the start of somethin strong and this is just the start of it
Praises to you my Lord for lettin me be a part of it
I was that kid that been there did that
Became ashamed so I hid that but aint no longer with that
Use me as an exampleif I can do it then they can too
With the Lord behind us there aint nothin that we cant do
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him  The light with him 
Youre alright with him  Cause he loves you 
I said youre alright with him
I know youve never seen him
But dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh youre alright with him  Cause he loves you 
I said youre alright with him
Hes by your side
Right by your side
X dry your eyes
Cause itll be alright
Yeah hes by your side
Right by your side
X dry your eyes
Cause its gonna be alright
Yeah yeah yes it is
