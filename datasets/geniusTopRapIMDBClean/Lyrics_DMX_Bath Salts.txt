Haute is the livin CocaColas the sponsor  Woo 
I run up with your boo uh Hov is a monster  Oh 
Yeah uh they like me like that
Every girl I see wanna be wifey like that
Im the King of Zamunda uh King of the Summer  Woo 
Come be my Kardashian queen of the come up
Uh to be loved Shakespearean
Experience to be us
Jumpin off boats hoppin off another cliff  Woo 
Every six months I think I need a new bucket list  Oh 
Yeah I think I might need a harem  Say say 
Im way too much yall should share em  Hands in the air 
Im feeling like a baron all I need is a castle
Be my Halle Berry all you need is a catsuit
All I need is Heaven I dont want the hassle
God bless the child that can hold his own achoo  Queens stand up 
My instincts guide me through this Kurtis Blow culture  Woo 
Good angel bad angel sittin on both shoulders  Uh 
One be trying to gas me manipulate me tempt me  Ow 
Make me have no soul so I like to take a tally
All the favor of the days when the paper wasnt major
But love was abundant
Before the God got the Gods Son upon the stomach
Let these niggas know it was a feeling I would get
From music that they would come with  Talk to em Nas 
Hate start with H cause the H come after a G  Right 
They wont say it face to face they say it after I leave
After the first night at my place she asked for the keys
Its my season Garden of Eden we Adam and Eve
Now were naked in savage hedonism from a lack of belief
I aint a pastor pass the Lafite
We aint in no relationship but do relationship things
No ring but she slide through when I ring  Hands in the air 
Ha lets put success to the side
Id still be this fly if I worked at Popeyes
Thats a whole lotta spinach whole game full of gimmicks
Make a fool out of yourself for a post on Akademiks
We are not the same I am a alien
Hovering over your city shutting down all the stadiums
Wiping out everything in my radius
Dont play with us yall aint made enough
Shit pop off we dont blow it up til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up yall niggas know whats up
My niggas throw it up we all know that
Got niggas missing in action where are they at
See you niggas never really been duffed out
But youve got enough mouth to get snuffed out
Duke the rough route
We dont play around here nigga we grown
Start applying the pressure give a dog a bone
Im taking half its just that simple
Or I can start poppin niggas like pimples
Ima let you call it you ballin
Til you get hit with them hot things now you staggerin and fallin
Holding up the wall you got more than enough holes in you to fall
Youre just wasting a nigga time come on man
I got shit to do like hit your crew
Might hit your crib what that bitch gon do
Not a damn thing but go with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conanbonan
Ima go where no man has ever gone nigga
When its on its on Ill let you know in a fuckin song
I got nothing to hide but you got a reason to run
Come through like  gunshots  til the squeezin is done
And thats just squeezing one imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into death row  Woo
