Hey yo D Its your nigga D
What the fuck you forgot about me
Youve been eatin real good lately
Didnt get a shout out on your last album what you hate me
Said I was your dog
Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Said I was your mans and them
And any problem that you had I would handle them
Ayo dog its like this I fuck with you lightly
Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep youd bite me
Get mad at me send niggas wantin to fight me
Whole time you fucked with me you didnt like me
Dog where you hear that Pssh niggas talk
Plus you know how shit flow in New York
Walls have ears buildings heard
Supposed to be shhhhhh but spill the word
Everywhere that I go everything that I see
Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin with me
Im gonna fly
Why you lie
Told me it was Ryde or Die
Im gonna fly
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie
Now dog you know me better than that
I could put you ahead of the pack instead of the back
I could have niggas sellin tapes instead of the crack
Could have niggas fallin down with lead in they back
Aint much that I cant do when I want to
I dont really need you nigga fuck you

Nah Im just playin got a wife and kids
Good thing they aint come across them triflin kids
Yo what you mean by that Mean by what
Youse a grimy nigga freal I see whats up
I dont even know why I fucked with you from the door
Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I couldve got it from Him But you wouldve had to wait
But I wouldnt have the weight Cmon dont hate
What happened to the right hand Light Man
Nah thats Dark Man Well lets get it right then
Everywhere that I go everything that I see
Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin with me
Im gonna fly
Why you lie
Told me it was Ryde or Die
Im gonna fly
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie
Now I see you for who you are its like I know you
So I cant trust you as far as I can throw you
Oh you dont know you are the reason
That I go through what I go through Let me show you
Didnt I promise you a Benz lots of friends
Countless pairs of Timbs endless ends
Yeah but what did it cost me
My life to be taken softly man back the fuck up off me
Dont fuck with me like that when I fuck with you like this
Dont come at me like that when you know that you might miss
Go on about your business
If any cat you send my way aint gon be no witness
Lord Jesus Cmon dog look who youre fuckin
Please help me Whassup dog Man you buggin
Keep the Devil Thug life thought we was tight
Out of my life  Ill be back aight Psych
Everywhere that I go everything that I see
Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin with me
Im gonna fly

Told me it was Ryde or Die
Im gonna fly
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie
