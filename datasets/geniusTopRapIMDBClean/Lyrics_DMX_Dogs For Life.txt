But now we here at the same place at the same time
And got jokes cause now niggas get it with the same rhyme
Yeah niggas is living comfortable cause life is all good
But one thing we must remember is that life is all hood
And the caskets all wood and we all take there one day shit 
Shit today is Sunday we both can be there on Monday
Life is funny like that  WHAT  bugged the fuck out
Sometimes I take it to the church Sometimes I thug the fuck out
Niggas get drugged the fuck out they boots violatin families rules
Motherfucker stay in your shoes

Ride till we die on till its up
Thick like blood wheres my dogs
Uh theres my dogs

Only niggas I fuck wit is thugs nigga what
Blood in Blood out vatos locos homes theres no chocos homes
When we smoke them chromes and how we broke them bones
While the last niggas is ass niggas
