Once again its the darker nigga
Here to spark a nigga pick apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger under stress
So unless you wanna get blessed to the chest
With slugs from the Smith  Wess rest
Or the pumpll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty cause I play dirty the mob way
You dont know fuck it find out the hard way
A niggas job is never done I handle my business how it come
And theres never been a one on one
There hasnt been a problem I dissolve em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught
And its my fault keep niggas on point duckin down
Niggas like you need to get bust you fuckin clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort never get caught cause I creeps nigga

Im at the crossroads look but Im not really sure which way to go
Should I play the low for what I did the other day
They on their way the flow got me strikin this random
I cant stand em fakeass niggas wantin to be the Phantom
Lookin over my shoulder cause its colder than it was
Extort shorty because Im a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw with the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But Im gon die by it cause Im like kneedeep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to Hell and back I aint with sellin crack
Id rather rob a nigga leave him with a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitchass nigga
Get it on the floor get itget it on the floor  What 
Get it on the floor get itget it on the floor  What 
You dont wanna party then your ass gotta go  What 
You dont wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker bounce to this motherfucker

When I crawl leave a nigga sprawled out after I smoke em
Ill slit his throat dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My MO is manslaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun Im aight
Stay outta sight while its light and then come out at night
To make moves again stomp and bruise again
I know Im goin to Hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin life Ive been the Devils advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
Youll know why Ill split your motherfuckin brains for
Get it on the floor get itget it on the floor  What 
Get it on the floor get itget it on the floor  What 
You dont wanna party then your ass gotta go  What
