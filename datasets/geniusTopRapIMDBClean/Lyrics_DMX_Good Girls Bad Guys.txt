Why do good girls  what what what  like bad guys
Hey yo Boo why do  good girls  like bad guys
Knowin that bad guys tell mad lies
And why do  dog niggas  want a honey wit class 
Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass 
Uh uh
Hey yo who would ever think that the two would go good
Midtown honey nigga from the hood
But knock on wood I got this bitch  what  excuse me
She dont like to be called a bitch try not to lose me
The rules we go by where Im from she dont know
When I say Im goin around the way she wont go
Hell no  Cmon baby you aight with me
Tryin to get you to spend the whole night with me
But Im a good girl  Uhh thats why I like her
Couldnt treat her like a hoodrat didnt bite her
Turn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder
Take her to the Ramada make it an all nighter
Oh no I only go to the Swiss hotel 
Fuckin with me I have you in the back of the Chevelle
Like what  what  hittin it raw dogg in the butt
You was good this mornin but tonight you a slut
Chorus DMX  Dyme 
Why do  good girls  like bad guys
Knowin that bad guys tell mad lies
And why do  dog niggas  want a honey wit class 
Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass 
Hey yo Boo why do  good girls  like bad guys
Knowin that bad guys tell mad lies
Then why do  dog niggas  want a honey wit class 
Sometimes you want more than just a honey wit ass 
Hey yo Boo Im diggin you cause you make me wanna do

Cause you be actin like

But I will keep you wit a smile and walkin funny
So whats it gon be  Yo what you mean  What to do
You want the nigga wit the slacks or the jeans and the boots
You wanna be safe or be laced cause you can be replaced 
Yeah you can be erased
Dont get slapped babyface 
Chorus
Man I got shorty stayin out late  Well I keep him wit a cut
And his nails stay clean  At least I get a nut
And I got honey rebellin  And I stopped him from sellin 
I be gettin away with murder right  shit I aint tellin 
Straight out the hood  yeah nigga you get mushy 
I got honey suckin dick  and I got you eatin pussy 
I can be good in a bad way  I can be bad in a good way 
Girl you aint the same dog  thats what them rats in the hood say
Or would say if you was around them more often 
I got honey smokin weed  it be havin me coughin 
She keep the dog on the leash  when we walk in the streets 
And if yall think its sweet  then the dogs off the leash
Now I dont want no drama wit no babys mama
I might be a good girl but I keeps the armor 
Girl you off the hook but at least now I know why
Good girls like bad guys
Chorus
