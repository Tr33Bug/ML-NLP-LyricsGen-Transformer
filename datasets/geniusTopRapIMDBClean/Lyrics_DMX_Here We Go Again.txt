I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand  Uh 
Hit him with work cause yo thats my little man  Uhhuh 
He asked a few questions bout the game and I told him  Yeah 
So when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him  Aight 
Never told him nothin wrong kept it fair
Didnt listen so I might as well have been talkin to the air  Damn 
Everybody makes mistakes a mistake is aight
But if it aint Ima tell you straight time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played regardless of the relationship
But shortys fuckin up big time I hate this shit Im caught in the middle of havin love for a lil nigga
And knowin whats expected of me as a real nigga  Damn 
My next move is crucial what do I do

Under normal circumstances he would be a marked man

Youre on your own little man dont ask me for shit  No 
If you paid attention to what I taught you then you good  Uh 
If I see you again get it understood
Go head before I change my mind cause you know you should be dead
