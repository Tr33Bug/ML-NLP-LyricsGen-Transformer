Sometimes
Sometimes you just know
You just know thats all
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on hold on
The best of yall niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile theres somethin I gotta show you and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up youll see that Im just showin love to you
Other niggasll put a slug through you over your ends
Cats I fuck with are real but hey those are your friends
Its just what you got comin sometimes you dont know
What you askin for yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door this one here good as done
You thought you was a killer you swore youd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin in the air Yeah its gettin closer
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on hold on
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that and hit em with the blazin tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
It takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The Devil got a hold on me and he wont let go
I can feel the Lord pullin but he movin dead slow
Let em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin but we all do the losin
Its just who does the choosin is you goin up or down
What have you been provin Just that you a fuckin clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
Cause I know that deep down you really dont want it
I was traded the chance of bein a child with a father
For a talent and bein able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life keep my dreams in strife
Thats why I hit these motherfuckin streets at night come on
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on hold on
Theres a lot of shit that I let slide cause its outta my hands
Lot of niggas I let ride but its not in my plans
That a lot of my mans is not seein through the fog
Families by the truckloads fleein to the morgue
Full moon  Ahooh  the howlin
Grr  the growlin  Shh  the prowlin
Dont know love cant show love
That means you gonna need mo love than an old thug
But hold up roll up talkin out the side of your mouth
Is whats gonna let niggas know why you died in your house
While they lied to your spouse told her it was suicide
But you and I both know the truthll never die
Listen nigga if you scared get a dog but be prepared for the morgue
Cause you dead up in the fog and thats your head by the log
I can smell it in the air I can tell when its there
This is hell and were both here can you feel it Tell me yeah
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
Ive been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on hold on
