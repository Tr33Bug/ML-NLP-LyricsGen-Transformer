I know that my savior lives
And at the end He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body I will see God
Yes I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment
Grandma I really miss you and it aint been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway why you gotta be so far away
Used to say Dont worry its gon be okay
But it aint  its like when you left you took the Lord with you
Why couldnt I come when He came to get you
Damn I really miss you I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbors yard yeah bein hard headed
You told me I would get it  you said it
And boy did I get it but after you spanked me you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be
I know now thats why its only done out of love
What I wouldnt give for one mo hug from grandma
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
What Im about to say a couple of family members is gon hate me
But Ima let you know whats been goin on lately
Now you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed
Yeah Jackies still crazy dont know whats up with James
Aint seen Jerry in a while you know he walk like you
And Renes back in jail you know she talk like you
Riculahs   doing real good now she workin
Rhondas still runnin around trickin jerkin
Buckeyes buggin he done lost his mind
And Jarvis Back out of jail doin fine
Kylie He done changed it aint all about self
As for my father well thats somethin else
But thats my dog he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother makin a lot of trips out of town
But thats a good thing and if I could only hear you sing
Once more oh Lord the comfort it would bring
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
You left behind a mother eleven kids eleven grandkids
And since then two of your grandkids done had kids
I got a boy named Tacoma Xaviers brother
Thats right Xaviers made you a greatgrandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin and lovin my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners they were vital
I thank you for my life I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that youd sing in the mornin
Amazing Grace  while Im yawnin
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again  Amen
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Baby its gon be okay  She used to tell me that 
Baby its gon be okay  I really miss hearin 
Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now Im found
Was blind but now I see yeah
