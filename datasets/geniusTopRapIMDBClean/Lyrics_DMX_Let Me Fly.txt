If you love somethin let it go
If it comes back to you its yours
If it doesnt it never was
Hold me down baby
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Hold me down niggas wanna know me now
Didnt want to play with me when to show me how
No meow cause its all about the bark
Let the dog loose baby its about to spark
Light up the night like the 4th of July
Niggas know when I let go niggas die
With this Y and you dont know you slow
Like Baltimore if you aint tryin to go you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go its violence cause the wildest
Is the dog barkin up the tree for the cat
In the fog what yall niggas see is the bat
Flappin away but Im blind like Stevie
Niggas dont hear me still tryin to see me
Stop bein greedy you heard what I said
Let me go let me flow or Im dead
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day


I sold my soul to the Devil and the price was cheap
And yo its cold on his level cause its twice as deep
But you dont hear me ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes its better to be thought dumb  shall I go on
Yo on the real what the deal Its a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you dont see it then it wasnt meant for you to see
If you wasnt born with it it wasnt meant for you to be
But you cant blame me for not wantin to be held
Locked down in a cell where the soul cant dwell
This is hell come meet the Devil and give me the key
But it cant be worse than the curse that was given to me
Its what I live for you take away that and Im gone
Theres a difference between doin wrong and bein wrong
And that aint right just keep it fair baby
Put me in the air and Ill take it there baby yes
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Ima flow regardless because Im an artist until Im trapped
Ima continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me dap but you aint my friend
I see it in your eyes you contemplate my end
You waitin for that bend in the road where you were told
That you would go when you were old and if you died young it was cold
Sold not for nearly what it was worth
Think back 26 years be like What if his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given somethin that if taken away youd have missed it
Didnt know yet I persisted it was the call of the wild
I merely say whats in my heart and you call it a style
Dont put it in a cage dont mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge Here it is eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked with this rap shit
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest take my breath
If I dont fly Ima die anyway
Ima live on but Ill be gone any day
Or give me death
Or take my breath
Ima die anyway
But Ill be gone any day
Or give me death
Or take my breath
Ima die anyway
But Ill be gone any day
Where my niggas
Uh ah for my niggas
Uh ah for my niggas
Uh ah for my niggas
