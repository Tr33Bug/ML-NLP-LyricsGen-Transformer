TranslationsTrkeLetter to My Son  Call Your Father  Lyrics
Huh rrr  Woo 
Ooh rrr
This is one of those
You already know what it is
Rrr
Dear son I look in your eyes I see my own
You look in my eyes you see my throne
As many times I tried to talk to you explain to you
See it didnt mean a thing to you
Love you but right now I wanna bite you
I wanna give you a hug but I might bite you
Be a man about it we can admit when were wrong
Come on get off that kid shit you on
If youd have paid attention youd have saw it coming
But you a man lookin through the eyes of a woman
Always gon love your mama  Always  we just drifted apart
And my kids yall my heart
And you got more brothers and sisters
Because I got more kids and hey its just what it is
You the oldst I known you longer but I dont love them lss
Had to get that off my chest
And I dont know what you thought about my use of drugs
But it taught you enough to not use them drugs
When you were a kid you play with toys okay
But you a man put them toys away
What Im saying is stop thinkin like a child
Cause what if its when Im gone  Damn 
That you gotta realize youre wrong  Damn 
And we couldve been best of friends all along
But it would kinda defeat the purpose of the song

Give me a call I love you boy  Thats the truth call me 
Yeah ay I let you down
Shouldve been there but I let you down
Not too late not too late
I cant give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late it aint too late
Call your father
Call your father
Dear father shouldve been there when I needed you
Shouldve been there when the devil had a hold of your soul
Hold of your soul hey hey 
Ayy I let you down
Shouldve been there but I let you down
Not too late not too late  Not too late 
I cant give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late it aint too late
Call your father
Call your father
