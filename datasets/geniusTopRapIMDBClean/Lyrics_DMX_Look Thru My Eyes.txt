Aint right I seen your eyes all fucked up
Judge not less you be judged first
My nigga my nigga
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Burnin in hell but dont deserve to be
Got niggas I dont even know that wanna murder me
Just because theyve heard of me and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real when you see that spark itll kill
Peep how I park it and chill take it over there walk wit it
From YO to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit it
Come through flyin up 129
Up the School Street cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs Get at me nigga
Get at me nigga
What the deal is Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Cant help but feel this puttin goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Its the calm before the storm
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and its gettin warm feel me yo
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street  Yes 
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street


I can understand why yall niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
Cause I leave blood wherever I go wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark about to bark 
Take it to the heart cause its real like that
Give him chills but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real what you dont know is gon get ya
With the steel what you dont know is gon split ya
I can blaze tracks make niggas play racks and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch didnt you used to say that
Play around in dirt youll get mud
Cause you know I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof make it a quickie for real
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street  Yes 
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
I bear my soul niggas wouldnt dare my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth then told its not an eighth
But then its out of state and its too late for changes to be made
Thats what I get for fuckin with strangers in the shade
This is it yall niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate now Im supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldnt give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelins put aside cause now I gotta reach him
What Id like to do is turn my head like I dont know him
But it seems like Ive been called on to show him so Ima show him
And if you never met me then youve no right to judge me
Ive got a good heart but this heart can get ugly yes
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street  Yes 
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Feel the pain feel the joy of a man who was never a boy
For real
