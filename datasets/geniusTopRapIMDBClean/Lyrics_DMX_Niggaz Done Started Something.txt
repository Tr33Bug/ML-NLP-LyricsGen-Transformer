Yo ayo lets get papers and pop Mo with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums overlooking our drug capers
New York City know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff Ls and look jiggy
Who wan test this My semi leave you chestless
And aint shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young but I done did shit that you wont do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggas who pump on yo block and in your spot
Who sit next to you Protectin you
But theyll murder you playa
Don status nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis fronting fronting in eclipsesis
Ayo Mae and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot get found in vacant lot
You dont really wanna come try the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
Its not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays spray strays wit niggas names on it
Often I bug then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood fill his coffin with slugs
Yo you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason have a explanation
You bring your crew and em and Im doing em
Then Im beating em down with aluminum
Then Im putting two in em
You cant touch me Ive been devil sent wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things but thats irrelevant
If you love the money then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
If you love the money then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
Yo check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha be in the Costa
Rica sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks we kill em
Yeah I hear niggas but I still dont feel em
And this for the listeners and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16s be so real
You can feel em in your vein
Like Ramellos pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom youll see beg niggas pardon
Whatever we can do it at the Garden
Word life this shit is real B
Im making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty
I want a palace for my thugs with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me still couldnt shatter me
Im only getting up splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think youre smartest and retaliate the hardest
Regardless if youre a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey I be Gretzky puffing Nestle
And yall niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God then Ima make salat til you rot
And if you a playa then play for everything you got
And if you a thug then start busting off shots
And if you a dog you better bite before you bark
If you love the money then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
Dont come at me with no bullshit use caution
Cause when I wet shit I dead shit like abortions
For bigger portions of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing fuck whatchu heard this what you hearing
How much darker must it get how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy but not up in my face so give me 3 feet
Cause when we creep no more than 3 deep niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible so you know
John Doe is what they gon be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon tell your mother her babys under a cover
In the morgue stiff as a log sniffed out by the dogs
Another hardheaded nigga that wouldnt listen
So you got what you came for
Whats that  Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
Cause like I said before aint nothing going down until I eat
Muhfuckers think its all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well Im testing bitches game undressing bitches and caressing bitches
And dealing with muhfuckers on all levels what Im dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
Cause what they got is all of mine your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I dont know you I dont fuck witchu
And if you with my man then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime black Gotti I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitchass niggas that act snotty
Get it
These niggas is for real
These niggas aint playing
This aint no fucking game
She think we playing
Ruff Ryders
Grr
