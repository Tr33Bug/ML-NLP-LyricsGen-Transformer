Its dark and hell is hot
Aint no sunshine when its on
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when its on cause when its on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time cause we dont play
Who turned out the lights is what niggas be sayin
Now you dont wanna fight but yall niggas be playin
Thinkin its alright keep playin with that role
And you gonna know the night when you layin in that hole
Dirt gettin tossed in yo grave now its all over
Preacher said You was brave but now its all over
You just one of the many plenty I done gave it to
Aint no savin you
No matter how many tears your moms cried
Aint gon bring yo ass back plus in hell you gon fry
Why But now the only two relative questions
Is Do we bury him or burn Any suggestions
Either way you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention your name they knockin on wood  Aight 
Did I get my point across
Another body on the shottie another joint I toss
Aint no sunshine when its on
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when its on cause when its on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
It aint no sunshine when the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9s so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine cause Id like to hear some shouts
Get at me dog niggas know how its goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow I gets busy
Who is he Dark Man of the unknown
Grrr argh  One dog one bone
Now who aint goin home Looks like you
You hear strike one talkin shit strike two
Wont be a strike three cause I dont play fair
Ima look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like Yeah holdin you up cause you fallin  What 
The Lord aint comin so nigga stop callin
You was ballin a minute ago in it for dough
Til it was Yo I swear to God I didnt know
Aint no sunshine when its on
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when its on cause when its on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
And I know I know I know I know I know
What you think you gon get fuck around with my dough
Just so it aint no mistakes this is my show
One  one  two  two  three here I go
Your shit is quick and your shit is slick but this shit is thick
And you hear this shit Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But youll be blind Ill do it 360 and come up from behind
Tap you on your shoulder have you turnin around
Hit you with somethin thatll have you burnin the ground
Be like Damn aint nothin left of money but a pile of ash
Life is good so please enjoy it while it lasts
Cause you know aint got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends on the stronger the flow
Well niggas know I dont give a fuck right or wrong
There aint no sunshine when its on
Aint no sunshine when its on
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when its on cause when its on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
Every time cause we dont play
