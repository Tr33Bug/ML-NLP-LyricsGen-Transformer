Thats how its goin in the slums over crumbs  What 
Somethin little becomes somethin major  Uhhuh 
Niggas gettin blown up like a pager
Ear to ear with the razor  What 
Pour out my soul took control of hurt
Why must Earl Simmons swim in dirt
Im gon make it work twentyeight and tryna get baptized
Priest scared to touch me cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ride when I die straight down but Im plottin
We all gots to go but who wants to be forgotten
Ima leave a mark and it wont be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin me from thrivin
Fuck what them niggas is talkin about Im survivin
Alive and goin through it but I made my bed
So now its in these flames that I lay my head
