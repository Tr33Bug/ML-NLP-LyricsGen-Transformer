Im up at like 6 AM to check this nigga  Uhhuh 
He work the nightshift and I gots to check them figures  Aight 
Knock on his door peoples talkin bout he aint there
But the house is packed shit I know he here somewhere
See money get high I dont knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin by dont fuck with you gettin mine
Aint the first time he ran off shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what hes did and if I catch him slippin
Wont be an asswhippin I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat he go and sell two packs
And run off  Damn  tell me he was locked down up North
And you out a week later Thats bullshit I bust off

I need this wealth because I feed myself
You play with my life when you play with my money
Played around but thisll be the last time you think somethings funny

Yo Ive been casin the liquor store for a month now
But me and two other niggas
Is about to run up in there and shut it down
They got four people on the inside one stay in the back
Two stock boys one at the register but he count the stacks
Aight bitch put on the ski mask
Make sure that when we ask
For the dough they know that we takin all three bags
Now see that We got a hero shoot that nigga
Matter of fact you hit the back Ill put two in that nigga
Hardhead motherfuckers always get it
I told him what would happen if he moved
The nigga moved so I did it  Aight 
Did you get it I asked my man as he was comin from the back
Nigga opened his mouth said nothin and fell out flat
This cat come out spittin hittin my mans his mans
Couldnt control what was in his hands
Im hit damn I bust back and got the fuck up outta there
Didnt get a dime but at least I got up outta there
One more road to cross

Ayo I see it try to avoid it but it comes
Thats how its goin in the slums over crumbs  What 
Somethin little becomes somethin major  Uhhuh 
Niggas gettin blown up like a pager
Ear to ear with the razor  What 
Pour out my soul took control of hurt
Why must Earl Simmons swim in dirt
Im gon make it work twentyeight and tryna get baptized
Priest scared to touch me cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ride when I die straight down but Im plottin
We all gots to go but who wants to be forgotten
Ima leave a mark and it wont be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin me from thrivin
Fuck what them niggas is talkin about Im survivin
Alive and goin through it but I made my bed
So now its in these flames that I lay my head
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like theres one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like theres one more move to make
