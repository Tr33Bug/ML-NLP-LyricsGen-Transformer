Party Up  Up In Here  Lyrics
Yall gon make me lose my mind
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me go all out
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me act a fool
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me lose my cool
Up in here up in here
If I gots to bring it to you cowards then its gonna be quick  Aight 
All your mans that been to jail before suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with get done with dumb quick
How the fuck you gon cross the dog on some bum shit  Aight 
There go the gun click 911 shit
All over some dumb shit aint that some shit
Yall niggas remind me of a strip club
Cause every time you come around its like what
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I dont know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But Im not him aight Slim So watch what you do
Or you gon find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldnt have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
Thats why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin the truth and it hurts
Yall gon make me lose my mind
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me go all out
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me act a fool
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me lose my cool
Up in here up in here
Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
Cause niggas still want the fame off the name
First of all you aint rapped long enough
To be fucking with me and you you aint strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin on
That got you think that you Superman I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick or the mic
Yall niggas is characters not even good actors
Whats gon be the outcome  Hmm  lets add up all the factors
You wack you twisted your girls a ho
You broke the kid aint yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid you be like So
I love my baby mother Ill never let her go
Im tired of weakass niggas whining over puss
That dont belong to them fuck is wrong with them
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it all on the strength of the hands with them man
Yall gon make me lose my mind
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me go all out
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me act a fool
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me lose my cool
Up in here up in here
I bring down rain so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking less you tryna end up red
Cause if I end up fed yall end up dead
Cause yous a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog bloods thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order the more guns we brung out
Run up in there everybody come out dont nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out Ima keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth Ima blow his lung out
Listen your ass is about to be missin
You know who gon find you  Who  some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your souls at rest
But its hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Yall gon make me lose my mind
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me go all out
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me act a fool
Up in here up in here
Yall gon make me lose my cool
Up in here up in here
One two meet me outside
Meet me outside meet me outside
All my Ruff Ryders gon meet me outside
Meet me outside meet me outside
All my big ballers gon meet me outside
Meet me outside meet me outside
All my fly ladies gon meet me outside
Meet me outside meet me outside
All my streetstreet people meet me outside
Meet me outside outside motherfucker
