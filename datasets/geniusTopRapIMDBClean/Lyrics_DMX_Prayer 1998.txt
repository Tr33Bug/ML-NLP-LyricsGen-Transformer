Prayer  1998  Lyrics
I come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I aint perfect but youd like me to try
Unlike the Devil who just wants me to lie til I die
Lord why is it that I go through so much pain
All I saw was black all I felt was rain
I come to you because its you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you asked for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hid
And I remember once you held me close but I slid
There was somethin that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think Ive seen it cause I dont feel the same
Matter of fact I know Ive seen it I can feel the change
And its strange almost got me beatin down your door
But Ive never known love like this before
Its a wonderful feelin to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when Im here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tear its on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty Paso and Jays brother Dan
And I fear that what Im sayin wont be heard until Im gone
But its all good cause I really didnt expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die but please Lord treat him right
