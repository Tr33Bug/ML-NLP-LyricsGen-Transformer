Let us pray
I thank you Lord for my birth and everything thats followed
I thank you Lord for today and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you Lord for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and Im lovin my wife til the end
I thank you Lord for your guidance cause its all that counts
And right here right now Lord this is your house
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I dont always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
Cause I need You here wit me without You in my life its empty
I think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now I pray for my enemy
Not because of what Ill do but because they dont know
Theres somethin better after here but everybody wont go
So I ask You to forgive them and well hope they see
And I thank You for the love that theyve given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love em like children that I see everyday
And I pray no we pray together
Get us through the bad weather and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start but I stand a man
And for as long as I can as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live bear with me
Amen
We each walk the path that weve chosen  Yes 
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Lord You left me stranded and I dont know why
Told me to live my life now Im ready to die
Ready to fly I cry but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears its been years
Snakes still comin at me just missin
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special thats what You told me
Hold me stop actin like You dont know me
What I do so bad that it sent You away from me
Not only sent You away but made You stay away from me
My child Im here as Ive always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say Follow Your word and be true
What did you do Well what I wanted to do
What have you seen Darkness and hell at a glance
What do you want All I want is another chance
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Just because you went away my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home All you gotta do is knock
You see I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and Im still not able to stand
I gave you a hand Well but I was lookin the wrong way
Figured out the plan then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here over there
Back to over here now it got me like where
Do I belong do I fit in
Things on my mind where do I begin
Its easier to sin but it hurts my heart
Im really tryna win so where do we start
Thou shalt not steal But what if he stole from me
Thou shalt not kill But what if hes tryin to kill me
Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains withstand the pain
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Im ready to meet him
Our Father who art in Heaven
Im not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw Im ridin with the Lord
Cause I really cant afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that Ive seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
What have you learned Its better to tell the truth than to lie
What have you learned To love my life until I die
What have you learned Violence isnt always the key
What have you learned You cant always believe what you see
What have you learned Its better to forgive and forget
What have you learned Give as you expect to get
What have you learned That I cant go on without You
What have you learned I mustve been a fool to ever doubt You
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Im ready to meet him
Cause where Im livin aint right black hate white
White hate black its right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Im ready to meet him
Im ready to meet him
Im ready to meet him
Im ready to meet him
Im ready to meet him
