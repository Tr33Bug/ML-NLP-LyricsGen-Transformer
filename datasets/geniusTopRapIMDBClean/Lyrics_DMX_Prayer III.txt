Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people and its all for the good
I influenced so many children I never thought that I would
And I couldnt take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you Lord Im just the one thats givin it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well but if youll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart will begin to show
And when I get goin Im not lookin back for nothin
Cause I will know where Im headed and Im so tired of the sufferin
I stand before you a weakened version of your reflection
Beggin for direction for my soul needs resurrection
I dont deserve what youve given me but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful and I use it and I do not worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only havin one life to do it instead of two
Amen
