Niggas wanna try niggas wanna lie

Fuckin with the wrong crew dont know what we goin through
Ima have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out theres some more niggas thats runnin with your niggas
Nothin we cant handle break it up and dismantle

Give a dog a bone leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and hell find his way home
Home of the brave my home is a cage
And yo Im a slave til my home is the grave
Ima pull capers its all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us
