Over and over I done told ya boy
Im a GUnit motherfucking soldier boy
And when you gon get it in your brain
The gates wide open and the dogs off the chain
I be that youngin with that gun thats tellin ya stop frontin
I be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin
In the Bible I read death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon come
Jay taught me how to flow they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there now he runnin scared
Some say Im gangsta some say Im crazy
If you ask me Ill say Im what the hood made me
Now I can stunt til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
See Im cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say Sak pase Nap boule and rob niggas
The media be tryin to make a nigga look bad whats with that
See my flick next to Preme Papi and Cat
And Montana I kill em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
X what up  Aight 
You dont live that you shouldnt say that
Cause what come out your mouthll get you shot down
Throwin your money around and we dont play that
Getting in our linell get you shot down
We know where you hang we know where you stay at
That bullshit you onll get you shot down
Heres a few cliques that you shouldnt play with
GUnit Ruff Rydersll get you shot down
Fuck yall niggas talkin bout think you playin with
Double R GUnit the same old shit
Put the faggots in the ring watch em all quit
All yall niggas is pussy suck my dick
Aint nothin but a handful of man still standin
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was Slammin
Now we meet again its all good my nigga
Back to the street again its all hood my nigga
Knock on wood my nigga we both walk the dog
We aint get to where we at by luck shit was hard
But once we got through the trials its all smiles
Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from
Imma make you remember where you know my name from
45th Street and blaowblaow Ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half nigga
You dont live that you shouldnt say that
Cause what come out your mouthll get you shot down
Throwin your money around and we dont play that
Getting in our linell get you shot down
We know where you hang we know where you stay at
That bullshit you onll get you shot down
Heres a few cliques that you shouldnt play with
GUnit Ruff Rydersll get you shot down
If your head aint off of your shoulders
You aint get shot you got nipped nigga  just nipped 
Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
Its gon do more than chip nigga  a lot more than that 
Yeah what the fuck is the problem
The Porsche is red the buckets is army
30 shot handguns the gutter is starvin
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Bloodstainsll fuck up your carpet brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I dont want the throne or the crown I aint sell enough
You can have the jail or the ground you aint in hell enough
Im the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man and let him know Pll love to cut his
And niggas is gettin shot down two guns up
Double R SP holdin D Block down
You dont live that you shouldnt say that
Cause what come out your mouthll get you shot down
Throwin your money around and we dont play that
Getting in our linell get you shot down
We know where you hang we know where you stay at
That bullshit you onll get you shot down
Heres a few cliques that you shouldnt play with
GUnit Ruff Rydersll get you shot down
