This life shit this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out son for real
See to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well thats to find meaning in the suffering
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ive been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If Im strong enough Ill live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there now Im in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that Ima
Be that seed that doesnt need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesnt bleed
Im ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Bagging niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Goin too fast it wouldnt last but yo I couldnt tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn was it my fault something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than Id ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
Thats my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast


Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
That aint the half shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didnt need a clique cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin shit for kicks
Catchin vics throwin bricks gettin by bein slick
Used to get high just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin a couple of forties made me hate somethin
I did some coke now Im ready to take somethin
Three years later showin signs of stress
Didnt keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
Im possessed by the darker side livin the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but Im fuckin it up
Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Wasnt long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin shit like Damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window no more indo
Look at a video sayin to myself That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV believe me it could be done
Somethins got to give gots to change cause now Ive got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin high drinkin 40s
So I get back lookin type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong kept a nigga from doin wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit youll get yours because its due
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I cant get up
Ayo Im slippin Im fallin I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
See this is that shit this is that shit
That all real niggas can relate to
This is from the heart baby
Dont get it twisted
X baby
