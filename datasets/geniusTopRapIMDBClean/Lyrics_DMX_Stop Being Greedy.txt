Uhhuh uhhuh

Uhhuh uhhuh
Uhhuh uhhuh
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
I could flip that flow I could stick that ho
I could get that dough you know Im with that yo
Aint a thing about the shit I came through I havent seen
But when it gets dark its like a niggas havin dreams
Or nightmares the light dares to desert me  What 
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  What 
Paranoid so I strike out at whatever  Uh 
The closest thing to me is gonna get it but never
Will I kill I think death is wrong
So Ima keep holdin on til whats left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin motherfuckas stay on the floor
Fourfour thats what I get sick with  Grr 
Four more now all this is liquid  Grr 
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
I thank the Lord everyday that Im blessed with a gift
Im the best so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Dont touch that uhuh leave it alone
When you walk past the doghouse leave it a bone
Dogs bite dogs fight dawgs knife
Scratch shake and hold all night
So when you hear the start runnin
Cause when you hear the Im comin
But I dont like drama so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
Im drunk so Ima bash his head wide open
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin
Didnt get his wish and now hes a dish for the pack
Two glowin red eyes everything else is black
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin me for their health
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside
Suns goin down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage gauge with the buck shots
Faggot youve been lucky all day thats when your luck stops
One drops then another and another
Gun pops goin through you and your mother
When does it all end I found a friend in a dog
Cause fuckin with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions no answers just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that Im blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Cant see straight cause Im so high
Why ask why when you know
Nigga when its your time to go you go
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
Yall been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy
Just keep it real partner give to the needy
Ribs is touchin so dont make me wait
Fuck around and Im gon bite you and snatch the plate
