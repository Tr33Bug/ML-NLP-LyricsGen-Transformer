You tell me that theres love here but to me its blatant
That with all the blood here Im dealin with Satan
Plus with all the hatin its hard to keep peace  Uh huh 
Thou shall not steal but I will to eat
I tried doin good but goods not too good for me
Misunderstood why you chose the hood for me
Me Im aight I just had to work hard at it
Went to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it
So now here I am confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose or is this just a lesson
And who is gon choose when it gets turned around
And will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground
My child Ive watched you grow up and Ive been there
Even at those times you least suspected it I was there
And look at what Ive given you a talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call but Im always on time
Somebodys knockin
Should I let em in
Lord were just startin
But where will it end
Somebodys knockin
Should I let em in
Lord were just startin
But where will it end
But when the funds are low the gunsll blow
Lookin for that one that owe make em run that dough
No Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
Youll get it all in due time
Youll do fine just have faith cause you mine
And when you shine its gon be a sight to behold
So dont fight to be old or lose sight when its cold
See that light down the road Its gon to guide you there
Two sets of footprints I was right beside you there
But what about them times I only saw one
Those were the times when I was under the gun
It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety it just wasnt your time to face me  uh huh 
Ayo a few of them times I thought you would erase me
When all you did was embrace me prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse
And the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith
No more runnin or slidin in the dirt cause Im safe
Somebodys knockin
Should I let em in
Lord were just startin
But where will it end
Somebodys knockin
Should I let em in
So if Im your man Im in your hands whats your plan
Never had a friend cause you couldnt trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled things were twisted
And if you showed me anything at all then I missed it
Looked the wrong way Ive done some wrong things
Kept a bad attitude but thats what wrong brings
And now you mean to tell me that after all this time
It was you that kept the dog from goin out of his mind
It was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born
And it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong
And it was you that let me do what I knew what could be done
And it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son
And its been you speakin to me inside my mind
And its been you who has forgiven time after time
It was you who opened my eyes so I could see
It was you that shined your light on me
