Next stop Chicago
Its such a long long train ride
Its such a long lonely ride back home
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Uh uh uh uh uh
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Its not that we gotta do what we do
Its what we know
So to me it aint nothin but bein true but
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It doesnt have to be the way it is you say it is
Just because for the past 20 years every day it is  What 
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin about comin to conflict with the law cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I follow Him theyll follow me
And Ill speak life into the words that you can see cause
Now I know  Cmon  only I can stop the rain
We get away with it everyday shit
But everyday shit catches up with you and when it does you cant say shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I dont you will what I wont you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill when
Now I know only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If it aint broke dont fix it I gave it to you straight
Dont mix it twist it  What  up for some slick shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I dont have to talk to it anymore
I dont have to walk to it anymore Im out the door  What 
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the Lord
I dont wanna find a beast with the sword I cant afford to
Now I know only I can stop the rain
When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight between wrong and right
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I thank you Lord for my life
I thank you Lord for keeping it loose when things got tight
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Im out
