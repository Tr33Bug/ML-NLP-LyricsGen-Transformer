One more time
I gots to hit the streets off
Make the streets talk let em know it aint a sweet walk
This gon be
The only joint made this year thatll knock til 2003
And yall gon see
That the hottest nigga out there was is and will be me
Just like that
I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit but bounce right back
And when its on Im coming strapped
With some shit thatll spit from dusk til dawn
And when you gone
Aint no coming back in the morn
Like that shit was a dream nigga you gone
Thats for real
Creep niggas like a SEAL
Tote the steel stick a nigga make him squeal
Oh my God
Those cant be the last words of your man
Damn your man was so hard  Come on

How many million did my last one sell
Fuck it Im going for ten
Its never gon stop
And every fuckin time I hit you
Its going straight to the top of the charts
The champion
Im a thoroughbred my blood is strong
And I scratch til you done
Cross the line
And aint no more scratches after that
Straight up niggas is dyin
Yo what the fuck is you cats doing
Running around like this like you wont get stuck
Yo thats my word
I stay givin it to niggas
And I stay not really being heard
But yall gon see
That the same thing thou did to them will be done to thee
And then youll know
That sometimes though you come through the front you leavin out the backdoor  Come on 
Bring it what
We right here

We right here
This is ours and we dont share
We right here
Bring your crew cause we dont care
We right here uh uh uh
Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you dont give a fuck about
Cause you gon lose your boys
Cause we dont play
And the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin to say
Dog for life
Whether Im on or off the leash I bite streets are my life
Click click boom
Another life taken too soon another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin goin
Shit Im always careful when I walk Im always seein knowin
The dog gon live
Stay walkin the wire over the fire when I can I give
The dog is good
And how its stayin
Dog gon fuck with the hood til dog fuck with the wood
