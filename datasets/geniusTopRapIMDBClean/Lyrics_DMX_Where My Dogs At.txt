What
Where my dogs at
Where my dogs at
Where my dogs at
Where my dogs at
You can try but I do fight just cant seem to do right
Cant run with the big dogs his jeans is too tight
Ive been doing this for too long plus dog is too strong
Let you catch fight me off the map with a new song
Man you know you wrong trying that shit there
Yeah a nigga went there all you do is sit there
Ive been rapping for 20 years and you 20 years old
X back on the block nigga you lucky if you go Gold
Theres a new sheriff in town just been reelected
You aint gonna like it but respect nigga check it
Imma get it in till the nigga wins with the dividends
We gon walk these dogs til the bitter end
You like oh its him again I knew thats how you felt
Pussy I knew thats how you smelt
But you cats still playing around with just beats
Talking about what you got aint air in the teeth
You can put on a vest but Imma still stop it
Cause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter
And niggas really dont want me to pop the trunk
We gon either chop or slump when I cock and dump
Whether the Glock or pump cats aint ready
Half from here to here lookin like spaghetti
Pull out the machete hack off the limbs
Bag up the pieces wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz five cars deep
4 oclock in the morning riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
GIVE A NIGGA PASS I lay my dick down
You can bring out the best or bring out the worst
You gon bring out the worst we gon bring out the hearse
Niggas play poker I play pokeher
Hit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker
