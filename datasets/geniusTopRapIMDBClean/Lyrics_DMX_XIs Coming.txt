Whos afraid of the dark
Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark they hear the boom but you see the spark
And I see the part of your head which used to be your face
Be replaced by nothin for bluffin what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine picture that
Get on some old second grade shit Ima get you back
Retaliate if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off yeah you heard me shook it off
Man if we was up north niggas wouldve been fucked you
But then we in the streets niggas shouldve been stucked you
Plucked you like a chicken wit your head cut off
Theyll find you wit your back open and your legs cut off
And as for your man dont you ever in your mothafuckin life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit a knife aight
And forgettin you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Dont give a fuck about your family theyll be resting with you

You got yourself in a predicament that you cant get out of
You already in some shit but its about to get hotter
Fuckin with a nigga like you runnin your mouth
Will have that same nigga like you gun in your mouth
But wont be like the last time when you run in the house
Cause I aint knockin on the door Im comin in the house
And Im gunnin for your spouse tryin to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older than 15 Ima rape her
Take her on the livin room floor right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously whatchu wanna do
Frustratin isnt it Wanna kill me but Ima kill you
Now watch me fuck just a little while longer please will you
This is revenge know that before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
Ima make you suffer see your ass in Hell motherfucker
Click boomboom see your ass in hell

When I speak you better listen the harder it gets the more follows
And Im hittin em with shit that they cant all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you not seein tomorrow
I will borrow a gun then run til I catch you
Let you slip up just once then Ima wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
Cause where I catch you is where I catch you thats what killin means
Fuck whoevers standin there when you get what you got comin
Cause once I hit you in your head the witnesses start runnin
Niggas started somethin but they chose not to finish it
So Ima wrap it up for real dog cause Ima win this shit
Fuck it yo lets end this shit I dont need the plaques
And I aint a DJ nigga so I dont need the wax
Gimme slugs for my gats gimme hoods for my rats
Gimme wood for my bats then they meet where the fuck Im at for real
