Deadpool The Animated Series Finale  Lyrics2
DEADPOOL
Oh dont get me wrong Id rip
that horn off myself if a
poacher paid me enough Im Jeremy
Meeks when it comes to that bag
then 
But I also love everything rhino
ya know I used to wear a ton of
Ecko back in the day I was a huge
GUnit fan Had the whole fit I
still got some shirts
Beat
DEADPOOL  CONTD 
You want some Ecko shirts
ESIANKIKI
No
DEADPOOL
Yeah Me neither
then 
So wheres this big grey nutsack
skin covered unicorn
ESIANKIKI
Were hiding Sudan right now Hes
very weak Weve been doing all we
can but if he stays in captivity
he will die The problem is the
poachers Theyre everywhere and
theyve been waiting for
DEADPOOL
OH MY GOD
ESIANKIKI
You see one
DEADPOOL
Sanaa Lathan bit Beyonces face
scrolls 
Wait
relieved 
Oh thank God It was Jennifer
Lawrence I already hate her
Its fine
He continues to scroll and stare at his phone Esiankiki
keeps driving awkwardly He looks for a moment then goes
back to scrolling
