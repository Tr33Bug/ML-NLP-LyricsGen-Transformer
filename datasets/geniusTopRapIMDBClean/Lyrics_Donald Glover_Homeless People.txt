Im kind of obsessed with homeless people
I really am
Cause I dont know
We have a long history together
We do
We have a long history together
Like when I first moved here
When I first moved here from Atlanta
Like the only thing I knew
how to do to make money
was to babysit
cause my parents like they ran a daycare
We had a lot of foster kids
So the only thing I knew how to do
Was take care of kids
So I had this job
I was supposed to pick up this kid
and I was running late
And I was leaving a message
on the phone
And I was just like you know talking
And I wasnt really paying attention
to where I was going
And a homeless man punched me in the face
And I think he was like schizophrenic
or something cause he was like
STOP FOLLOWING ME
and I was just like
AHH and I was just like
Just ran away
So anyway I go and pick up
the kid I pick him up
Bring him home
Make him dinner
His mom comes home
Shes like Hey
She goes in the back room
She comes back out and she goes
Hey are you okay
and Im like
Yeah Im fine
I kinda forgot
Shes like Are you sure
And Im like
Yeah whats wrong
And she plays me the voice message I left
And I didnt keep it
But I remember it very well
And it went a little something it went like this
imitates voice message tone 
Hey uh its Donald Uh I just
wanted to let you know that  sighs 
Im running a little late picking up Ben
But I just wanted to let you know
gets punched 
Whyd you do that
Whyd you do that
I gotta hide
Ill hide in this tree
Get away
Get away
Leave me alone
cries 
I wanna die
I wanna fucking die
Thats pretty much how it sounded
So thanks
