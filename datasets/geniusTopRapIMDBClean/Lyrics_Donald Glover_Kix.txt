It was so ridiculous
I like  like cause like
Cause you know that stuff is important to you when youre a kid
That stuff is really important
Like that was like the world to me as a kid
Like cause kids love sugar
My brother Stephen he loves sugar
He LOVES sugar
And I remember like we werent allowed to have any sugary cereals as a kid
We werent we just werent allowed to have any sugary cereals
And like my mom would like get us  the two cereals we were allowed to have were Cheerios and Kix
And Cheerios is like cardboard doodoo
And Kix is kinda like the handjob of cereals
Its like a little sweet its like the handjob of cereals
Cause its like This is pretty good but you know what I REALLY want
So like we would always go to the store and my mom and like my brother would be like Mom can we get Coco Puffs I really want Coco Puffs Can we get Coco Puffs I want Coco Puffs
And my mom would be like No no no no no like no Were not getting Coco Puffs no sugar no no no
And one day my brother just snapped
He just snapped
He was like Mom Everyones eating it
My mom goes grabs it and goes fine
Throws it in the cart and just walks away
Me and my brother would be like what It was that easy
So we go home we go home and were skipping around like yes yes yes were gonna get Coco Puffs This is gonna be so awesome Yes yes yes yes I cant wait This is gonna be so great we get to tell everyone at school we had Coco Puffs
And she my mom was a Tupperware woman
And my mom goes over to the cabinet and does the most devious thing Ive ever seen anyone ever do
She takes a big Tupperware container meant for cereal like one of those big things that you pour and stuff
Opens it up takes a quarter of the Cocoa Puffs like just the top like 14th of the Cocoa Puffs pours it in there like
Then takes a big ol box of Kix pours like the whole thing on top of it shakes it up
So like the ratio is like 13000 Kix to one Cocoa Puff like it was like one spot of brown
It looked like a Kanye concert
Thats what it looked like It looked like a Kanye concert
She takes the box and slides it across the table and was like There you go
And my brothers just like crying sounds
And continues to pour himself a bowl
You bitch
How could you ruin this
Like crying
But he still ate it
Thats how much kids love sugar thats how much my brother loves sugar
He was an addict
He could have been like fuck this I dont need this whatever
He was like No no I still want it I still want it
Its just like if you love pizza and then a dudes like Hey you like pizza
There you go
Youre not gonna be like Oh you asshole You asshole
Dont eat the pizza
Dont eat it
Theres not people lined up around the block just like a Dominos like Oh come on baby I used to be a lawyer
Dont eat it
