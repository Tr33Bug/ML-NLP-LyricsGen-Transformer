I just like I was just doing some stuff with likemusic
And I just put out that EP and I was like
crowd cheers and applauses 
Thank you
And I was listening to it in my car I picked up
Like mixing
I was like Oh I wanna see how it sounds in the car and I picked up a friend of mine she got in
She was like Is this you
I was like Yeah
And she goes You listen to your own music
I was like Yeah yeah I listen to my own music
Like being an entertainer
Being an entertainer is the only job where you can enjoy your own stuff Did you know that Its the only job where you can enjoy your own shit Like if I made sandwiches for a living
Like if I made sandwiches for a living like if I worked at Subway or something I made sandwiches for a living then I go home and I make a myself a sandwich Nobody in here is gonna be like Getting a little conceited arent we Like no one cares No one cares Its also the only job where you have to keep proving you can do it
Like if you worked at Staples you dont have to be like Oh I know how to move paper from here to here
Like you dont have to do that every time you go in
As an actor I have to prove I know how to act every time I have to audition and prove I know how to act
Like Im just gonna forget how to act one day
Like Ill come back from summer break go to Community and theyre gonna be like and action and Ill be like
pretends to jerk off 
crowd laughs 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I DONT KNOW IS THIS ACTING
HELP HELP
Ridiculous
Well like I was talking about music I like music a ton But like the problem is I like weird stuff I like weird crazy music Like weird people making music and we really dont have that anymore I mean we have Lady Gaga and stuff like that but thats
I dont think thats really weird I feel like its plain
We need weird stuff cause like as an adult were not really allowed to be weird anymore Like the older you get the less you can take weird stuff
Thats the truth like you cant take weird stuff anymore
As a kid the idea of Santa Claus is really weird and fucked up
It really is
But like just like
Hey theres this fat guy and he comes to your house eats all your food and he leaves little gifts for you while your parents are sleeping he runs up to Timmy and like
He gives me gifts Cool
Youre just fine with it
Youre fine with that guy being in your house
As an adult somebodys like Hey man Glee comes on at 9 instead of 8 tonight
FUCK YOU REALLY WHYD THEY CHANGE IT Whyd they change it
Cant take any change whatsoever But thats basically what it is Its like Im 27 and Im about to become who Im gonna be for the rest of my life Like basically like once hit your thirties thats who youre gonna be for the rest of your life pretty much If youre a conservative and youre around your thirties youre probably gonna be a conservative for the rest of your life If youre like liberal and in your thirties youre probably gonna be liberal for the rest of your life If youre a girl and you dont get blowjobs curl up to your nine cats and your Twilight DVDs cause youre gonna die alone Youre gonna die alone
crowd laughs 
Sorry
I love that joke because guys are like Well put Mr Glover
claps 
But its true You cant take any like as you get older you cant take any weird stuff Thats just the truth
Like I you know
That Lady Gaga Kanye West tour
I was super stoked about that That was gonna be so awesome and weird Its gonna be so crazy I was having dreams about it thats how much I was excited I was having dreams about it
I was like theres gonna be two big pillars on stage like one big pillar here Lady Gagas there and her hair is blowing in the wind and shes playing the bass like that but the bass isnt a bass its a huge tampon just plucking at a huge tampon and at the end of it is Tony Danzas face hes just like ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba like hes just going crazy on it and like theres another one theres like another huge pillar and then like Kanye West is on it hes playing the piano but the piano is not a piano its just a bear its a LIVE BEAR for some reason and the bear is not eating Kanye because he has so much respect for him hes just looking at him like Aw I wanna eat you but you made Graduation you mothafucka hes like mad and then like in the audience theres a big clear beach ball that everybody is pushing and kicking around and in the center of the big clear beach ball theres just this one lone baby just like one lone naked baby and hes not crying or anything hes just confused and shit like Why did my parents put me in here I thought they loved me
And I was like YES Thats worth 50 Wanna see that
And they cancelled it they got rid of it
They were like Its too weird its gay get rid of it
But they got rid of it they cancelled it And thats ridiculous Thats crazy Only adults would do that Like as a kid we watched the weirdest stuff and nobody cared
Nobody ended
You guys remember Muppet Babies
Let me refresh your memory what Muppet Babies is about
Muppet Babies is a show about a lady with no face who takes care a frog a pig a dog that plays the piano and an alien named Gonzo that fucks chickens
And adults were like Yeah watch it I dont give a fuck I got things to do gotta go
You guys remember Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sounds like a homeless persons fever dream If you were walking down the street and you saw a homeless person and they were like theyre all named after renaissance artists and their fathers a big a rat youd be like STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME MAN
