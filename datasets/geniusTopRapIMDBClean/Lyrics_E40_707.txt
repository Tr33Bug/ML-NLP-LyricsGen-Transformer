Im a Hillside Kitty Walk nigga of course
You bound to see a nigga do a drive by on a horse
Countrycity boy big cornfed nigga
40 ounce sipper discount liquor
On the corner of Magazine and Sonoma Boulevard
Across the street from Grant Street suicide backyard
Play them boys for false fuck around and get stolen
They rep that shit hard shout out to Soulin
I got the munchies cause Im smoking on a log
Went to Bridgeside for some Sacs hot dogs
Im slapping Hubba Head the Luvva Twins  Albino Rod
The first record Vallejo record ever pressed up as far as hip hop
Then came MVP  40 DShot Suga and B
Then came The Mac then came Mac DRE
They doing the Thizz Dance in front of SolTrans
Everybody activated with a pistol in their pants
I was taking a shit and Cousin Fik hit me up
He said 40 on the other line I told that nigga What
Pressed mute wiped my ass bounced the fuck up
And started talking business with the boss of where Im from
The seven hundred and six plus one
I be in the trap with Kyle Nasa in the flats
Was born in 95 and after that its been a wrap
Im a hustla not no rat
Im about my Gouda Im about my scratch
Im heading to the tippy so Im always on my toes
Times Herald taking pictures for so Im striking for the pose
My niggas on Alhambra still be playing with their nose
Even if this rap dont blow I still get money out a ho
I was raised by OGs so its class in me
Im allergic to broke bitches so they bad for me
You want a verse from lil Neffy then start cashing me
Bitch Im from Vallejo muthafucka stop asking me


VAdoubleLEJO
Hop in this form bitch ride with the roller
Whats your motive Them aint the cops them the rollers
Flow straight colder talking sicker than Ebola
Had a tramp out in Rosa and I fucked her good
I found out she was a ho so I kept it hood
Yeah we counting Cnotes like a musical
Im slapping Young DBoyz Selling Cocaine as Usual
I went to House of Soul I need the usual
Never wore a suit but Im suitable

Moved to the A the shit was beautiful
I moved back start killing niggas your funeral

Hell yeah Imma rep they gonna hate me anyway  BEEZY
