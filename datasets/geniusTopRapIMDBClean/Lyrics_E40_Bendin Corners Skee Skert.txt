Bendin Corners  Skee Skert  Lyrics
Lil Bonez on the beat
This thing go for sholy
Only bustas I like is Buster Posey
And the Bay is so trashy murkish and murky
Crooked cops crooked dice theyll do you dirty
When I enter the neighborhood when I pull up
People gather round me like an ice cream truck
They say Uncle 40 waterwhats the secret to life
Im trying to get on I need some advice
I give em some game and then I dip
Off to the next episode money to get
Cant be slippin and snoozin and cattin off
If you lag you lose man your loss
My Ruger wont stutter to put you under the cover
Or should I say sheet with a tag on yo feet
Fetti by the face aint complexion as duct tape 
Then its dark like shadows off the tree bad apple
Cognac and Snapple sippin spliffer twistin Swisher Sweets
Smokin and blowin and puffin on some Larry OG
Comin around the corner disrespectfulass beat
Old peep cant sleep call Johnny Law on me
I dont make it rain Im not a cloud
And I dont pay for coochy coochy pay for me pal
You can find me doublefisted in the crowd in the party talkin loud
No harm no foul
And I be bangin this shit when Im bendin that block  bendin that block 
Bendin that block
And I be bangin this shit when I bendin that block  been in that block 
Bendin that block
Hit the corner like skee  skee  skert  skee skert 
Skee  skee  skert  skert 
Hit the corner like skee  skee  skert  skee skert 
Skee  skee  skert  skert 
Skee  skee  skert  skert 
Hit the corner like
No withdrawls just deposits
Jordans and Foamposites
Yo house smaller than my closet
Nigga you oughta stop it
Thats what I told the fraud
I aint forkin over no broad
When you speak to me watch the way you speak
If you feel froggish leap
He jumped so I beat him like an egg
Cracked his shell got on his head
Throw in the towel or we can take it farther
I got more drums than Travis Barker
Or should I say the Blue Men
Two sticks in my hand
I go ape on a fake if thats what he want
Im not a chump Im from Vallejo California I aint no punk
Bboy apparel candy Camaro
Sharp like a arrow hood like valero
Badges be on me they like my strategy
They love my attitude and personality
Crown me like a cavity recognize royalty
Kingpin I say that with authority
Ooh  She stacked like french toast brains over beauty
She just so happened to be blessed with both


Skee skert
Skee skert
Bendin that block
Bendin that block
Hit the corner like skee  skee  skert  skee skert 
Skee  skee  skert  skert 
Hit the corner like skee  skee  skert  skee skert 
Skee  skee  skert  skert 
Hit the corner like
