Bitch  Remix  Lyrics
Nigga dont act like a bitch  Haha 
Thats why I never love a bitch  Yeah 
50 Cent Too hort and E40 say bitch  Remix 
She sucked me off dont kiss that bitch
From New York to the Bay From New York to the Bay 
Ohh why Ohh whyd you marry that bitch
He said he love her mane he really think he love her mane
She a super freak freakier than he understand
Shes not the type of girl that you take home to your mother
Shes the type you take to the track to come up on sucker
Watch her deep throat see her DP
In and out both holes like its easy
Its not a big deal she doin what she do
She doin it with everybody not just you
Hello  Haha  Im tryna put you up on game
You get emotional then you could get the fuck on mane
You buy her everything you let her treat ya like a trick
Your sugar daddy mentality it make a nigga sick
She ask for it you just run and get it for her
No matter how much you give her she wants more
I hate to tell you but you in love with a whore
And chances are if niggas try they gonna score man fuck that bitch  Haha 
Thats why Ill never love a bitch
50 Cent Too hort and E40 say bitch
She sucked me off dont kiss that bitch
Ohh why Ohh whyd you marry that bitch
I get everything I wanna get
I have some fun with it  And make her momma trip
Cause if Im in her life  its a problem
A real players at your girl you better stop him  whooooooowhooooooooo 
Turn your back on the bitch she aint actin right
He hit it way before you now hes back in her life  haha 
Whatchu gon do when you lose her
She got a nigga on the side just to use her  AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 
If its me Im parkin at the front door
And you be knockin on her bedroom window
You see the shadows  You hear the sounds
But you dont do nothin you just turn back around
Like a BITCH  Feelings hurt ready to cry
You caint believe everything she said was a lie
She got a lot of bitch in her but not more than you
I never underestimate  what yall boysll do
Bitch  You love her I fuck her
She my jumpoff she yo baby mama
You kiss her I twist her
And send her ass back to you before you miss her  Bitch

Thats why Ill never love a bitch  Ill never love her
