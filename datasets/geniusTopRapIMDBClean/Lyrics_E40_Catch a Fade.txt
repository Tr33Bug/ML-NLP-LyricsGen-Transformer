Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Pulling up and hopping out
Shell catch it poppin out
And I aint never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats give me that give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
Im ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
Im pissed off so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw fuck a rentacop
Im hot Im napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me what I do wrong
Nigga it aint bout the chain nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch nigga you a fucking waiter
I dont even want a favor I just want a fair one
And its like that till the sheriffs come
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
DroopE look
Problems we solve them bout that action
One less sucker nigga thats subtraction
His boss is factors on the team
Real niggas no actors on the team
Not you who Droop He a good dude
Put him in a bad mood he turn you into goon food
Im in the party feeling like me
SICK with TDE
Your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
And this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She shows up chump salute give daps
Get your face flat you dont want that
Get your nose tapped you dont want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped get chopped on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Stay turned super charged up stoned
Ghetto pass never revoked
Mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a Cnote pea coat
Popo tryna decode lingo
Not drunk but Im finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me I aint shit
She hate me but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
Bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
Patna wanna challenge cause my pockets hella fatter
But he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
Put hands on a man fuck unity
Aint nothing between us but space and opportunity
Never been a sucker never been a lame
Stay in your lane you cant see me like a stealth plane
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Dont approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade catch a fade
Where you from DroopE  The West 
Where you from Kendrick  The West 
Aye 40 where you from though  The West 
Who bring it to their front door  The West 
And where they get their game from  The West 
And where they get their slang from  The West 
And where they get their strains from  The West 
And where they get their grapes from  The West
