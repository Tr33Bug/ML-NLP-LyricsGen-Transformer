I made a detour out of the game when I was hustlin crack
Made a couple of dollars made a little bit of change never looked back
You could find me at the shooter range practicing bussin gats
Or in the vocal booth in this new studio bussin raps
With some gold on my body out my body off Carlos Rossi
Im sloppy I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di she like to party off molly Bacardi
Love to get naughty a hottie up in the lobby she stopped me
She said 40 Water where you bout to be
I said Follow me follow me follow me bitch room 223
