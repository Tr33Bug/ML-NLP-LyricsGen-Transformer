Function  Remix  Lyrics
This is the remix
League of Starz
Trend on the beat
Ayy ayy bitch try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You aint down bbbye bitch
I aint got time for playin Im just sayin man
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
I aint got time for playin Im just sayin man
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
I aint got time for playin Im just sayin man
We out here tryna function
Uh I slid into the function  the throw 
Lookin hella dipped  saucy 
Lit like a strobe light  like a strobe light 
Hella diamonds on my wrist  bling 
You can call me Your Highness cause Im hella high in this  bling 
Play with her mind like a shrink like Im a psychiatrist  skrink 
No dryness I make your chick have a climax  cream 
Even nicer wet she tellin me that Im the best  scream 
You dont want her Ill take her off your hands and do you a favor  favor 
You might not regret it now but you gon regret it later  later 
Im about my paper stapler right on the side of my hip  hip 
In case a hater want it in case he decide to trip
Platinum plannin shippin and handlin see these are digital sales  digital sales 
Used to push E up from the scale but now its legitimate skrill
You aint understand it Tell this game evolved Im from the Hills  from the heels 
Vallejo Calihari to HI double L  biatch 
Ayy ayy bitch try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You aint down bbbye bitch
I aint got time for playin Im just sayin man
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
I aint got time for playin Im just sayin man
We out here tryna function man we out here tryna function
