Money Money Money Money
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
Money on my mind on my grind tryna catch a break
Gorilla for the scrilla an ape about my cake
The rap game dont work Im back to pushin selling weight
Got a family to feed gotta put some food up on their plate
Sippin this jack and smoking this cali green turtle
Trying to relax and overcome obsticals and hurdles
Haters wanna hold me back because im solid and im laced
But if you spit in the wind its gonna blow right back in your face
Bosses love me lames dont like me
I dont want them around me anyway like poison ivy
I aint in the way Im out the way but please dont try me
Throw a thread at me  taking it lightly
Be careful what you wish for karmas a bitch
They shot him at 5 but he died at six
Id rather be judged by 12 than to be carried by 6
What kind of ammo did they use  556
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
Ive gotta get that to them
Revenue is dreamin and you know im never losing
Got money on my mind big bank is on my brain
I keep on counting currency but I will never change
The more I teach them the dumber I get
I keep it lit light a spliff rub two sticks
I aint soup and salad Im souper salad
Got more homies and prison than I do in college
Zoom zooms and wam wams wam wams and zoom zooms
Every other week Im in the visitng room
Dominos and pinochle talking hella shit
reposing taking family flicks
Never hustle backwards always hustle forward
Never live above your means buy things you cant afford
I aint shallow Im deep I will not sleep
Cant 7 days cant be weak
Never get on the stand and speak when youre in the hot seat
Never play for give always play for keep
Theres enough money for all of us to get
We the cheese cheddar weak when we separate but we stronger together
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
Ive gotta get that to them
Revenue is dreamin and you know im never losing
Got money on my mind big bank is on my brain
I keep on counting currency but I will never change
Bill collectors calling all day and night
Make me want to jump through the phone and take flight
I aint paying shit you get it when I got it
Im about to spend this money at this motherfucking party
Bad bitches in the function and I gotta do me
Last night I hit two tonight Im trying to hit three
Make them buy me a room at the double tree
Ive go the liquor the condoms and the broccoli
Bitch
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
I I Ive got money on my mind ooooooooo
