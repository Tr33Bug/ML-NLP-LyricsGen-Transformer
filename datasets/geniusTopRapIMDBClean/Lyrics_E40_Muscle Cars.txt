The beat wrapped monster cables the speakers humpin
Trunk soundin like King Kong and Godzilla back there thumpin
All we do is drink and get high and pedal and push
Organic weed mystery weed just Purple Kush
I cut the the wheel well on my whip and filled that bitch up
Now my muscle car sittin high like a monster truck
Monster up suck up to none dont be no poodle
Split his pack open like pack of Top Ramen noodle
In the heart of the soil where you can find me
Try me fuck boi and get your face put on a white tee
40 Turf Talk and Keak the Sneak

High speed chases and runnin lights
Water in the duals make loud glass pipes
