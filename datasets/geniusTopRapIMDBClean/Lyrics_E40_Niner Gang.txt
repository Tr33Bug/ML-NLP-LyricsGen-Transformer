Against all odds weathered the storm
Built for combat and battle young hyenas in uniforms
We play no games with the opposition we active
Let the whistle be the bell we gon get down
What we got mad at
Many have tried but many have failed
The 49ers got the livest fans in the NFL
I tried to told em we back and we never left and we got heart
Levis Stadium startin to feel like Candlestick Park  uh oh 
Goldblooded my neck is frozen with diamonds
Front Row 40 be on the field with the linemen big timin  Fixture 
Niner Faithful old school like an Impala
Ask Merton Hanks and the homie Ricky Watters  Take a picture 
Them was my neighbors in 96
RIP Dwight Clark The Catch  Legendary 
Im a Niner forever like Rice and Lott  Dont forget TO 
Niner Empire until the world pop
