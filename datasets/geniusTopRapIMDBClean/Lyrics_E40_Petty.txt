Somebody call the ambulambs and the reverend
Teach a fuck nigga a valuable lesson
Scorpio thats my astrology  Forty 
My Rover a autobiography  story 
Oyster perpetual presi  Ching 
VSs all up in my bezi  Bling 
Punk rock bitch gold digging hoe
All up in the function with your best friends clothes
Always starting something you a messy ass hoe
Lil groupie ass bitch on the stage at the shows
As far as these niggas they petty too  irrelevant 
They hate on real niggas like me and you  relevant 
They jealous conniving and sneaky  sheisty 
Dont wanna be them wanna be me  icy

They pockets is pennies my pockets a check
