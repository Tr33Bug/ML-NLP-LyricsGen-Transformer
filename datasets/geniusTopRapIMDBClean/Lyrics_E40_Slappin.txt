I got the mouthpiece of a ventriloquist
When Im talking business I barely move my lips
I dont want no suckers and counterfeits in my mix
I dont want them around me I dont need em
If you find a real one like me tell em I want to meet em
It all depends on how you breed em
And who they come up under
Your plug might be jealous cause you took his thunder
Let him know you recognize him as a factor
One of the rules of power never outshine the master
Sluricane in my cup category fifth
All on SnapChat taking hell of flicks
Some of my fellas is sober some of em smoking dope
Some of my fellas is older some too young to vote
Rapper now but used to be a dealer  a dealer 
Got enough paper to have your best friend kill you
Release the silent ones up in the Benz
What you yelling 
Im yellin real nigga over everything
This motherfuckin gnac
Got me not knowing how to act
Bout to fuck on this bitch in the back
Yeah get her ass fuckin slapped
Yeah and this motherfucker slap
Aye aye said this motherfucker slap
Its slappin
Said this motherfucker slap
Whats happenin
Said this motherfucker slap


Homeboy bought a rollie and his shit get taken
Invisible sets rockin like my shit went missing
When the ice hit the light it twinkle and glisten
If my shooter get shot then Imma finish his mission
Currently on my second tour ever this feels like heaven
They calling me the dude no Devin its for my sevens
Ima ride if Im summoned I abide by nothin
Im my own damn boss I can put you onto something
And on tuesdays Im rocking with my Uzi
Slappin dumb hard tryna knock me off a Toupee
Yolo whippin and product reppin Crest Toothpaste
I flip a coin and take a life just like Im two face
Elevated on my high horse now cant come down
My achievements speak loud Imma lil child
Water hit me on my cellular like look Neffy knock this out
I need that blapper shit that slapper shit
Tryna blow a speaker out
This motherfuckin gnac
Got me not knowing how to act
Bout to fuck on this bitch in the back
Yeah get her ass fuckin slapped
Yeah and this motherfucker slap
Aye aye said this motherfucker slap
Its slappin
Said this motherfucker slap
Whats happenin
Said this motherfucker slap
Aye aye learn about it
Having so much money it takes me two weeks to count it
Baby girl got kicks make her booty shake she got talent
Hit it from the back her knees shake and  she lose her balance
Woah woah hold up thirtysix twentyfour she a double D cup
Doing splits on the floor bust it open in the club
All them bitches jealous cause niggas showing you love
Popping my collar drinking my drink and making my presence known
Vanille Tobacco Tom Ford cologne I got on
You can tell by the way I carry myself Imma star
These Cartier buffs my face cost more than your car
From a dollar man to a millionaire they stop and stare
Look at my IG Im everywhere
That and they just be liking on me cause they know Im the guy guy
Blowing this tree put it in the air like wifi
This motherfuckin gnac
Got me not knowing how to act
Bout to fuck on this bitch in the back
Yeah get her ass fuckin slapped
Yeah and this motherfucker slap
Aye aye said this motherfucker slap
Its slappin
Said this motherfucker slap
Whats happenin
Said this motherfucker slap
