Bruh you heard about our lil nigga
Naw what happened to our lil nigga
They got a homie in Chinese cater and turned his car into a cheese grater
How long ago did this happen 
About a hour and a half ago  where did they take him to
The queen of the valley hospital
What did the perpitraitors look like 
A bunch of mop heads
Mop heads
Yeahsome niggas with some dreads
Who told you this 
This brawd
How the fuck she know she saw it
Now I aint the one to gossip but Imma keep it solid  I think she why he got it
Now now the fact aint been provin but I think that nigga was goosin
Who
The perpitraitor my nigga I think that nigga was goosin too Well where the brawd at
She cut she probably gone for days she was in the car with him but she didnt get hit she only got a graze
A graze you mean to tell that bitch only got a flesh wound  while my nigga up there brain dead layin up in the ICU room  now was these some clown niggas or some really ready to get down niggas  where them niggas at what side of town Imma spit they crown nigga
Dont even look over there  act like we aint trippin  next few days  partners came up missin  x2
The art of storytellin  the art of storytellin    x4
What you think we ought to do
We gotta out think them niggas You see it take a fool to catch a fool Anybody got any pictures 
Go to they myspace page bet you one of em rap I can almost guarantee youll find a flick with the rest of em in the back
Every since I received the disturbing news every since I aint been sober we gotta react right now my nigga we cant wait for this shit to blow over

Man we in the middle of a damn drought punkin them niggas out 7 62s and 2 23s showin em what we about
Chorus
Dont even look over there  act like we aint trippin  next few days  partners came up missin  x2
The art of storytellin  the art of storytellin    x4
