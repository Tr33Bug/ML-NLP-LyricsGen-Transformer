  x2 
Every time I stop hoes like look at him
Every car I drive niggas want one of them
They pointin they pointin
They like dammmmmn
They pointin they pointin
They like dammmmmn
Like Ricky Ross everyday Im hustlin
Gettin off weight  like who  Jennifer Hudson
Pack a hammer Thor
Shooter score
Slide through batches think Im hecka rich
Breakin necks turnin heads like the exorcist
Thumbs up like the like button
Eatin good no rib touchin
Runnin with a bundle never fumble
Countin so much bread I got Carpal tunnel
Stock paint  from where  Maaco
Beige like a potato
They hate me on the outside love me in the inside
Suck me in the back seat while I let a friend drive
Half a pound two stacks half a unit 105
I stay out here by Sully so you know a hustler been fly
My pockets somen serious mansion on a hilly
Main that nigga got more cheese than a philly
Shoelace tied but a nigga still trippin
Im Lionel Richie high Im dancin on the ceiling
Never marry a hoes I just marry checks
Thats how you stay on top missionary sex
Rubba Band Business know you heard of that
I got the town talkin know you scurred of that
None less than ten figures you know what Im worth
Record sales show money not including merch
Club full of bitches pocket full of Franks
Blunt full of weed cup full of drank
Me going raw dog aint no way in hell
Before I risk my life it be a cold day in hell
But bitch take it off here we go show and tell
And Im fuckin that pussy like Im fresh out of jail
Parallel park while Im ghost riding
Black diamonds man Im racial profiling
Im so fly man I need a copilot
So I might let your damn ho drive it
Lil hair pullin man I like rough sex
Dropped out I aint never passed a drug test
You know my lingo baby lets mingle
So I got a thousand dollars worth of singles
I got racks in the cargo of my camo
Still still wont give her Nathaniel
Life a gamble so I had to make a bet
These aint Air Max but I can make a check
They took me out the streets but its still in me
I been sellin werk since we had Bill Clinton
Im the voice of the streets so they still listen
On the back of the milk carton ceiling missing
