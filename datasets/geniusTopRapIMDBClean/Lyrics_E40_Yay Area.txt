Poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock  but
We be to rap what key be to lock
We be  we be to rap what key be to lock  but
We be to rap what key be to lock
We be  we be to rap what key be to lock  but
pattern repeats in background as the beat comes in
Ooooooh I got my second wind pimp E40
Rick Rock I got my second wind Sick Wid It BME
Talk to a peeeimp  Warner Brothers  fuck with a peeeimp
Oooooh talk to a peeeimp fuck with a peeeimp
Heavyweight a vet not a amateur  what else
Looted up I push pies like Marie Callender  whatchu gon do
Suit it up if I must take over shop
Get out the car and walk sneak up on pahtnah and do a dome shot
Kerpow Kerpow  kerpow kerpow  OOOOH
Then I blend into the crowd
Ohah ohah ohah ohahh  OOOOH
Hang with a bunch of hotheads super hyphy and wild
Tell yo batch to stop askin about a player
Inquirin about a player cant fuck her right now later
Im busy gettin my paper and ridin round in my scraper
Interactin networkin and campaignin like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Like McCormicks Im seasoned I run my region  run yo region 
Yall think Im starvin Hell naw nigga Im eatin  we eatin 
Stay barkin like Dino lyin and cheatin
Keep jackin my lingo one of these rappers gon end up leakin

Tell the people that 40Water is back
YAY AREAHHHHH LIke dat
Tell the people that 40Water is back
We be to rap what key be to lock  key be to lock 
Cut a corner or 2 and bend the block  bend the block 
The West aint been the same without Pac
So I guess its up to E40 and Rick Rock  act like 
STUNT  uhh 
You hear 40 new shit He on there comin
You hear 40 new shit He on there dumpin
Hear all the women talk about That nigga somethin

Got some folks in Lompoc and Skeleton Bay
Uhh kilograms I had to measure
Finger on my Heckler havin mo paper than a paper shredder
Oooh tycoon til I fall  til I fall 
I dont sound like none of yall  none of yall 
You gettin independent scratch  uhhuh 
Just remember the niggas that taught you that
Ooooh  who you loyal to Loyal to my soil
Never leave the pad without my blessing oil  uhhuh 
Cause I surround myself with felons  what they do 
Pop innertubes and bust melons  oooh 
Ooooh  HUSTLERS
On the lookout for the racketbusters
On the lookout for the fuzz
The racketbusters meanin people them false them undercovers
Never tell a batch what youre up to  what she might do 
Cause one day she might tell on you  and what else 
And youll be sittin in the can  while she what 
While she fuckin all yo friends  uhhuhhh 
Spendin all yo yaper  what else tell me 
Ridin round in yo scraper  what she givin 
Givin brains  uhhuh 
All the hood homies runnin choochoo trains
We be to rap what key be to lock
We be  we be to rap what key be to lock  but
