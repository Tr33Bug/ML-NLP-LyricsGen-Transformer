Yo were two hard motherfuckers
Taking out any punk ass suckers
Can you believe this if so be frightened
Were strong as fuck with the power of a titan
Setting a mark of destruction get it
So dont front and say you aint with it
You wanna rumble with us you cant hang
Because were something like a two man gang
Starting some shit is what we do best
Just care about ourself and say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy  wassup  bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid motherfuckers the deal
I look you dead in the eye then I spit  yeah 
I tell you to your face punk you aint shit  you aint shit 
I dont give a god damn about feelings
Im just happy just as long as Im killing
A 187s in progress nigga
Just as soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic heavily I start firing
And the kids on the block Im the one theyre admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and Ima bust your lip
Now who you gonna tell that Im making you soft
The police aint shit cause Im paying em off
I move slow always ready to go so fuck it  so fuck it 
And bitches on my dick they know that they can suck it
Im a hardhead always having a fit
When Im not allowed to tear up shit
Im a hard motherfucker  Im hard motherfucker 
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Now look at me Im a crazed bitch
With a gangster profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that dont give a fuck
To a pussy ass fool trying to press his luck
Im ready to scrap thats if youre ready to go
Ill take you out going toe to toe
E will start a conversion and hit you from the back
While you getting fucked up by a ruthless jack
Critical condition is what you receive
Thinking of some back up to go and retrieve
But Eazy tell what would happen my man
They would get fucked up by a ruthless clan
So its simple we dont give a fuck right
So you and your boy can get the fuck out my sight
Im on tilt with class getting ready to blast
Cause Im a hard motherfucker
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Eazy and Ren is fucking it up again
Scheming up a plot before we begin
Because niggas like to stare like a bitch sometimes
They say how could them niggas have some hell of a rhymes
Its simple tell em what we mean
When the two baddest motherfuckers step on the scene
Now this is some shit  Yo what are you saying
You stupid motherfuckers they think Im playing
Talking all kind of shit but Im cracking it up
I can afford to laugh cause Im backing it up
Im not a buster Im more like a hitman
So if you dont wanna throw then you can get down
You dont like the fuck away from me
So you can stop the shit trying to fuck the E
You heard what he said and its the truth so whats up
So if you want me to go well Im about to nut up
The two baddest motherfuckers alive
So I dont think that you and your boys can survive
You got a girl well if shes good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the ho
A train was in effect and your bitch was rocked
By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop
Yo Ren lets jet lets get the fuck on out
Because everybody knows what were talking about
Were two hard motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
