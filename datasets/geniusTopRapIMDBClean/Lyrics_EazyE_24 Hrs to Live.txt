24 hours to live
24 hours to live
Seventhousand four hundred twenty three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
Its how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfuckers gotta die
Im an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
Im gonna put these things on you and never let up
See my momma she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E shoulda never been born
Too late big mistake in 72
Its 92 now they yell code blue
15 hours11 minutes30 seconds Im a motherfuckin wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days aint long Im comin strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggas kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin too
Now what else can I do
Fuck fuck fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka EazyE
24 hours to live
But I dont wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why oh why
Must die
Sky diving scuba diving
To Evel Knievel stunt car drivin
Bungee cord jumpin off a bridge
Its hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I cant take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the butt
I gotta let off
A few more nuts
Im starting to panic
Im starting to sweat
Cause I dont really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells flashbacks in my head
Niggas aint want me to bein happy when Im dead
But I aint goin out unless 30 niggas die
Im dying anyway so Im thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin by the pistol
Took the motheruckin whistle
24 hours to live
But I dont wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why oh why
Must die
To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
Screams 
Shut the fuck up nigga
Cause you aint seen shit
Im bout to take this blade and staight up grip
Im holdin the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now Im mad insane red as rose as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpetythump to pump it might burst
False alarms and no harm that will commit to the E
But now Im down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast but not that slow
I thought I had an hour but its seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my  BOOM 
24 hours to live
But I dont wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why oh why
Must die
X2
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
As time winds down to its last 24 hours
In an earth that weighs 60 trillion tons
Travelling 1037 13 mph how do you define time
What is a minute
How important is an hour when 24 hours becomes a lifetime
Oooooh so define how do we define time
Now you choose
How will you spend your last 24 hours
Cmontalk to me
3X   must die is faded into next chorus loop 
24 hours to live
But I dont wanna die
24 hours to live
Oh why oh why
Must die
