Put in the old tape

Raised in LA
I was 
Crusin down the street in my 64

Ridin Los Loses
Lookin for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound
To diss the law
Stopped at a light
And had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost
Wreaked my shit
Flipped his a off
to the floor
Bottle was empty
So I went to the store
Nigga on tilt
Cause I was drunk
Seen a sissy a punk
Had to go in my trunk
Reached inside
Cause its like that
Came back out
With a silver gat
Fired at the punk
And it was all because
I had to show the nigga
What time it was
Put up the Jam
It ends like a mirage
A sissy like that
Got out of dodge
Suckers on me
For the title Im holdin
EazyEs Fcked up
And got the 8Ball rollin

Yo man you see Eazy hurlin in a parking lot 
Stepped on yo foot
