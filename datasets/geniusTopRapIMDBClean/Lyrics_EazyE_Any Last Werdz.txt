1999
The world is at its end fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang
Its the end of the world
And still niggas aint got no satisfaction
So I take my nine put it on my set bust a cop in his head
Now Im blastin
Cause Im known as a G
And Im comin from the CPT
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin packs cant fuck with Eazy

Wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up wet em up

This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I aint fuckin around G
So take a look at a real live nigga thats crazy
And get ready to die loc
Any last words before your ass gets smoked
It aint a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
Thats why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nikes
And anything else I might like
And then Im off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker slippin takin two to the chin
Im on a roll two niggas in one night
Didnt even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
Thats real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me do you have any last words
Cause its the end of the world
And still niggas aint got no satisfaction
So I take my nine put it on my set bust a cop in his head

Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a driveby did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it aint wise to get faded off the St Ides
A mother cries another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught slippin and set trippin
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin
Too many lives took too many hearts broke
But you dont hear me you just see my fuckin gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from the innocent little ones
But where I come from we take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin cap peeled
Grab your steel forget about what you heard
Its do or die nigga
Any last words
Cause its the end of the world
And still niggas aint got no satisfaction
So I take my nine put it on my set bust a cop in his head
Now Im blastin
Cause Im known as a G
And Im comin from the CPT
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas cant fuck with the Eazy
Wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up
Wet em up wet em up wet em up
I got the 9 and Im finna straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life so I peep
Checkin the scene but stayin low so Im not seen
Case I gotta get away gotta make the shit clean G
So Im lookin for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked em
Scoped shit then I licked him
Now Im back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squeal when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause its funny nigga fuck his ass
He aint the last and surely aint the first G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse G
So Im feelin somewhat relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G so forget the silly shit you heard
Its do or die EazyE gets that last word
Cause its the end of the world
And still niggas aint got no satisfaction
So I take my nine put it on my set bust a cop in his head
Now Im blastin
