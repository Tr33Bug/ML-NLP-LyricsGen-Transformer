YEAH
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa
Hate brought death
Around the block as the hollow points bust though the punks back
Raising gang feel no pain  as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill Im wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hell raisers
Im 30 ot 6 with the scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts lead in that niggas flesh
Aint no hope every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his Glock in the back of my neck
Im thinkin to myself what the fuck as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do
If I make a wrong move the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy Im bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dough to Daytons I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa
Which bitch made the statement
About the nigga busting caps sporting all black Ben Davis
Im out the door
My pagers blowin up I check my gat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as Im livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the
Upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Aint no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga Im killing for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa
