BoyzNTha Hood  GMix  Lyrics
Yeah Gangsta Dresta done stepped in this motherfucker And this one goes out to all the OGs out there And I cant forget the baby gangstas whats up niggas My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit nigga That got all of yall on his dick in the first place yeah So run that shit E yeah
Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the freaks clockin the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about making that GTA
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash well pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said My man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car trying to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash well pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops knocked his ol ass out


Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash well pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Now Im rolling hard now under control
Then wrapped the 64 round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walking home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash well pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cut a fart
Disruption of a court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash well pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
