Hey yo remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfucker said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit
Yeah the stupid shit man
That shit was dope
Hey yo Eazy
Wassup
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute and bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was Gangsta Gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that beat
Mothafucka say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr Big Stuff
Rock mothafucka like the hard three the hard way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
Ill throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yeah I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past mothafucka
Get busy yall yall yall yall
