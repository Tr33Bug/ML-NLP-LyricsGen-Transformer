Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the freaks clockin the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that bass
Mothafucker say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucka dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue


Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath started stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross coldknocked him out
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr big stuff
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped my 64 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum Beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas causin a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Get busy yall
Aw
You mothafucker
