A scandalous lil nigga with no heart to feel remorse
Dig the niggas corpse leave it on his mommas porch
Dont give a fuck about shit thats why Im mellow
Or maybe its the fact that Im kin to the Devil

Now later on that night as Im rollin
Lookin for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin at a light on the late night
Fire up a Philly blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all Im thinkin is a murder plan
Creepin through the drivethrough kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the 4 yo
Smokin on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin Im about to lay their ass down
Reach for who was fool make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the niggas dome now he sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat peep
I dumped on the lil skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about five blocks
Before I got stopped by a punkass cop  Shit fuck em 
You cant shoot a cop 
Fuck you shots
