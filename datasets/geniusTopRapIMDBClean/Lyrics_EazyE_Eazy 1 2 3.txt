A typical street corner ass nigga
Once a nigga always a nigga now a public figure
But I can still serve a mothafucka if I have to
Cuz Im slanging them thangs nigga
I roll deep with the crew oh a posse  Yeah 
Niggas cuttin throat Murder She Wrote for the EazyE fool
Fuck with the veteran still a better man than the next man
Then again  Uh  I can still put a chrome 9 to your dome
Po nigga po nigga no Milkbone
Yippiekiyay your ass back the fuck on home
Stay the fuck off the sherm and crack and Just Say No
My definition of a bitch nigga ah shit
Get pistol whipped need to sit down when he piss
Cause I beat em treat em fuck em like 1 2 3
The legend of gangster rap is EazyE
Still gangsta and Ruthless leaving mothafuckas toothless
I was high as the sky before I drew this
A nigga gone I guess I see you at the crossroads
A nigga with an attitude my name Phalos Mode

Yall dont want a death in the studio
Another scandal for media to handle  Uh 
Raised my 64 we livin on the road
Bang Los Angeles slang
Like a double barrel E pointed right at the game  Haha 
Big Loesta your SC smoke blower
None fucking with legends Eazy where the weapon
Cash is threatening kill a crossover
Jumped in the game and bitches slandered my name
Violence reporters the streets out of order  Order 
Projects corners and gangsters with fourdoors

Now what the fuck is worse than 1 punk nigga  Nigga 
2 punk niggas add em up and get the picture
Ones a fucking fag from the days and ones a busta
I was born a pimp a mack daddy and a hustla
You can take the nigga off the street
But you cant take the streets out the nigga
Once a nigga still a nigga
Fucking hoes and I do mean fucking steadily
I fucked your bitch  Uh  cause she was begging me
Your bitch aint nothin but a piece of cock to me
She dropped the drawers when she found out I was Eazy
She licked the balls and sucked the dick I came heavenly
Ooh get me ready E fuck me steadily
Why these niggas sippin Haterade Drinking on bitch KoolAid
For the name of Eazy niggas get sprayed
Im in my Lowrider and its candypaint
Stash spot for the Glock nigga think I aint
Im with a 55 gangsta with skrill
Big paper drill on the quest for mills
Now everybody say they thuggin
But when the gun blast seeing niggas running
I leave no witnesses
Punk niggas always tryna hate and they be always talking shit
But when they sober they all hesitate cause they dont know who they fucking with
Long live real gangsta shit and tell your ho to get off my dick
Cause we gone finish up the legacy and keep the family so legit
