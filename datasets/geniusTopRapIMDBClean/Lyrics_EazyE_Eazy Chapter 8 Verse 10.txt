Alright go 
This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10 and it reads
Its time to put some niggas in check
When you shoot a gun hot shells eject
Catch em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for fingerprints
You ask why am I like this
Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it how I know it just hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggas out frontin loitering and looting
Lets recreate a driveby shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray shotgun Mack10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of niggas
It was 9 just like the fuck they figured
Go around the corner come back real slow
Lights off cars in neutral rollin at a snails pace and creepin
Hoping to catch all of them sleepin
A socalled gang drugs and sex  NWA 
Start busting a cap and all the others jet 3 of em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scene with gunshot wounds
3 dead because Compton is scandalous
Id like to tell you brother ashes to ashes dust to dust  Amen 
Da da da
You will now witness the sound of TV AngAngAngels 
We will now pass around the hat 
Thats good enough 
No it aint you fucked up you fucked up  its cool 
No it aint
