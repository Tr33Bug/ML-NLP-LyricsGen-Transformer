He was once a thug from around the way
Eazy but you should
Bitch shut the fuck up get the fuck out of here
Yo Dre  Whats up  Give me a funky ass bassline
What the fuck is up
In the place to be
Coming on the mic is EazymothafuckinE
Dre is on the beat Yellas on the cut
So listen up close while we rip shit up
Well Im EazyE I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out the chute
EazyE motherfuckers cold knocking the boots
Cause Im a hiphop thugster  I used to be a mugster
If you heard  Dopeman  you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit I give him a  POW 
8 ball sipping the bitches are flipping
Slow down I hit a dip and continue my tripping
Hitting my switches collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats
Because Im a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now EazyDuzIt
I was   knocking muthafuckas out 
Whats your name boy 
Funky fresh EazyE 
Kick kick that shit 
Where you from fool   Compton   Yeah 


Rolling through the hood cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say whats up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know thats an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 247
Rolled them muthafuckas ate em up hit 11
Got another point I made a ten a fo
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo
Laughing in their faces and said youre all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat I knew he wouldnt last
So I said to myself homeboy you better think fast
He shot  gunshots  Then I shot  gunshots 
As you can see I cold smoked his ass  ha ha 
Because Im a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now EazyDuzIt
Wait a minute wait a minute who does it
Muthafuckin Eazy does it
But how does he do it 
Eazy duz it do it eazy thats what Im doing
Stop   Man whatcha gonna do now 
Now Ima break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker a sucker muthafucka
Hes addicted hes a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He mustve been starving cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now Im wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasnt shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the shit I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out Im gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said whats up
And said lets make a deal you know Ill do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do
Unloaded like hell cold smoked the ho
Because Im a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now EazyDuzIt
From around the way born in 73
Harcore Bboy named EazyE
Its 88 now 73s obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and a hundred percent street
And if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other Im a bad brother
Word to the muthafucka
