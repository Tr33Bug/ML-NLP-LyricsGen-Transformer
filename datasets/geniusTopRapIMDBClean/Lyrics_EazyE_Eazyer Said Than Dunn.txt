Yo man I dont think they heard you
Wont you tell em what ya name is
My name is Eazy yeah this is true
Keepin your attention is what Im gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin me my defin they say the boy goes off
Fillin up my memo with a touch of my rhyme
Suckers stayin with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because Im about to begin
And if you didnt hear me boy Ill tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But It doesnt really matter to me
Cause Im the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin
I just gotta keep cursin
This is for the radio so I better chill
They wont play it if I cold get ill
But Im like that and thats an actual fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I dont do dope but Im dope not a dope
But Im doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme Im displayin
And the beat thats playin
Yo you could try allday
And you still wont match up with the Ruthless POW
Cause Eazys doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo its easier said than done
Woo woo
Now its easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya dont ya might get lost
Im not a role model or a Dr Seuss yo Im a gangsta
And Im about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the EAZYE comma now thats drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
Im comin off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you dont need no glasses to stare
Itll probably take you in and its just like youre there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think Im a flip or slip dont even trip
Cause Im a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and thats my label
To get the money the women and cold bust the fat cables boy
Master Rhymes a toy
I mean straight while you suckin with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you dont even know me  Yo Ren 
Whassup
Get the gat show em where its at
And thats just the sound
And next time Im peelin your cap
To let you know where Im comin from
Eazy said it and it shall be done


Woo woo
Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
Eazyer Said Than Dunn yeah thats the title
Lovin the ladies only the fly ones ya know
But what if shes ugly
Eazy come Eazy go
Dont ask to battle me homeboy whats that
You wanna battle me Boy ya better be strapped
Cause where Im from it aint all about that playin
Now thats what Im sayin
Said before that I was born in 73
Now everybody wants to know the AGE
Girls on the tip fellas too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin I was only 15
The fellas would ignore me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do
I wish theyd let the ladies through
Cause the ladies I love em
Nice tender and soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
Im the real Eazy those others be fakin
Tryin to gain fame off the name Im makin
Sayin on your records you could get some
Yo homeboy its easier said than done
Woo woo
