Aw yeah lets take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and dont slip
On a funkydope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buddha sack and a 78 flak
Come clean gangsta lean I got green
But I serve dubs like it aint no thing
I hang with OG playaz dont set trip
Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I dont slack when it come to street
I kick real G funk to a gangsta beat
Its so sweet when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a flyass Benz
I make ends spend my dough on no ho
Thats how it is and thats how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them playaz that I know is real Gs
When I was just a baby
My mother told me Son always be a good boy
Dont ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin
I hang my head and cry
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a gster an OGster  Whos that 
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Dont need no punk fools payin me
And broke groupies and hoochies dont faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I dont brag but I tell it like it straight up is
Before you do a record partner handle your business
And dont get caught slippin on the under
Or you might wonder  Whats up with them ends G 
I call a spade a spade and get paid
Gs show the way so I give love to em
EAZY must I
Chase the cat and be a dog a straight up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my record bumpin on the Compton street
That OG PIMP and Loc G and Loc
HipHop thugsta so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt fool I do work
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Thats how it is when it come to me
Cuz Im the short but wicked playa named Eazy
Women cant play me some say Im crazy
But I dont think so come if youre a loco
I gives a damn about a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
But dont trip gives my dough to no ho
Thats how it is I got no love for ya
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime  Thats right fool 
If you got love for them hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough  Hooooo 
If you got love for them playas
Let me hear you say ooooh ladies we want you  Ooooooh 
If you got love for them straight Gs
And you wanna be down just scream  Heeeeeeey
