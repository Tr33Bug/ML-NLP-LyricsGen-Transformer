I got beat for the street
To pump in ya jeep
Or in ya caravan wit tha homies kinda deep
Smokin on a thai stick feelin kinda high wit
Ya passenger seat occupied by a fly bitch
Rollin in your lolo
Cutlass or your MC
Slap in the hiphop
To hell with the Temprees
Modern day gangsta from the underground yeah
Niggas roll around wit the boomin ass sound
Got the 64 kinda low as we bouncing
On the Grapevine rollin deep to Magic Mountain
Hoes on ya jock everytime ya hit a corner
Because ya rollin twisted on the gold Daytonas
Frontin on the regular talkin on ya cellular
Actin like ya dont hear the little bitches yellin ya
