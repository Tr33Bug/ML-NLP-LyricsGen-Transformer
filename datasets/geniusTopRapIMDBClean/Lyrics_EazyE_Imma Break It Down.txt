My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the hihat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy that
The E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So thats how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental thats recorded
Step on stage and Im suddenly awarded
Some sort of trophy like a plaque
And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
Takin a bow cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo its Eazy on top even though Im short
Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Dont attempt the laugh Im not a pranksta
Im serious create sounds so quit playin around
Cause Ima break it down
Last time I was takin my time with this
But other suckas were makin a rhyme with this
I had to change the tempo or make it hyper
But they was rotten I was gettin riper
Ready to go like never before
Givin you more because Im ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin me destroy the suckas that soften
Curin diseases my rhyme pleases throw it a key
Balls havin seasons this is a doctrine
And Im locked in and I made up my mind
And I think Im gonna rock then
You got bitches chill and Ima push ya
To freeze after Ill cut ya cause Ima butcher
And say ya have pricin and then out ya go
Cause a percentage on pork bellies are very low
Messin with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
Im not a lawman but Im a raw man
But ya the dopest one I ever saw man
I keep droppin it pound for pound
And when Im on the mic I always throw down
To keep yall dancin to my funky sound
So listen up cause Ima break it down
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent experience or a trade
And compliments for the rhyme thats made
Top song of the day is this one
So pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
Cause I dont need water to clear my throat
Comin from the rain the show is like dancin
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin
Wantin to get wit me this routine
Keepin it sprung still stayin mean
Can ya dis this man I dont think so
Once I start writin the way I let the ink go
Comin out with songs like hit after hit
Cause this is legit and yours aint shit
Makin it sound so dope cause Im a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin away like if I was on a sax
Doin a solo in the shade Im a spotlight
Relax and chill while your uptight
Pumpin up the funky sounds
Yo you should know its kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down
