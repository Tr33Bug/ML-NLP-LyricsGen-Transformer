Todays a good day to die  screaming 
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts nigga suck on these nuts
I tell em bowwowwow yippieyo yippieyay
Suck on these nuts nigga suck on these nuts

That punk nigga Dre still pays me
Well if its on motherfucker then its on G
Now if its on motherfucker then its on G
Hey mister prankster prankster
Story book gangsta
Back in 86 you wore the pumps and mascara
Down with the motherfuckin Wreckin Cru bitch
But once a bitch is always a bitch and now the fuckin switch
Fag with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin Locs in a G ride
What set you from punk what set you from ride
Rip Van Winkle sleepin nigga woke up and became a G
But you still dont impress the Eazy
Smoke a lil sherm now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the westside call it bionic
I make a mil here make a mil there
Fuck a bitch here fuck a bitch there yeah

Old nigga EazyE went to the cupboard
To get Snoop Doggy Dogg a bone motherfucker

Or should I say a H a I a J a K a LMNOP
P for the pussy wussy wuffin nigga broke
As a motherfuckin joke
Talkin about you wanna smoke
The E to the AZY
Nigga this east side
Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg you wanna try
187 on the E that you sing
But you cling on my balls when I swing my dingaling
Yeah ya got more juice like a plant of puppy water
First Im gonna choke ya
Then I smoke ya then Im gonna
Toss you in the back of my trunk
With the other punk
Smoking Death Row like I smoke a Phillie Blunt
If its on motherfucker then its on G

Still a nigga once a nigga always a nigga down from the getgo
Never let go never flossin
Never slippin never trippin stickin
Dick and my balls down your throat doggy listen
Niggas from the LBC they never heard of ya G
And niggas from the CPT aint down with DRE
But you gave it up still like a trooper
Let em play your jam shake your hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast and the midwest
But In LA you still cant pass the test
See I can tell a pussy when I see one
Dre wearing lip stick that mean ya have to be one
You need to change your sex and your occupation
You try to fuck with E nigga run run run
