Its that man comin up from that land of tha CPT
Whats my motherfuckin name  Snoop  EazyE
Comin thru with a big lick for 94
Showin alla yall them trueass gangsta flows
So bowdown bowwow the big dogs in town
And them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laidback as I blow a fat sack
Hittin switches for them bitches bendin corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
With the E to the AZY
That nigga makin more off yo hits than you do
You fools need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin to speak up on tha OG nigga you dont know me
Break em off these nuts lil wannabe
Cause I peel caps if need be
And aint nothin you gonna bring dont see me
Just to let you know
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
Its the E comin up from the gank
So nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz aint nuthin on my mind but them chips
Gotta have a griff run a nigga dip
Back to the past on the Compton streetz
Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin mad coz they cant ride like I ride
Front n back dippin side to side
And its been like that since I was BG
Its the E thats what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad isnt really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin done like a two dollar ho
Its just a lil something from the E tah let U know
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
Its still the CPT nothin more nothin less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Cause them bustaass niggas cant see what Im sayin
They think the E be playin 
But I aint givin up nuthin but this Glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o gin Aint no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin
With the original Compton criminal
Coz the only thing poppin is a snaps
And aint no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
But a nigga like the E aint trippin though
Im just here to let you niggas know
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the COMPTON
Just to let you know
Just to let you know 
You have your own freedom of choice
So you do what the fuck you feel like doin
Take it from me that streetwise motherfucker named EazyE
