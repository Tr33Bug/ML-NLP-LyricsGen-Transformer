Aw shit lets take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff to this and dont slip
On a funkyass track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack in a 78 Lac
Come clean gangsta lean I got green
Bud I serve dubs like it aint no thing
I hang with OG niggas dont set trip
Or you might get a slug in your fuckin back
I dont slack when it come to street
I kick real G shit to a gangsta beat
Its so sweet when you got money to spend
I got a coolass tilt and a flyass Benz
I make ends spend my dough on no ho
Thats how it is and thats how it goes
Act like you know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them niggas that I know is real Gs
If you got love for dem gangstas
Let me hear you one time
If you down for the crime  Thats right fool 
If you got love for dem hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo
If you makin straight dough  hooooo 
If you got love for dem playas
Let me hear you say ooooh ladies we want you  ooooooh 
If you got love for dem straight Gs
Let me hear you mothafuckas just scream  heeeeeeey 
The ruthless network driveby expert
Straight outta Compton kickin up dust
The ruthless network driveby expert
Straight outta Compton
Dumpdump on a nigga with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a Gster an OGster
Whos that  A real nigga named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Dont need no punk niggas payin me
And broke groupieass bitches dont faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinumass cuts on the record shelf
I dont brag but I tell it like it straight up is
Before you do a record nigga handle your business
And dont get caught slippin on the under
Or you might wonder  Whats up on dem ends nigga 
I call a spade a spade and get paid
Gs show the way so I give love to em
If you got love for dem gangstas
Let me hear you one time
If you down for the crime  Thats right fool 
If you got love for dem hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo
If you makin straight dough  hooooo 
If you got love for dem playas
Let me hear you say ooooh ladies we want you  ooooooh 
If you got love for dem straight Gs
Let me hear you mothafuckas just scream  heeeeeeey

Chase the cat and be a dog A straightup hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my shit bumpin on a Compton street

Straight to the dirt fool I do work
Nobody move nobody get hurt
