Perched up high on a rooftop
Like a bird Im havin evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at its own pace
Sometimes I feel like a superhero
Urgin to free my kind
Im so accurate
I shoot ya heart through a dime
Now Im back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin with the present slavery
Im here to save you but whos to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put my finger on the button then the sight I check
I make the kill heres the deal
After the triggers pulled then the death is sealed
So its the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyones scared Im the neighborhood sniper
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Boom boom boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa boom boom boom boom
Boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
And simply scared the bitch  Boo 
Being the E ya know Im thinkin devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now theres nothing left but a snitch
Heres a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One  two  three strikes youre out
This nigga is dead and now Im lookin for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
Duckin to an alley so they dont recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin scared of the neighborhood sniper


They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Boom boom boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa boom boom boom boom
Boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa
Im doin dirt by myself as I continue my mission
Killin all fools as an addiction
As the E lovin the game leavin a shame
And in my heart I feel no motherfuckin pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And with my AK47 I stand bold
Rippin up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Poppoppow as I watch the motherfucker drop
Lovin the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph to keep in my hall of thrills
Im stayin calm and never hyper
As I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Some of them bust them pieces some of them run up to get that leakleak
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Boom boom boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa boom boom boom boom
Boom boom had to murda em
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa
They say that some of them bust them pieces and some of them run up to get that leakleak
Boom boom had to murda em
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa
Some of them bust them pieces some of them run up to get that leakleak
Boom boom had to murda em
Yaa
Everybody else everybody else Imma shoot to kill ya
Boom boom had to murda em
