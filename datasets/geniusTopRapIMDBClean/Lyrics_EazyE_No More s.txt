Were sitting here with EazyE
Believe that
How are you doing
Alright
So Eazy tell me how was your life as a youngster
Ruthless my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin I specialized in gankin
Whites Mexicans brothers and others
Daily its all about comin up
Makin sure no punks are runnin up
Because Im a gangsta havin fun
Strapped with a gat when Im walkin through Compton
Terrible I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang sold undercover
Call a girl out a name yo I aint no lover
Im a pimp mack daddy lookin for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a sixfour Impala
Rollin and runnin from the police
Brother dont you know you cant trust a thief
Or thug convict hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open gank for your stereo
Hard and raw no regard for the law
EazyE were you ever caught slipping Hell nah
Just trippin off 8ball
And girls aint nothin but female dogs to me
Bitches Im sorry for that burst
Its in my nature I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin on my nerves
You get beat ganked broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you dont like it I really dont give a damn
Hmm I see so youre rather violent
Sometimes
Okay what would be the situation when you socall gank someone
Waitin for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and its locked so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside I start takin
Cause you know its no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get front and center
Or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly but no runnin
Shh I think somebodys comin
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall dont fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
Gettin ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions


Yes as a matter of fact there is
Have you ever been involved in like an armed robbery or a holdup
You mean a twoeleven
Yeah
Theres a store but dont point
Walk inside case the joint
One man behind the counter another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask heres the task
Go in broke come out with cash
Were you slick Yeah you gotta be cunnin
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin
Walked in said This is a robbery
Didnt need the money its just a hobby
Fill the bag homeboy dont lag
I want money beer and a pack of ZigZags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against EazyE but he took one
Fell to the floor so I run
Back to the bucket then I said Punch it
Took the gun and then dumped it
Im not like Robin Hood cause I want more
Steal from the rich hang with the poor
My pockets are fat you see it dont matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true I dont lie
You see Im not Mr Nice Guy
Oh so youre not exactly a role model
Not exactly
And for your listeners what does Eazy think of himself
Bad and bold you cant get with this
Those that tried youre on my shit list
Cant be caught sought or fought
Taught and damn its your fault
Down and dirty from the CPT
NWA and EazyE
One more before we end this session
Whats your real age No more questions
