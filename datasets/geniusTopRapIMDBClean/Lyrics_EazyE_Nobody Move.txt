EazyE Yo Ren youre ready to go get this money
MC Ren Believe that boy
EazyE Youre strapped
MC Ren Yeah you know it
EazyE Lets go do this shit man I got it all planned out
MC Ren Yeah shoot any motherfucker that moves
Alright everybody
This is a stickup everybody get facedown
Ren gag their mouths so they cant make a sound
Tie em up for the fact that Im kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat and Im tempted to blast
My name is Eazy but I go the hard way out
This aint personal but now Im about
To commit a crime and go through it
You know what no need for shaking because Im used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah hes wearing a badge but hes a old ass man
Pop his ass in the head and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang just cant be seen
Lock the doors and throw away the key
Close the blinds so no motherfuckers could see
And smile you know cause Im controling of the shit
And no sucker ass niggas gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs and a Ruthless shirt
That means Im ready to work and rush a fool to the dirt so
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Alright anybody move and Ill blow your fucking head off
Alright empty your pockets but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fucking floor
Dont make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
Im in a bank and its a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dicks on hard
Laughing at the dumbass security guard
Whos tied up for the moment not saying a word
I should have known it before the motherfuckers a nerd
But back to the bitches Im peepin
And then untie the hoe so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch with a gun in her back
I said Lay down and unbutton your bra
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said Damn then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick
I said Damn dropped the gat from my hand
What I thought was a bitch was nothing but a man 
Put the gat to his legs all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt so
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
I said get down I want you all facedown on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot 
Stacking up the money and theres more to collect
Cause I dont give a fuck I take travellers cheques
Yo Ren peep out the window and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me what to do now
Hurry up and get armed
Alright tell me who hit the motherfucking alarm
Imma give ya a chance and count to three
Or else five of yall bitches are comin with me
Alright Alright come on out niggas or were coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in 
Fuck you we got hostages and plenty of loot
And dont give a damn and not afraid to shoot
Were sending out the hostages all except five
And if you dont meet our demands they wont stay alive
We want a copter so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
They shot a hostage they shot a hostage 
You stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now youre dead as fuck trying to race a gun
Alright this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast 
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages running and chokin
Gettin away but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they dont think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldnt fire the shit wouldnt work
So yall know what time it is
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Nobody move nobody get hurt
Well Im giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or Im gonna shoot two of your guards 
Hehe they got me once but theyll never get me again
