Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
Cause a nigga never know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
Cause I dont wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that never gave a fuck about me droppin phony tears
I hope Im in the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin all night
