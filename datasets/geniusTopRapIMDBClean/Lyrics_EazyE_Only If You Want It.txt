Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Can I get an eye open up
Eazy locin up smokin up
Much dust like a nut what
Give it up for the real stuff
Shut the what up
Back to shut up what
Hustler from the hood ho
Hopping in my trunk
The finishing touches
Would show what rough is
Coming in bunches
Could serve like lunches
Hold ya horses heres where the source is
Not very tall but never took a short kid
With a clip to claw
Quick Draw McGraw
I trick a law before all and all Im raw
A naughty shorty sporty with a forty
A lordy taking tours just to plan an orgy
A nasty critter any ho hitter
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldnt let me hit her
Now get up on it on and on get on it
And I will pump it only if you want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Heres something from the dingdong
Cause I really care how long ya been strong grown
Here comes permastoned cone
Couldnt hang with the king of the records
But I call for a yes yall toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I push a record through a heifer just like woody wooder
And if I left then that means that I shouldve booger
Heres a new track for all the new jacks
Im kicking it the hardest so gimme my shoes back
So I limp when I step its the pimp
And I rep Mr Right and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it on and on get on it
And I will pump it only if you want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Ooh A new jack A new jack
Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack here comes a witty black
Enemies go hide Im bout to show why
Eazys peeling caps cause my gats in the low ride
Bang when the gat speaks two in the backseat
My homie rides shotgun waiting to spot one
Duz is a fool who dont run duck dive and slide to a ride
Im shudder shaking the place when I start hey
So dont butter me EazyE but a Parkay
The only thing the flow needs now to be fly is a feather
I see the smiling faces in wilding places
You know me better hard rotty kid
Killed Cali kid now you know it boy
Left up in the alley dead
Now get up on it on and on get on it
And I will pump it only if you want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
