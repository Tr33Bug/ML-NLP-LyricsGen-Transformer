Ahh real Compton city Gs
Ahh real Compton city Gs
Ahh real Compton city Gs
Ahh real Compton city Gs
Hey yo Doctor heres another proper track
And its phat watch the sniper time to pay the piper
And let that real stuff provoke
See yous a wannabe loc and youll get smoked and I hope
That the fans understand when you talk about sprayin me
The same records that you makin is payin me
Mf Dre Mf Snoop Mf Death Row
Yo and here comes my left blow
Cause Im the EAZYE and this is the season
To let the real Compton city Gs in
Youre like a kid you found a pup and now youre dapper
But tell me where the hell you found that anorexic rapper
Talkin about who you gon squabble with and who you shoot
Youre only sixty pounds when youre wet and wearin boots
Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day 
But Dre Day only meant Eazys payday
All of a sudden Dr Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a shethang
So sucka please suck please
Dont step to these real Compton city Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now
Every day its a new rapper claimin to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a girl but portray the role of gangsta
Aint broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the brother and youll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of homies in Compton Watts and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me whos a witness to your damn work
So you never had no bidness so save the drama jerk
Brothers straight kill me knowin that they pranksters
This is goin out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt put in work and many brothers can vouch that
And since I got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But brother like you I gotta hate ya
Cause Im just tired of suburbia brothers
Talkin about they come from projects
Knowin you aint seen no parts of the streets G
I think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little  tried to sag but youre floodin at the same time
And your set dont accept ya scared to kick it with your homies
Cause you know they dont respect ya
So brother please brother please
Dont step to these real Compton city Gs


Well its the Knocc Out definition Original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard little busta Ima bank ya
Shank ya with my damn shank if I have to
Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters studio gangstas busters
But this time youre dealin with some real ass brothers
Gs fools please dont try to step
See if you do then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young brotherss like me will break you off somethin
Claimin my city  but Dre you aint from Compton
Suckers like yall is what I call wannabes
And aint shit compared to real Compton city Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now
I never met a OG who never did nothing wrong
You tried to diss the EazyE so now sucka its on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that yall hoggin it
Both of you brothers can come and suck my doggys 
Beatin up a girl dont make you it but then again
Some brothers think it makes a man
Damn its a trip how Dre could switch so quick
From wearin lipstick to smokin on  at picnics
And now you think youre bigger
But to me you aint nothin but a trackass busta
That aint worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you gettin treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeants directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith  Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and dont step to real Compton city Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now Eazy Duz It
