Compton
Compton
Compton
Compton
Compton
Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Hey Yo doctor heres another proper track
And its phat watch the sniper time to pay the piper
And let that real stuff provoke so yous a wannabe loc
And youll get smoked and I hope that the fans understand
When ya talk about playin me
The same records that you making is paying me
Dre
Snoop
Death Row
Yo and here comes me left blow
Cause Im the EAZYE and this is the season
To let the Real Compton City Gs in
Your like a kid you found it bumping down the dapper
But tell me where the hell you found that anorexic rapper
Talking about who you gon squabble with and who you shoot
Youre only 60 pounds when your wet and wearing boots
Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day 
But Dre Day only met Eazys pay day
All of a sudden Dr Dre is a G thang
But on his old album cover he was a she thing
So sucker please sucker please dont step to these Real Compton City Gs
Stomp him in his track
Show him that Im ruthless
Every day it a new rapper claiming to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a girl but portray the role of gangsta
Aint broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap about the guns and knives
Just take a good look at the brother and youll capture the fact that the bastard is
Simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the Mental
Of homies in Compton Wattz and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse you claim to do the dirt
But tell me whos a witness to your fucking work
See you never had no business so save the drama jerk
Brothers straight kill me knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt put in work and many brothers can vouch that
So since I got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But brothers like you I gotta hate you
Im just tired of suburbian brothers talking about they come from projects
Knowing you aint seen no parts of the streets G
I think you start trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme little 
Tried to sag but you fronting at the same time
And your set dont accept you
Scared to kick it witcha homies cause ya know they dont respect you
So brother please brother please dont step to these Real Compton City Gs
Well its the Knock Out definition original baby gangster
Approach me like you hard little buster
Im bank ya
Shank ya with my damn shank if i have ta
Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters studio gangsters busters
But this time your dealing with some real last brothers
Gs fool please dont try to step
See if you do then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young brothers like me will break ya off somthing
Claiming my city but Dre you aint from Compton
Niggas like Dogg is what I call wanna bes and aint nothing compared to Real Compton City Gs
Stomp him in his track and
Show him that Im ruthless
I never met an OG who never did nothing wrong
You tried to dis the EazyE so now sucker its on you
And your Doggy Dogg think that yall hogging it
Both of you tricks can come and suck my doggy 
Beating up a woman dont make you it
But then again some brothers think it makes a man
Damn its a trip how Dre can switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on  at picnics
And now you think your bigger
But to me you aint nothing but trick ass buster
That aint worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear your getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeants directions
Or get yo ass popped with a Smith and Wesson
Learn a lesson from the E
Stay in your place and dont step to Real Compton City Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre Whats up bang
Boy ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  whats up  Bang
Boy ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  whats up  bang
Boy you should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  whats up  bang
Boy you should have known by now
