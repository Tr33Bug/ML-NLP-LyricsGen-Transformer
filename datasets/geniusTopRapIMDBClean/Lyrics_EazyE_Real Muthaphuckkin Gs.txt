Compton Compton Compton
Ah real motherfuckin Gs
Ah real motherfuckin Gs
Ah real motherfuckin Gs
Ah real motherfuckin Gs
Ayo Doctor heres another proper track
And its fat watch the sniper time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See yous a wannabe Loc and youll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin me
The same records that you makin is payin me
Motherfuck Dre Motherfuck Snoop Motherfuck Death Row
Yo and here comes my left blow
Cause Im the EAZYE and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin Gs in
Youre like a kid you found a pup and now youre dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin bout who you gon squabble with and who you shoot
Youre only sixty pounds when youre wet and wearin boots
Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazys payday
All of a sudden Dr Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album covers he was a shethang
So nigga please nigga please
Dont step to these motherfuckin real Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
Boy you shouldve known
Every day its a new rapper claimin to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Aint broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and youll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton Watts and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me whos a witness to your fuckin work
So you never had no business so save the drama jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin that they pranksters
This is goin out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you I gotta hate ya
Cause Im just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin about they come from projects
Knowin you aint seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag but youre floodin at the same time
And your set dont accept ya scared to kick it with your homies
Cause you know they dont respect ya
So nigga please check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin real Gs


Well its the Knocc Out definition Original baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard motherfucker Ima bank ya
Shank ya with my fuckin shank if I have to
Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin actors
Pranksters studio gangstas busters
But this time youre dealin with some real motherfuckers
Gs nigga please dont try to step
Cause if you do then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you off somethin
Claimin my city  but Dre you aint from Compton
Niggas like yall is what I call wannabes
And aint shit compared to real motherfuckin Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre  Whats up 
I never met a OG who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the EazyE so now nigga its on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that yall hoggin shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin up a bitch dont make you shit but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn its a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin lipstick to smokin on chronic at picnics
And now you think youre bigger
But to me you aint nothin but a bitchass nigga
That aint worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you gettin treated like bootcamp
Gotta follow your sergeants directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith  Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and dont step to real motherfuckin Gs
