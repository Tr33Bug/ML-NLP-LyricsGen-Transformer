Cruel gangsta shit

Then comes the Eazy to the other fuckin E
Playin niggas life like a puppet

Rappers wanna diss Im glad to see em

And dont want a bitch if she cant rub the balls like a gypsy

Motherfuck what ya heard Im more than that
A real nigga from the hood and Im all of that
Thick as a hicky
A picky nigga fittin dickies with bitches strictly dickly
Many sets I rolled on
And killed squeals that told on my homies and so on
Dont ask Eazy shit
And still a hit is a hit and a bitch is a bitch
Hangin on my nuts like a hair strand
Hangin there with nan heart and nan plan
Ass out like an asshole
Runnin to my dick with a rhyme and a lasso
Again and again
From beginning to end its my nuts on your chin

Like shots to your dome
Killin off hella coppers get dropped in the home
With the bangers and drug slangers that cocked on the chrome
Hangin out of the Caprices in SC streets with
Curb servin head jerkin legs squirtin out your back
Feds hurt without the strap
Throw up the fleet snap your limbs in a heat
Helicopter toppler dropping the breeze
Poppin the thieves for my knots in the streets
And the blocks and the priest
Eager to pump and leave ya
What you need is a real heat seeker
Dig in the bass up in the state dick in your face
If you tripping get banged by them black plate
Cracked the safe Im comin out of your space
Like an atom bomb rippin your steak
Runnin your lips they got sniff for your pain
By these LEGs nailin the fleas
Tryna escape cause you feel the gauge pump and the squeeze
That ruthless life  Life  life is what we live
Thats how we live nigga
Gimmie that gangsta shit  That gangsta shit that gangsta shit 
That ruthless life  Life  is what we live

This for the scene for the hot four money getters
For the dope dealers for the big hitters
For my datin diners for the regal bidness
My instrumental killers are real niggas
My no talent niggas hands on your triggers
This where the peace meet the fatal realistical
And where the hard shit meet the radio
Niggas tastin the chrome niggas taste the flow
The street game is so motherfuckin heinous
Gangsta my head rest LEG vest

Street life end in cocaine whats next
Hopping with the hotters killing with the best
Leaving the scene wet crime elements
Take his money clips his dogs and his ribs
Entertainers where all this damn entertainment
Gagging the fool on the day  Raymond
Gangsta shit legends in the mix
From SC to the CPT
Coming to take mine he just took nine
Scratch material we came for the dough
