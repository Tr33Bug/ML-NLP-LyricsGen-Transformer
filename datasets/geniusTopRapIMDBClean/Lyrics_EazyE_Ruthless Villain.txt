Ruthless gangsta definition villain
Leave your shit unlocked and its stealin
So call tha police cause thats all you could do but
Hell get away without leavin a clue
Keepin shit in control like the neighborhood chief but
Referred to as a walking thief
They say hes a bad influence for the kids on the block
Why the fuck they blamin him Hes the one that they jock
Keepin niggas in line whoever fucks with his rhyme
And before you fuck with him you gotta fuck with his nine
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga
He could whoop his ass cause hes bigger
Size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool
Hes a villain from the streets and hes supposed to rule
Not sayin hes in shit but hes down for mine
He was put on the streets to keep niggas in line
Never givin a fuck  jealous of E
Because I know that hes a nigga that you want to be
He cant help it hes in shit but he dont hold shit back
Hes a gangsta in black and hes about to attack


Cause Im a ruthless villain cold tearin shit up
Dont come on my face pumpin no kind of junk
EazyEs in control and if you press your luck
Ill smoke you like that and wont give a fuck
Nickname EazyEOl 8Ball junkie
Ruthless gangsta definition villain
You can lock up yo shit hes still stealin
Gettin respect cause the boy kicks butt
But the real meaning is he dont give a fuck
Its EazyE in the crowd but hes not in the 4
I tell his money flow as he collects from his ho
All expenses paid for the rhymes that he made
Gold trophies in the house for the girls that he laid
Not a wimp hes a pimp now of course hes the boss
So keep your bitch out his face or else shes gonna get tossed
Too hard to be fucked with the boy got heart
Wanna fuck with him hell rip your head apart
Gangsta Gangsta thats what they yellin
But him with his gangsta stroll he keeps bailin
Wherever he goes theres no discussion but silence
They say that hes the one promotin gang violence
Thats a lie just a critic all that whack bullshit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin with
Cause Im a ruthless villain cold tearin shit up
Dont come on my face pumpin no kind of junk
EazyEs in control and if you press your luck
Ill smoke you like that and wont give a fuck
