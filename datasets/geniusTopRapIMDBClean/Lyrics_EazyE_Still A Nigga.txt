Straight off the streets of Compton
Dedicated and by most suckers hated
But I got something I want you motherfuckers to know
I really dont give a fuck
laughing
Niggas aint shit in the 90s I dont trust em
And bitches on my dick but they aint shit so motherfuck em
Eazy knows whats up cause see he really dont give a fuck
Cause it dont concern me if dont pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times out of ten bout some ends or some skins
Cause Im the type of nigga that gotta have it like a rabbit
Rappin is my hustle bustin hos is a habbit
I stab it like a true no good nigga should
I do it the way a down OG nigga would
And now niggas know Eric Wright aint no busta
Another platinum cut from the Compton thugsta

Still rollin in my 64 on them thizangs
Do wicked shit cause shit is wicked on the streets
And from what my eyes see the wickedness will never cease
Bitches on my dick and you know Im runnin yall
So you just sold your soul to the motherfuckin devils soninlaw

Niggas talk shit so I talk a lot of shit too
Niggas wanna diss fuck them and their whole crew
In fact niggas thank ya for stockin a niggas bank up
