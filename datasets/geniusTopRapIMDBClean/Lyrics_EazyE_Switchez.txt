Eazy muthafuckin E
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin in my 64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin block
Now when I hit that switch Im bouncin
More bounce to the ounce
And Im clownin
Keep the gat in my lap
Cuz Im fully strapped
For the car jackers
Fuck no hapsters

Plus a AK47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven peep
Nigga I dont sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
You try creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast til I blast no mo

Straight callin my city
Niggas be winnin and gettin busy
Wit a tizy
Through my city
Chalk lines hang
Niggas bang
Chevys swang like it aint no thang
The gangs bang
So nigga tuck your chain
And try to duck this thang
End up puffin one stuck in you brain
To refrain from this game of stressin
Smokin on water
And fin to bang your daughter
All up in the Best Western

Non stop on the ROC
Like the way she made me scream

Old nigga E still cruisin
Punk stay up on the nuts and the bone
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out of his teeth
The muthafucka should have stayed his ass home
Hey yo peep them bitchez in the Honda
4 deep with the proper ass sounds
Now every time that I meet a fine cute bitch
She got a friend from the fuckin Dog Pound
Hey yo bitch
Heres the seven digits
Call me if you can
Only if you want it
Let a nigga know
Can I dig like a miner 49er
Diggin for gold from behind her
Watch this nigga do some diggin
Pop that pussy on a platter
Watch this nigga do some diggin
Loose or tight it doesnt matter
