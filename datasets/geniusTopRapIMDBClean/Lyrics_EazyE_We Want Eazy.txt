Ayo Ren lets do this
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin out the sound that Eazy is throwin down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin a way with dope style
Yo Eazy what ya gotta say
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy Es on the set hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother whos smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal  Otherwise known as a villain
Because Im ruthless when I spot a sucka I kill em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo its obvious tell em who you came to see

EAZY

Alright
Yeah cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you wont strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that its done I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin a girl dreamin
Just to get a picture of me n my BOYZ
From the HdoubleOD
NWA down with me
Strong n Im ragin
Turn the page n
See Im not a son of a gun
Im a gauge n
Nuthin can avoid this shot cause its hittin
Its so cool when you touch it wear a mitten
Im comin off raw into ya speaker
Makin the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo its obvious tell em who you came to see
EAZY
Yo man you werent born in no 73
Why you be lyin bout your age
EazyE 
Man why you gotta bring that up
Yo get this fool outta here
Hey Eazy why you always cussin on your records
EazyE 
Who are you Gene Autry or somethin
I just do that to get my point across
Now I wanna know who you came to see
EAZY
Aw never Im just too clever
So in fact that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned then I jet
To make another hit for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it
EAZY
We want Eazy
