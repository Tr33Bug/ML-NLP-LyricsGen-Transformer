New year new money then the call dropped
New year new money let them drawers drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Cause them real niggas aint haters

And baby I could help your situation
No top smokin medication
This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin
I told em get money thats the best solution
When you do wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style I aint stress the boostin
