I cut my bitch off when the ball drop
Haan  whoa whoa whoa

Hatin hoes aint happy

Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
Haan Whoa whoa whoa  haan Whoa whoa whoa 
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New year new money then the call dropped
New year new money let them drawers drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Cause them real niggas aint haters
And them hatin niggas aint real
And baby I could help your situation
No top smokin medication


This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin
I told em get money thats the best solution
When you do wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style I aint stress the boostin
Its time to make more money less excuses
My old bitch on death row its time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass she the best since Boosie

Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin at  ba ba ba 
V with hundred on the Lincoln  bling 
3 quarter mink blew the top off Lincoln God  haan 
Niggas scared to play it like jail or Richard Mellor  Mellor 
I hope I never Tom Heller die  die 
Scramble like a dope fiend  dope mean 
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin  ahh
