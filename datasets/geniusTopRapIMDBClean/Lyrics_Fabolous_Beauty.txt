A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
The debris of beauty flickers
In the sadness of a smile
Its the perfection of your imperfection
Beautys when you just got out the shower
Hair still dripping wrapped up in a towel
Beautys when you ready in a hour
Them long legs I call em the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it put your hand on your hip
Put your hair in a bun and you handle the shit
Beautys when the strut compliments sass
You know ya booty look good with ya confident ass  shit 
Straight up but the rest swerve
You know its beauty when the smile is her best curve
Thats real beauty no makeup shit
The girl you dream about and wanna wake up with
Wait until Im looking then you throw it at me
Go down on me then you look up at me
Awhh man that shit right there
Probably give your ex nightmares
Miss Brooklyn New York
Ill give you whatever to get to your heart
Know your worth baby girl love
This Soul Tape shit
Never make shift all naturale
Put it down
Young Ralph lets get it
Beauty is knowing nobodys real as you
Truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
Killing the scene this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies she be the cuisine
When Im her jeans Im still in tune with the inner being
Her inner thoughts her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
Cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
For she I get super deep maybe speed up
Before I pull out and sex is a weapon
But beauty dont need a bullet
Beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
May you be guarded by God me and grandmamas angels
Its God given never complicated
A lot of niggas talking I dont have the heart to say it
The heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth
When niggas dont notice your beauty truly
You see beauty isnt a rush
Its a process sometimes its slow
Yeah I mean theres beauty in everything ya know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do
And I feel sorry for the people who dont
Soul Tape
