Breathe oh
Woo woo woo
Breathe
One and then the two  Two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
Then you gotta  gasp  then you gotta  gasp 
Yo these niggas cant breathe when I come through Hum 2
Some shoes gotta be twenty man its not even funny
They cant  Breathe  the chokeholds too tight
The left looks too right you know what You right
These bitches cant  Breathe  look look they hearts racing
They start chasing but Im so fast when I blow past
That they cant  Breathe  in the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better  Breathe 
You niggas cant share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And Im getting better year by year like they say wine do
Cops couldnt smell me if you brought the K9s through
And I pace myself
I know these moneyhungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em on a diet
Embrace they health or either keep em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got em grabbing they chest
Cause its hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
Theyd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the Bach
And I aint just laying a verse Im saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone cant leave the dick alone
So I know its one of them every time I flip my phone
Breathe
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
One and then the two  Two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
Then you gotta  gasp  then you gotta  gasp 
Yo these niggas cant breathe when I come through Hum 2
Some shoes gotta be twenty man its not even funny
They cant  Breathe  the chokeholds too tight
The left looks too right you know what You right
These bitches cant  Breathe  look look they hearts racing
They start chasing but Im so fast when I blow past
That they cant  Breathe  in the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better  Breathe 
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen maskes
I make it hard to  Breathe  but I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to  Breathe  they has to react
Like having an asthma attack when they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe breezing at 90
Thats the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
Im a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it til your face get blue
And then  Breathe 
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
One and then the two  Two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
Then you gotta  gasp  then you gotta  gasp 
Yo these niggas cant  Breathe  when the crew walk in it
Pop a few corks in it as quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath fore you catch a left even worse catch a Tef
Only way you catch an F to the AB
Its in the MayB rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you wont find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya they gon have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed And it wont stop
Til they inhale your seed and it dont stop
Til I tell em to breathe like a doctor with a stethoscope
I dont see no fucking hope unless these motherfuckers  Breathe 
Yeah Brooklyn gotta  Oh  Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta Queens gotta  Breathe 
Staten Island gotta you niggas gotta
You bitches gotta everybody  Breathe 
One and then the two  Oh two  two and then the three  Three 
Three and then the four  Four  then you gotta breathe  Breathe 
Then you gotta then you gotta
Breathe
