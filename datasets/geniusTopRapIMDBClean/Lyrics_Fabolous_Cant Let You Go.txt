Uh uh uh
Baby girl you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you dont put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
Shes my pinch hitter
When the startin lineup aint playin right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like Im gassin ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin that we dont sleep on the weekend
Wifeys a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
Itll be alright if yall bump heads itll be a fight  Mmm 
But I said itll be alright cmon
I really wanna be wit you  Be wit you 
But I gotta be real wit you  Real wit you 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
Youre the one I want in my life  Want in my life 
I already got a wife  Got a wife 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
You aint never step outta line or get outta pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you Ill get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket  Oh 
You gon play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page weekly ring
Plus you aint too shy to do them freaky things
I aint gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry bout you tellin the whole world Im your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin I denied
Somethin I would slide just to do somethin in the ride
But shorty theres somethin you provide
Cause the entre aint as good  Mmm 
Without somethin on the side you know
I really wanna be wit you  Be wit you 
But I gotta be real wit you  Real wit you 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
Youre the one I want in my life  Want in my life 
I already got a wife  Got a wife 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
Uh
Uhoh I might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gon kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
Its gon be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if Im a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit a empty Magnum wrapper  Ooh yeah 
So keep it on the down low call the car celly  Yeah yeah yeah 
You seen what happened with Mr Bigg and R Kelly uh
You know I care for you  Care for you 
Anytime this chick is there for you  There for you yeah 
These feelings Ima share wit you
Which makes it a little more clear for you
I really wanna be wit you  Be wit you 
But I gotta be real wit you  Real wit you 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
Youre the one I want in my life  Want in my life 
I already got a wife  Got a wife 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
I really wanna be wit you  Be wit you 
But I gotta be real wit you  Real wit you 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
Youre the one I want in my life  Want in my life 
I already got a wife  Got a wife 
I cant leave you alone  No 
And I know Im livin wrong
But I cant let you go
