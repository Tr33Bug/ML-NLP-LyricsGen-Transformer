You ever have a cold in the summer
That shit be the worse
It gets better though
How they turn a top dog to an underdog
Its a cold world even in the summer dawg
Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when its thick as London fog
Im from the city baby I done grew up under Small
Not to bring up old shit Im not a plunger dawg
No dalmatian but I come through with a hunnid dawg
And they dont bark they bite
Let it spark they might
Gotta walk straight right
Turn the dark to daylight
Let em talk they right
In your heart stay light
Play your part stay tight
Bosses park where they like
Dont you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut em off and let a bygone be a bygone
When you ballin you that nigga that they got they eye on
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
Bussin out sneakers swingin on rims
Being number 1 bringing on Ms
Hope the Knicks get him Ima bring him Timbs
Tell em lace his boots Ima give a king some gems
Like look you the great hope and a scapegoat
You gon have to make quotes and take notes
And some cant take smoke so they may choke
But those who learn to make boats stay afloat
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
The media promoting fake they just stampin and shit
You dont wanna see us beef then stop ampin and shit
They was giving Meek an L said he wouldnt prevail
Next thing you know that boy was in a championship
So everyday Im goin in Im on some vampire shit
And every night Im in my bag like Im campin and shit
The trenches that we grew up in need to know you can win
So you see me in my hood on my champion shit
See a minor setback breed a major get back
If I lose it aint over I be yelling bet back
I come from where they take it you might never get back
Gotta shoutout New Jersey yall wont get the Nets back
Play for keeps round here Pradas deep round here
Shooters creep round here hard to sleep round here
Life cheap round here Grim Reap round here
Spilled milk get wiped up we dont weep round here
We just goin harder we raisin sons and growin daughters
Came a long way and workin on going farther
Grew up not knowing fathers seeing no one bother
But know my story gets better cause I know the author
Keep readin its a comeback story
I told her that if you leave dont ever come back shawty
I be sayin word to Mother she the one that taught me
Karma is a bitch who hoes around and come back for me
Cold


Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
I just feel like life is hot and cold
Ups and downs back and forth
Wins and losses
Its gon be some sunshine and its gon some rain
And when it rain it pours
But ask yourself can you weather the storm until the sun shines again
