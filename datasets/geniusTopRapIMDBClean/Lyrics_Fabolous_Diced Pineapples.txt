Shawty so cold pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and youre my dinner guest
Shawty cleaned up nice never been a mess
Could take a little pain I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I aint try to hurt her cause ive always been the best
Im making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent get a hundred when I test
Im a fan of her talent so ive always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadnt reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadnt reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands
Call me crazy shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out dont it boy
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
The club popping but she aint trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them nowhere
Im the only one that get up in the vip
My money grown baby aint no need to see id
Slide her something just to come through host money
At least niggas know youre getting through the most money
Club my place you wear what you wanna wear
But youre overdressed if youre wearing underwear
I turn up couple js to burn up
Couple spots to hide out now let that playlist right out
Where I live on sunday her place monday
Her hand in my pants call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol yo kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like best she listen yo
Bad bitch good girl around the christmas though
Call me crazy shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out dont it boy
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right


Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushing and I drink the best juice
Im drinking till nothing left to
And she playing with herself too
I be thinking about her all day
She perform like its Broadway
Yeah we hop in the range she off top wit the brain
Got the windows down broad day
Just look at her spectacular
Throw her on the stove flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her but you see the niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping cause ill never get back to her
My bitch like bitches but none of my bitches bad to her
Shes said Trigga why I never seen her with a bad bitch
Unless shes meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples super fine at you
If shes giving head shes throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches nigga she dont mind what you do
I just wanna watch I aint taking time at you dudes
Never faking why they hella friend
Keep it real with her yeah thats what she ever wants
Somethin bout to alchemy she dont ever disappoint
London on the balcony were about to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss shawty youre the shit
Couple days with her man thats all I ever get
And she got a little sister thats what she ever with
Game like a nigga man thats all she ever speak
Montreal was our first time swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back she left couple spent a couple stacks had her put a couple pair
Try to beg mine my nigga out of bootie
Never retract statements nigga Im never scared
Niggas be switching up but nigga Im never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here all in another year
All in another lane all in another gear
All of you niggas lame all of your niggas here
Listen up bitch niggas bitching up
I guess youre doing what youre supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl though I just need you in my world yo
Call me crazy shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out dont it boy
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
