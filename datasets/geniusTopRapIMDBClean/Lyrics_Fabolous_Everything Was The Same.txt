Yeah everything everything was the same
Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck
I gotta set it off Jada Queen and Vivica
The last chick was scared to get that money I cant live like her
Got no problem with you niggas get it how you live it bruh
Its a cold world these mean streets will shiver ya
All I asks is for the same respect that I be givin ya
If not my boy will put the beats on you Karen Civil ya
That boy be on his shoot first never mind the trivia
My advice dont mess with his man word to Nivea
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia
Thats when you would go uptown cause you had to re there
Everybody broke back then you had to repair
Drug dealing was cool back then you had to beware
That was the 90s yall wouldnt get it you had to be there
Thats why Im glad to be here some of us never made it
Its hard to get off the ground yall think I just levitated
Yall think it was all love and nobody ever hated
Yall think cause I never state it I never been devastated
All yall see is sunshinin think I was never shaded
Ya think these calendar models is all that I ever dated
Nigga nothing was the same HOT 97 played it
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 plated
Cant trust nobody the crib is heavy gated
You ask why I tell them even heavens gated
You know why Cause when you good the devil hate it
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted
Attention I never payed it me and this clever lady
She brains do some thangs then we lay together faded
And while I chill loaded up a steel
Just wishin a nigga would but knowin a nigga will
But for real nigga good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
Still I dont owe these niggas nothing put that in a nigga will
Damned if you do them if you dont dont dont dont
Youre damned if you do them if you dont
But they dont have a heaven or hell to put you through
People sit around and judge you anyway
Dont dont dont
