Got her in Cancun
Sweating out of face powder watching her pants move down
Sat the generous zipper
Get her digits and I split her like its different opinions

I heard she chased by the safeties and tight ends
So I put it in the safe cause she might sin
I could go Wraith but I might Benz
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
This is not for goofy niggas wearing Breitlings
Every time I wave my wrist they think its lightnig
They dont know about this Patek up here on Dyckman
But the diamonds back me up just like the hype men
Im a pull up on you nigga not a skype friend
If you arent trying to level up then you not my type then
One eye on your bitch Ill be snipin
And all the pieces hittin Ill be swipin
Told my wifey Faith never sweat Baltimores
We could lose Audemar and order more tomorrow
The ballers gotta appreciate the water boy
Theres a difference in smooth silk or corduroy
Dont you ever ever ever loose faith in me
Dont ever violate and think youre safe with me
I know you dont believe in niggas
But do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
Do you have faith in me
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
All I got is faith in these light skins
Cause I love you
But cant fuck with you
You got something I need
But you dont got no faith in me
