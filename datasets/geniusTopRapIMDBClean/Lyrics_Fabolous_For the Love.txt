Would you do it for the love
Would you do it for the love
Couldve left a long time ago fuck it where Ima go
A brother back in the house couldnt let Obama go
Do it cause you love it nigga advice from my momma go
Those that just follow green be the first kind to go
Being broke aint a joke Im too comical
Seven digits nigga 2 commas ho
Make your first million and dont make it your last
Dont come if you aint ready dont try to make it too fast
You cant learn shit if you never make it to class
You cant just recycle what should be placed in the trash
I started wanted more money and a Stacey dash
A car that cost a house and a place to crash
Pull the hammer like a camera you dont wanna face the flash
Cause youll lose one of your sons and its no replacing Nash
Bet the faces you show be the same faces you stash
Theres more where that came from yall know where I came from
Its all about that boy that call me papi
So Im a keep making that paper copy
You squares could never stop me that triangles to play me
Two lines for you fuck boys now pause that play me
Right from where I left off that lets get back to that real shit
That sit back just chill shit With packs of that kill shit
I chit chat bout trill shit spit that hot feel shit
I give you four bars itll be a Kit Kat of some real shit
Who fucking with me I mean besides your bitch
I Deebo your ho you niggas should hide your bitch
Like the chain reds grandmomma gave him
I got a thing for women I like them misbehaving
You know like bad mike bad
So Ima checkem when I seeem Nik e  AD
Cause in this life things come and go like fads
And Im not one who favors using words like had
Im into having shit turning dreams to average shit
Bring your trophy to the club Dallas Maverick shit
Niceeee
I came from first of the month money
To waking up whenever I want money
Niceee
I chase paper I hunt money
Make 50 racks at 3pm and call it lunch money
