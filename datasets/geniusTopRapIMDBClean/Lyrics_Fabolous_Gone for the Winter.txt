Blunts full of smoke clips in the ashtray
Reminiscing on our past days
Back before a nigga went cold
Back before a nigga sold his soul
The grass appears greener on the other side
Cash is way greener over here where I reside
Soon as the summer come around Ima make sure you see me
Said Ima make sure you see me ayy but for now
Shouldnt you be gone
Gone for the winter

They say you cant do it cause the last nigga fumble
As soon as you make it out you get asked to be humble huh
Head high middle finger higher
My youngin dont rap but that little nigga fire
Like Ray Allen in game 6 when James missed
Then Bosh tapped it to him
You know what had happened to em swish
Its all about a swish
Know a nigga who would you aint even gotta wish
Its more in the sea and I done had a lot of fish

Cause eagles dont fly with pigeons they way higher
All wings flap but you gotta stay flyer  woo 
Niggas broke as a joke sittin laughin together

Fuck askin for a seat you gotta come for thrones
Kings dont speak English we speak Kinglish

Everybody wanna shine gotta give these niggas a gem

If you aint a hater put your hands in the air right now
BUN BAD MIND
Blunts full of smoke clips in the ashtray
Reminiscin on the past days

Came through in 98 and Ive been reppin since
These cats aint real just found out they leopard print
Cause they always talk shit then ask you for peppermints
Well I can smell a hate on your breath
And Im all out of Tic Tacs
All I got is clickclack
Put it to your mouth just like Cutti did to Anthony
I tried to be a friend motherfucker you under handed me
Lucky this is personal and God got a plan for me
Cause I handle my business never let my business handle me
Sayin your name could do more for you than it can for me
You give niggas and they forget your philanthropy
You aint have a penny to your name Anfernee
Dont ever bite the hand that feed you and then stick out your hand for me
We dont bass we throw niggas in the trunk for real
Chase you out the hood make you live with uncle Phil
Champagne every night I done drunk a mil
Yeah now thats money wasted
But now its kinda hard for me to buy Ace
Specially when I just seen Hov buy Ace
Moves time to make moves
No more jab steps those is fake moves
Gotta make it happen no time for what may work
My plan Bs another way to make my plan A work
Ill do the job myself and Im still boss
You was in a winwin and you still lost
