I made some changes in my life dont regret none of them
So if you aint heard from me then youre probably one of them
Niggas want different results but do the same shit
They wait for it to come I became it
Guess whos bizzack nigga
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit youre always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now
The new you I cant do I knew you this aint you
Im not no angel but always remain true
You hear what they say my only complaint you
Wasnt just listening you let that shit taint you
We fell out like faints do I lost all respect
For niggas thats bitches so dont call or text
Them bitches get checked like they all correct
But they be wrong thats why theyre called your ex
You know talk is cheap so I call direct
And you niggas broke Yall call collect
Im watching my close friends like strangers for bread
You said youd never change now dont change what you said
Face it yall all your bitches basic ball
But then you block it like youre 8 feet tall homie
Im in the truck with the Soul Tape on
Hoodie up rest your soul Trayvon
Im that cool I said guess whos bizzack
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit youre always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now
I can try to erase your pain
But you and I weve made some mistakes
I fucks with the old you the new you is lame
What did you say You said that youll never change
But you did soon as you got a chance
Why you poppin shit you should poppin bands
Living that good life without a care
The new you is hot headed and Im not a fan
But I still keep it cooler I think you should cool out
For real cause that aint you though
Since youve been on that high horse your life been at a new low
And Ive been chucking deuces from that 2 door with my new ho
Swear to God I aint losing no sleep
I know you heard what I do to those freaks
I dont beat it up I kill the shits cause a funeral in those sheets
You mess with lames they seven days I swear them dudes so weak
It can all be so sweet but baby do your thing
And miss me with that bullshit that you be saying
You complain and pointing your finger when youre the blame
You know I got that comeback boomerang
Baby whats up
You back in it all I know
Back on that bullshit youre always on
Everything was going too good to know
I just want the old you right now
And thats what you told me but its not what you showed me
It is what it is yeah but Ill always love you
