Baby girl  I really like 
Desert Storm  yeah 
I cant really explain it
Im so into you now I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I dont bring the problems from the 90s into 2 thou
Theres no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kids ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe Im speakin general now
But girl Ima do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldnt I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave shoppin sprees and them dinners to Chows
I aint concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you you growl
And any dude with you he better be a kin of you now
And I aint jealous its the principle now
Im so into you

Come on ma its more than a flashin
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashin
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin
The flawless diamonds and the border we flashin
The money we oughta be stashin
I make sure every quarter be cashed in I cant really explain it
My friend be thinkin Im slippin these girls be thinkin Im trippin
What kinda weed he be smokin what type of drinks you be sippin
Sweet thing just to think of you dippin
Would have me with the blues so hard you would think I was Crippin
Now you relaxin in the Benz credit cards with no limits
So you dont worry about maxin when you spend
Ever since youve been askin bout the friends
Howd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends uh

I dont wanna trip but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it aint because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you aint flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus
Other ballers look dumb when they press you five and sixes
You dont let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein a player was becomin too stressful
But every since the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winters been wonderful my summers been special
Lets fly to St Bart while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real theres no way it could feel like its tainted
But I cant really explain it uh yeah
