You finally got some off time
Its usually Sports Center for the fourth time
Tonight you came out of yours and I took off mine
Now we finally playing catch got some back and forth time
Tossing pillows passing blunts caught a buzz
First time you gave me head was everything I thought it was gonna be
You aint got one degree
But youll get a PhD for that thing youve done to me
And tugging your dungaree I wanted you under me
Wanted to spread them legs like you number 23
Maybe you wasnt ready
Maybe its under key
And its some for them and it aint none for me
So we cuddle for a while talk what you want to be
Some things we had in common and movies you want to see
He made her run to me you played with one of these
Pretty young girls aint no telling what she gonna be
If she was my girl might sound sprung of me
Id give her everything like she had a gun to me
Yeah busy man but for you Im free
Just counting down the days til the next time we
Lay down  lay down 
Lay down  lay down 
I can hear you now  lay down  let that body talk 
I can hear you now now  lay down  let that body talk 
Lay down  lay down 
Lay down  lay down 
I can hear you now  lay down  let that body talk 
I can hear you now  talk to me now listen 
Your scent light up the truck soon as you hopped in it
Easily number one no matter who the top 10 is
In that passenger no reason for gassing ya
Girl you aint killing em baby its a massacre
Black curly hair smile with a pearly glare
I can take you around the globe Im sure the worldll stare
But tonight we in the city like JLo and Diddy
Back in 99 that Bad Boy with pretty
A rainy night the type that make you change your flight
But we still fly
Aint nothing plain about us right
We came to get a bite blue ribbon for two
And I aint clumsy but Im so tripping off you
Had sushi for the first time she tried the king
California tempura oh you trying things
Im your waiter I hope you like what Im trying to bring
All you gotta do is the two words Ryan sing
Lay down lay down
Hey girl I know my way round
Coming down Htown
Ass up face down
Guess we on our way now
I know you cant stay round
She climbed on top and said look nigga
Lay down  lay down 
Lay down  lay down 
I can hear you now  lay down  let that body talk 
I can hear you now now  lay down  let that body talk 
Lay down  lay down 
Lay down  lay down 
I can hear you now  lay down  let that body talk 
I can hear you now  lay down  let that body talk to me girl
