Uhhuh uhhuh
Got a young chick from the hood Southside
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was gon backfire
Cause she act quiet got baptized
Sang in the choir but the thing she desired
Was a older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girls in heat its deep
She sneaking out off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out he kicked her out
She living on her own and its vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And Im thinking of the best way to kick her out
Its cold
Cause all she ever talks about is Louis Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga I cant fuck with her no more ayo ayo

And if that is you you so shallow
Youre on a boat that wont travel
Wont float and wont paddle

She was standing at the baggage claim
First thought Gotta bag this dame
Not knowing she was one of them

Anyway Im happy that it came off the belt
Damier joint same as the belt
She look like she came on herself
Shorty you should be ashamed of yourself
Im checking out her cute face thin little waist line
She checking out my suitcase like the bitch half canine
Couldve took her number but thatd be like taking bad advice
When you look at her youre looking at a price
As I walked away she said Thats a nice

You cant keep a shallow bitch if your pockets aint deep
So I try to be slick aint reserve no dinner
