Money Goes Honey Stay  When the Money Goes Remix  Lyrics
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
It was all good just a week ago
Shoe box full no sneakers though
Just moved in its been a week or so
Brand new coupe so the seat could go
White Benz  White Benz  light tint  Light tint 
Riding like What the fuck is an indictment
Spent ten thous for excitement
Thats how the day goes thats how the nights went
Louis bags Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me Im a Murcielaga
In the same lime green as the Air Max joggers
But if it wasnt here will she wanna go
You dont wanna ask but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm
Stick around til the weather is warm
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
She like shopping but never trendy
A little Gucci maybe Fendi
Island hopping the West Indies
Diddy said got us all about the Benjis
Key tile phelipe chow
Reservations we could sleep now
Ask how much I dont allow such
Pull an AMEX out ya reptile clutch
But who knew that the sky get cloudy
I bought her four rings didnt think shed be outty
Huh the games over seize my Range Rover
Feds said somebody gave my name over
Now Im inside shes outside
What should you do How about ride
Guess nothing lasts forever
I thought we could watch these clouds pass together
But hey


When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
You cant ride big on lil rims
You wanna do it big You need a Lil Kim
Raise ya hand high look in the man eye
I dont know em your honor cant lie
Money comes money goes
So you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who aint turn 180
Place no one above ya sweet sady
Sun stop shining she never got shady
She couldve watched them box you in like a Brady
But she stood up like what up
Its a cold world zip the coat put the hood up
Thats some sick shit thats a ill bitch
When you dead broke she make you feel rich
See mama youre my Rihanna
Pull the umbrella when you see drama
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
