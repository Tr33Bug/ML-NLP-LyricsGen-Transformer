She said I wanna hold you down but we aint never gonna be right
Cause you too caught up in the street life
But thats the only life I know
She said them niggas thats around you they aint never gonna be right
Cause everybody wanna be right
Instead of focusing on their own dough
But this the only life I know
But this the only life I know
They say a woman cancel dates cause she has to
And a man cancel dates cause he has two
Well I got two dates one with destiny
I need more baby dont think any less of me
Tryna juggle slowly but came with struggle
Sometimes I wanna hug the block sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes its about the check sometimes its about checking that
De Niro said you gotta leave in 30 seconds flat
When the heats coming even if you meet someone
Leave it in the rear view dont look back keep running
Left her in the passenger with the Jeep running
Hazard lights blinking and the beat bumping
Ear to the streets I hear the sweeps coming
Air to your chest so I hear a beat from it
She fell in love with a street nigga
Tattoo my name on her petite figure
She said I wanna hold you down but we aint never gonna be right
Cause you too caught up in the street life
But thats the only life I know
She said them niggas thats around you they aint never gonna be right
Cause everybody wanna be right
Instead of focusing on their own dough
But this the only life I know
But this the only life I know
Theres always money to be made that you cant deny
I always made mine never one who cant decide
Im only human so if I dont eat I cant survive
And mama said youre not a man if you cant provide
The sun must know a shortcut it beats me home
I worked so hard to get here now it keeps me going
By the time I get in what she made the eat be old
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold
Caught up in the street life just like my bitch said
I love the game I love the hustle just like Mitch said
Yeah I can leave the game but is they still gonna love me
And when a new nigga come they gonna stop thinking of me
Shawty watch the hustle movie she can never get
How they make so much money but they never quit
I tell her quit for what Thats the only life they know
The streets a dirty ho niggas try to wife it though


She said I wanna hold you down but we aint never gonna be right
Cause you too caught up in the street life
But thats the only life I know
She said them niggas thats around you they aint never gonna be right
Cause everybody wanna be right
Instead of focusing on their own dough
But this the only life I know
But this the only life I know
