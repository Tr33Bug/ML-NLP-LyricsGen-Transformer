Yeah you know the crazy thing is
They gon talk about you when you aint got shit
But then they gon talk about you when you got shit
And see they gon talk even when they dont know
What you had to do or what you go through
Sacrifices
Seeing your family scrambling thats sanity damaging
Gotta make a move cant just stand and be mannequin
Have a man who be managing randomly standing in places he shouldnt
Trying to move that Pamela Anderson under
Stand it be hammers in Grand Marquis paneling
Cause them niggas from the other side are fans of me vanishing
New day new funeral my grandma be panicking
But I gotta eat she just handing me sandwiches
And an appetite like mine got me scamming and scandeling
Riding shotty with my homie but I plan to be phantom and
Bumping something I can feel fam I need sampling
Not no Bieber on the hook I need Anthony Hamilton
I got molly I got white I be Hannah Montana and
Like a Migo its illegal but its grands in my hand again
So it probably aint right but this the land of the scandalous
Til your own friend a snake you probably cant understand it then
When you go youre just gone all we missing is payments
Dr King fought for my freedom that I risked just to pay rent
Aint no love for these streets aint no kissing the pavement
Yeah Im sick and tired of shit but they insist on being patient
But for what To wait on that eviction note
I wake up to some real shit them dreams I have is fictional
Unless I go and get it dont stop get it get it
2 Live Crew money and the Luke dancers with it
Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
You gotta do what you gotta do baby
Baby gotta do what a baby gotta do
Baby mama aint got it but her baby father do
Never pick up baby boy but his Mercedes power blue
Now mommy sick of daddy and baby got a flu
And whats crazy about it too
Is all she sees is lies when she look him in his eyes
And her baby got them too
Pay a little child support but whats so shady about him too
Is in the club he pop Rozay but wont bring baby bottles through
I know things fell part I aint saying we gotta glue
But if you walking around in Prada buy your baby Prada too
Telling hoes yes we cant get a maybe outta you
Shit is fucked up and I dont think the baby gotta clue
Whats a lady gotta do Bend over for dollar tips
Cause aint nobody giving young single mothers scholarships
Mama just got diagnosed breast cancer
So when they ask what shes gonna do her best answer
Is I dont know gotta do what I gotta do
And I dont know about your bills but the ones I got are due
People always wanna try and tell you what you gotta do
But theres a difference in what those who dont and those who got it do
Its called sacrifices hate to see my man gone
Bail was like a pop fly just to bring my man home
Cant just leave him out there
Gotta believe in yourself even when theres doubt there yeah


Jesus died on that cross thats a sacrifice
Niggas dying for their cross thats a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge thats a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you thats a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
You gotta do what you gotta do baby
