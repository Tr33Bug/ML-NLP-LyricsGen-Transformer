Fuck you and these neighbors I hate you

We all have situationships good sex bad relationships
Had dinner dates had vacation trips
Now the respect is lost the admiration dips
And all we do is fucking argue
Yeah thats it fuck and argue
Why have somebody lying with me every night
If they just gon be lying to me every night
Im trying but Im never right buying shit you never liked
Two wrongs just make us wrong why even be together right
We used to be lovers now we used to each other
Keep accusing each other of us using the other
And whats crazy is soon as you fall back they crawl back
Saying they sorry and want it all back
How do I get myself in these situations
Good thing I know
Yeah somebody gon be mad if they hear me saying that Im single
Cause lately I been feeling like Im single
How does together feel so alone
Like Im a stranger in my own home
Like Im single guess Im single single Im single
Titles aint shit if the story dont match it
Now you got a itch looking for a way to scratch it
Flirting online hoping shorty dont catch it
In the strip club you do it for the ratchets
Meanwhile discussing turn into fussing name calling and cussing
The person you put your trust in
You tryna take back something you already said
Thats like giving CPR to something already dead
And it is what it is or it is what it isnt
The comfort to us is no longer sufficient
But I hit it well in public I didnt yell
We got everybody fooled but I think the kids could tell
That this situation aint the best it aint the worst
Its been times that I felt like this it aint my first
That alone got me like try harder or why bother
One thing I know


Yeah somebody gon be mad if they hear me saying that Im single
Cause lately I been feeling like Im single
How does together feel so alone
Like Im a stranger in my own home
Like Im single guess Im single
Single single Im single
