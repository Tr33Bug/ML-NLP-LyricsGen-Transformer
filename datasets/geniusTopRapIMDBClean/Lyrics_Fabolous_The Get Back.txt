Who wanna bet us that they cant fuck with us
Stack cheddar forever live treacherous all the et ceteras
Until the death of us me and my confidantes we shine
We make the ambiance you niggas just rhyme
You little niggas need guidance you barking up the wrong trees
Pissing on the wrong hydrants Im a high fence
I grew up around violence you grew up playing violins
In your hood silence where Im from sirens
They just killed this vibe they just killed this vibe
Theres something about killing shit that makes us feel alive
We feed off your energy we see you on that Kenny G
Just tooting your own horn do your thing my NIG
Whenever you ven aqui to that mighty NYC
We gon check that name you claim bring your YAWK and ID
We take it the wrong way all gold everything
One gold watch two gold chains give me all those  everything
Yall dont want to bump heads Ocho Evelyn
Them boys will leave you butt naked the mall closed and everything
The Streets Is Watching asking if you gon reply to them
Seems like I woke up sleeping giants  Eli and them
A major comeback comes from my minor setback
But still in all we living just thinking about the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully
The get back the get back the get back the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
Im like Nino with the Uzi back of the motorcycle heading
To get back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding
Im like Doughboy looking for Rickys killer  one last soldier
Niggas who turn they backs on me turn your punk ass over
Yall smoked my cousin Harold now Im in the Camaro
Loving and Happiness playing me and my dog with this double barrel
38 40 belows live or die motherfucker
Im Pac you Radames Riverside Motherfucker
The get back everybody better get back tell my niggas in the jet black
Until the seats let back on your jet back if youre a gambling man you could bet that
Its a sure thing not just a New York thing or a rich or a poor thing
Its a lace your boots pull your drawstring who want to go to war thing
Its a who gon protect your thing who really want it more thing
Putting legends in coffins and some bullet holes in the door thing
Its a nobody saw things street code not a law thing
Its kids that wasnt taught things old ladies like poor thing
Poor thing and the get back is important
Poor thing for the dead homies we pour pagne
Like what you say while its cocked back to him
Guess what goes around comes around got back to him


A major comeback comes from my minor setback
But still in all we living just thinking about the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully
The get back the get back the get back the get back
The get back the get back the get back the get back
Now these motherfuckers smoked your God damn cousin in FRONT of you nigga
Blew his head off in front of your face and you aint gon do SHIT
You acting like a little bitch right now nigga
Man FUCK that I aint letting that shit ride
We gon go in there and smoke all these motherfuckers I dont care who the fuck out there
Goddamnit Is you down nigga
