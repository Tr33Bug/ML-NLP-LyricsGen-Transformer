Sometimes I like slim sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine them and I like thim slick
Thim slick probably went over your head
Couldnt lay up I just went over for head
Made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony pint over the ledge
Been a few days but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
Not to save hoes or rescue anybody
But a nigga know what stress do to the body
And I done seen you in your best shoes but Zanottis
Shit be looking like fresh shoes on Bugattis
And I dont know who invented high heels
But I swear we all owe him one
And if you do know that man girl
I be like where you know him from
You so slick so small curvy
Teeth all pearly hair all curly
Was a Tom Boy now you all girly
Never look tired but you wake up all early
Hit the gym keep it toned up
Progress pic holding your phone up
Aw shit waist getting smaller
Niggas on Instagram like damn I need to call her
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say everything looking just fine
You got that blessing in disguise
You wouldnt know it girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time  girl you got me
Thim slick girls could get every dime  girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time  girl you got me
Thim slick girls could get every dime   girl you got me
She like hold up let me throw on something light  damn 
Bitch really went and threw on something tight  haha 
Came downstairs in her Superwoman tights like
Dida dida dida dida dida
Damn I aint know you was holding like that
I aint know brown skin Kelly Rowland like that
Never knew you had it with your sneaky ass
She said I never seen you looking with your peaking ass
34 24 36
Finally got a selfie after taking thirty pics
36 24 40
Dcups caption double cup shorty
And its angles to this shit angles to this shit
Gotta hold her phone up and put the angle on the pics
And then they poke it out and put an angle on that hip
Having thirsty niggas come from every angle at that bitch
Lord Heard when they thinner you get deeper in her
They say when they thicker they make you cum quicker
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime 
That ass in the gym squat life
Gotta show em love in the era of the shot life
This is all from my mama this is not knife
Niggas love her shit give a fuck about likes


That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say everything looking just fine
You got that blessing in disguise
You wouldnt know it girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time  girl you got me
Thim slick girls could get every dime  girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time  girl you got me
Thim slick girls could get every dime   girl you got me
