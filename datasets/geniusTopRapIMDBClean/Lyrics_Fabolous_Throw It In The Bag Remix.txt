Throw It In The Bag  Remix  Lyrics
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
You know we had to go shopping one more time right
I think we forget somethin haha haha
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
I said if you gettin money if you gettin money
If you gettin money just throw it in the bag
Its Mr Throw It In The Bag I just throw it in the bag
I dont know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I aint know it had a tag
Im no liar I dont front Im a buy her what she want
Cause your queen posed to get what she desire what she want
If my lady like to eat then Im a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want bet its gon cost you
Bags with the Gs jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga aint ya nigga unless he endorse you
They sayin it aint trickin if you got it they lyin
I say it aint trickin if you got her she mine
You niggas aint got to worry bout her she fine
My Player Cards approved you niggas declined NICEEE


Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
If you gettin money if you gettin money
If you gettin money just throw it in the bag
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
I said if you gettin money if you gettin money
If you gettin money just throw it in the bag
Well alright
Loso and Drizzy baby
Uh uh we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say come again
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back I make her feel young again
If her card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They dont give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him tell me thats her baby
I hope that I never meet him that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah she say she lucky that she his
No Im lucky that you mine baby you know what it isssss
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Shorty so nice I dont mean polite
When I say nice I mean lookin right
And you cant put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much tell em what its lookin like
Everything I buy fly its like Im bookin flights
If I want it Im a get it that should not be tooken light
And thats on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Aint A Thang JayZ JD
Like JayZs lady its Beyoncein
Supportin your women goes beyond payin
Watchin me ball is like LeBRON playin
Im in the Louie shoes you might see KanYe in
They sayin it aint trickin if you got it they lyin
I say it aint trickin if you got her she mine
You niggas aint got to worry bout her she fine
My Player Cards approved you niggas declined NICEEE
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag
