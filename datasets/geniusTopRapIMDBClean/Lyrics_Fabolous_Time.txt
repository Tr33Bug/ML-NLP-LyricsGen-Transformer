Somebody told me the greatest gift you can give somebody is your time
Cause when you give your time
You givin a portion of your life that
That youll never get back
Yeah
Shawty I never meant to hurt you hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach curtains
Since I got my bag up I cashed out on a Birkin
I aint gotta question myself know you worth it
I dont want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high  Uh 
I just wanna bust down with you we can just fly  Yeah yeah 
I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time  Yeah 
I had to buy that watch I knew it would take time
Just like Rolex Im always gon make time
Been through some rough patches but also had great times
I mean we done did it all except for the state time
But we got time in and Im tryna do life
Got a ring to go with it if you tryna be wife
Cause this lifestyle savage and it kinda be trife
Its so many backstabbers at your spine with a knife
But her she aint no bust down thotiana  Thotiana 
So she get the bust down watchiana  Watchiana 
Drippin like she just now out the sauna  Out the sauna 
She take off and touch down in designer

Shawty I never meant to hurt you hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach curtains
Since I got my bag up I cashed out on a Birkin
I aint gotta question myself know you worth it
I dont want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high

I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time
Yeah  Yeah 
They always tellin me that time is money  Time is money 
But I never could do shit with that uh
Cause the money come the money go
But the time you never get it back
If I could turn the hands of time back
Id bring Cliff Nipsey and Prime back bring Rings mom back
I mean I wish I could rewind back
More than the Raptors wish Kawhi would sign back
But he didnt  But he didnt  so cherish the time you was given
Be thankful you eatin not just on Thanksgiving
You can right your wrongs as long as your living
I dont ask to be forgotten I just ask to be forgiven
Life is too short for grudges too long for DAs and judges
Who wrongfully convict niggas
Im talkin Central Park Five Jena Six niggas
Exonerated but that time still tick nigga damn
Shawty I never meant to hurt you hurt you
I want you in back of the Maybach curtains
Since I got my bag up I cashed out on a Birkin
I aint gotta question myself know you worth it
I dont want these hoes to surround my vibe
I just wanna double cup and get high
I just wanna bust down with you we can just fly
I bought the new Rollie just so we can reset time  Time
