Cause I know how niggas is
When you in the streets and you hustlin
You know how niggas is
Cause you was one of them niggas you know what Im sayin
You were on the corner tryin to get your money
You see a nigga roll around in a Benz or a Bimmer know what Im sayin
Fuck that nigga know what Im sayin
I murder that nigga I ride that nigga you know what Im sayin
Now Im the nigga in the hood know what Im sayin
Now you guys own the corner so I know the same speeches comin up
You know what Im sayin its all good though
I aint trippin
Im that nigga
Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck
Remember I was down to die just to live it up
But lifes a bitch and that judge is quick to give her up
They say life is short cept when lookin through them bars
Gotta keep your head up I be lookin to the stars
I been through a lot wasnt lookin for no cars
Didnt kill me though now Im here lookin at the scars
Sometimes you get caught by people lookin from a far
Thats how it is when you out here takin cookies from the jar
Thats what my son said they came and took him and his draws
He support the family they took his mama favorite bra
The feds snatched my favorite boy
These the rainy days they say you should be savin for
But when sun shines no one carries umbrellas
And if they did we would look at them as dumb fellas
Im trying to become something they probably become jealous
Have a lot to say about it but afraid to come tell us
Im here to beat the odds that was set against me
Wished the worst luck to anyone who bet against me
I wanna be somebody somebody thats never been
No squares in my circle best shape I ever been
Im growing up my daddy planted a seed
My momma watered me with a plan to succeed
I was that kid in the ghetto hand full of seeds
But Im here now and I dont plan to recede
Sometimes I think I lucked up at right time
Imagine I wouldve fucked up that night slime
It hurts to even think about it
Would be in the streets thirsty trying to get a drink up out it
Black hoodie I pull that quatro cinco out
And put that iron to your clothes like Im taking wrinkles out it
Take every Franklin Grant Jackson and Lincoln out it
Look you in yo eyes and tell you Dont you even think about it
So as you hear me dropping this rhyme
Know my opportunity couldve been stopped at a dime
The life you choose come from lack of options sometimes
Gotta do what you gotta do even opting to crime
And who am I Without namedropping it Im
Someone who saw the top and didnt stop he just climbed
Someone who get money without dropping a dime
And transform to your leader in my optimus prime
So for dinner we stopping at Prime
Round of chill Patron top of the lime
Hold em up look at your niggas and say
There was no way out but we figured a way
And now we chill loaded up a steel
We just wish a nigga would but we know a nigga will
But for real good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
And we dont owe these niggas nothing
Put that in a nigga will yeah
