Oh
You see what I cant understand
Is how somebody have a lifetime friend
That theyve been through thick and thin with
And they just fall out over the simplest shit man like
But that same person will be in a relationship
With a triflin ass mafucker
And keep takin em back
Shit is crazy
The karma of fuckin over a good person
Is the asshole you end up wit
Get a taste of your own medicine
Funny you the one who end up sick
Always took you back even though it made my friends upset
Told me I should blow you off havent got that wind up yet
Know how many days I hurt Many nights Ive been up stressed
Thought that we had been in love maybe I just been obsessed
When you crossed me you lost me
Now if I was guardin Derrick Rose
I would be more understandin but you aint Derrick Rose
You was my number one but um you aint Derrick Rose
You tryna make a point again you aint Derrick Rose
You just on some bullshit bitch you aint Derrick Rose
Im a lover and a fighter fight for what I love
But you made somethin of bitches I think nuttin of
Ask myself why I fight when its long been over
God gives the hardest battles to the strongest soldiers
So I fight for us long as theres reason to
You wanted to give up on us long as there is season two
Cool youre gonna need me one day
And if its Sunday that oneday gon be Monday
Thats how fast things change sometimes
Niggas play the tough role I Ving Rhames sometimes
Like like like I dont want that bitch back
I mean I want her but I dont want the bitch back
She say she want him but she dont want that nigga back
That nigga act like I aint had a nigga back
Youre gonna need me one day
So much pain in this sample
Youre gonna want me back  So much pain in some of our hearts 
In your arms  I just want a painfree heart 
Youre gonna need me one day  I dont ask for much
Fab whats good though 
Youre gonna want me back
In your arms  Lets talk to her real quick 
We start with
I love you and I think we got the power to grow
Woulda gave up but aint no coward in Joe
Funny thing about it all you check my Twitter every hour or so
And then you bring this fake shit to our reality show
Spent however many years lookin for devotion
Its weird your feelings but I put em into motion
I dictate the Whats and Whys  What else  The How and When
You aint learn to separate your now from then
I keep my distance cause when Im near my head is hurtin
Exhausted every road to friendship but its never workin
Me I met the sweetest girl you know yall met in person
Bottom line I made you then made a better version
Tried to give you good advice but you aint heed it
Mustve figured you aint need it but all I can do is seed it
Told you you gon fuck around and end up sick
You chose dick from this nigga off the New York Knicks my nig
You so spiteful that aint the way we act
That cock was inserted in you how could it pay me back
I know you said when we were over youd start aimin bigger  But 
But you cant have anonymity with famous niggas  Oh 
Know you thinkin my happiness is a front
How would you ever know Happiness is what you wanted
So unidentifiable when that harmll never let up  Why 
You fucked me real good but karma fucked you better
Youre gonna need me one day
Youre gonna want me back
In your arms
Youre gonna need me one day
Youre gonna want me back
In your arms
You never miss a good thing til it leave you
I finally I realize I dont need you
You want me back
You know youre gonna need me back gotta have me back yeah
Heartbroken when you left my world
Boy you know you shouldve kept this girl
I was there for you
Now I dont know what you gon do
Without me baby
Ooh
