I aint in no rush
I handle you niggas when I feel like it
I just be chillin
Your bitch is chillin too
When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
The way its shaped they say its fake I cant lie I still like it
No snitch I cant tell if it look real and it feel like it
She bend it over I will hike it number one pick got skills like it
Heard she fucks with some ball player when I touch down I still spike it

At the game on them floor seats I aint Spike but I feel like it

Got soldiers in the field like it bout mine you get killed like it
Pussy niggas be commentating say they aint hating but it feel like it

When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
I aint a chef I make meals like him cut them up in thin slices
I got bricks like constructions
You want instructions You niggas aint built like me
Competition aint real like me Im so sick who ill like me
Two bitches in my suite so when I leave I bet them bitches still diking
Family good cause I feel like it Im hood cause I feel like it
Might not be your favorite artist
But your favorite artist got a verse from me so they still like it
Aint nobody popping seals like me codeine like a supplement
If I make her cum its a compliment nigga fuck you like a parking ticket
Now I got caine like a walking stick shoot you for a argument
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get
Im getting rich cause I feel like it take your girl cause I feel like it
Cash her out toss her up wash her up thats the spin cycle
And them niggas never did like it in the car and I got the title
Grandma bought me a hand bible I bought me a hand rifle
Cause I feel like it all you niggas look recycled
And Im getting head in the car while shes driving
When I feel like it kill these hoes when I feel like it
When I feel like it thats my bitch when I feel like it
When I feel like it kill these niggas when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
When I feel like it smoke one when I feel like it
When I feel like it pou up when I feel like it
When I feel like it cash out when I feel like it
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
