Who Do You Love  Remix  Lyrics
Who do I love
I love niggas with money thats what I love
I love money I love designer bags I love designer shoes
I like expensive cars I like vacations at the other side of the fucking world
Thats what I love if you can do that for me I love you too
Bitch who do you love Me or Chanel
I bet a bag make her happy like she was Pharrell
Nigga try to lock her down but she gon rebel
Like cuffing season over nigga she out on bail
And whats the first thing she do once she out of jail  huh 
Get a real nigga like me on the cell
Im like pass through bring your girlfriend with the ass through
Lie to em if you has to when he ask you
Crunch time playa better pass it fore you choke
Bad bitches aint cheap better pass her if you broke
Imma pour it if she drink Imma pass it if she smoke
Dont be trippin bout this shit dont be asking bout the folks
You just passin through the city and that pass can be revoked
Dont get your car wet and the passenger be soaked nigga
Young OG I be on lowG
He be in your comments heart face emoji
Oh no thats a nono if you dont know
Just between us babe not even Bo knows
Made a fuckin movie with your chick porno
Then the song came through the sonos
Who do you love
You aint the same whenever Drakes around
I know you dont love me
You scream and holler when CBs in town
Now I got a Hollywood girl she say Im the captain
Then she sellin ass on the side
Got a New York City big titty pretty thing
Catch the train to a nigga she dont drive  dont drive 
Im that nigga Im that nigga Im that nigga in your city
But a nigga from Virginia
Im that nigga Im that nigga
And if you niggas done forgot you niggas bout to remember
You niggas better remember losers never lover a winner
Bitches never love a loser beggars never can be choosers
Im in the crib playing 2k new bitch got loose lips talk like Lupe
You can kick push baby why you acting booshie
Fresh kush liquor pills just a movie
Its a movie call her best friends skin like Dusse
And I made em sound like who they
Who do you love
Ho I know yo type 
You aint the same whenever YGs around
Bitch who do you love
Know you wanna act a fool when you see that nigga Dolla ign
Bitch who do you love
Aha I bet you be a freak for my nigga Meek
Who do you love
I bet that you go low for that nigga Loso
Who do you love
I bet you let your panties fall quick for that nigga August
