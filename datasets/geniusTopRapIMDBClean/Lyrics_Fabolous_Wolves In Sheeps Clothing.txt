Them niggas is talking baby
Dont mind them they just talking
They know they cant fuck with me baby
You tell them like that bitch told Scarface
What did she say
I dont fuck with the help
They say theyre out for dead Presidents never respect it
First of all Ben Franklin was never elected
That means him and Big Bills have never connected
They just say it cause they think it sounds clever on records
Secondly Gods first should never be second
And if you living wrong money can never correct it
Imma say it once then its whoever direct it
You never get off on me Im never the exit
All black everything in my black V
It aint a game if it was itd be a black Wii
Im on my A game never on that B shit
You on that B shit you never gonna be shit
Thats how I see shit cause I am de shit
True story like that Hollywood E shit
I say F niggas cause Im on some G shit
Yeah that redandgreen stripe double G shit
That was for my homie just know Im thinking of you
I told him stay on top so they cant get above you
He told me I dig that like a fucking shovel
Why it take a nigga to go to jail to say he love you
We be killing them boy we be killing them
Damn we used to dream to have a million
Now the family get money like Will and them
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium
My baby girl got ass its no secret that it
Make you look away and still be peeking at it
She said they come with paintedfaces trying to clown on you
How they under you but try to talk down on you
You see a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar
Tell my bitch that Im no good as if theyre any better
But her loyalty keep her from them other boys
Let em holla she just gonna exist above the noise
Paul is sorta like
A nigga with the swag of a Yao Ming balla type but more Rich Porter type
A small giant nigga we not at all alike
The shit you just discovering Ive been doing all my life
Yall niggas call it balling I just call it life
Im still the same as day 1 I dont get caught in all the hype
So wussup Dash I cant call it Ike
I guess they dont see Paul they only see all the ice
Yellow everything lemon head sour jewels
Rich head to toe aviator fly Howard Hughes
Enjoy the best of everything we paid our dues
So niggas wanna jump ship and join our cruise
But this aint no joy ride when my boys ride
Somewhere somebodys boy died and never will your boy hide
Im on frontline no matter how drastic
But otherwise you can find me where the cash is
In love with the rapids no I dont mean white water rafting
Im talking bout them 4 door Astons
Addicted to fashion diamonds flashing
But the money music and fast cars is my passion
Im no newbie nor am I a hasbeen
These whack rappers give me headaches this just the aspirin
I often speak through my actions
But paint pictures with words that you can close your eyes and imagine
