Nice
Oh oh
You whats up girl aint gotta ask it
I dead em all now I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Aint gon stress you but Ima let you know
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em oooh
You aint gotta worry bout her shorty straight
Been chasing her for 2 days first 48
A bad bitch cost she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels a newer ride
Louboutin shoes she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her I call it shoeicide
Looking good has its sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice face dime
Give you that iPhone 4 face time
Shorty in the streets still handle the home
Enough class for wine still handle Patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand em the tone
You whats up girl aint gotta ask it
I dead em all now I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Aint gon stress you but Ima let you know
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em oooh


Yeah I know thats what they all says
She got a donkey with her Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Cant fault her the last nigga spoiled her
But he aint beat it up I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she aint gotta beg borrow or steal
Often imitated never duplicated
They say she a dime I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick execution
You whats up girl aint gotta ask it
I dead em all now I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Aint gon stress you but Ima let you know
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em you be killin em
Girl you be killin em oooh
You be killin em 
Had to let you know
You be killin em 
You be killin em girl you be killin em 
All the ladies  to all the ladies 
You be killin em 
Id like to congratulate you
You be killin em 
Congratulations
You be killin em girl you be killin em 
And you just came from the gym clothes
In a fitted cap and some Timbos
And a pair of flats well trimmed toes
Camera in the mirror BBM Pose
Still killin em hoes
You still killin em hoes
You still killin em hoes
Oooh
