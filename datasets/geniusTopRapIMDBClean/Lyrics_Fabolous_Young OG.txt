Nigga dont tell me what niggas say about me
Tell me why they feel comfortable telling you
The saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40s bunch of kids scattered shorties
No respect from the neglect they call they daddy Corey
Im from a different cloth that aint the pattern for me
Its levels to this shit its different categories  yea 
Cant be like them niggas out here looking fat and gaudy
They aint never won no rings but be mad at Horry
Talking bout man that nigga dont deserve that shit
Like I was really in these streets I used to serve that shit
We started from the bottom had to topsyturn that shit
Get it while the gettings good after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hitting it be too late to swerve that shit  ERR 
Thats a young mistake Lord knows I made me some  word 
I love getting brain that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum swear these hoes made me numb  yea 
Only feelings caught is bitch you been shoulda gave me some
I knew niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs  feel me 
Drink the whole fucking juice and never saved me some  feel me 
I know how young niggas feel I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated nobody gon give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas yeah we shouldnt do it
But hoes gon be hoes they just aint admitting to it
Where I been Getting to it going through and getting through it
Running round killing shit and telling cops I didnt do it  Niicee 
Thats why they call me Young OG
And Ima spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chilling in my city but my lungs OT
And fuck them niggas online reply why
Broke niggas talking cause its free WiFi
I hear you you know the problem with you lil niggas
You think you know everything about the damn world and you dont know shit
Well I see you got yourself a lil business goin
Well thats good thats good when you make that paper
But when you makin paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
There are two types of niggas in this world there are niggas with guns and niggas with butter
Now what are guns The guns thats the real estate
Thats stocks and bonds artwork you know shit that appreciates with value
Whats the butter Cars clothes jewelry  all that other bullshit that dont mean shit after you buy it
That is what its all about  guns and butter baby
Lil dumb motherfuckers
