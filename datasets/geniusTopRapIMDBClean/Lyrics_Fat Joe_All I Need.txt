Who you gonna trust
Oooooh 
Yeah you could trust me haha
I dont care about nothing else my baby  Baby I dont care 
All I care is bout being here for you  Oooh 
And I wont stare at nobody else my baby  Promise I wont stare 
Cuz all I need is you  All I need all I need baby 
To all the ladies in our lives you heard
Strong independent women come on
Yea huh
What you think gangstas dont cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
Im tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
Im in the studio at night you think Im out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you Imma speed crushing all day
All Im askin you for is to be more trusting
Im outta town all the time and dont accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz Im not at home
Thats why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray Im on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose  Hey 
Yea how Im supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a niggas knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when Im gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring now thats
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I dont care about nothing else except my girl  my girl 
Not myself no one else just my girl  my girl 
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl that
Haha
This is going out to you you and you and you
To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether hes locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man and
Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always
Always be my girl
repeat 2X
