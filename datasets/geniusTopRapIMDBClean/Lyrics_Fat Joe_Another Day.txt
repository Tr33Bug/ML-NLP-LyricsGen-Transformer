Crack Sometimes you have to take it a day at a time
You know when you hear that Haaaaa 
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin good today
I hear the  gunshot sound  but Im here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didnt have to use the K today
Made it through another day
In my hood everyday niggas get locked down
Best friends hit on your girl and get em knocked down
Teachers tell you quick you niggasll never be shit
Dropped so much coke in the water could make the sea sick
All I hear is sirens and sounds of guns blastin
A little girl went missin but aint nobody askin
My nigga Lil Troy hit the bank said he need cash
Seen him on the news I guess he forgot the ski mask
Strippers and celebrities Instagrams a lick
Niggas rantin bout gay cause ignorance is bliss
Shorty changin food stamps just to get high
Listenin to Stevie Ribbon in the Sky
Homie reminiscin Im keepin him in my prayers
Cause Joe crack cares even if no one else cares
See me on the screen but Im still the same G
They thought Id never see outside of 5V
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin good today
I hear the  gunshot sound  but Im here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin good today
I hear the but Im here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didnt have to use the K today
Made it through another day


Welcome home my nigga Joe Crack
Bust a bottle of that black shit lets go
New seven series charcoal gray Beamer
Joe Crack Dope Boy nigga Don Cartegena
All the sixes we collect bitches we could sex
Phone still tapped so its best to send a text
Go and do a bid back home just like a king
Bucket full of crab money bags that we seen
From Rikers to Fisher Isle digits to digits pilin
New Wraith with soft plates long as the bitches smilin
Ciroc boy AP on the rocks
New Sunseeker four mill on a yacht
I came from the mud Def Jam the new plug
Five gold joints and still gets no love
I walk the same block rode the same trains
We fucked the same bitches whipped the same cane
Boss 
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the  gun shot sound  but Im here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the  gun shot sound  but Im here to stay
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didnt have to use the K today
Made it through another day
