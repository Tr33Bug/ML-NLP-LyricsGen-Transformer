Another Round  Remix  Lyrics
I just like waking up right next to that thing
La dee da da
Have to roll over and go another round yeah
I wont be holding back my love
I wont be holding back
I wont be holding back my love
No I wont be holding back
Cause in the end youll know Ima want another round another round  another round another round 
Boy I know I want another round another round  another round with you 
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
Ima give you my all all I want is you
Hair in a bun cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty  yeah 
Swear on my son aint too many things could hide your booty  nah 
Call me what you like but bet I slide with cutie  check that 
Kenny name wasnt Bud but he still ride with Rudy  oh 
And thats why we comfortable as a Huxtable  oh 
You been around since the Lunchables girl I fucks with you  oh 
In the back of the truck with you same fingers I chuck with two  oh 
Im just playin with you thinkin bout stayin with you
Not forever but at least until the AM with you
Still playin with it cause you like it raw
Might need a mornin after what we did the night before
Might go another round if youre tryna fight me more yeah
I wont be holding back my love
I wont be holding back
I wont be holding back my love
No I wont be holding back
Cause in the end youll know Ima want another round another round  another round another round 
Boy I know I want another round another round  another round with you 
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
Ima give you my all all I want is you
Yeah uh yeah uh yo
Cake cake cake cake cake you know you love it
Icin like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you you a star Im a G Joe the Don
Super thief I go hard in these sheets Im a God
Lord Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy Superfly Snuka
Have you comin back to back more sex to cook up
Haha but ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots


I wont be holding back my love

No I wont be holding back yeah
Cause in the end youll know Ima want another round another round  another round another round 
Boy I know I want another round another round  another round with you

And now you got me and only me tonight

See she done came down
Double cup with ice man I think she got some drank from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong cause her boyfriend listen to me
I dont give a damn bout it
That nigga if he trip I got a whole clique of killers with me
See Im the man now
Rollin 24s through the hood women checkin for me
Girl I aint playin round
Pull up to the crib hope you wearin somethin special for me
And Ima lay it down
Round one two and three can you keep up with me
I wont be holding back my love  I wont be holding back

I wont be holding back my love  I wont I wont 
No I wont be holding back  I wont I wont 
Cause in the end youll know Ima want another round another round  another round another round 
Boy I know I want another round another round  oh another round with you 
I used to want you and her and her and you and her and her
And now you got me and only me tonight
