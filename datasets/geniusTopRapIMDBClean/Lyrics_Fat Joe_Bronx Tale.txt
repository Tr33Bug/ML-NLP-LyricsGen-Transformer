Music please
Yes welcome to Jealous Ones Envy
Wed like to thank you in advance for purchasing this product
It is a Relativity Records product artist Fat Joe
My name is KRSOne
And of course were gonna bring THE noise
Cause we can never be toys
Yes I am the ultimate uttering ultimatums for the fun of it
It appears to me you dont know who you fucking with
You cant see this with bifocals cause youre local
Cant hang with my vocals better you fuck with Sonny Bono
Or Yoko Ono but KRS oh NO NO
You might think you all that but I dont give a fuck though
Im rolling hard like God for the squad black
Packin them poppers bitch where that money be at
Aiyo I be the show stopper as I shine like gold
Other rappers dull like copper the certified fake nigga dropper
Which borough is the thorough
I know do you know Let me know Im sayin though
The coke connector sweating leathers with reflectors
Dont get caught up in my sector
Or Ima have to inject ya with a slab of this lyrical dope shit
Fake MCs and wannabes best to quote this
Fat Joe the true and living will prevail
Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale
Will I fail I doubt it
Im the nigga catching bodies while other niggas fantasize about it
True indeed behind my back MCs claim they can serve me
In my face they screaming Were not worthy
Youse a has been actually you aint been
I be touring while you be home taping
So what punk you could battle in a second
Frankly the bottom line is wheres your hit record
You claim Im jocking claim Im on your dick wheres your witnesses
If Im on your dick my name has got to be syphilis
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck  Jeru
Up up up and away cuz I dont play clown  Kool G Rap
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck  Jeru
Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down  Kool G Rap
As we proceed to lock it down dont get it fucked up
We be the kings of the Boogie Down
All we do is spark izm and get cash
Torturing MCs like that warden up in Alcatraz  bo bo bo bo 
Its Fat Joe yo you know my steelo
Get so much love Im payin sixteen on a kilo
Sending niggas outta town still got control of the Boogie Down
Now how the fuck you sound  Yeahhh 
Aint no army that could harm me or bomb me
Cmon G you clowns aint got a fucking thing on me
Im flashy like white linen  tell em 
Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the 9th inning
Im down with Kris and aint no stopping me
Im out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me
Its My Philosophy puffing Ls in the corridor
Slapping cops like  hitting whores in my laborator
These motherfuckers dont want it
Word to mother Joe these niggas dont want it 


If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck  Jeru
Up up up and away cuz I dont play clown  Kool G Rap
If youre feeling lucky duck then press your luck  Jeru
Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down  Kool G Rap
Mercy you wanna serve me but you aint worthy
My style is too curvy what you telling me
Bet your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and fondle your balls
With KRSOne up in your memory
I know your kind you act like
Youre Mr John Gotti the Don but youre just another bwotty mon
Telecro bwotty mon how you collect
Rap magazine dating back to Tougher than Leather
The only reason you got such an extensive rap collection
Cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together
Watch what you say watch what you said
When your skull gets cracked what you gonna say crackhead
Your file is dead kneel to the rap God in bed
Before I slap you way Back in the Days like Ahmad
Dont get me fed up or vexed up cause youll get set up
My crew dont let up I be dead up in this piece  tell em 
Recognize its BlastMaster KRSOne
For ten years Fat Joe chillin on the East
