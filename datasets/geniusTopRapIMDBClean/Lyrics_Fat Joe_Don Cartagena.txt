Nobody said it would be easy ha hah

Nobody wanna handle it
As we proceed to give you what you need
What yall wanna do hah  2X 
Nineeight its the great
What yall wanna do hah  2X 
Now why the sad face jealous for fellas thats diamond laced
Tryin to find a place to recline shine my face
Under the sun where its warm runnin with Pun til Im gone
Thats word is bond on my moms
Thats the squad motto got beef we call Rallo
Dame Un Trago he go to war wit a bottle
Simple as dat flip out the mack and cripple a cat  take that 4X 
Right through your back tissue with any pistol I pack  Cmon 
Physical rap means we live the lyrics
Long as niggas fear us you could never entirely dissapear us
We the realest you ever gon see
In all honesty aint another brother thats hotter than me
Modestyll get nowhere thats why I go there  Yeah yeah 
Like lettin you know where to buy the new Fat Joe gear  Thats right 
Five sixty  five sixty  only the Squad ride with me
Unless you a Bad Boy and roll with Puff Diddy  Eheheheh 
Its my city and everything in it
Aint a thing rented  cmon  its my Benz if you see me in it  yeah 
We invented floodin the watch and runnin the spots
Thats why Im not a player I just crush a lot

What you thought we aint run the streets
Now you cant sleep ten deep convoyin in the Benz jeep
Rollin deep with the DonTana
I put the chrome in your cara adios to manana
Yea uh yo
You better slide or catch this homicide
Aint no match for Joey Crack Im blowin backs out the other side
Brothers died and mothers cried at wakes these are The Breaks
Kurtis Blow your head off like Jake  like Jake 
So take heed and read between the lines aint no cheatin mines
Player haters never wanna see my shine
Up in the Range or in the Lex Coupe
Rockin a fresh suit with dress shoes on my way to Les Boos
Lets choose the life we rather live on the streets stabbin kids
Or livin mad sweet in lavish cribs
Fix marriages for my kids six karats Im a whiz  Mm mmm 
Exotic tokin parrots on my wrist
It aint shit but for sex money and drugs
True thugs with slugs and wrap bodies in rugs
What the fuck Joe Crack twist your cap back
Leave your heart rate flat once Terror Squad attacks  Yea yea yea
