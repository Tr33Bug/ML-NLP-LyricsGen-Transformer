Fat Joe vs George  Scary Movie 3 Rap Battle  Lyrics
These guys cant be serious right here
Stan and MiniMe
AKA I hope he aint
The one you fight with
Ayo this niggas mad corny and aint got no skills
Cause hes alright but hes not real
Dont mean to hurt your feelings but youll never get a deal
Cause hes alright but hes not real
Youre a needle in a haystack Im the don the city slicker
Forget cows well milk your moms lil titties nigga
Porn elixir thought he wasnt
Bet this nigga end up havin kids wit his cousin
Halfretarded my numberone fan be like
Duhduhduhduh That means Fat Joes the man
And youre a liar in denial
Kill yo ass quicker than I died in Empire
How dare you want to joust with me
Lookin like you dyin of SARS or mad cow disease
You fake BRabbit out to battle me
8 Miles down the road the farms that away
drops the mic
Plays harmonica note 
Bitch  Plays lower harmonica note 
Ho  plays harmonica notes 
Now everybody in the 202
Throw your hands in the air cause Fat Joe is screwed
Now everybody in the 202
Throw em up check it out
Im a white boy but my neck is red
I put Miracle Whip on my Wonder Bread
My face is pale nah Ive never been in jail
Me and Buffy spend every winter in Vail
How many bitches have I slapped Zero
Uh and Martha Stewart happens to be my hero
I grew up on a farm and I was born with no rhythm
Dr Phils my uncle and I like to hang with him
I cant dance I wear khaki pants
My middle names Lance my grandmas from France
So maybe Im wack cause my skin aint black
But you cant talk smack cause whitey just struck back
drops the mic
