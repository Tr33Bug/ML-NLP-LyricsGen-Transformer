Give me my shit back mira  Hey yo
Fat Joe and them is here now word
Shine like marbles  Collects diamonds

Politic for the real ones  Yo

Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here thousand and one
Corner son fake a jack you be a goner
Yo control this rap like Napoleon halfMongolian
Hold it you owe me in rock em like linoleum yeah
Lex diamonds shinin like you rhymin 929in
Titanium glass time to play that ass
Whirlwinds of French come movin intense
Time to pull again release the shell well make em yell again
So sleek but Ima be maxin in suites
Countin your paper and countin your sheeps
Hittin your chick in Jeeps
Miraculously attack your faculty
Who wanna tackle me You Jack Mack kidnap em for free

We movin like gestapos through underground potholes
That rock those much land discoveries
Chrome rims sippin bubbly

Thunthun straight out of Sicily

We gettin knots like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here thousand and one
Corner son fake a jack you be a goner
Word life Ill be the infamous
Who leaves no witnesses cracks the wickedest
Run up in your crib blast your kids
Aint no myth in this shits official

Cause my obsession with sendin rappers to Heaven gives me an erection
You need protection from the smooth assassin
Who really moves at action blastin mothafuckas
Execution fashion
Now whos the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mothers wake smack you
Then Ill wack you with my snub 38
It doesnt take much to make me restless
Look at my face and definite lose your breath
Truck up my face is Lexus
You want to test this so really
Ill make one call and have the whole Wu comin on the ferry
Im very dangerous and wellconnected
I puff an L with Method
Then try to decide whos next to fill his neck slit
So respected and admired the boss retired you lost
WuTang your Terror Squad vaya con Dios
We gettin knots like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here thousand and one
Corner son fake a jack you be a goner
You guys despise guys like us
Guys like us disgust like Spartacus
You cuss and claim a bust
You lust for a part of us you thrust but cant touch
Plus we far from any type of fellas you can trust
Put the pressure on the mic I biz press to your chest
Sound like sweat on my back were having sex tightass flex
Pretty Pocahontas pussy sweet like my new TEC
Sis got curves like a GS 300 Lex
My bodys 95 alcohol 5 cancer
Sosa diamonds Getty Lucci blaze it up like Bonanza
Catch me in the cut easy Gs is burnin my gut
As I remember my menagetrois was minded by sluts
I questionmark your heart punctuate your fate
All your verbs and predicates done as well as you pronunciate
NOF were gonna break you off the isle
Take COs hostage Arab style no surrender
We gettin knots like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here thousand and one
Corner son fake a jack you be a goner
Yo Im all about business and enterprisin
Advisin financial advisors on franchisin to widen their horizons
Divisin ideas with masterminders
Movin on a stash with Diamonds
First we get the cash then we laugh like mynas
Dont get me wrong Im a funny bastard
But when it come to money done Im not the one to laugh with
Im after for what cash can bring me brothers
Me and my demon lovers blast and laugh like hyenas
Back to Ringling Brothers
Believe them others youre the best
Yes and still Im investin mils on a hunch over lunch
Puffin on a Chesterfield
Who want test the real scandalous
Im at the Sands in Los Angeles
Plannin hits with anonymous philanthropists
Spanish kids close to God like evangelists
Choppin niggas up and makin sandwiches
We gettin knots like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here thousand and one
Corner son fake a jack you be a goner
