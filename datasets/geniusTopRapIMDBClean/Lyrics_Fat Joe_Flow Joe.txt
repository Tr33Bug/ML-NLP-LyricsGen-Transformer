Bust it check it watch how I wreck it
Niggas watch your back shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie sucker wont face me
Im so much flavor you can taste me
Im underground like a gutter
You never catch me stutter everybody knows that Im butter
Im not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe the labels Relativity huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
Im burnin hot people think I have a fever check it
If niggas wanna front then come with it
If youre havin second thoughts well then forget it see
I dig in my crates I dont perpatrates
I got shit sewn like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Koco yo Im not a slow boat
Got so much dough I vacate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come Im not the one
We can do this with the hands or take it to the guns

Everybody knows Fat Joes in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
Im livin in the Bronx on an ave called Trinity
My name rings bells within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin mono
Together we gettin dough just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me yo youre dope Joe
But Im not a car so I dont get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint no Im not a sucker
Never liked ball so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own never sweatin nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way I can kick it that away
I kick a funky style from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninetythree its all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse Showbiz and AG
Gizmo Little Hec and Kool Mikeski  say what 
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around then youll catch a beat down
See I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up hell get smoked like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man then youll end up in the cemetery
And thats word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves Ill go out like a troop
So act like you know the name is Fat Joe
I can flow I can flow I can flow


You gotta flow Joe you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe
You gotta flow Joe you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe
See I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad I make you wanna wear a vest
Cause Im too hot to handle
Knockin niggas out like Livingstone Bramble
Rappers come heavy but yo I weigh a ton
I wont lose weight cause Im not on the run
Im on point like a sniper hyper than the hyper
On the DL overlooked by CCipher
Never get caught Im on top with my game
Flip a fat ride theres no need for a train
Rappers come close but they just cant make it
When it comes to the funk you know I wont fake it
Peace to Serge and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe cause Joe is livin Fat
Niggas gettin jealous cause I got a contract
But I dont sweat it I know the style is raw
You cant compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninetythree they should free John Gotti
If you step battle and Im gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow
You gotta flow Joe you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe
You gotta flow Joe you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe
You gotta flow Joe you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe
