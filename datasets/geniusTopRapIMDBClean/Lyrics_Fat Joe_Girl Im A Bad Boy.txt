Terror SquadBad BoyJoey Crack
Girl I gotta do what I gotta do
Change my life  Change my life 
Make things right  Make things right 
And girl Im a bad boy so I gotta do what I gotta do
Risk my life  Risk my life 
In the late night  In the late night 
Cause girl Im a bad boy yeahhhhhh
I know at times you feel stressed out
But Im tryin to set you up so later I can buy you up this guest house
But for now I gotta hug the block
I know you sick of visits from undercover cops
Runnin to the kitchen tryin to hide the box
Just give me a minute and Im gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but lets be real
Aint no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal
I gotta do what I gotta do thats whats up
Whats with this new attitude you know bitch that is whats up
Im a Bad Boy like Mike Lawry
How you think you got that rainbow Louis
Not with a legal jobs salary
Ma we got you stuck off the realness
You know the infamous
You heard of us
Its your Bad Boy business men
Me and Joey Crack gettin benjamins
Sittin in the Vanquish the same color as cinnamon
Ma Im tryin to be your knight and shinin
To put you in the house on the Cayman Islands
Spend your whole life with stylin
With that light that got me
Through it all you was right behind me
And ma I know I gotta change
But right now a nigga is dealing with alot of things
Its not the same
Girl with me you can achieve whatever
But I cant change Im a Bad Boy forever
adlibs from Fat Joe and P Diddy 
Now we livin up in Jasery
In the tv in the car got the game on starrin Marbury
And your ring gotta rock the size of strawberries
Everything that you want I got it dont worry
And I know it aint about the chips
Just my way of sayin thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And Im reminded why everytime we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
Its more than a crush
Its all about us
Its love and trust
Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice
But Im gonna be a Bad Boy for life
