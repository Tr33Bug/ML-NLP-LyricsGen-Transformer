Ha Ha  Slow Down Lyrics
Ayo it took A Keys and JayZ to get this city poppin now
Rob Base Snoop Dogg to get it rockin now
Big money talking Mayweather Paquiao
Gucci soft up cause he cant hard top it now
Now what you boys got a death wish
I beat a muhfucka uglier than Precious
Real nigga you can find me where the X is
Whippin in the kitchen both hands ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I dont buy stocks
Tell a little muhfucka get his shine pa
Goodfellas hood fellas livin on my block
Nigga got a problem I solve em  solve em 
A couple keys yes nigga well rob em  rob em 
Got the 9 milli in my pants case you niggas wanna dance
Leave a muhfucka shakin like Harlem  Harlem 
I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams Whats up
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Always on that blow shit Jeezy Montana
Cocaine capital that would be Atlanta
One triple O where Im from thats a homo
Nigga catch ya slippin where Im from thats a no no
Next up a homicide aint nobody seen shit
Wake up to a homicide aint nobody dream shit
Welcome to the home of the home invasion
DEA like to raid you might get your home raided
Went up in it like a halfback from the Raiders
Bring a half mac anything for that paper
Two door Phantom Avatar blue though
Parked outta space shit we call that bitch Pluto
Grown livin legend in the hood Im a hero
On that minute fourteen like a guitar hero
Came a long way from that toilet bowl white though
But Ima be all right though
I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams Whats up
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Always on my hard shit Joey Viagra
Pull up make em car sick abracadabra
Presto magic Bugattis on the scene
Parties all around me like its Gotti on the scene
Your money NBA NFL all legal
My niggas on the block goin hard pumpin diesel
However do you want it
Joe stay blunted I gets off but the hoe stay on it
This is my castle but it aint white though
Ice so bright shit shine like a light show
This my life yo go get yours bitch
Ball til we fall til the drugs hit the ball pit
Cocaine cowboys thats my thing
Do it for my niggas locked down in the bing in the state
In the Fed pen my name rings
I dont need your respect the streets crowned me king
I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams Whats up
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
Ha Ha  Slow down son you killin em
