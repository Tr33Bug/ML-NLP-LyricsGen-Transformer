For such a long time now
From back then to now in my story
Straight from the hood
Youve always been there for me
And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasnt anything
It was you that kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yeah
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now its skyblue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
For sweepin them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que on that red carpet

I never told you
But you was there for me
Whatever you need I be there for you
