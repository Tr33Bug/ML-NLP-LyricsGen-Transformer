Bouve on my wrist Instagram that bitch
Instagram that track Instagram these racks
Fell up off that balcony ass so fetch your bounce right back
I got hoes off of my water bracelet all on my anckle
Fuck parole that striperpole I love them hoes to their anckle
Instagram that ho Instagram her mama
Instagram that bitch on the top of the whip while she giving me knowledge
Alexander McQueen hundred racks in my jeans
Andy Warhol on my wall so all yall heard the bitch scream
Drake told me she look good
Homie on that camera
And I dont even got hoes got this Instagramer what
They hoes all on my phone 
She want a nigga with cash so her questionnaire I pass
Diamonds all on my fingers
Diamonds all on my Jesus
No miles on my Beemer never disrespect my genius
20 rooms in home plenty room for my shone
She posing all in my mirror sendin pics to my phone
Givenchy all on my back
Versace all in my bag
Margiellas all on my feet
Never interfere feel my cash
Fountain blue I floss
Prostitutes dont charge

Five days on my yacht
Cash money I talk
I just instagram my shit and let them broke haters just watch
