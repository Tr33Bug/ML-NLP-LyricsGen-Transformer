My stripes show like regiments military intelligence
Murder game I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my preschool even talk to my old principal
Hed tell you how I used to pack a No 2 pencil
Stabbin students grabbin teachers Catholics preachers
In the school staircase cuttin class passin my reefer
In my own class operation return they tried to say
I was incompetent not able to learn
The tables turned now got my own label I earned
Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents Money to burn
Queensbridge pay homage respect Nas is a vet
Acknowledge the rep polish baguettes
Niggas is this and that Im just the best
Puttin all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings and blood los sangres blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom to help teach in prison
My crew puff lye anyone testin Pun must die
Just give me one try now you know you done fucked up right
Ha you aint got no wins in mi casa
Qu te pasa You aint even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
Im Terror Squad beta kappa everybodys favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
Ill appear in your dreams like Freddy do no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still shshshit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter your shitll shatter
Im the kid out of the Bronx thatll stomp you to death like it didnt matter
Im even better than before iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun cause one verse dead em all

Johnny Blaze aint a damn thing changed
Ayo my attitude is subject to change
I mess around and spit twelve at the drivers side door of your Range
Six hit you the other six up in your dame
Mafia style leave you with your watch and your chains
So take heed that not only can I flow I can aim
Cause yall misdemeanor niggas cant stand the reign
Better believe that whenever I see yall Ima test you
Only cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore like shit you get kicked out the yard for
Kiss aint the cops but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soap and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table we could battle on cable
Yall hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason that shorty from The Lox John Blazin
My son cool out  What  dont beef yo throw the tool out
Lets run these niggas kidnap they work make em move out
Crushed hash hands is like glass keep the heat in the dash
Did some dirt for some work caught a gash
The flicker blocker wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God stackin up joints rack em like Footlocker
This is raw raw like fuck kid represent here to Crenshaw
Hold my words stronger than a Benz store
Relentless the anthology consolidated with the quickness
Dress up in the wig and blouse killer sickness
Lex imagination large gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist iciclist Woolrich collar
Feelin the rich work for every dollar dont snitch
Thats why broke niggas who got heart God sign em up
Start the wind up we John Blazin don up in the line up

Its simple mathematics you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise undisputed don
Im from the slums where its worse bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge twenty shot
Run up on any block disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots now I own shops
GoreTex with the lock five sixtyfour bills a pop
Im hot who wanna get burned
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin head turn
You best learn to parlay Ive had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed
