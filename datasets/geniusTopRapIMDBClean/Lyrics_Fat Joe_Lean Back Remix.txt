Lean Back  Remix  Lyrics
Stop Its the motherfucking remix
Uhh Yeah Harlem is back  TS 
Who in the world want a problem with that  Fo real 
I heard Harlem is back  You know we had to do the remix 
Who in the world want a problem with that
Yeah Eminem nigga 
Uhh Yeah Harlem is back  Lil Jon nigga 
Who in the world want a problem with that  Mason Betha 
I heard Harlem is back  Fat Joe 
Who in the world want a problem with that  Lets go 
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back come on
You know its deja vu and the day yall do
Itll be the day yall bleed
Wrist minus eighty degrees
King of Harlem aint nobody made me leave
Who else could take five years off
Cold turkey Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jakes on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Mae call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 Im a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth fore the Mae song
You play Clark Kent you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back lean back lean back
Cause hes back come on
Lean back lean back lean back
Cause hes back come on
Eminem whats up Hey
You dont want no problems with Harlem
You dont want no problems with the boogiedown Bronxster
You dont want no drama with the blonde bomber
Original Don Dada of the blonde bottle
The model from White America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Mae back to reperesent
Everything else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we dont
The best from each coast the midwest to the dirtydirty
Even further to Miami all the way back to California
Itd probably be best right now if I warn Dre  Yo Dre 
To get on the horn and tell Im about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal grab a gal right now get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way but baby I dont dance
Not that I cant theres a pistol in my pants come on
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back come on
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back come on
Ayo Remy pop but Im hot like an out of state spot
And anybody think Im not youre found in a vacant lot
You dont really wanna run with the one chick
Who smoke dutchess for lunches da castle hill I aint luncheon
Now its on it for the Terror Squad
Pun Prospect Sunshine Geddy Crack and Remy Ma
Its not a chick in the game want it
My 16 so mean put 20 Gs and my chain on it
Quick to flip I aint the average chick
Im packin a MAC in the back of the fortyfive past six
And you know I got enough goons to crush a country
Any dude disrespectin Pun he better play then run C
Bring your mans and then we handle him
Then we gon Timbaland trample em then we pull the cans in them
Lean back cause I aint never worry
See Im forever glory smackin up any chick in my territory
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
Come on
No Judas or cowardice or Cains brother
Abel is able to stop me nigga not me
Got the streets asking Damn who can top P
Summer Jam Killed it man I did it all with one beat
I guess Im bicoastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out  What 
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking Crack got one hit then he out
Nope Joey bring them semis out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmys out  Uh 
Lean back motherfuckers  Yeah 
This heres a threepeat we back at the Rucker
Its Cook Coke Crack preach it to ya brother
The Mike Moore rap and preach you motherfuckers
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
Said my niggas dont dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
Come on
Said my niggas dont dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away fuck nigga
Lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
I said my niggas dont dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away bitch nigga
Lean back lean back
Lean back lean back
