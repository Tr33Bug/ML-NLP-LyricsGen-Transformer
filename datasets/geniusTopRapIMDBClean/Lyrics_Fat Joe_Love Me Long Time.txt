You said youd love me long time girl
But now you say I call you at the wrong time girl
Oh you acting different  different  what you out here slipping  slipping 
Run the streets with these enemies and make me no difference
Show me that catalogue to hermans I cope that
They said it only come in hard top I drop that
Mama said you dont love me  love me  shit about to get ugly
Would you love me and fuck me if I wasnt getting this money
If I aint have that theory five karat earrings
Girl would you love me for me
When that money get low you started tripping
Now you walking out the door and you flipping
Even my mama said you wasnt gon love me
