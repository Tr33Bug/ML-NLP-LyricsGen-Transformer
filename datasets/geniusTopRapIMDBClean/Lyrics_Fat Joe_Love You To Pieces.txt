Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love aint
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
Thats its real
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
Soulmates are like diamonds
You never can make them
You got to find them
And your beautys  quite blinding
Its like staring at the sun on an island
And its always the little things
I could see your halo and pretty wings
Lemon crunch on your pinkberry
Thats always she really wants
Got to thank Mary
Foreplay but its so long
Just enjoy the ride
Mama hold on
And your loves the sweetest
Youre the pieces to my puzzle
I love you to pieces
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
Thats its real
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
Twentyfour karat gold edible ice cream
Thats a thousand dollar sundae
Met her at Liv
Then I scooped her on Monday
Now thats a hundredthousand dollar Sunday
Birkin bags with the tricolors
Thats just something I cant deny lovers
But this more than just fashion
Its like knowing without asking
Simple things like your feet rub
Rose petals on the greek tub
Sign says slippery when wet
So I dives in no life vest
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
Thats its real
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
Caramel skin
Hair to her waistline
Porcelain grin
Every kiss like a taste wine
I know true love takes time
If you need a heart
You can take mine
Know youre beautiful
Girl youre beautiful
Things Id do to you
Things Id do for you
Cause your loves the sweetest
Youre the pieces to my puzzle
I love you to pieces
Where you come from girl
You got to be a prototype
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
If I tell you
If I tell you
Thats its real
Cause you love aint normal
Its incredible
I love you to pieces
