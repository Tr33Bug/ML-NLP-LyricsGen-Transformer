My Lifestyle  Remix  Lyrics
TS
Double R baby D Block
Joe Crack this is history
Who got the most cars most guns most bitches
And I dont gotta pull the trigga I just blow kisses
Niggas love Jada that hate rap
Upstate tryin to get they weight back
Bout to go to ksack
Cause I made niggas believers
My voice my flow that helped your faggot ass get in the league
And I aint gotta suck dick to sell records
Get all outta character and scream and yell reckless
Listen to me Im the cat thatll sit in a tree
And shoot the dog in the head while he shittin and pee
And Im just so cool I prally could snatch Chilli
From Usher in a club in Atlanta wit no jewels
You always was puss you never was hard
You know who it is Ruff Ryders and Terror Squad
And make sure you remember this
My lifestyle remix Kiss Joe Cracks and Reminisce
Yall wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crack house
Wanna war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on and Imma show you gangsta
Hoddie down wit the mac
Boggie down where its at
Fuck around hear the sounds of these gats
Wanna clown we react  come on  fuck dat
Dont you know what you do when you fool wit Joey Crack
Im still the realest yall just pretend that you
Claim to do shit that we dont remember
Always thinkin that you running the streets
Now Imma leave you leakin under a sheet what 
Fuckin with Joe Crack is costly
No gat can off me
They learned that when I sold lacks at 4th street
A few dudes crippleanother 2 vegi
Its more than obvious this terrorsquad crew deadly
What could we do to stop it
Everything new he cop it
Convertable blue 6 before you knew they drop it
And even if they didnt wellyou would just assume he choped it
My lifestyle the shit man its truly poppin
repeat 2X
Yea yea yea
I catch you backstatge you already know whats gon happening
Aint gon be no applaud just a whole lotta clappin
You cant live my lifestyle lemme catch yor ass rappin
First bitch to spit a verse first bitch that Im slappin
Tell me how these clowns gon laugh at me
When Im flyin pass the ass pushin a pourch to its capacity
You see me where ever joey crack be
Pretty have niggas sick like oh shit thas remi 
Yup Straight gangsta  what  straight music
All that hype about your album and it aint even do shit
You might have a gun but you sure dont use it
And if givin the opurtunity you prally wouldnt even shoot it

They wanna what
repeat 2X
