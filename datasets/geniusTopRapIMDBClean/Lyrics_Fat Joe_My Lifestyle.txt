Yall wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your techs out

lapses over
Yeahughhright back at you motherfuckersughhyeah
Yo Yo I stand alone in this cold world could you believe that
Ive seen some good men get blown over Gpacks
In the Bronx where its known to hear the heat clap
And live niggas get it on with the Dtechs SHIT my lifes legendary
If I wrote down all in a book it would be very scary
What you know 16 Beamers and Benzes
Rope chain down to my dick the beef looks tremendous
Me and my niggas flip holes in bitches
Back then when I wouldnt even pose for bitches
AYO you can ask Dapper Dan who was the man
Back in 88 every other week tricked 30 grand
Even my bitches wore Gucci and Louie
My peeps already in the crowd looking for groupies to screw me
Exit the club about to cruise up the block now
With the taj stay frontin with top down
See me in that new thing with my fiancee
Ass so fat making you say Muchos GRANDE
Dont blame me blame them the white folk
For giving me ten mil for possessin the tight flow
WHOA
Yall wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crackhouse
Want a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on and Im show you gangsta
lapse over chorus
Yeah yeah uh yo blow half your head off leave you with brain damage
He got his shit rocked cause he didnt pay homage
Its the Don of this rap shit go on with that wack shit
Heard you walked the dorm in a thong on your last bid
Joey Crack is the most official
Toke the pistol for those who appose the issue
I hope I convinced you to back up really you acted up believe me
I could EASILY GET YOUR ASS TOUCHED
And that sucks aint nobody could fuck with this
Pull a Suge move and make you take a bucket of piss
For runnin your lips
Got the fifth stuck in your ribs dont make me
Splash your lungs right in front of your kids
Im a basketcase dont ever give this bastard space
Or Imma have your ass erased
Im from the Bronx amongst corrupt cops we mothered this rap shit
But still dont get enough props
All I hear is Gangsta you aint build like that
Dont make me have to pull a tool and really tilt your cap
Im from crills to crack
Youve been dealin with rap
You aint never run the streets now Im revealing your act
What the fuck
Yall wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your techs out
Bring it on and Im show you gangsta
