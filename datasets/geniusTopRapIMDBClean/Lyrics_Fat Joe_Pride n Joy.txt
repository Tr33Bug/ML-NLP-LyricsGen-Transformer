Fight then we fuck again I swear I really love her though
But youre still my pride and joy and joy and joy
Dont wanna be a player help her find another Joe
Just to prove I love her I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out itd be another blow
And that only me that Imma have to hit another store  my pride and joy 
Spend another knot hit another lot
Thats how you know if you are in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on Mothers Day

Whats goin on with me and you is real for sure

Before you steal my pride and joy
