Salam Aleikum Joe
Whenever youre in Dubai
We have a zoo in the house
We got tigers called Tyga and Kylie
We living life
Yeah uh
Pulled up in the big boy drop to the big boy yacht
Too many Patek Phillipes I make the big boys watch
Villa suites in the Fendi chateau
Now ask Big Meech what he know about Joe
Im fly like Ye get mines with Jay
Got every pretty bitch tryna ride my wave
Gotta have slim waist and the face Sade
Lay up in the crib and menage all day
Went from nothin to somethin now Im pushin the button
To the Wraith and the jewelry like a safe
Its a hundred on the hate but Im zoned on the cake
When Im gone Im gonna miss yall like the gold on the Cristal
Hit Avi told him switch dials
Green prawns in Philippe Chow
It aint shit to me
No Drake but the P is free
She got cake well its somethin to see right
All I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder damn its super there
When you send a text I get so excited
Yeah I got a new flex and I think I like it
Yeah all I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder damn its super there
When you send a text I get so excited
Yeah I got a new flex and I think I like it
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah Im so excited
Yeah I got a new flex add it to the cypher
Yeah I got a new flex and Im so excited
Yeah got a new flex and I know I like it
Ever got head in the Wraith Well its outta this world
You dont believe me Then ask your girl keep it a hundred
All she wanted was a real nigga
Im prayin every day not to kill niggas
Blocka
Everything Fendi from the lights to the sofa
Everybody fly put Fendi on the chauffeur
So sentimental make her cry when its over
Biggie Hypnotize still feel her thighs on my shoulder
Throw money at these hoes but I dont do dances
Keep threesomes on my mind like the hat on the Chance kid woo
Yeah we back at the Grammys
And this time Im bringin back home three for the family right
All I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder damn its super there
When you send a text I get so excited
Yeah I got a new flex and I think I like it
Yeah all I know is how to keep it super clear
Good head on your shoulder damn its super there

If you dont want no problems boy dont get involved
Now everything aint Gucci this a different star
Im about to go Carmelo boy and risk it all
Bitch so bad I could risk it all
If you dont want no problems boy dont get involved
Now everything aint Gucci this a different star
