Step into my zone and get blown my ways are internationally known
Yeah in case you havent heard or read
Have an appetite for beef and get handfed lead
Rapidfire echoes through your vicinity

But its always room for riches and deep ditches

Declaring war on cocks and leaving chumps slain

The streets are full of vengeance and its expensive
If you dont organize your words right in your sentence
Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost
Who said an arm and a leg was a high cost to toss
Things are done different in my zip code
Hollow tips implode dumdums explode
Now your crew is screaming like they see demons when I reload
You cant comprehend act like you want it for clarity
Im pushing wigs handing out jigs like charity
You best to get your groove on or get moved on
Or play the hot steppa and die with your shoes on
I collects ass and cash
While my crew consumes liquor and hash and keep the stash
Whether hustling or dusting we get busy with ours
TS TAT respect for miles
The Bronx is the turf South is the area
Bring ten bring twenty the more guns the merrier
Nobodys bad as me no cops nabbing me
Front if you dare and Ill change your whole anatomy
For real uh
