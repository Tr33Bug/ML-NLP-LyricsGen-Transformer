Terror Squad
Ungh
Now why you wanna go and fuck with them
Platinum status motherfuckers
Eat a dick
Now whos the underated pro
They scared to play on the radio
Who lives the lyrics
All my real niggas already know
Flow for flow
No crew can step to us
And blow for blow
Im pretty sure that you heard the rumours
I give tumours to niggas and comas to bitches
No ones against us
Roll with the riches or float with the fishes
The revolution has started thats why Im undercarded
My Squad will turn to the most feared into the dearly departed
As hard as they come
They all fall like the Great Wall
Make no mistake
I take you straight to the state morgue
Swarmin informers like cops at drug corners
Feds got the bugs on us
Tryin to lay the law up on us
They want us in jails with bails too high to bond but am I the Don
Shit
Ill be out by the morn
Word bond my game is on lock trigger ballcocked
And its never ever gonna stop
Yo yo I play the game with caution
Sun changes gave power creative activities
Bring fame and fortune
Why cant you live this
All day hands on bitches
With financial ventures
Enhance the riches
Gotta hold the cake
My grandmoms had dreams
But it seems I couldnt graduate or go to Drake
It hurts at nights
I gots to reimburse the rights
Niggas is worse than shiest for the merchandise
My words precise
Cause if not I wouldnt speak it
I rock shit everyday of the week
Especially the weekend
Outside its pretty clothes I live
But with the tittyho
Knock a nigga out for the shit he stole
We already degraded
Me and my family the most hated
Bitch we barely both made it
See to them we relate to everything in the street
Im sellin coke crack to dope plus swingin the heat
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
I thought you knew we had
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
And it dont stop 
I got rubies on my Uzis and gems on my Mack 10s
Diamonds on my nines and golden bullets just to match them
Platinum magnums with silver clips
Real begets
Shit Im gonna milk this bitch till Im filthy rich
Filled with chips from the floor to the ceiling
Just flossin and chillin
In a Porsche full of women
Im one in a million
Het on the deal already
My skills are sharper than a steel machete
Realer than the military
Killin every track Im on
Link and Joey Crack the Don
Pimpin in my Cuban Caddy with the hazards on
So come on if you gon ride with us
Live niggas
Hop with us
Quick to try to triple five figures
Your style is unoffish
Niggas like you stay on my wanted list
Pun the prince be barking on kings like a son of a bitch
Fuckin with this is hazardous to amateur battlers
Average niggas get lost in the course of embarrassment
Course you dont have a chance
Im the boss and your eminence
Get tossed in the ambulance
With the force of an avalanche
Ill torture your fragile ass
With rhetorical paragraphs
For all of you thatll laugh at an historical aftermath
I come equipped
My tongue and lips are like a hundred clips
Look behind you Ill blind you like when the sun eclipse
Aint no second chances
I glance at niggas make em wet they pants the
Chances are slim if twins dont swing the rest of the ransom
The best and the champion that means Im far beyond
Dionne read my palm
Told me to get on and put my army on
Come along
Follow the Don my motto and song is fuck tomorrow
Cause todays almost already gone
Lets get on
Split your belly with the machete long
Tear your arms of your shoulders and tell you tohold on
I know its wrong but it feels so right
I used to bust steel all night but now I gotta deal alright
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
I thought you knew we had
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
And it dont stop 
Fuck a Toe to Toe
Give me a fortyfour and a foe to blow
To make it more dramatic
I quote Jehovah holding the scroll
Open your skull
Show you shit you aint supposed to know
Break the world in half and split the ocean from coast to coast
Just to let you know that Im zone coasting
And play the visuals from the top of my verse back in slowmotion
Assassinate the Pope with no emotions
So why should I hesitate to crush your campaign like I wasnt votin
My brains floatin away above yall niggas like I make time pause
Checkin my Rollie watch my diamond Roman digits
Golden riches
Better hold em bitches
Cause we robbin niggas way before the translation of Holy Scriptures
I was Armageddon before the motion picture
The last nigga to drop his verse and have the globe shifting
My Squads hard and far from Puritans
Robbing and killing men like we proud to be Americans
We got drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
I thought you knew we had
Drug dealers and bug niggas who love dealin
Slugs killin ya touch feelin just for the thrill and
We bust villains dump bodies in crushed buildings
Terror Squads everywhere its just us illin
And it dont stop
