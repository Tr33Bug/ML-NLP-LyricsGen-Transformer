Yeah uh
I bet you thought I left you hanging
Yeah yeah yeah
I bet you thought I left you hanging
Terror Squad again long overdue baby
III bet you thought I left you hanging
Don Cartagena bringing you the best in hardcore hiphop
JJJoe Crack returns banging
Yeah uh
Yo its the Don of rap sipping Cognac hit you on the back
With the MAC  Clack clack  slip you into cardiac
Its the art of rap at the illest form
From a killers point of view who thrives off the area jealous ones
You could tell its on from my introduction
Hibernate the junction with killing something when you was barely dumping
You aint even nuttin to worry about
I flurried your mouth with about thirty right in front of your house
Then Im hurrying out in the expedition professional hit men
The vestibule shit from the credible disses
Federals is listening to my conversations taping all the songs Im making
Shaking down every ounce of my congregation
John Blazing raising the stakes changing your fate
Tied up in my basement with a gauge in your face
Make no mistake thats how I do my thing
Blow out a lot of brains Im saying its not a game
X2
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Uh uh yeah
Joe Crack taking a L and make Tone roll over in his grave never that
TS shatters dreams and discourage the brave remember that
I been busting guns since the infamous days of leather hats
Varsity sweaters with big letters black
Pushin the illest whips down fiftyfifth
Where killers riff without havin to split Phillies and sniff
And Willies who shift jobs from Chili willing to leave you stiff
Fulfilling my biggest wish in this illegal shit
Quarter Maris stay slugger with karats never offered marriage
When my corpse is carried my momll get all my cabbage
Terror Squad is savage draped in the finest of fabrics
Floss like its a habit eight shot up in my Louis baggage
You knew we knew we had you lay half your crew in gravel
Caught you slipping with your boo and started shooting at you
Out of captivity left Relativity
Now we on the Bigger Beat Terror Squad trilogy what
X3
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
