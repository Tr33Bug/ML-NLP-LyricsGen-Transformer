Im sleeping on a billion dollars
Coka
Im eating
Crills mania
Im eating
Im sleeping on a billion dollars
And I say right about now New York City
Oh no oh Joe he did it hes back
In the back of that black Maybach tripping
Now blow that motherfucking kush up in the sky
La la la la la la la
Bumping that Kanye you cant tell me nothing right
La la la la la la la la
Hand on the shotgun and Im riding shotgun
Uzis banana clips what what I got some
Bullets are wholesale food stamps coupons
Yellow mustard Phantom car it Grey Poupon
I can make it Pacman Jones in here too long
We up a hundred grand whenever I hear a new song
Come one come on theres too many ringtones
28 what you want me to tell you
Make it rain Mary Anna go and grab an umbrella
Ella ella ella holy shit
So much coke a nigga have to shovel it
So much coke a nigga change his government
Now we can all sing along for the fuck of it
Crack crack crack crack
Hey this is the crackhouse welcome to the crackhouse
I mean Im talking more pies than a frat house
This is a problem this is not music
I hope you find it cause he about to lose it
Joey dont do it Joey done did it
Joey keep doing it until youre done with it
Bring them to the crackhouse show them the crackhouse
Take them to the crackhouse we in the crackhouse
You gotta touch your toes or Im out
Fuck a club I got a strip pole in my house
Six million ways to make it rain hold up
Conflicts in my chain from Angola
Convicts in my plane when we roll up
And they hustle yay not vitamin water
Fat cause Im so rich rich cause Im so hood
Uzi your whole whip nigga Im that hood
You flow cold but Joe flow sicker
Even Reverend Al be like Joes that nigga
John Gotti Supreme Team show
These are the niggas you compare to Joe hello
Hey this is the crackhouse welcome to the crackhouse
I mean Im talking more pies than a frat house
This is a problem this is not music
I hope you find it cause he about to lose it
Joey dont do it Joey done did it
Joey keep doing it until youre done with it
Bring them to the crackhouse this the crackhouse
Walk them to the crackhouse we in the crackhouse
Get em Joey just get em
Get em get on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them
Hey Weez just stop right there

And thier times tickin like an Audemars
First nigga pop up and we gave him the piece
Next nigga pop up leave him under the sheets
