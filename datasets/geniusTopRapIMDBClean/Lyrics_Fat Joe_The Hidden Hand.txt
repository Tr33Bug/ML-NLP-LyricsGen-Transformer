Yea time to educate the youth  Speak on it God 
Cause if we wont then who will  True 
Terror Squad style yo
Speak on it God 
Yo I was a wild adolescent blessed with the foul essence
Messin around with the wrong crowd I learned my lesson
Stressin all the things that I have not
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot
I hear mad shots homicide come and play Matlock
But never crack the case cause the defendants a bad cop
You feel me fam The devils got a plan
Thats why Farrakhan formed the Million Man up in Washington
The Hidden Hand even planned this man
Have me goin hand to hand killin my own clan
But now I understand and see the big picture
Fuck cryin about the struggle I teach you how to get richer
Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple kids robbin coppin capsules
Rockin tattoos boppin with ankles locked in shackles
Got the cops joggin at you spittin rounds of clips they down wit it
New clownsll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit
Now its been written that all men are equal but then its legal
When they beat us and treat us as if were different people
We go for delf fuck the cops health
Id rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts
Cause God dealt us a helpless hand they made us sell this land
So the palest man could build a selfish plan
You know we cant trust the government cause Uncle Sam is smugglin
Drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him
Even McGruff is in it gettin a percentage
Takin advantage punishin just blacks and hispanics
My heart is cold as ice so I know Im sheist Big Pun was the kid
That no one liked my whole life is one big roll of the dice
Payin a price twice as expensive as white kids
Destined for Rikers not knowin my existence was priceless
Its like this my soul was lifeless I earned stripes
Fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice em in half and make em dash
Like hyphens invitin any rapper to Clash With the Titan
The writings like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson
Im hypin the crowd keepin em Loud like my label
Im proud Im able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto
I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family
No more wars and renderin tears to insanity
So keep the salary and tear the mic cause I love it
Theres my life you judge it fuck it Seis I dont want it


Im a Dominican stranded in New York like Gilligan
Dont wanna get locked up in the pen again
But here they come the badges and cuffs searchin for guns
Turnin they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs
They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin heat
Four deep we puff production my cheek you know my steez
Fuck the police usin probable cause to break laws
Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war
I got somethin for you boys in blue
The system poisoned you blew your cover now what you supposed to do
I never let the faggot pull the trig first
It wont be no American flag over my hearse
Whats worse you know they disperse for bucks
So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks
This dude he had the darkest pads
Who dressed up in the heart of brash
Forever talkin trash
How he stacked niggas to almanac
Gunshots to corner four police informants
Stood like he modeled the latest fashions sidewalk sideshow performance
He raised to pull a graceful razor blew his face
Four is commissary plus a pack of dadundaduns laced with toothpaste
Life aint to be gambled son you could get trampled
By people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel
Thats what his poppa said whose locked for droppin Ahmed
In the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed
He aint listen he became a braindead cocaine head
Older Mexicans knew they killed him eatin bacalaitos
But hey little kids dont follow these dopes
What Uhhuh yea I can dig that
They call me Prospect I just came back from New Paltz
Had this track on pause now Im back on course
Its lost on the Ave tryin to take my life from the past
Get this legal cash look what I done grabbed without dad
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity
Only if he had one love trust for liberty
This world would be a better place get what it takes
In a race to racism replace the snake in em
Bad ones want to spend lives and discriminate
Im tryin to keep this positive vibe and from that
I generate to the top like Puffy wont stop
Im mature now with one knot from tryin to get locked
And to the shorties on the block tryin to twist 40 tops
Get your act together do some carpentry with a Black n Decker
And stop speedin like a Kawasaki
From my life to your life Im touchin everybody Twinz watch me
Everything we speak is the truth
From Prospect to Munroe here in a hot second
The whole world run know everything we speak is the truth
Terror Squad
