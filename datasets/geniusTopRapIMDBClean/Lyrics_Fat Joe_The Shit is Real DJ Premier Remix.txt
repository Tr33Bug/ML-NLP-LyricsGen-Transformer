The Shit is Real  DJ Premier Remix  Lyrics
Hey Joey
Yeah
This is goin out to all the live motherfuckers know what Im sayin
All the real niggas Bronx Brooklyn Manhattan Queens California
La Perla Puerto Rico whatever the fuck youre from know what Im sayin Yeah
The story takes place back in the South Bronx
Where at the age of fourteen I was already to knockin off punks  Yeah 
And suckers were scared to death
Every time I walked by I hear them niggas take their last breath  Ahh 
See I just didnt give a fuck
And if you had a sheep skin or leather bomber you was getting stuck  Word 
That was the way it was
One day I went to visit my aunt and stuck up my cuz
See shit was fucked up back then
No matter what the fuck I did I never had no ends
And my moms was on welfare
Ayo I knew I had a father but the nigga was never there
So what the fuck was I to do
Im sick and tired to being the bummiest nigga out the crew
I gotta get mine I gotta get cash
I see a old man Im gonna rob him with the quickfast
Gimme your motherfucking loot papi
Im gonna get paid and cant a damn thing stop me
See Im tired of this poor shit
And who the cops Well they can suck my motherfuckin dick
Cause all them niggas ever do is harass
Thats why I get glad when I hear somebody smoked that ass
Just to let you know how I feel word em up

Keeping shit in checking order
And my main man Tone was fucking everybody elses daughter
See everybody knew in town
That Joe and Tone had shit locked down
And a nigga wouldnt test me
It seems like every other day the fucking cops arrest me  Yeah 
But the shit would never stick
I make one phone call and be out right quick
Cause Uncle Dan had my back
And now niggas gettin jealous cause they know Im living fat
Talkin shit around the way and on the block
But never in my face cause they knew I packed the Glock
And my crew is mad deep
