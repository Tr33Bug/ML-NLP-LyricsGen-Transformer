Since day one niggas doubted the Don
Cause I was anon now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadriplegic any squad that wanna squabble when Im heated
Not even God can believe it the way we regulate
And levitate heavyweight niggas like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thing
Its the paid game to amputate more body parts than gangrene
Yo this a mans game its a shame how niggas truly mock me
But who can stop me from breakin niggas off like Fujiyaki
My crews probably the only niggas that really live the lyrics
Niggas really fear us they mustve heard we really killers
Were Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army colors Willie niggas that laundry dollars
Im Nostradamus predictin the future my position is crucial
With a nonfiction obsession addiction to shoot ya
Hey yo Im better off dead than givin the feds the satisfaction
Subtracting my freedom have me missin in action
A fraction of yall raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of yall fear war and couldnt follow out the protocol
Joe the God is like the angel of death strangle your neck
Thats why Don Cartagenas the name you respect
Ill leave a pain in your chest thatll make you question your threshold
Flex like you bench four still bless you like a chest cold
We destined to explode thats why I stay on flip mode
You dick rode me long enough Dunn now you can let go
X2
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me


Uh uh uh yo
Somebody hold me back Joey Cracks about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max n better out for the ass n cheddar
But fast cash dont last forever
I asked the felons if I dont stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers I got all the ostriches acting jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompsons flown back from Paris
Dat dats the illest these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine  to climb
Especially in time with the recipe in mind
From the jump start they aint have to pump heart in this
I was a part of this and marvelous stats it wasnt hard to miss
And yo I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu A record deal they couldnt lend you
I had to burn my Glock and earn my spot
The time flew by had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume I run into that bitch named Desree
She aint believe my dream was a better way
Prospectll have to collect dough
Diallin 905 to LAX with somethin I was trying to drive
A life thats trife for what I wore in the fuckin 
A thug in pain I swear to my little cousins grave
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im dead in the middle of little Italy
