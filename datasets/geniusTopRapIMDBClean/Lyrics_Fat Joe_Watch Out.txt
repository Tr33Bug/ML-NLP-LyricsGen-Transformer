Yeah
Straight out the heroin infested streets of the Bronx
Home of corrupt cops
Where niggas get they motherfuckin wigs pushed back
Even if they dont fake jax
Fat Joe bringin forth the illest motherfuckers
In this whole rap game
Hey yo Armageddon let these motherfuckers know
You look I look you invite it I took
I forever wearin it you know stone cold crook
Whats truth whats lie Whos people who spy
Its life and death choose live or die
Ultimates who made em why do we even exist
When we die is there heaven or is it total blackness
For any touch theres a feeling
Touch and yall felt
We can exchange shots until our chambers melt
Theres mad tension in the air  mad tension in the air 
Over one mans stare you wanna dare yo Crack
Eject the Tech from the glove compartment
Lay out the lead spray and flame him up like arson
Its dangerous business
Opposites these strangers be bendin opposites
So put your face in mine best brace your spine
Cause opposites may attract but they dont combine
My impact so fat you feel your vertabrates grind
Now delayed second thoughts run through your mind
When my slugs connect and strike your major arteries
When my fists connect they causin major injuries
What you know Junior You not evil
Uhh the South Bronx is the wrong place to visit
I dont know an MC who has enough balls to diss it
Whether rain or shine we be bustin out nines
Hey yo Punisher hit em with that illtype rhyme
Yo I cause a bloody bath to make my buddies laugh and gig
My nutty wrathll live as long as Im a nasty kid
I blast a pig and slit his throat just for Toom and L
My skills a human I choke  puff shell puffin boom in Hell
I doom the world like I was God and throw my gun away
Then snatch the moon out the sky and blow the sun away
Me and my brothers play hardball
Strictly hardcore lyrics til Im finished breakin Gods laws
My jobs raw but I gotta do it  Im feelin high then buddhaed
So you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid
The spot I blew it at an early age ever since the curly braids
I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge
Theres dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls
Just load the Glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers
Dont stop or pause let the shotty go up his butt
To finish up punchin body blows and uppercuts
The South Bronx is the wrong place to visit
I dont know an MC who has enough balls to diss it
Whether rain or shine we be bustin out nines
Hey yo Keith Nut hit em with that illtype rhyme


Yo I cause damage raps redhanded bandit
Well Ill be god damnit I kick ass like Im yo parents
Prepare for the slaughter when my brain is out of order
Got kicked out my church
Cause I got caught fuckin my preachers daughter
Menace like Dennis on the MIC
You best run son Im sendin emcees up shits creek
So dont sleep cause I creep on New York streets
Like Im a big fat dick wack emcees is asscheeks
Yo Im that nigga thatll kidnap yo kids
Take em home fuck em good
Then send em back to you in bandages
You lose cause I got the ill street and still keep
The toast close and repa resenta the East coast
So watch your back black Bronx niggas dont play
If you ever fake jax Ill slit yo throat like OJ
