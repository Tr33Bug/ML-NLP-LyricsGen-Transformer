Rihanna Rihanna hey ho hey
Madonna Madonna hey ho hey
He is a good family man Your Honor  Your Honor Your Honor 
He does give to numerous charities  Charities charities 
He did pay back all the money Your Honor  Your Honor Your Honor 
But do it for America
For the love of drug dealin bricks to the ceilin
Tits on display relatives on payroll
Put my moms in a mansion mink draggin off the yay
Got lifers ready to kill when I say so
COs slide me cellphones
Speak Italian with my capo Jesus medallions extravagant
Sittin in the Porsche like Im Tony M
Niggas tryna X me out shoot me off the podium
From lux tees to Rugbys my crime syndicate
I grind in the mix you niggas rhymed into this
Pump cracks out the wall back at us all
In Lil Waynes crib writin crack on the wall  Crack 
Barcelona 9s but these squeeze all
23 shots off a hardened man jaws
For my Chi Town niggas Joey need a statue
Cause Joey played the goalie when them things is kickin at you
Shoot like paparazzi I go Kanye crazy
Then beat a nigga blue like Beyonc baby
Uh lifestyle of the realest
Step on Donatella when Im coming out the villa
This shit separate me from the pack
Im the reason why the HipHop Cops came patrollin the block
They mustve heard I was cookin with rock
Respective path made the 850 roof is black suede
Hair slicked back like Pat
Drivin glove zipped up speedin tickets gettin ripped up
Eatin chicken gettin my dick sucked its basic
Ronny Fieg Asics
This fucking beat make me feel like Im in the basement
These fuckin drugs make me feel like Im in the Matrix
With a long trench and a motherfuckin feather earring
You better cherish before I perish
Scuba divin off the terrace
Utilizin my athletics
Supersize me on the lettuce you could keep the beef
Cause I know youre tryna keep your teeth
I like em Greek with a petite physique
She make me healthy things to eat and never feed me meat
So I keep Chanel on the feet Im a great man
Me and Joey sit at the table then we ate lamb
Then we shake hands
Im not a stranger to the court of law
Thats how you got the word for the numbers you sellin
Niggas yellin out the window Joes at it again
Joes at itJoes at itJoes at it again
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Niggas yellin out the window Joes at it again
Said Jojo crack shits all the same
As far as rap go its only natural I explain 
These Feds want me for some Tax Evasion
