Yacht cruisin in the deep
Im twisted up I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Cant tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin off me let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin 10 for the strong
Keep on goin in on this song
Keep an FN at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born
