I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when Im with you feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy I won me a trophy
I won I won I won a trophy
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when Im with you feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
A trophy I won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
A trophy
Get to fuckin on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money dont matter its the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin fatter and I know its because of me
I know its because of me
I know its because of me got you in custody
Whoever knockin at the door they gotta wait til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that aint where we endin
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when Im with you feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
I won I won I won a trophy
I won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
A trophy
You the number one trophy wife
So its only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J Lo Timberlands by Manolo now
Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA NFL players
So every time I score its like the Super Bowl
Baby we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now thats the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike I gave you only pipe
If people dont hate then it wont be right
You could look at Kylie Kendall Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies right
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when Im with you feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
I won I won I won a trophy
I won me a trophy
Trophy I won me a trophy
A trophy
