I pour out yellow tuss I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah Hendrix
I pour out yellow tuss I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert dippin through traffic
Im gettin better Im at practice
Im workin everyday craftin
Im cool on her I done had her
Bounce back with a millio
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad Im a champion
Remember we hit up the highway we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down nigga cash out
I get on the stage and I rap til I pass out
Hit another city and another city Im just groovin
I was tryna tell you I was losin
I was gon tell you Im improvin
I done caught a vibe she was choosin
Gotta keep my pride Im a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus Im phenomenal
Once I cock and load Im the money man
Got a hundred hoes got a hundred Xans
We gon party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin kungfu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I go through
Gotta keep my pride Im a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I dont wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert dippin through traffic
Im gettin better Im at practice
Im workin everyday craftin
Im cool on her I done had her
Bounce back with a millio
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for my squad Im a champion
Remember we hit up the highway we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down nigga cash out


I never told the world about you
I never told the homies bout you not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
Thats not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
Its mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool on my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin me now
Our foundation built on loyalty you cant ruin me now
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert dippin through traffic
Im gettin better Im at practice
Im workin everyday craftin
Im cool on her I done had her
Bounce back with a millio
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I rap for the squad Im a champion
Remember we hit up the highway we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down nigga cash out
