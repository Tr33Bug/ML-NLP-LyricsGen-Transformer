First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo extendo extendo
The clip gotta hold like a thirty
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin jerseys
Like a nigga wearin jerseys
I get love way in Jersey
Crime rates goin crazy crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas made a purchase
Caught the wave I aint surfin
Caught the wave I aint surfin
You do what you want when you poppin yeah
You do what you want when you poppin
You do what you want once you cop it
You do what you want when you got it yeah
You do what you want when you poppin
You do what you want when you got it huh
I be on syrup they know it huh
Stack up some money then blow it huh
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the Styrofoam pour the syrup up
Its a dress code but that aint for us
Do what you want when you poppin dont fold up
When Im feelin the stress then I pour up
Reppin the set like a soldier
Hop out a Benz when I roll up
I wasnt splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin me nervous
I keep me a banger like Birdie
Sip out my cup and its dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo extendo extendo

When your ganggang in the chain gang shit serious

We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches
I be on syrup they know it huh
Stack up some money then blow it huh
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the Styrofoam pour the syrup up
Its a dress code but that aint for us
