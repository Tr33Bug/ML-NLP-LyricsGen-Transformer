You know

You know what Im saying
This beat is so so Metro
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money stay clean
Michael Jackson Billie Jean
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a Vette
Smoke a lot of kush  I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up ran up my check
Picture nigga getting money nigga get back  back 
Roll a blunt of chronic nigga sell a lot of crack  crack 
You can hit a nigga line order what you want
I can whip a Maserati pulling up a donk  donk
