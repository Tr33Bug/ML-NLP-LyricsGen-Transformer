Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
Sco came to me said They think you washed up
You need to go back in show these niggas who the one
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody they took my life away
People didnt even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
Thats when I did Beast Mode
Im fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain aint got Sco with me
Aint got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean man when I was OT
And Im still dealin with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon catch an armed robbery around me
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag we gettin back to the paper
Gettin back to the basics
Everything I did it was premeditated
I just knew thered come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin
I aint never had no problem with these niggas
Ive been about my guala from the dodo
Got an RB chick layin on me no photo

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where Im from to get to know a nigga

Hidin from the police
I spent time overseas hangin out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country I need this
56 nights gotta know the real meanin
I aint holding this back I aint holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio give em what they was missing
They didnt know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They aint know me in the cut they just know me from rhymin
My hard work finally catchin up with perfect timin
You know what Im saying

And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch you dig
Got the game from them old niggas

Hidin from the police
I spent time overseas hangin out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country I need this

It prepared me for everything that Im going through right now
The good and the bad you know what Im saying
Cant let none of this shit get to me
I go harder cause I know where I was at
And I know where I wanna go
