Life Is Good  Remix  Lyrics
Say she want to eat sushi I gave her enough to go shoppin
Anything she want she cashin out without no problems
How you gon love a nigga that aint got love for your mama
You can die today it aint gon save me nothin but drama  Super 
Workin on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual  Like usual 
Niggas swear they passed us they doin too much
Havent done my taxes Im too turnt up
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar she didnt wanna leave
Treat her like garbage my heart was on my sleeve
Shouldve chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep
Why should I have trust for you You aint get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you You aint kneelin to my feet
Why should I be carin when I know I cant be beat
See how the ice be glarin when I come through and retrieve
Its easy to know its us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket you niggas beneath me
Who causin a racket in Jamaica on the weekend
Half a ticket on vacation I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son right or wrong FBG shit  Freebandz 
How you gon be gang You bang if you rich whats in your bloodline
Come in with some Talibans everythin gettin gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch shit gettin scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring cost a Bentley truck Im legendary lil bitch
Hot off the thermometer lil bitch
Hotter than fish grease lil bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
Im gettin money like this cant tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like Im goin to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line cause they know Im lit
Stuffed a hundredfifty racks in your purse lil bitch
And when I wake up go surf in your pussy hit


Say she wanna eat sushi I gave her enough to go shoppin
Switchin up my bitch I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon love a nigga that aint buyin a Birkin for your mama
You can die today I swear I still wont break my promise  Pluto 
Make love on the weekend as usual
Take drugs goin up oh thats usual
Every time she come big spender
Every time I put my chains on big spender
Its cool man got red bottoms on
Life is good you know what I mean Like
Yeah hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger lil bitch woo

Dropped three dollars on a ring cost a Bentley truck lil bitch woo
I was in the trap servin cocaine I aint been the same since
I cant entertain all that flodgin
