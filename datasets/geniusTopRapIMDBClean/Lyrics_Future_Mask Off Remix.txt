Mask Off  Remix  Lyrics
Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise I swear I swear
If Young Metro dont trust you Im gon shoot you
You heard spit it yo
Percocets molly Percocets
Percocets molly Percocets
Rep the set gotta rep the set
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Mask on fuck it mask off
Mask on fuck it mask off
Percocets molly Percocets
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Dont chase no bitches
Two cups toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole nother domain
Out the bottom Im the livin proof  super 
Aint compromising half a million on a coupe
Drug houses lookin like Peru
Graduated I was overdue
Pink molly I can barely move
Ask about me Im gon bust a move
Rick James thirtythree chains
Ocean air cruisin Biscayne
Top off thats a liability
Hit the gas boostin my adrenaline
Percocets molly Percocets
Percocets molly Percocets
Rep the set gotta rep the set
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Mask on fuck it mask off
Mask on fuck it mask off
Percocets Molly Percocets
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Dont chase no bitches
Fourdoor Maybach I drive anything
Buy my Range make em go insane
Oh my Lord praise him be 
DJ EscoMoe City
Uh I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin like Pancho lookin like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon grow when I say grow
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Aint no penny that I dont touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Aint no talkin when its fatal
Havin heart I cant tell  Wait 
Half of yall might need help  Wait 
I might fall in Rodeo  Bitch 
I might ball in Australia  Say no more 
I might call her for real  Say no more 
All the ass gon unveil
Wind blows in the windows and I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 104 know who we sent for
Platinum platinum platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How yall let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin conscious albums
How yall let the braids on TV
How yall let the hood at the table
Now yall dont even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin like Im a CreateAPlayer
Everybody who didnt pay respect
Gotta fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin down if makin threats
Gotta say somethin now dont hold ya breath
I mean Im floatin I got the sauce got the potion
I got em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions and put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin its deep  Its deep 
I done fucked so much I cant sleep
I done fucked so much Im retired  Swear to God 
Im bout to live my life through Dave Free  Swear to God 
She said she broke down when Prince died  Its alright 
Bitch my hair down Prince live through me  I am Prince 
Get your ass up and be inspired  Get inspired 
You know how many bodies in the street  How many 
Take the mask off so you can see
Percocets molly Percocets
Percocets molly Percocets
Rep the set gotta rep the set
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Mask on fuck it mask off
Mask on fuck it mask off
Percocets molly Percocets
Chase a check never chase a bitch
Dont chase no bitches
Mask on fuck it mask off
Mask on fuck it mask off
Mask on fuck it mask off
Gas gone never nod off
Vengeance is mine said the Lord
