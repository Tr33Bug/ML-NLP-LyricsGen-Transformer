Ive been in the stu late workin no residuals
If we never speak again Im just glad I got to tell the truth
I aint done countin
You wanna come to paradise
Matter of fact you wanna come to Pluto
Haha
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
Im tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits aint got nothin to do with my lil child
No this codeine aint got nothin to do with my lil child
I used to sell dope at my grandmas house as a rude child
All these cameras on fuckin with my mood wild
And these chains clinkin back and forth they too loud
They know damn well this wasnt promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left eighty racks in the dresser you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Cant be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one then God will let me know
But at the same time I like to vibe with one
Im paranoid I gotta ride with one
And I had to splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
Wont get a response from me aint no confessions
Before I tell a lie wont tell you nothin
Any time I got you girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
Standin on Black Sox meet me at the yacht dock
Icin out the clock watch bitches on my cock
Yeah maybe its the drop yeah we get in our feelings yeah
I dont know how you would feel about if I aint have millions yeah
Im conversin with you I hope you hear me yeah
Keep my promise take my love with you everywhere
And hell no it aint about no braggin rights
But even if it was shit I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
Ima keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn she know what to do with me
And right now I dont know what to do with you
I dont wanna sound like Im bein rude with you
She caught a red eye leavin LA
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her bout Miami
After she came with no panty
Wont get a response from me aint no confessions
Before I tell a lie wont tell you nothin
Any time I got you girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once you part of my collection
