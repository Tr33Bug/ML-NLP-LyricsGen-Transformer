I be on the phone with Doe Boy I be telling him
He inspired me to go harder
You know what Im saying Real talk
WillWillWillWilliam
My savages my savages my savages
Im always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
Im on the phone with Yo I ask him how the trial went
Thirtyfive racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back thats how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting you must dont respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy this a letter for my dawgs how we let the money get between us
How we let these bitches get between us
How we let these niggas get between us
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it aint like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke I got her to infinity
My lil dawg caught a murder gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary I know you feeling me
RIP my granddad Quick he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me but these niggas aint doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didnt love me wouldve been done jumped ship
And its the love from my fans got me still here
Monster ah
Say Im Illuminati
They tryna make me catch a body
I dont know when Ima flip nigga
Get me some codeine and sip nigga
Big Bank saying wipe a niggas nose
My girl changed the lock on the doors
Said fuck that shit poured up a four
Aint falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me
That what you really expect
You thinking Im sitting up depressed
Im somewhere countin up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas thats my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row who would think we were poor
Who would think we was poor
Theres money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil shawty with me she a pro
Know shell never meet another nigga not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars he cant make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasnt tinted I told em aint got nothing to hide
Told em Im through with the pies
Told em fuck all of my wrongs I dont even write
My savages my savages my savages
We gon leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin
Free all my niggas incarcerated you heard me
Loyal for life you heard
Freeband Gang
We global now
