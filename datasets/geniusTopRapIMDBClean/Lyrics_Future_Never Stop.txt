I will never stop never stop
Keep goin keep goin
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks
It aint gon never stop
Tryna run a billion up until my ankle pop yeah
Youll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin we came up out the sandbox
Bringin tears to my eyes 
Made it out the trenches it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful they envy
Tryna shake the devil on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you dont feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried but a nigga been in debt
I cant get caught up inside the matter
I shouldve did better but its chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word it dont matter to me
I got so rich nothing matters to me
Im livin my second life its so amazin
I done been hit with a bullet and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure it dont faze me
I done came up out the ghetto my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil these niggas hatin
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers this shit brazy
Icyed out the Hublot these niggas lookin fugazi  Yeah 
Money stack tall past the ceilin I cant be jaded
I done came from sleepin on floors you cant persuade me  Yeah 
I been takin other niggas hoes its gettin outrageous  True story 
Rich nigga gettin caught with a bitch worth minimum wages  Pluto 
Fuckin with my ego but I never lost a lady  Facts 
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious  No cap 
Twenty percent of my dames I shipped em right out to Vegas  Gone 
You can feel the pain when Im rappin cause Im ragin  Wizard 
You can see my past and where I was on they faces  Weak 
I done flipped the truck over and crashed ducked the agents  Facts 
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist  Freebandz 
I been gettin richer each year feel like Im racin  Gone 
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldnt take it
Hard work and perseverance they aint related  Aint related 
Poppin up on Forbes is fuckin up my relations  Fuckin up my family 
Ten milli plus on a crib and its vacant  Woo 
I can see it vividly at the crib Rico basement   Woo 
Watch him get the mula I was sittin back bein patient  I was bein patient 
I was sittin back programmin my brain I was in trainin  Yeah 
I be in my coupe Maybach and I aint have to trade it  Skrrtskrrt 
Thinkin bout when I was posted up when they raided  Swear I was 
Now I Double R and Ghost it up I feel spacious  Woo 
I dont feel the safest but I feel gracious  Yeah 
I thank God every day I dont feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I aint have my babies  Sheesh 
Probably be gamblin with my life if I aint made it
Home invasions and you aint have to persuade me  Nah 
Cut it with a razor and serve it til your day
Came from whippin out the bowl Tom Ford suit and tie  Yeah 
Get my grandma to serve my dope that aint a lie  On God 
You can tell Ive been broke when you look into my eyes  Future 
Nobody done noticed til the jet was in the sky
Soaring soaring 
Bringin tears to my eyes  Oh yeah 
Nobody done noticed til the jet was in the sky
Bringin tears to my eyes  Keep goin 
Gotta tell The WIZRD its a story like a book
Tears in my eyes
I cant forget where I came from
I lost a lover its alright
It cant be worse when I lost my main homie to the streets
You shouldve never give up on me without hearin my side of the story
The WIZRD 
I cant forget where I came from
Freebandz
Bringin tears to my eyes
