You know how we be rocking ya heard
Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac panoramic no panties
Old school Chevy 55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it cause you know Im getting at it
Throw the fork on it then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didnt do it to yourself thats tragic
Hope you didnt throw away what we established
Hope you wouldnt turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look round here theyll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother young nigga
I just wanna see you happy I just wanna see you happy
Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
Bout to get it straight finessed tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle
Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy where ya mans at Heard that the feds got em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex better check your peripheral
Its a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones aint gon see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
Fore you gon knock someone down
If they gon shoot then shoot something
We better hear bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga no wonder
Hoes getting Xd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk but we wont say nothing
True to these clips niggas wont say nothing
Niggas true to these clips niggas wont say nothing
Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel Im a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freebandz RocAFella
Told a young nigga Freebandz RocAFella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the Front Street where Mama said Dont gowe went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack then we went there
Shawty dont fuck with these folks
These niggas be telling these days be telling these days


Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy where ya mans at Heard that the feds got em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex better check your peripheral
Its a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones aint gon see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
Fore you gon knock someone down
If they gon shoot then shoot something
We better hear bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear bout this shit on the news or something

True to these clips niggas wont say nothing
Niggas true to these clips niggas wont say nothing
