Ride shotgun in the foreign thats a Rover
Until you gun down we gon never have closure
Got real estate downtown investing all over
I heard youre trying to talk down like I aint focused
I know you tryna play around like I aint got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers

Hope you see the path that I made I took a chance

Two cups of that dirty take a dab blow kush and
