Any nationality they coming baby coming
Ride shotgun in the foreign thats a Rover
Until you gun down we gon never have closure
Got real estate downtown investing all over
I heard youre trying to talk down like I aint focused
I know you tryna play around like I aint got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers

Im just tryna show you how to get a few Rollies
