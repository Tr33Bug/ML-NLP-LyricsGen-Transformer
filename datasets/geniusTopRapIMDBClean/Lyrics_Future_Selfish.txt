Ooh  Ooh 
Yeah
It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin ever stopped you
From showin your progression suddenly
Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels
Ohoh
Lets not be alone
Lets not be alone
Lets be one
Ohoh
Lets not be alone
Empty thoughts fill the room  Mm 
Breathe for me and Ill breathe for you
Lets be selfish selfish bae yeah  Tonight 
Tonight
Lets be selfish selfish baby  Tonight 
Tonight  Tonight yeah yeah 
I just hit the lick south of France
Currency exchange lookin fancy
If that money dirty make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals bottle standin
Came from the concrete takin chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin from your family
Broken lies aint no love without us
It will die roses turn into dust
Every night we gettin more popular
Wrong is right when it comes to us
Oh lets not be alone
Lets not be alone mmm tonight
Lets be selfish selfish bae yeah  Tonight 
Tonight
Lets be selfish selfish baby  Tonight 
Tonight  Tonight yeah yeah 
Ill be selfish lets be selfish
Ohoh ohoh  Yeah yeah 
Ooh ooooooh

Lets be selfish
