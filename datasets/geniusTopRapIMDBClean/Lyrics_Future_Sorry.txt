Aint really tryin
I aint really tryin
I was in the UK thinkin shit dont feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin hope I aint goin insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin to the floor
Tryna find a PYT I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
Its hard to breathe on my own
Its somethin bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
Cause Ive been gettin fly since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens then mail them
Take em to the hood then sell them
Fam come first you never fail them
Rebellious always respect my elders
Thats why I might treat you like Im careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes it turn black for real
Pack was too small I aint have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles nigga I got the sack for real
Money broads lawyers cost a half a mil
Fame change the family loves the way it is
Fame change a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion thats a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up every nigga usin
Grab the fuckin carbon hit him with the tool
Im not tryna argue I got issues
You see what Ive been put up against baby
You see why Ive been tryna make the rent baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint baby
Dime rose bout to get lynched baby
Its hard to caress you
All your bad energy its hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin too hectic
V12 motors my confession
Tryna identify you look sketchy
Im a real nigga its hard to accept me
Yeah aint really mean to hurt you

Aint mean to try to desert you
Sorry tryna be this way

Hot tenderoni Bobby Brown ooh

Work every day like I got somethin to lose
Oxycont got me flown up nothin new
Styrofoam cups everything is approved
Styrofoam cups everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope but I got that boost though
Ayy my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party sittin at the dock of the condo
Better not be late bitch you better come pronto
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion Cubana mi ana
Yolanda Sholanda Miyana mi casa
I dont know Spanish I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didnt send flowers
King like Mufasa messiah then higher
Goshies and Rollies yeah fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie he smashin the CO
My wrist got an ego my watch in an igloo
We took illegal got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin stone high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you effortlessly ball on you
LOtoVE hope you aint get greedy
Chasers do numbers man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi got goonies on speedy
She like it rated aint nothin bout her PG
I had it made it I thought I was jaded
Persian Malaysian Super sensation
Yah sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious I shoulda known it
I turned the pages heavily sedated
Too many clone me too many phonies
Armani on me you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches
Gold chains and rings theyre so easily gettin offended
Spendin all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around take a O from me and never give a penny
Fuck yall I skrrt off cause everything shitty
I hit my first model stepped up my pimpin
Caught her off the runway she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones runnin up a billi
Indian Cherokee clarity shinin is therapy
Mami Israeli  Mami Israeli
