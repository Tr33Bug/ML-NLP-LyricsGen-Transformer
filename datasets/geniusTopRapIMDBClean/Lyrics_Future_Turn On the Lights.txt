Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Is that her in the VIPline
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Bimmer
I dont want er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Bimmer was a loaner
Her old man the owner
And dont even drink Coronas
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If youd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib where ever
Dont get too thirsty get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see er fore I do tell er I wish that Ive met er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she aint gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need er she come through
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Send er my way
Tell er Ive been lookin for er in the broad day
Hangin with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know to keep er yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number you know I cant wait to dial it
And if we get together girl you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and its ours
Whenever you up here aint nun nobody can do about it
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she aint gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need er she come through
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
Ive tried to go to sleep
And seen er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today Ima stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face send er to me
And tell er Ive been lookin for er with a flashlight
You cant tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure when you tell er tell er we goin past the moon
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she aint gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need er she come through
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er

Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
