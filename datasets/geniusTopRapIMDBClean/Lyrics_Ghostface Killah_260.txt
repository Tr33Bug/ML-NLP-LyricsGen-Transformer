Then after I get mines you can do what you want to do

Yo kicked down the door in the spot 260
2L I heard they had Os for sale
I heard the same shit money drive a burgundy whip
Keep a low fade license plates engraved PAID
Wheres the cat from think hes from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him but he was using him
Boss Suns younger physical you know the God
He go with Tip the one who called Lover of God
Why Equality Self I know the Master Allah Now
Its time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the low I heard he got Born Original sent
Back in a drivethrough Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him dunn aliens is snatching our bread
UFOs moving in with bigger plans than Feds yo
Knock on DaddyOs door get the scope

There go the the dreads yo swindle two bags of that skunk
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Kiana whats up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a cream Honda with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her she took Regine to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes Ghostface
God forbid she safe BCW was watching the kids
Two hours later scheming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Kiana aint telling no lies last year she did a sting and a half
With Tymeek bought him a aircraft
But anyway yo DaddyO home we need the shotties nidow
When we get back throw you a thidou
Later that night stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5 meet you on the corner of Now Why
You ready you got the EJ and the machete
We going upstairs I hope one nigga is heavy
We walked in both of us looked like terrorists
Masks on second floor dun yo I handle this
Kick in the crib the whole shit looked graphical
Natural fucking a white bitch actual
Fiends chanting Do your thing Chef handle it
I shot him in the neck it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging throwing the twin cousins at his nugget fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block you lounging
Where the blow at I aint got shit stop fronting
Yo Chef throw the joint in his mouth moneyll stop stunting
Bitch hold that pit before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that show him where the paper at 
Come here Valerie you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe heres two tickets to a coke gallery
