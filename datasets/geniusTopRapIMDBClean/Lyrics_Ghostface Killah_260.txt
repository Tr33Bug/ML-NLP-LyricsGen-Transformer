Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes Ghostface
God forbid she safe BCW was watching the kids


Two hours later scheming like DeNiro in Casino

Masks on second floor dun yo I handle this
Kick in the crib the whole shit looked graphical
Natural fucking a white bitch actual
Fiends chanting Do your thing Chef handle it
I shot him in the neck it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging throwing the twin cousins at his nugget fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby

Fake cats announcing on the block you lounging
