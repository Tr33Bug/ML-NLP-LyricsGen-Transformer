GHOSTFACE KILLAH
Lemme give yall the bullshit hook for yall niggas
Check it out
The burners and the stash we bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See niggas in the place that bit my style
Well Im a singer dancer we bulletproof brothers
WuTang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pantsuh
Yall be nice to the crackheads everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches the ho aint trick enough
Word life to big screen Don tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything thats the gods honest beyond
We airin niggas out thats the type shit that we on
Official WuTang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka
I drink heavy gallons of cru play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes yo the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin for nothing then my team pull up
We all throw down yall broke niggas stay frontin
Lines come digital stupid plus aint got no jewelry on
Bet Im still live and Im coopin
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react were sippin Cognac  relax dude
Know Im with these cracks dude
Yo 12 Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo
Its the return of Bin Laden grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators roll deep with my entourage
My whole crews fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin my hand
I remember in the elevator we was playin corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin on us
Statens where the war is
Where the court systems running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I cant call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 10304 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island Im from
And yall dont want no problems with them
We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it aint no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the ville from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes encouraging skills
From rat packs the smallest crews were enormous
We hit em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those thats more sensitive to heat and shock
We grindin down to the bone my name grounded in stone
Im Mr Violence we loungin with chrome
Mr Violence we lounge in his home hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems got a jones for dinero
16zero my songs we throwin elbows
The hoes cling sho thing we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right we choose Queens
Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast he aint ghost
Its no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit witness the killing chilling crime scene
Body on the block eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster gotta blast ya cause I have to
The rat pack is back from the island of Stat
Leave you cursed dust cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncers ear off let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See its pure let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You dont want no drama Im flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash
