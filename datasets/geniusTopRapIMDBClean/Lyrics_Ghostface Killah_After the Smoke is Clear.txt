After the smoke is done
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas 
WuTang Delphonics number one
Word up big dick motherfucking house
Whaddup bench press these cats yo 
Yo god show these niggas how we get deep down and dirty
Like Keyon got his wig pushed back for 5 birdies
Yo they got a hit placed on my head what should the God do
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews
Never that dont ever look at me out of sync
The imperial industrial king got weight
Dont give a fuck like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts now Im writin darts
Like Ebenezer the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba  rapper valet the visa
My team got rides like Six Flags plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Dont touch this cracklin hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half laugh and pop shit
Readers Digest passed my book to L Ron Hubbard
It got back that the World Government tried to dub it
But devils love it boobytrap raps cover the track like ADAT
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientele my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit is piece wheres the Nobel
Oh well signin off as usual
The arsonist leavin niggas lost in the stairwell
WuTang Delphonics number one  Yeah yo yo

The greatest story ever told by me precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad get drunk speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold got beef with the globe
Met my comrade go half on this lab down in Baghdad
Flippin like a meths tab get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now hush you wanna do what My clique better bust
Underprivileged grew up in Stapleton House Village
Where blood flood the water of streets like oil spillage
WuTang Delphonics number one 
My front door was blowing the debt man spotted 55 boa
Niggas was still flowing voices echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor with the gamble the sample it shocked her
My ninjas run wild like Shaka Zulu
Some play peace like Ganj the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar solar or the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal
My brain with worth 30 billion
WuTang third battalion rush like Hannibal raiding Sicilians
After the smoke is done
WuTang Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
WuTang Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and WuTang still here
After the smoke is done
WuTang Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh  Wuuuuuu wuuuuuu
