What they give you blood
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway You oughta be home with your momma  How old are you boy
Thirteen
Thirteen Damn the bastards must be runnin outta niggas to arrest
Yeah ohh yeah this goes out
To all the families that went through the struggle
All that I got is you 
Yeah from the heart
And Im so thankful I made it through 
It was all from the heart everything was real
Yo dwellin in the past flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that Id have a baby girl and three sons
Im goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my Old Earth had so many seeds
But shes her own woman due to me I respect that
I saw life for what its really worth and took a step back
Family aint family no more we used to play ball
Eggs after school eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasnt easy
We survived winters snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly Daddy left me at the age of six
I didnt know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasnt strong enough she just went down
Check it fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed two at the foot two at the head
I didnt like to sleep with JonJon he peed the bed
Seven oclock pluckin roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon watchin Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing every meal was no frill
In the summer free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Techs house with a note
Stating Gloria can I borrow some food Im dead broke
So embarrasin I couldnt stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin I spent stamps in stores
Mommy wheres the toilet paper use the newspaper
Look Ms Rose gave us a couch shes the neighbor
Things was deep my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy it killed me
But I remember this moms would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here why
Yeah yo


All that I got is you
And Im so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And Im so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you  Word up mommy I love you 
And Im so thankful I made it through  Word up 
All that I got is you  It was all you word 
And Im so thankful I made it through  You brought me in like this 
Yeah
I sit and think about
All the times we did without dad
I always said I wouldnt cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddys not here now
But some way or somehow I will always be around yeah
All the things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always oh
Yeah you say
You see the universe which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand
We got to keep it real and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see thats the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from heheh
Youre never gonna make it where youre goin aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And youll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again
