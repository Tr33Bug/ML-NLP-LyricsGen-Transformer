Uhhuh uhhuh motherfucker uhhuh
Yeah I see that I see that
All yall fake motherfuckers up in the joint huh
Stealing my light huh
Watch me duke watch me
Yo check these up top murderers
Snowy in the bezel as the cloud merges
FBI try and want word with this
Kid who pulled out bust a shot up in the Beacon
Catch me in the corner not speaking
Crushed out heavenly UG rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli Wallys look stink
He with his man straight from Raleigh Durham
He recognized Kojak I slapped him 5 Masta Killa cracked his Heine for him
Everybody break bread huddle around
Guzzle that Im about to throw hair on your back
Since the face been revealed game got real
Radio been gassing niggas my imposters scream theyre ill
Im the inventor 86 rhyming at the center
Debut 93 LP told you to Enter
Punk faggot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma beneath the LaZBoy where you hid your knife
Ghost is back stretch Cadillacs fruit cocktails
Hit the shelves at Pauls Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Dorothy try to judge these
Plus Degrees sessical Rasta fiends
Getting waxed all through the drivethru
Take the stand throw my hand all on the Bible and tell lies too
Im the ultimate splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring
Dolomite student enroll holding it
Aiyo this rap is like Ziti facing me real TV
Crush at high speeds strawberry kiwi
As we approach your hood the gods bail  bail 
These Staten Island ferryboats cash bail  bail 
Fresh cellies 50 deep up in the city
We banned for life Apollo Kids live to spit the real
A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks snatch em up son 20 off no tax
Dream merchant tucked in the cloud stay splurging
Rock a eagle head 6inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas vs Jets dudes slid in with one hand
Two Culture Ciphers one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up wasnt looking splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing first thought was beat the bitch up
Moseyed off gracefully New Yorks most wanted cheeba hawk
Seen the yellow brick road I stole the pastries
Same Ghostface holy in the mind
Last seen Manhattan Chase withdrew the 68 digit in the briefcase
Rawness title is Hell bound
Quick to reload around faces surround look astound
We split a fair one Poconos money gin rummy with glare
Spot the lame bit his ear
Yo and taste a teaspoon 300 goons stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms hit with the Glock spazzed in Grants Tomb
Clocked him like a patient his stocks fall hustle invasion
Knowing now we copped the block off
The chain tricolor freezing in velour icicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs rock boats under water watch clams
Pose for the standoff mad timid
Hoping that the gun fall guessing like lottery balls yo


Aiyo this rap is like Ziti facing me real TV
Crash at high speeds strawberry kiwi
As we approach your hood the gods bail  bail 
See Staten Island ferryboat cats bail  bail 
Fresh cellies 50 deep up in the city
We banned for life Apollo kids live to spit the real
