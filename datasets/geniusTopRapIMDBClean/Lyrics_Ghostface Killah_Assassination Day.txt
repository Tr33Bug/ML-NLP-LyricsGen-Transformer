Theres no coke
What
You heard me you dumb fuck theres no coke
What the fuck do you mean theres no coke
Ive been up and down this ship
Ive been in every fucking room
Theres gotta be coke
There is nothing nothing
heavy panting
Help PLEASE
panting continues
Help me
gunshot
Its assassination day I stalk
I move through the Third World my third eyes the guiding light
Invite the fight we all die tonight
The life I lives a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short Cee Cipher Power stalk plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
Were all for sale a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter from the worst slaughter
Devils poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under halfmoon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action
I stop producers careers the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark pierce the heart with silver spears
Youre bewildered my unsaturated low filtered
Devils still feel this so youre living built tilted
MCs upon their axis their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid desert dry cactus practice
You can never match this invincible WuTang indispensable
One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the doubleedged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable caution flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on this shit is like a Yukon don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb action word flowing like a blackbird
God came in aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar stay relaxed God his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra UFO spot em like Galaga
Holding like bulletproof Acuras
You so fly yeah right you want to get me high yo Bobby
You hear how Im shooting it like they blue tops
No you wont play me like your lady
Pay me 380 spit it at you like a baby final destination Hades
Wars extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
Its assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a miclike bait then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward ignorance wouldnt allow retreat
Youd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now whos best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback
Its assassination day I stalk
