Back Like That  Remix  Lyrics
Its your boy NeYo we gonna do it like this
The Roc is in the building yeah
Its the remix yo
Kanye is in the building
Yo the monster don is in the building we in here
Kanye West is in the building
Ghostface
Your boy getting fat now
I got the fat stomach and laid up eating good now
Other girl all stressed out my girl got the fat ass
Shorty mad pulling her hair out
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Im high powered put Eva Mendes to sleep
Yo pardon that bitch been on my mind all week
But back to you MAC gloss chick youre way fit
How you have everything in this world and waste it
Prince told me itll be okay Im so sick like NeYo say
Im laid back like Neo so I holla back at this Creole ho
She from the NO but she never told me NO so
We at the spot to chill where the food get grilled
She ordered the Kobe beef like Shaquille ONeal
Second I walked in the whole room got still
I dont know how to put this but Im kind of a big deal
And she conceited she got a reason
She got her hair did she got her weave in
And Imma sweat that out by the evening
You I dont sweat that now I got a new


Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Oh girl I cant believe you zoned out
Played me for this dude nice shoes and a bottle of coast out Mont
Im that Don Wilson
First one to put you up six suites in that Resident Hilton
Mink coach colorful stones and big stacks
Yeah I was fucking but you dont get me back like that
Causing me grief you know me and homey had beef
Now you got me losing my mind out up in these streets
You flamingo showing your true colors
Heard yall was ducking down low when you see my brothers
But its all good I move from ex to next
Got the baddest little chick to sign off of them checks
Fat bubble her bodys like one of the best
But I dont need to say nothing ask Kanye West
She eye candy smoother than Godiva chocolate
And you mad cause you played yourself its your fault trick
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
Shot through the heart the girl caught me
Shot through the block with him shot gun
He lucky I aint stop copped the shotgun
Killah type cat you better be glad Im not one
Had a couple stars up in my sky
She was my moon and my sunshine
Dude aint even fly he just some guy
You blamed yourself Im done peace one
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga aint friends
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Bouncing around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that no
