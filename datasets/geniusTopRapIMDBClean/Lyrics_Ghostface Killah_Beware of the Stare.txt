The slums of a big town as packed with drama and danger as the squalling street of some native quarter In the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame
He spares no one
He was forgotten but he was someone
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah
Beware son I got the stare of Medusa
With the rope tied around your neck it wont get looser
I might shoot ya make your ass an example
You cant fuck with Tone Starks and not get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in a field I hate rats
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the don Im back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies DeLucas spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons I wanna murder they daughters
Revenge all I see is blood in my eyes
Like the rise of your worst nightmare come alive
Ghostface Killah lets see whos gonna survive
He spares no one
Hes not forgotten cause he was someone
Yo look away dont stare into the eyes of a killer
Metal lungies junkies nigga I pack the nine millers and thrillers
Bulletproof robes and wave caps
Revenge mode nigga you know Ghost gon stay strapped
Hunt em down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me watch the man slaughter
The butcher the baker the torturer the taker
Imma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes miss your soul sold to the devil
Its the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel
Im immortal gonna kill generations of your fam
You tried to loathe my legacy away but I stand stronger
GFK the pain prolonger
He was a lonely man they killed him
Cause they didnt understand
Though his spirit possesses a rhythm
As the words on this record unleashes the Ghostface Killah
