Who Im is The Phenom them niggas cant live
Who Im is We aint got shit something got to give
Yall done flipped yall wig blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my badass kids freeze
Looking at your ice like Jeez
Im plotting on the mousetrap about to snatch the cheese
I heard yall kids is bout that psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at Wu til they bury me
Never tell a lie like George with the cherry tree
Now its cherry pie if its not broke let it be
Aint nothing nice in New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing that tough talk
Dont mean nothing when youre up North
So keep them hands where I can see em like you want freedom
You know that saying If you cant join em beat em
And push your way in
We aint acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slum jewels from Jacob fool
Youre like Dude I dont like your fucking attitude
Fronting on my Clan from the Stat but we aint mad at you
Yo yo Starks with the Parcheesi face measly paced old face
Ghostface Jump out the window for a little taste
The joopy look my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say Ghost you so crazy
Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls drip jewels big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose its the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home to Staten Island
Playing with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice but Duncan Hines
Didnt know Betty Crocker had the two nines
Made the club moist shattered the windows
Dustheads running
The rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming
The words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off thirtythird of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough yall aint trained to brawl
Yall more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear youre not prepared
For the project flow with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear  bullets flyin 
Yo the hard wire starting bonfires
Pull the mask so you know its me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Cant smoke with ya watch Ghost tie a rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya
Eat a dick like  HUH 
Baby shake your shit girl youre thick like  HUH 
Getting rich like  HUH 
Word its me yall
We in two sixes flirting with bitches dime plus
Taking pictures How you doing baby My name Ghost
Dont get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence slickest nigga going since Grease
Check out the grays on the side of my waves
I grew those on Rikers Island
Stressed out balled up in the cage
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam text takes jam
Silky texture Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot nose numb real as they come
Biggies Versaces snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love move in when we hug dont make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks my back all chiseled
Elbows unique now meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous Tone Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80s in front of Macys I start my own chapters
Tyco NiteGlow velvet pose special effects
Hightech armors merc you at the shows
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Dociousaliexpifragilisticcalisuper
Cancn catch me in the room eating grouper
Shoe fly shoe Wally Don Clark crew
Fuck yall wanna do crack a brew
Smoke an L or two and flip like  HUH 
Killing for the whole clique is sick like  HUH 
You and your stank bitch eat a dick like  HUH 
Baby shake your shit girl youre thick like  HUH 
Getting rich like  HUH
