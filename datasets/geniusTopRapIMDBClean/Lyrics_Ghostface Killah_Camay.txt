Love was never born to say goodbye Whats happenin
Love was never born to say goodbye Yo yeah you smokin
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am This is it
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am Another chamber
You know how we do
Yo whats the deal Goldilocks Aint nothin Im just hibernatin
Love that watch pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier
No doubt have a chair Boo lets get to pollyin
Who you with Me and Molly and some trick whos Yugoslavian
What fabric is that Its only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon fly Fahrenheit spray on
Im gettin tipsy I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transportin bricks stealin many fifties
Fuck negotiatin  is you with me Is you aint
Sweet ass carrot cake fakin plus you dont eat turkey bacon

Analyzin Miss Clairol  Fendi down mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon
Say goodbye
Love was never born to say goodbye
Love was never born
Socializin vibin with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowin up the spot
While my heart was racin like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me puttin out the pot
Peace Dot Im so happy to see you at the rendezvous
Hows life today Your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you ridin on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Riunite on ice sounds nice
She elegant pretty eyes glasses intelligent
Whispered in my ear that shes celibate
Whispered back to her ear We dont have to go there
As I grabbed her hand sat her politely in the chair
As we stopped and stare at one another black sister to brother
Im thinkin all the time how she could be my lover
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
Love was never born to say goodbye
Love was never born to say goodbye
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
