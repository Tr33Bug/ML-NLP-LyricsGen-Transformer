Tommy Mottola lives on the road
He lost his lady two months ago
Maybe hell find her maybe he wont
Oh wonder that love
Brothers try to pass me but none could match me
No girl can freak me Im just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors I attack yall
Snuck through the back door guess who they saw
Goldie and Ghost black African Rose
Starstudded low lenses plus the mural was dope
Airbrush WBs STOP  Shake your body body 
And cop a couple of these  Shes a hottie hottie 
Schott Free and Sean C very upset
Theyre sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of
Rats
I know they are over
One in the head Im fed this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick bust right through em
Come out your shirt insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr Buzzard Bacardi Lime
We passin it takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist taste and follow mine
Swallow nine model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doodoo makers stuffed inside pajamas
Theyll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile hey baby
Theyll love you one second then hate you the next
Oh aint it crazy baby yeah
Tonys his name the undefeated champion whoa yeah  Blow em down God 
Now hes alone hes just the king of his throne  Yeah aha 
Always will be my friend Ghostface Killah  Truly yours peace boo
