Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boop bum
She had an ass like Deborah Cox face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
At times she got my dingaling hard
When she said push hard she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back couldnt help her dress blew back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rocking Wallows
Drawing cards sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolemite few tips from Goines
Birthday gave her two fifty cent coins
Puppy love gorgeous face amazed by lip gloss
Cherry scent when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs Cole
Girls so pretty kids with little biddies hope the years go slow slow
Surrounded by intelligence life through education healthy minds will grow grow
Catch me on a busstop dusted cursin out the cops
But still come and vibe with me
Everybodys talking about WuTang fronting
But you still telling lies to me
Beautiful in lightshows having no intentions on love
But having strung I suppose here we go
Its not the way she bubbed the gum
Shooked her ass Im not the one
Double dutch waiting for the bus with faggot Laurie son
Now N Later lady 7th floor building 780
Fancy fox booties for her socks nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree shes a capricorn
I really liked the girl had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got  louder 
But hating was Sheneneh and Grace and Keylolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me you hit me Grace got the last hit
Eh yo the bitches started swinging and shit so I jumped in
Those were the days made faces in school plays
Paper trays city wide test made half a days
Shooting puppy water might hump the pillow dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga Ill pop her cherry for her
Fresh Air Fund nails done alphabets berets
Jellies bubble yum soda tongue too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings ayo I hit that shit
Got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broke her ChickOSticks
Guys and girls
Yall remember those days and shit
Girls walk around in school
One ponytail with the beret
Necks looking like baby powder youknowhatImean
Those were the days right there
Boston Baked Beans girls come to school with mad candy
YouknowhatImean
Youd just come in school for half days and all that
Just to see that little girl right there no mind to this
Go home and think about it youknowhatImean
May hump the bed sometimes on her youknowhatImean
Word those days man those those were the good old days right there G
That shit was fun lunchroom see in the lunchroom youknowhatImean
Might get a little go to the GO Store or something youknowhatImean
Word buy a little chocolate a little shake or something youknowhatImean
A little buttercrunch joints or something youknowhatImean
Thats that real shit G I miss those shits man
I wanna go back to school man
Thats my word man
For real yall those were those were the
Goddamn yall you remember
