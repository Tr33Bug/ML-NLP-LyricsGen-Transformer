We are the GODs
And we came to rock the spot like Ironman Starks
They be the illest emcees in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the RZA
So listen to them clear and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with WuTang Killer Beez
From where we at to my mans cell
From where we at
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists light up the mic Godacknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points Corolla Motorola holder
Play it god Epack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks player like Yanks check the franchise
Front on my guys my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him manhandle him if you wanna
Run in his cribo get ditto skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Dre
Thugs they be booing and screwing we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doingfuck the union
Its the same style RZAs train aboard jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new Bals
Especially that aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax lay back sell a grenade a dait pays black
The Mac10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands revive lands
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing em rocking his jewels like we using em
Lowpro star seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods build with the Sun Moon and Star
All these MCs start realizing
That Ghost got that shit thatll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolins finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
Ghost Face Ghosface Killah
Mercury raps is roughed then god just shown like taps
Red and white Wallys that match bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper Radio Barber
Murder sleepaway camp the fly lady champ
The arsonist who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines pick herbal beans bubbling strings
Biochemical cream we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape wicked like Nixon
Blonde heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binocularsthe rap blacksmith
Moneys Rolex was rockless Chef ragtop is spotless
Im Iron Man no diecast metal Im steelalloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deliing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians
Rhymes like retail make sure shit sell
From where we at to my mans cell
All these MCs start realizing
That Ghost got that shit thatll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolins finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
CappaCappaCappaCappachino
Give me the the fifty thou small bills my gold plate my slang kills
My beer spillswhat up Lils Murder one dun
Killer bee stung guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won third platoon soon
Cristal bottles cages of boom Papi wardrobe
The madhatter big dick style beware goons
Smuggle balloons Lorna Doones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build pull up the grill check out the mad skills
Topsecret technique too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knock our slang sweep it
Out of order tape recorder cant record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten
High top notch borderline rhymes is Hancocked
96 my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot
All these MCs start realizing
That Ghost got that shit thatll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolins finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us
