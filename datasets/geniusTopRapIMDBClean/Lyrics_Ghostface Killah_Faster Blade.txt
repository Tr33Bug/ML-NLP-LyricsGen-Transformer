You know what Im sayin You on the corners and shit ya know
Just gotta be on some handsdown shit you know what I mean
Just keepin ya eyes and ears open at all times
While we rhyme and shine
For my dedicated niggas who love this shit we doin it like this
Word up whats the phenomenon
Carry on Don tranquilizin
Ayo Movin on these niggas like they owe so bro
You know how we go we go shift em out like perico
Fine protgs off top connectin like a buildin
Four dollar whylin niggas buildin savin the children
Come on now check out the view like a oceanfront
Slowmotion in cunt takin what we want
You know a kid Asiatic holdin power like a Craftmatic
You like your fish fried or battered  That day he ratted
Check out the rubies from Diana jetskiin in Atlanta
Makin some power moves out of Savannah

Out in Bermuda send that twentyshot Ruger
Continue to slam and mend you like a venue
Get all up in you oh yeah your friend too respect Wu

Rhyme for rich niggas who supported me
Shorty pussy extorted me
So its a science now RZA cuttin they pockets like scissors
Cindafella found him a Wally slipper
Splashin ends in the glass Benz in Nevada
Flashin gems eightandahalf Timb state robber
All my life been on some foul shit besides kidnap a child shit
Get on some foul and proud shit
Cheatin many Koreans bein all that I can be an
Put down on thirty keys an get to fleein light up a tree an
Dont be breezin like a blow dryer
Yo yous a liar like Jeremiah gamin on the flyer
Yo Barbarian niggas is carryin thug drug marryin
Hittin Marion off at the Clarion
All my Spanish niggas love us

At the flick stick the usher
Broke niggas  spot em like Cascade in the street masquerade
Faster Blade
