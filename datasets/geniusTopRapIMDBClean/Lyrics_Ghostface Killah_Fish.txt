Ayo
You know theyre killers themselves
Hey hey hey fortysix hundred in there duke
How you want it How you want it
How you want it Stop that stop that
These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26000 men
Except for dope we operate in all aspects of organized crime
And if theres one thing Im sure of
Its that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end itll only lead our country into ruin
We eat fish toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglordll throw the arrows
In the dope fiend vocal cords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap smack pawns swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bowlegged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills I inhale smoke to blow on duns
You run errands Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel itll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot check this shit
I take it back to Playboy stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched raised their fists in early sixties
Now check this one you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun and flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one I step past one
Dont make me blast one Im cold like Eskimo floe
Cappavillain stay chillin take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out she fiend to blow out
But Im equipped with mad white Morris The Rat got nine lives
Ill take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker Ima do mine
Now where I come from cats be carrying
Marrying drug money fuck up your wife get four to life
Cream we handling Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit plus quick to buy shit
Chef yeah you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time play it like Canadian wine
RZAs divine now the sacredness of ones true mind
Now lets get colorful like moneygreen
High roller coaster Sosa million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah god be having my whole steez laced
Now lets rap a taste connect dots aim Glocks train stop
Figaro fly jewelin tricolor Cubans
Swerving with power Germans and Suburbans
Twentyfour niggas with vests on my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica wizzes be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and block ya goals like hockey
