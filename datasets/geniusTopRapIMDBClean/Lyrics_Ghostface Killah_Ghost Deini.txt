Yo summer time holdin the nine split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin hide your rocks hydraulic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain and touch top dollars
Hold me down hand me my cake
Dust and bake activate
Fuck your corny debates
Im like cake or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits
The kid walked through switch up his accent now Im from Paris
Cash the bill frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was yall niggas thinkin
You think I fell off the ledge
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead
Never impossible pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Galants hittin if we got to
Bustin at yall niggas daily wall to wall hawkin
Suckin your teeth cause God chaintalkin
Like Ghostface this Ghostface that Ghost sold crack
Now his revelations spoken through rap
Veloured down like the Sheikh of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans Michael Davis its me against housing
Extraordinary problack sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks Apollo rap Frederick Douglass
You know what Aiyo fuck this
Aiyo how can I move the crowd
First of all aint no mistakes allowed
Heres the instructions put it together
Its simple aint it Well quite clever
Marvin Marvin you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin ugh
2Pac Biggie ohhhh how we miss you so
We want yall both to know
We really love you sooo
Aiyo Im Gucci down Wally boots Jamaican hat long 4pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Dont speak much deluxe plush imaginations
Hold a note like Willie Hutch
You mightve bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious knowledge by 2 triple geese
Come on we juggle mics
Three Card Molly amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night Jamaica
Came through in a booger green 68 Pacer
Mad paper high as a fuck truck
Two rappers got stuck that night I aint saying no names
They know who thank you for the chains
Outdoor event New Years Eve Cali weed
30 seconds til we tear and decease
Quick call my seeds dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly we exactly
Formed like Christ and his disciples
Black fatigues lethalfaced doonie he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers droppin they drinks
On the low tuckin they links we made eighty off the books


One of the illest since Magic Johnson no disrespect
But metaphorsll keep me out the projects
Rap connectsll keep me correct
Aiyo I wrote this on Donnie roof after his funeral on one knee
Thinkin his killers followin me
So to my nigga Donnie up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here
You got beer weed guns AIDS
All these obstacles its hard to make it nowadays
Whys the Devil winnin Some say its our fault
If thats the answer you know smokin cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin cause thats how they rewind
Yall know how we dine we dont eat swine
And we dont drink wine
If you dont bring me some motherfuckin cognac Ill kill you
I cant feel you aint in my senses and you aint in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers no leashes no collars brolic scholars
Thats Ghost Deini
