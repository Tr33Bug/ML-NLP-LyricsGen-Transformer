One two
Yeah niggas dont know about Fatback
With the different color records they had back in the days
You know what I mean The beltdriven turntables the Technic joints
With the slipmats 
Put nickels on the needles so the motherfuckin record wont jump
The needle wont skip and shit
Gettin juice from the fuckin light poles
Shout out to the Bronx nigga
Aye yo this shit go way back like a Uni marker kid
Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up
Krylon bandits attack Planet Rock Bambaataa
Peace to Pelan discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch
Paved the way for Flex Mister Cee nuff of them cats
See this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twentysomething years later I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldnt stay out late I was sour
So I sat by the window heard the DJ cut
Impeach the Pres Apache and Just Begun
Otis Redding Tramp
The music stopped guess the system blew out one of his amps
Itd take a little while then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit thats all
Now everybodys back in the groove echo chamber
Check one two one two thats my favorite
Strobe lights is live Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that cleared a circle in the park and shoot five
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees Tale Lords fit the fellys
Samster Barons and Kangol buckets BVDs
Go with the Sergios like fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie
Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted
Throwing bubbles on the wall
We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother my sister
Its our duty we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark
Yo it all started at the After Midnight Philly but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly Gangster Boogie and PSK
I remember shells Gazelles top tens and lottos
Mega design reefer smoke Coqui nine bottles
84s from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing RustOleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed Truly yours
Philly smashed 87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Kick the ball with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Dukeing in the party all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
Rebel Without a Pause was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze Disco C Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging Sucker MCs in 83
I was South Philly like St Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin he was a buck too
Yall dont like how Im living well fuck you
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebodys dollar party getting into shit
And late nights shoulda been in bed
Instead I was running round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen seeing real strong images
And thats the reason for my real rap penmanship
Thats where I started it and thats where Imma finish it
