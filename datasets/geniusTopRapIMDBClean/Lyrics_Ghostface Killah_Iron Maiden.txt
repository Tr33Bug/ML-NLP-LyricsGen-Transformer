Yo Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers give em theirs
Sit back jollyin
My team be gaming like Threecard Molly and
Drug Somalians pollying
Mittens raps they crocheting
Ayo Iron these niggas portraying
But havent been paying
For real slide on these niggas like a fresh pair
Caesar fade style usually tuck grenade
Throw a blade fuck getting laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Day to day Wallies half leather halfsuede
Connecting with the high stylist dun
Light up a chalice
I run with nothing but the wildest foulest
Come on now longdick style
Niggas on the hit out ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually bust a rap gun mentally
Been doing this a century kid just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin off white BM
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Palladium style play it like thirtytwo Arabians
The greatest lesson is dont owe you might get stole on
When I go bury me with velour on

They come to me and understand just let me get mines first Then after I
Get mines yall can do what yall wanna do Fuck em up bad
Sho nuff hit the Bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade swallow raw eggs read the label
Hitting whitelabel left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing walked in my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing Im too ill see were grilling at the parlay
Kicked up mack max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote Im too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in Knowledge God sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious no blotches
My telephone watchll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor smack the juror
Me and my girlll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls we wilding
Sit back jollyin  ahha ahha ahha ahha 
Sit back jollyin  ahha ahha ahha ahha 
Sit back jollyin
My team be gamin like three card Rolly an
Drug Somalians pollyin
Sit back jollyin
My team be gamin like three card Rolly an
Drug Somalians pollyin
Sit back
Deep meditation sound orientated war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person itd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause Im PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna sona old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninetysix jive I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening I have a by myself meeting
Thinking whos gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize all competition catch hell here
Chance him thats what they said threw up a ransom
I jacked it stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards
The way I the way I wanna get em I want em gotten I want em layin
Out I want em gotten Cause niggas need to be got He need to be
Taken off of here Thats right
