Your kung fu is good
Your magic is good
That is why he waited so all my power would dwindle
My power has diminished
Then he come to kill me
Yes but
I know your kung fu is still very good
If you practice again
Noone could possibly be your match
Oh the ancient weapon
Fierce I travel across seas on glaciers
Fought shoguns and got fucked by geishas
Still gracious still able to spit out darts
Just grew tougher skin for swimming
With the sharks Broken ankle
Fucking with the wallabee clarks
Got them bitches still screaming my name
Waddup Starks Im a bonecrusher
Oxll split your face like a Dutch Master
No more mixes  polar bears from Alaska
With sharkskin Air Maxs and igloos of ice
Rocks clumped up like overcooked rice
Im nice you the reason why the game went soft
Bland niggas I come through and season your broth
Like Mr Dash I blast Im a Menace like Dennis
Young Ghost in the bathroom a 6month sentence
Rehabilitated back in the yard flying heads
With barbed wires stay tying niggas to beds
Everybody get paid everybody get laid
All these bitches dirty everybody got AIDS
Everybody get played everybody get sprayed
Everybody do what I say everybody my maid
P crackselling black felon
That clap rat tat tat tat tat melons
Some thugs one gun one slug
Shotcaller like yo let me speak to young Mugs
Listen its Mandela pa
I grab wack emcees I smack em hellahard
I kill niggas with the birdy blick banger
My WuTang niggas call me the 36th Chamber
Lyrical miracle spiritual rap dudes
Get smacked off their skateboard for not paying rap dues
P call me the gatekeeper
Break heaters on your face smoking laced cheeba


She want a thug not the lawyertype
A golden boy employed to promote and write
Sort of like an ill De La Hoya fight
Im eating good enjoying life
Flawless ice with the bag of flawless white
With no strings attached pull this might
Toy with my S550 with the raw pipe
Peeling off like snakeskin
Watch the cobra bite overnight success story
Going jet for me you rep Wally
Thats why your cassettes corny
Your money too short for long convo
You in the game hurting tryna play
Rajon Rondo Millionaire swag
Peep your boys ensemble
Jewels heavy Prince Akeem coming to America et cetera
Whoever said the kite is a messenger
Cause I think like the man behind a register
Quick to pull the toaster out
Stomp choke em out We over here
Counting Bread what you loaf about
