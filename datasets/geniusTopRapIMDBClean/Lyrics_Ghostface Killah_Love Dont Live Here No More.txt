Feelin fresh walkin down the block
Bout to see my boo its about 6 oclock
Love is love itd been a long time comin
9 long years I know she missed my lovin
Huggin kissin in the scent of the kid
She gonna fall out when she see me at the crib
Ding dong can I speak to Bamboo
Its me Penelope stop actin a fool
She said damn I thought you was dead
Not a phone call Not a card in the mail
For real a phone call Stop
You know I had to up and leave
I told you Ill be back girl but you aint believe
She told me 9 was too long and she got a new man
One who gon stay and hold it down for the fam
So scram theres no more love for the kid
So I turned my head down and walked away from the crib
Loved so many times
Ive been alone so long
Had to pull myself together
Find my heart a brand new home
Got a good thing goin on
Cant let you mess with my flow
Too little too late
Love dont live here no more
Love is love Tonys back up on the aisle 
Gone for 9 years like 9 months to a child 
Cried so many times
Wheres my boo at I need to see Bamboo 
I got a lot of things on my mind to explain to you 
Love dont live here no more
Love dont live here no more
Its like that
Okay then where you put all my stuff at then
You know I thought you know I swear hes he been doin this for too long
I done came home you got another man you know what
Oh word so you over it Thats absurd
I never did a damn thing to deserved it
This is a mans world I go away come home lookin for you
Now you fuckin up the plans girl
You another mans girl that aint kosher
Once you see the kids face youre supposed to
Drop what youre doin show your loyalty and love
Step out on the porch with a kiss and a hug
Yo you buggin
Just cant understand you know I treated you I gave you everything you wanted You know what Im sayin And its like you got another dude laying in the bed
Wearin my robes wearin you out
I know I was gone but damn I just cant get it baby
But I loved you though man and I still do though
