So they try and project the image to the public
Uhh 
That this this is being done by THIEVES and thieves alone
Speak brother Malcolm speak 
And they ignore the fact that no this is not thievery alone
True indeed 
Its a Its a corrupt vicious hypocritical system
That has CASTRATED the black man
And the only way the black man can get back at it
Is to strike it in the only way he knows how
audience claps
Ayo
Im like Malcolm out the window with the joint
Hoodied up blood in my eye I let two fly like fuck it
2 gunshots look how these niggas duck shit
One kid hollerin What lookin up he the big wig
Fake ass cat low life sodomized mind
Beatin niggas big bricks of bread sell em as dimes
His feet hurt networkin he get no work
Yo smack him where his hand hurt fuck what he worth
Yo he sucked his thumb Slew footed kid laced with the pink gums
Stuntin to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run
Plus he ill on the drums heartburn for life calcium man
Watch him grab the Tums hes a front
Pigeontoed Tylers sister with the fat ass
Show hash for Hines up the block plus he smashed her
Big Buck did him somethin deadly act premeditated
Buck 60 strike was the medley
Nice like Van Halen seen him at The Tunnel with his skin peelin
Did two days thought he was jailin
You get close look at his hands
Thats the same kid that cut his wrists talkin bout The cuffs did it
He bantam weight frontin majorly
Eyes like Sammy Davis Jr rounded off with a fade G
He sport the Bob Hope classics randown Asics
Kmart the short sleeve shit be the basics
He eat hams shitted on hisself twice
Bighatted Jews rushed the nigga out in Crown Heights


Yo let me tell you how the game go
We gettin rid of all the prostitutes
Tony wants the streets back fo sho
Too many hustlers too many thieves
Were fuckin up whos willin to fight and teach the seeds
Too much TV guns and robberies
Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy
Yo ICham punched Mase in his face over some bullshit
The other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives
Its rainin 85 degrees kinda muggy
One of the nights they thrown in his face its real ugly
Yo we up in Jonesys posin all these niggas know me
From fuckin wit Un and these niggas heavy parolees
Yo we played the speaker
And from a distance we could see these chains
The P slayed flat on his chest was two planes
Ashy hands yo no need for rings at all
He just cracked the V8 backed up leaned against the wall
Look at Flower he just came home he on it like a fuck
Did a dime for holdin up the guards up in the armored truck
Ten years later son 280 on the weight tip
He throwin up six plates plus he studied Matrix
Hes a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor
Cockeyed nigga back up his neck he had sores
Sammy eagerly rode up on him
Toxi off the turkey with the joint on him
Flower look his man stood up before him
The bitches hit the table Jah king stripped off his cables
Shots went off Samll get a chance to make his debut
Flower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns hat fell off
We noticed ringworms he hid behind Rich
CAllah hit the light switch young girls were trampled
In the mens room Poo pistolwhipped Mase and broke the handle
Desperate crawlin to the door on all fours
Shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was Its Yourz
Oh my goodness Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin
He layin like a gay model shoutin out Sebastian
He smiled with his teeth missin beggin for mercy
No more God Theres 68 thousand down at pier 3
Out came the cannon whistled out zaggin
Cham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon
Its over another story told
Lyin with the snakes tongue kissin cobras
Yo let me tell you how the game go
We gettin rid of all the prostitutes
Tony wants the streets back fo sho
Too many hustlers too many thieves
Were fuckin up whos willin to fight and teach the seeds
Too much TV guns and robberies
Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy
