Yeah
Word these Wizs be buggin God
Reason why aint got nuttin to do with nuttin
Yeah check it out yall one two
We back up in this joint What
Check the fly shit yeah
Dont black out on me
Yo black man watch out she saltwater trout
Al Deuce dug her back out inside the dugout
Heard the pussy was good big niggas fell victim
Mentally stripped em one God turned Christian
She know magic soakin wet pussy on the matress
Skin like Cleopatras the leading actress
She been fuckin since we went to fourteen look at Miss Thing
With a ponytail kept a jar of Vaseline
Shes a big girl now with a body that growl
Like Wiz murder trial smile attract crowds
Most niggas would light the lord over this broad
Big niggas in they drawers pose one knee on the floor
Little kids daydream of humping wildflower
Hanna Barbera fame Geraldo Rivera
Fat ass whips big asses colorful lips
Wide hips spoiler kits chrome dipped
Wearing loot kicks
Plus Gs boomin beats
Loud horn beeps crowded streets confusion yo
The heat is on yo its too black its too strong
In one hour WuTang Clan is about to perform
Police barricade sidewalk crowded like parades
Your arena now present the event of the decade
Long braids and fades bald heads finger waves
Extensions nails
Friday just got paid
Headlining your marquee is the prime time rhyme crime family
That shines Godly light upon this hiphop art form
Yo Dunn we cant be measured by no chart the God born
Never bust premature for sure
You want it raw let me plant my dynamite bitch
Deep inside your core
The explosion stops your menstruation
Cause your stomach inflation
Patiently wait nine months for deportation
Of the Earth from the Moon black woman stay in tune
Yo Gods let me born yall the science about the womb
Its a black hole for those who lose control
Fertile soil for royal and wise
And spoiled many men and took many lives
Loyal brothers changed sides
Only birthed a decimal compared to those who died inside
