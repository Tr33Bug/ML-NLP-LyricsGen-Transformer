My God so they are killers
Ive heard lots of people say once a mans a killer they just keep on killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
Yeah thats right
They kill one man or kill ten
Its all the same  Yes 
After all they can only hang you once
Both hands clusty chillin with my man Rusty
Low down blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world cant touch Ghost purple tape Rae cohost
Monty Hall expo intellect you read pro
Sons triflin fuck wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michaelin
West Brighton Pool now Im into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths Whoopi she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of Hell aalikes propel parallel
Duracell knot you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland kids the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit we never did
Like eating dead birds trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men ill they got the urge pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now
When we hug these mics we get busy  Busy 
Come and have a good time with GOD  GOD 
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle  Wiggle 
Scream shout laugh or just giggle  Giggle 
Shake that body party that body
Dont fuck with Ghost youll feel sorry
Thats word Im not the herb
Understand what Im saying saying saying
Hit mics like Ted Koppel rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel burn a flag in your grass spiteful
Ringleader set it off rap Derek Jeter
Culprit prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair eyes fiery red feet made of brass
Twelve men following me it be the God staff
Move every scripts like Miramax
Smashed the big boy totaled it Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu binos to Latinos we love Selena
Overnight God schedules FedEx
Pretty silhouette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain smack em say when
He rollin up face wrinkled up hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop fronting on the grounds fore you get touched
Its Canada Dry sess with Allah son
We want rye we want it so bad we might cry
For every blow depends on breath control
So its the first thing you must learn
Fortunately its easy
Youll soon learn
My God so they are killers
Killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
My God so they are killers
My God My God so they are killers
