Yeah whassup yall whassup
This is Ghostface straight from Staten Island
You know I dont really mean no harm
But it just happens you know
When I step approach a motherfuckin wack nigga
That tryin to spit his darts and cant spit em
Check it out though ayo
Scientific my hand kissed it
Robotic lets think optimistic
You probably missed it watch me Dolly Dick it
Scotty Wotty copper tipped me big microphone hippie
Hit Poughkeepsie crispy chicken verbs throw up a stone Richie
Chop the O sprinkle a little snow inside a Optimo
Swing the John McEnroe rap rocknroll
TyDBol gungho pro Starsky with the gumsole
Hit the rum slow parole kids live Rapunzel
But Ton Stizzy really high the vivid laser eye guy
Jump in the Harley ride Clarks I freak a lemon pie
Im bout it bout it Lord forgive me Ms Sally shouted
Tracey got shot in the face my house was overcrowded
You fake cats done heard it first
On how I shitted on your turf that time Cuban Link verse yo
Check out the rap kingpin summertime fine jewelry dripping
Face to the box I seen your ear twitching
As soon as I drove off Cap came to me with three sawedoffs
Give one to Rae lets season they broth
Lightning rod fever heaters knockkneed a Sheeba for hiva
Diva got rocked from the receiver bleeder
Portfolio looking fancy in the pantry
My man got bigger dimes son your shit is scampi
Base that throw whats in your mouth dont waste that
See Ghost lamping in the throne with King Tut hat
Straight off

Smack all yall niggas and niggarettes
Universal death threats yeah
This be the God Body
Yeah no doubt Judge Wise
Ayo spiced out Calvin Coolers lounging with 7 duelers
The Great Adventures of Slick licking with 6 Rugers
Rock those big boy Bulottis out of Woodbridge
Porridge for the biggest bear seasoned giraffe ribs
Rotissiere roast hickory cinnamon scented glaze
Perfected find truth within self lets smoke
All hail to my hands 50 thou appraisal
Dirty nose with the nasal drip clique flipped on fam
Dancing with Blanche and them bitches flicking deuce pictures
Kick down the ace of spades snatch Jack riches
Olsive compulsive lies flyers with my name on it
Dick made the cover now count how many veins on it
Scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap
Ten years working for me you wanna tab shit
Bong bong bong Your bell went rung rung rung
StapleLands where the ambulance dont come


Yeah you see what I mean
You see what I mean you motherfucking crybabies
Get in line punk
You should be studying your arts instead of studying me
Thats how you lost your first job punk
Now get in line before you get your lil thick ass tossed up
Shit I studied under Bruce Lee nigga
He was on the fourth I was on the third
Pass me a honeydipped spliff
Black mental cause continental drift
One whiff of PowerU gets my Divine stiff
Brick rock late night hear the tick tock of my clock
I used to run up and pick a crab lock
Hit his stash dip back to the Lab make him flip
Uptown BOODOOP now we back on your ave
Incognito fatal Hapkido blow pop a needle
Dick a knockknee ho bust out her fetal
Nine inch long strong Bobby pop the bitch thong
Spit on her then I banged on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Ming point the killer bee sting
Ring dings right through your head bing
Snap the wing off of bats my battleaxe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop Imma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette puff a loose leaf cigarette
While your man search the internet for Bob Digitech
In Stereo crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standing next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde
Dip hair make a nigga flip in his chair
Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair
Stomach flat as a pancake for her mans sake
Used to fuck her when she menstruate
But it made her hyperventilate
Brooklyn I know I know I know I know
Queens I know I know I know I know
Shaolin I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know
Bronx I know I know I know I know
Jersey I know I know I know
Long Island I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know break it down
