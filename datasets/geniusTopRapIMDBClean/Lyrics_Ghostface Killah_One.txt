Yo  Yeah  new Ghostface  True indeed 
Glorious days  True indeed God 
Check it out yall
We back yes yes yall  Fake roller derbies  yeah
Masked avengers  Were here to sharpen your sword 
All praise is due TMF WuTang Clan
Scream on it Ghost  Ayo 
We at the weed gate waiting for Jake
We want eight ravioli bags two thirsty villains yelling bellyaches
Heavyweight rhyme writers hitting the grass thats the ripest
Pull out this kite from this white bitch
Talking bout Dear Ghost you the only nigga I know
Like when the cops come you never hide your toast
Guest starred in mad shit CBL Ice Water metallic
Past tense placed in gold caskets
Dru Hill bitches specialist lounging at the mosque
Suede kufi wrap undercover dentist
Rhymes is made of garlic never in the target when the NARCs hit
Rumor is you might start to spit
You nice Lord sweet daddy Grace wind lifted on the dance floor
Makeovers free followed by gauze
Duncan Hines monument cakes we never halfbaked
Alaskan sesscapade push your new court dates
Trauma hands is like candy canes lay my balls on ice
The branches in my weed be the vein
Swimsuit issue darts sent truly from the heart boo I miss you
See daddy rock a wristful
Modernday slave God graveyard spells fog you goggles
Laying like needles in the hospital
Five steps to conquer ask Bernadette Baguette swizzle
Ziploc the air hear thistle
To my real bitches take your drawers off
To all my high niggas snatch her skirt off
Just in case she wanna play get up in that bitch face
And tell her Ghost said Take your clothes off
Ayo the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog yall and grow up  Grow up 
Ayo crash through break the glass Tony with the goalie mask
Thats the past heavy ice Rollie laying on the dash
Love the grass cauliflower hurting when I dumped the trash
Sour mash served in every glass up at the Wally Bash
Sunsplash autograph blessing with your name slashed
Backdraft fourpounders screaming with the pearly ash
Children fix the contrast as the sound clashes
Mrs Dash sprinkle with her icicle eyelash
Ask Cappa Pendergrass for backstage passes
Special guest no more Johnny Blaze Johnny Mathis
Acrobat run up on that Love Jones actress
Distract the cat while Im high sugar get a crack at this
Dicking down Oprah jump rope David Dinkins
Watch the black mayor of DC hit the mocha
Tangerine sofa two super soakers in the Rover
Hit the sports bar tell a young lady to bend over
Meditated yoga Paddle Ball dancing with the vulture
Castor Troy laying for Travolta
Yo switch the lingo fivenineseventy
God glow seven fifteen four be ebony
Ayo the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog yall and grow up
