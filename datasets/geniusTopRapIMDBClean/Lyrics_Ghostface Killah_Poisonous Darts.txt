Lets see you try the water technique
Hai ha ha ha ha
The sky is high the cloud is low
Yeah
But my water technique is hard to beat
Word up
But the earth can absorb water
Gotta zip my coat
Hai hai ha
Yeah
The sky is high the cloud is low
Fuck em
But my water technique is hard to beat
Yeah check the fly shit
But the earth can absorb water
Uh
Hai hai
What the fuck I got to lose huh Word to God lets get it on
Clap your heels three times grab the magic wand
Nameless these stonewashed cats leave em brainless
Somewhere out of this world stranded on Uranus
With coke and a dollar bill stems and crack capsules
Take a blast boo booby trap a cruise its natural
Like soybean burn like a laser beam
My vaccine I shoot it firm and it connects like sideburns
The segment rap fragment
Comes together like magnets
Attract heads captured like Dragnet
Going through mad phases of all ages
Killa Beez locked the fuck up behind cages
The Genovese swallowed this line and caught a freeze
Press caller ID for me to quote more degrees
The fortune teller tuck a sleeping gas umbrella
Award winning dining in the back of Marabella
Now who dont believe that cash must rule
I dont eat meat I slap blood out of Perdue
Keep a wireless mic mics on strike the session
Its over Ill fire this and glow like fluorescent
The sky is high the cloud is low
Peace to yall lets get our rhyme on
But my water technique is hard to beat
Yeah peace to yall lets get our rhyme on
But the Earth can absorb water
Hai hai
Yo yo mountains of blow like snow constant cash flow
Rocking a Shaft afro Tony got mad glow with hoes
Mega powder dripping from they nose
Fucking Jet magazine bitches with wide pussy pose
Centerfold the whole night deadly venom horror snake bites
Only Built 4 Cuban Link kings who shoot dice
Holding money bags convertible Benz with feathered bags
With the mongoose your mans got two seeds down in Baghdad
You onionhead niggas spread out and parlay
Yo Rae these icksdays get crashed with ash trays
I pull stings like guitar strings down in Spain
Im so hyped jakes labeled god Crack cocaine
Y Equality Self god yeah yeah you know it kid
Ricky fucked up a GPack blow his wig
Hes rocking Wu Wear the latest in fleece uniform
Hes a newborn look at money swearing like he on
But anyway back to furry Kangols Jamaican Wallabees
My back is on the wall bombing devils with tricknology
My heart is cold like Russia got jerked at The Source Awards
Next year two hundred niggas coming with swords
