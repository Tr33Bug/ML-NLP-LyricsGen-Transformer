Psst
Yo  Yo  yoyo  Yo  yo  FiveO 
Oh shit yo  Yo let me out  run
Ayo I jumped from the 8th floor step hit the ground
The pound fell cops is coming
Running through the pissy stairwells I aint hear nothin
Buggin only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the second floor ran across
Cracks is fallin my pockets is mean clean when I vanished off
Took off made track look easy
The walkietalkies them DTs had Black they was rated PG
Run I will not give up no quick flag the car down  Yo yo yo 
Take me to Ghost here they come now
Rrt pull off quick back up
Hit the bitch dog turn down Hill light the Marley spliff
Run I will not get bagged on a rock
Run I seen what happened to Un they bad with they cops
Run they amp shit plant shit destroy evidence
Fuck a case Im not coming home when im fiftysix  No 
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid bounce do the bird hop
Curve swerve and get served these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I dont wanna merge
Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run fuck that run cops got guns
They givin out life like by the tons
Run if you aint do shit you it
That next felony nigga is life threezip
So run hop fences jump over benches
When you see me coming get the fuck out the entrance
Run fuck that run cops got guns motherfucker
Aha I might got take my shirt off  Yeah kid 
I like that one  Uhhuh go in go in  yo uh
Its task force Tuesday the narcs is in the black car
I got five hundred hundredpacks in my backyard
Clear twelvetwelves that look like stuffed shells
Im cutting niggas throats on the sales while they puff Ls
Dont leave nothing unbagged shave everything
I learned from the OGs to save everything
They come by one more time they gon hop out
They two deep and one is a bitch she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing so Im dippin with that uh
Downshifting on em like I got gears on me
Besides that I got about five years on me  Run 
Scared to death running like I got bears on me  Run 
My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me  Run 
Its hard for me to slow down its like Im on the Thruway
My belts in the crib on the floor by my twoway
Now Im trying to hold my hammer up and my pants too
If they dont kill me they gon give me a number I cant do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And Im asthmatic so Im looking for somewhere to hide at
But they too close and I got this new toast
Imagine if I wouldve let off a shot or two you know what I gotta do


Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run fuck that run cops got guns
They givin out life like by the tons
Run if you aint do shit you it
That next felony nigga is life threezip
So run hop fences jump over benches
When you see me coming get the fuck out the entrance
Run fuck that run cops got guns motherfucker
