Oh yeah motherfucker
Its real
Yall niggas hold your guns
Throw your guns down put em down
Yo we in the fields with heat
You fake niggas eat kid meals to me
We street referees we rock
Jean jackets thick shirts over turtlenecks
Certified doctors in hoods that still oil techs
But wait roll cameras Babyface money blowin like Beech Nut
Call off the mutts its me again
Ghost your host this evenin
Ladies and gents Id like to thank you all for comin out tonight 
Tux tight all sharp light up a bark lets mingle
Fetch me a Remy Martin on Diamonds
Flareleg Gucci joints I never wore
I might give em to my brotherinlaw
Fitzpatrick rich bastard worth more than Egyptian marrows
Borrow the God jewels Gucci goggles
Thats how the God do Motown twentyfive
My orals like Smokeys voice little moist but choice
We guzzle Doms smoke with scratchy throats
Live on the edge bracelets shades and classy coats
Jumbo in the club we play Columbo
Frosty the Snowman frozen as the milky way
Ice on the floor ElProducto in the sleeve
In the seam of his mink he said he dont drink
Think before he talked he walked like he ordered
Champ room down in Vegas
Vendin machines that shoot Alize compliments of EJ
The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had us years
What is a man to do  Brother 
Stay true stay true 
The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had its years
What is a man to do  Brother 
Stay true stay true
