Yeah Solomon marked for life a million to life
Thug for life forever eyein the kid
89 stickup kid King of New York
Regulation party daddy hardbody
Rowdy Brighton Godbody
Smooth like a leather bop 83 hiphop
Top of the world get it rizzight
Dick to your wizzife murder cats for the right prizzice
Fourhundred and fiftysix on the dizzice
This is real lizzife aint nothin sweet God
Sit down and think it through God God
Cause coming all outta ya facell get ya clap God
You are now listening to the sounds of Supreme Clientele
Step in to the party its me
God Almighty Ghost still holdin that shotty
Dust and Aliz threequarter Timbs
Terrycloth robes crisp hundreds in the envelope
Dookied on the globe
Thank God for my Wallabee shoe it done saved me
Up threenothing and Salt Lake City
Burgundy minks whips with sinks in em
Broccoli blown illa disease breathe elephant skin
Meet the black Boy George dusted on my honeymoon
Bitch like my wife she popped my Ghostface balloon
Bitches think that Im Dominican slafhash Indian
Milk on my mustache drop to my chinnychin
Dive into dangerous parts buildin with thirsty mammals
White man scream Swim Starks sharks
Smack the jail bail bondsman strength of eighteen Bronzemen
Tall like Karl Malone Mailman frame of Larry Johnson
Tony Montana blow creamy white Havana Joes
Old Suzanna ho pussy sweet banana flow
David Banner gamma ray shots beast will marinate
Bones splittin fatal Wu sword style amputate
Duck Savanna wait we splashed the glass ice rocks
Our cash high price stock our logos on your rice box
Plus your dice box on the side upon your white socks
Bobby got the mic cocked buckbuck nice shot
