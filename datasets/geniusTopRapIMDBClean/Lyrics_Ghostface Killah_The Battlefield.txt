Ayo Im back after nine years thats 36 seasons
Shit is changed up for all types of reasons
Staten Island aint the same shit is lame
No familiar faces son Im dodging the game
I want a clean slate but these cops stay screwin
Snatching me up off the block what am I doin
Oh its officer Dingle and his sidekick Berry
Driving me around the hood so I could worry
See how fucked up it is theres crackheads on every corner
Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
I aint feeling it this aint the way I left these blocks
And my names faded out like some old damn socks
I want respect these streets was my playground once
I was the Mack across 110th on these stunts
Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
I would walk down the street and sneeze they all blessed me
Been on the battlefield for a long long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine
Yeah homie Im the kingpin called Future
Make a killin in these buildings in the millions got em feeling like Brewster
Shit hot as Fallujah kids grown now they cock Rugers
Welcome back to the sewers where new whips maneuver
No kids playing no safe and sound havens
Theres tre pound cases on the playground pavement
No more dudes with 22s in their sneaker soles
Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
Im that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
Heavy iron on the ready my shitll crease your clothes
Keep a flock of sweetest hoes yeah I sleeps with those
Little slum young Keyshia Coles with cheaper clothes
Undercovers all around the gutter they creepin low
I stays ahead kid I toss bread like pizza dough
I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
That bulldog short nose G be at peace with those you know
Mama Bear was a church woman pops skated off
I was impaired an introverted youngin a lot changed my course
From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came across Flashed the badge took my stash told my little ass get lost
Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mines to a nine times ten
I was gone remembering though that fine lines thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets but the Ds ran them
I was a killer underneath but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit
Salute to the enforcer call me officer now
Supporter of paraphernalia I toss it around
The link to the cartel costs is down
Its that Denzel in training day shit caution my grounds
