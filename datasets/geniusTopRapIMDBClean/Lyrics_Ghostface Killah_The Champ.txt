My swagger is Mick Jagger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to a T spark when weed went up
The coca leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gram Dukes tomato plants
And jets get chartered marquee shit with the cars on it
The haters they earl run to the toilet and vomit
Back East Im a MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man Bulletproof and Supreme
Kufi on double deuce in the jeans
My man shape was on the floor with the mother lode both of them green
