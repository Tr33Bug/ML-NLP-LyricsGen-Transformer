Do you wanna see it
Do you wanna see it
Im gonna do it for ya
Im gonna do it for ya
Im gonna do it for ya
Im gonna do it for ya
New Ghostface
Yo deep in the trenches
Wig young black green beret
Chrome laser guns blazing at spades
Wallabies cherry noose koolaid
10 niggas call it TaiChi
Black blades one hundred dollar seats
Hold up we at the opera Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg
Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper
Chunky ass necklace must be her birthstone
John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome
So Charles eyes up on her prince fucking with Diana
Two rows across Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White
Fingering Pamela Lee we on the balcony
Dare one of yall to Malcolm X me
Somebody might catch a Kennedy
Yo let me adjust my lens through these binoculars
I paid 5 gs sliding off like Kid Vitamin
Viking patriot of Broad Street
Bet you think Im laying like a hyphen
Tony Starks make the narcs dogs bark
With the Benz parked up against the boulevard
Starks had the bone sparked
One cop tapped the window glass like a cymbal crash
What the fuck son You trying to break glass
He flashed his badge License and registrations
At that moment his fat partner started chasin
Chicken heads they was racing wit they hearts pacin
For snatching gold trying to dip into the gods basement
Our location lead steel shed spread
Cracked shorty head left sweetie there for dead
Ghetto poodles fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit it Clinton bout to cut WIC
Maybe one yall rich rap niggas need to politick
Reach for the sky they throw bleach in your eye
Dont teach you why you be keeping em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie in cold milk bold silk
Goldfilled cap Wu wear hat low tilt
True Islamic we speak verbal rhyme phonics
Why yall trying to change this hip hop to technotronics
Dont go against the grain  the grain 
Dont go against the grain  the grain 
Dont go against the grain  the grain 
Girl because of you Im hurting
Within my within my heart
I know its not right to be flirting
But a relationship has to start
Youre the one that Im clocking
Its time for you to start jocking
Dont want you to see me cry
This is why this is why this is why
I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder
Hey yo god dont fuck with her
I met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz
Hey yo lord dont fuck with her
I rocked a ho named Tina from the heart of Medina
Hey yo kid dont fuck with her
Yea that girl Kit Kat she got the good poodycat
Hey yo nigga you better fuck with her
