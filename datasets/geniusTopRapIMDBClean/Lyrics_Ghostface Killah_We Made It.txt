Tony Starks fights again for survival
And by just a thin thread of electric current
Wins another victory
Ugh cmon yeah cmon yall
Bounce wit us  Hiphop
What Celebrities what 
Street corner  For all my niggas
Crack spot niggas
Chip Banks starts to sing we made it
Chicken ass mothafuckas envious bitches
Yo you know what yall
Make me wanna pop something no champagne
Twofive on me weed and crack on me
Bitch motherfucker tried to get a rep off me
Leave him there never know get him off me
I remember days when we just fucked bitches
Bought a lot of clothes and played the ave
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I aint trying to waste my career on yall
Even scuffle with yall waste gear on yall
But if I gotta go out you know Ima show out
You gon fuck around and get your whole back blown out
I remember on the Island Cay tone out
In the Mess Hall hall about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
See see see see me I roll with Ghost and
Cats that carry they toast make the post and
Front page and centerstaging
When its time to bust off them things it aint a game man
We rocked out own diamond rings see them bling bling
Got big boy toys push sixes
Dime bitches told yall before we import those
Jury stay froze court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino cause how fast I rose up
Like George Jefferson and em stepping on em
The headline read Starks had the weapon on him
And the vest what yall expect He a vet
Plus the best now tell me how we gon fail
When we dealing with Supreme Clientele
From Rikers Island to the Cayman Island
We thugs like life is the same challenge
Do the knowledge recognize your talent
And if you live the streets you better stay silent
From Rikers Island to the Cayman Island
We thugs like life is the same challenge
Do the knowledge recognize your talent
And if you live the streets you better stay silent
Yo spotted at The Mirage Ghostface swarmed by groupies
Mingle among stars I come in cat invades Mars
Highlight of the century first bet placed upon entry
Fainted when the book mentioned me
Keep balling new systems high sciences
Drop that Ghost listening track sizzling
Angelica Judy Plum for bitches Goines king of the century
Best sellers for niggas stay together
Posted up trucks leaning on the Benz cinemax smile
Shot in thirtyfive lens you program
Broke bottles of Dom seven inch bangles back breakers
Im a dope fiend look at my arm Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions blow backs in
Flip raps like fortyeight bundles
Dinner plates deadly front gates celeb Bryant Gumbel
Analyze This shit like De Niro
Words in your center ear hole
Blocks of ice like SubZero we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn virgins to nymphos pop these hollows
At fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out throw your liquor bottles
At hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the Twelve Apostles
And life without you held counsel with great men
To murderers in the state pen
Being caged in the wages of sin
Before they read up they pop our tape in
You aint gotta tuck you chain in
Cause here we want the head of Satan
Doorags and our pants hanging
Chip Banks starts to sing we made it again
