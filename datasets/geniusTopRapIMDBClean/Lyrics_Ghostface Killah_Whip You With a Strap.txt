Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad
Picture me snotty nose sittin on my aunts lap
The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack lightin all the reefer up
Baby caught a contact Im trying to tie my sneaker up
Im missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like Im wobbling look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the jokes on me
I heard a voice get in the room I get angry
Stomp my feet catch a tantrum
Spit scream fuck that
Momma shake me real hard then get the big gat
Thats called the belt help me as I yelled
Im in the room like  panting huh huh huh with mad welps
Ragged out bad belt yes her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed its time crash out  crash out 
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad


Despite the alcohol I had a great old Mama
She famous for her slaps and to this day shes honored
But when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude
I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in a nigga food
Get beat then Id run and tell grandman mama hit me for no reason
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake prokeds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head  ahHH 
Nowadays kids dont get beat they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks punishments like have a seat
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
Thats back to back beatings
Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
bad
