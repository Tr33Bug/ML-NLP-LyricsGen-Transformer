No man all bitches are the same just like my hoes you know
I keep em broke wake up one morning with some money
Theyre subject to go crazy you know
I keep em looking good pretty and all that you know but no dough
When I get a bitch I got a bitch  Right on 
Word up
Got motherfuckin brother wise
You know what Im saying
Teaching the uncivilized
Yeah runnin the streets you know its deep
Word up check his technique yeah
I be Ghostface
Flippin the marvelous track
Yeah you know the steelo
But yo yo
Check the bangingest sounds that I invent
Fake niggas who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldnt match up with the fly nigga with his back against the wall
Heads clocked once I came in the door
I played the speaker sippin a Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch and yo I had to step to her
In a manner and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace excuse me allow to introduce myself
Yo Im the man and honey youve been rated top shelf
Yo whats your name hon Hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle just like glass in the sun
Never diss em its hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially when youre browsin goin fishing
Your waistline bangin like a bassline
Physical form is well complex and yo I love your outline boo
Your whole body is wild with your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You cant strike out tell me what can really go wrong
Youre rocking labels Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and Ill be more than glad to shoot it through
Ayo peep it I know you love Victorias Secret
And lovin all the marvelous slang on how I freaked it
Plus see youre the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash your flesh is way softer than a babys ass
Your body lotion is the potion
This shit got me open like dust and yo your stee is Thai potent yo
We can go the distance Ill put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked the hot Arabian desert barefooted
I grabbed your hair you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
Word up yo straight up and down yo
Check the joint baby
It be the WuTang production
Yeah yeah and all types of shit
And brothers catchin repercussions
Yo straight up
