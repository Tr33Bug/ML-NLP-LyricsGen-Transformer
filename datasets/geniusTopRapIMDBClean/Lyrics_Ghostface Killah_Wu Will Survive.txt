WuTang will survive no no you know now
The WuTang will survive
Cause every time they flip a party
You know the party screams and shouts
Cause you DAMN Aw TC that was the bomb
Get all my peoples get all my peoples headphones
All of em lay em a death warrant
Aaaah yo show it off kid show em What What
Let em have it bust it aiyo aiyo
Blend wine who wanna win mine
Shorty get a tenround for floatin with the richest huh
Flexed out Flintstones style
Your criminal pen pal kidnapped Loud jetted the
Mozayan posin for them niggas up in Poland
Rollin waxed out museum G em
Them richest niggas bless this like Russian cut VVSs
Slide the hatchback black word finessin this
Them niggas over there know Gazelle goggles and them Lottos
88 style throwin bottles  Bottles 
Scenario rap imperial material  Uh yo yo yo yo 
Yo dunn dunn murderin cats is like that real
Yo come do me something word to Michelob peep the Land Rov
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove
Its like space kid the whole world is pitch black granola rap
Dough got smaller famous team walked up in Fotomat
Black down numerous rounds boots is brown
Getaway driverthis white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and highspeed chasin
Porno stations drinking violations Godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pop the Winchester rifles in the kitchen
Murder the DJs eyes twitchin woofer hissin


Yo hes strongarmin manipulatin niggas scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas hate fakin niggas
Yo you hear me The whole shits like wrestlin
What you dare me Back the fuck up kid we flexin
This rap shit bust your gums and leave you stunned
Pull your plug now you cant function
Theres no total or sum to this equation you frozen
Many may come but few are chosen
Pretty niggas want to play the war posin
When the ruckus come they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die it be I Metaphysical Man
Holding court from my Wu indivisible Clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
Its getting deep in this mud
Cats heatseekin for one blood
Nameless thugs with aimless slugs shootin at these stank bitches
Thats either brainless or bugged I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin I Blaze britches then I roll
100 mind 100 body 100 soul individual
Assholes tend to run from this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawns early light with this headbanger
Boogie represent this shit fully
Like Im constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure About to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex Free Willy
We on some milli check the joint Engine Engine Number Nine
Niggas wastin time worryin about me and mine
Get your own shit
