You Know Im NoÂ Good Lyrics
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull Tshirt
You say why did you do it with him today
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
Why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks n
You need to just walk away like Kelly Clarkson
I know we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cause how I get down
Not cause you was out there messing around
I would of told you once you go Ghost you never go back
Try ging me like I dont know how to mack
Im a don  top of the line I stay flying
Stop trying to keep covering the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out get to the bottom of it all
Lets go before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And thats stalking you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block when we in the hood
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl nasty girl try to play me
Ayo I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperatures so hot the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again cause of old boy
But oh boy together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh what a web we weave
But you played me so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down holding the next mans stacks
Now you sorry tryin bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
Its a shame how you cant get me off the brain
Hear that lame You love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name thats right Im high post
Get the champagne love word up we gon toast


I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
You had to be nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl girl
You cant leave the kid cant leave the kid
Dont worry Imma be around forever nasty girl
Dont forget Imma be around forever nasty
Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
Were like how we were again
Im in the tub youre on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Yo get the bath and body works pumkin and spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong we make nice dreams
Fight scenes I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So lets stick it out so we never regret it
I could forgive the past but I never forget it
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
Got to forgive the past but I never forget it
Nasty girl nasty girl try to play me
Nasty girl you had to be a nasty and try to play me
Nasty girl try to play me try to play me
Nasty girl got to forgive the past but I never forget it
