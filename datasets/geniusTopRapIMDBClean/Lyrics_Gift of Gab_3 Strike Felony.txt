I shift shapes like a pottery maker
My ego is insane frontin modesty breaker
Break a 19 join the odyssey take ya
To the outer planes of the farthest reach thank ya
For letting me be myself and see myself
Its me again
Fourth dimensional spirit its new in 3D again
Be a friend to yourself just let go
It aint no way you could ever deny the QP flow
Its not one no direction yet its everywhere
In one take dunce we pulling verbal felonies here
I got styles gold miles flow dizzy and fear
Egomaniacs really aint feeling me when
Sabotaged by their own self limited there
Biggest dream is my downfall nigga be real
Only trailblazer mind that youll ever see is
Bottom of my shoe rising while I sail in the air
I dance with verbs like wolves but Im not Fred Astaire hot
Ready to tear the spot just give it here
In the year 20 naw fuck it in any year
Ancient guest appearing manifest lineage through me
You better prepare we pulling verbal felonies here
So telling me where the beat knocks everywhere
Better be scared these rhymes and these melodies here
Rock streets down states just feel it we here
You better prepare we pulling verbal felonies here
So telling me where the beat knocks everywhere
Never see fear clear but we solemnly swear
To rock QP emcees all up in here
We rob ya mind steal from the father of time
Converting circles and dimes in the paper and lines
Yet in the hustle and the peddling
The seniors and the minors
Use thick millimeter clips to stick up diners
Fill em with lead leave they third eye with a shiner
Assaulting your mind kind of like a cock on vagina
Repeatedly forcefully conscious and whining
So youre steadily enjoying it without even trying
Fuck a why and the where knowing whos on what side when
We do it just because motherfucker stop crying
We do it like you make your toilet run using some pliers
Or like you use the heater when youve broken the dryer
See its circumstances that are gonna dictate me
And in these circumstances we just trying to stay free with it
Breathe with it grow trees
And in the process bring the corrupt system
To their knees with it
Gs get it police dont agree with it
Judges and politicians their pants they pee with it
And they should see jitters no justice no peace
We telepathic ill erratic hypocrite killers
You better prepare we pulling verbal felonies here
So telling me where the beat knocks everywhere
Better be scared these rhymes and these melodies here
Rock streets down states just feel it we here
You better prepare we pulling verbal felonies here
So telling me where the beat knocks everywhere
Never see fear clear but we solemnly swear
To rock QP emcees all up in here
Fuck you bust you and your bunk crew
Crush you like tissue hush you up cuss you out
But nothing shut up fuck you but and
Must you always mess shit up
Thought you was impressive
And untouchable til I pushed your buttons
Lunching hunching over crunching numbers
But the punching that I put up on your stomach
Wasnt in the budget was it
Crutches wasnt something
That came into the discussion was it
When you was plotting and plucking away
On how you the hottest stuff in the bay
Spotted with my positive ways
Out of pocket on the side of your face
With this myriad of lyriads
Cant carry that with delivery vans
Shed a tear for your ass but I buried your ass
Keep bumping your gumps and munching your tongue
I send you bungee jumping over the aqueduct
With no bungee punk
Oh now you want to be humble unbelievable
Does the wittle wabbit want to wub up against his whittle bunnie or cuddle wit his whoopie cause hes worried about Wywics Born
Damn right
