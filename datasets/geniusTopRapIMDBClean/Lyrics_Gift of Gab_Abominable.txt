Yo this is for all of the emcees that taught me um
How to color outta the lines
All of the emcees that made me wanna raise the bar
And take it to the next level
This is for all of yall
IMMA FUCKIN KILL YOU
Im abominable
Im a rhymer thats totally all about vocally dominant flows
Abolishing fools that be hollerin
Goin at all of em look like youre honestly so horrible
Obviously intolerant
Send me yo dough on the friendly expresses
Just go through my honest opinion but now Im just listenin and smilin and cheesin
Know all my rhymes will go all at emcees
And the thousands of pieces will pound them with ease
And the standin around so the thousands is doubts
That are out emcee cowards grab on my counts
Till they out in they galaxy out in the clouds cuz the honor of rapping is marvelous gorgeous
Jump down for dying you talk to em bout but they answer I just wanna party and bounce
They sing along dont make me think too hard I just came here to relax in my drinking form
Dont make my brain work too hard I need TPR
Keep it on up please dont rhyme about meteors
Im just an earthling and then Im like ETR
My favorite Martian I feel like Im speaking to him
All of my peeps if you do not mind keeping your
Light to yourself because we out here seeking dark
ness
Im like I could just beat you boy
You dont want spirit
You might just want ouija boards
Youre the reason hip hops making me sleeping more
Until you try to battle then you peepee your pants
And you fret cause youre keeping your stance
And you stand there just leaking from dances
Im speaking advanced from my speaking youre bad for an album this outcome I once tell em done and to keep your advance
Abominable phenomenal flow
Just sign if theyll take you where yall wanna go
Abominable phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle aint probable though
Abominable phenomenal flow
Just sign if theyll take you where yall wanna go
Abominable phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle aint probable though
Im unfathomable with a habit of totally smashing opponents at random
Zoomin a lot Im as potent as stabs from cobras fangs
Corroding the back of your brain exploding your veins
And growing your skin where rappers are flowing again
Its over for emcees lacking attacking Im notable
End these after I smack em
Im over the feeling actually rapping
They know when Im here to razzle and dazzle opponents
That fear the boldest and coldest of opuses
This is copious diss Im blowin these kids to bits
With ritz
I wouldntve said ritz and kids if it wasnt for hieroglyphics
My rhymes are extensions of all my influences
Combined and mixed together in lyrical bliss
ya smell me 
Here Ill give you a whiff
inhale me 
Be clear your mental will drift
and still be 
Beyond and enter abysses
tell me 
Mom this prism is glistening
said she on 
This livin is dented everyone that listens to this
Is privileged to witness lyrics from emcees
well beyond 
The level of rhetoric dwelling in here has
The competitors iggin except for whenever I said
That all niggas with metaphors get in the best of your sentences
Just go back and try again
Dont care about your damn zodiac sign
Or your country of origin
Homie like I am aint kill em or killing
You phony ass rhymers and only at times and at
Moments of finding components of rhymes
That escaped through the vessel and go out implying that old ones cant science it
Open your eyes to the forces inside its exploding and shiny
Abominable phenomenal flow
Just sign if theyll take you where yall wanna go
Abominable phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle aint probable though
Abominable phenomenal flow
Just sign if theyll take you where yall wanna go
Abominable phenomenal flow
Me losing in battle aint probable though
