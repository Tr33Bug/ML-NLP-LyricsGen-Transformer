Yeah
Aspire
Yeah what
Times get shooken up
People lookin up 
Words Illuminati cookin up
More plots and plans hooked in your washed up brain
Still lookin for life just look at this
Once crookedness
Just up against blatant acts just the way they act
When they stayin back
the puppets moved by the puppeteers
What the fuck is this
Now they shovin fear
Tryna keep us unaware
Because they know that unaware folks aint gonna tear
Down the deceitment
All of the people
All youd need to arm and proceed to swarm like a single Voltron
We are really the illuminated ones
Really people change to take the story as the story comes
When we can create a newer story starting one city at a time in alignment
The assignment is refinement
Rising higher and higher
I just wanna see the people of the earth aspire
Everyones a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Dont allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
Aspire
Everyones a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Dont allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
Niggas act like we aint been through 400 years of a government
That dont want us here
All his brothers pierced
and his wisdom sense of what justice is
Paganomics we survived
We are gonna live on another year
Then another year then another year then another year
Can we open up and let some love in here people
What the deal
Is it really gonna take a revolution for the veil to be lifted
Truly lifted truly this shit do be twisted
I just wanna channel all the mystic
Powers of the spirits that existed
All the unformed soldiers unborn
Call em to the light they come swarmin in
America is really now on some tournament dumb sorta shit
Observin it crumbs puddles and slums and the rich
Wanna run this shit but its done for em
When we come for em all we gotta do is move as one swarm of ants
In this tournament
Now who wanna dance
The assignments set yall come to class
Marchin in and on to freedom once more
See we dont fear Illuminati yo we write our own story
Everyones a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Dont allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
Aspire
Everyones a storyteller right
Put some coal into the inner fire
Dont allow the powers to define
Organize when we unify
Be the people seein through their lies
We can change the course we on if we aspire to
PEOPLE OF THE EARTH ASPIRE
