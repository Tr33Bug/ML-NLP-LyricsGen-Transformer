Yes
I feel so brand new right now
Miraculous marvelous poem
Everyday on the calendar
Here on star it is born
Some are in heat of the night
A prophetll come droppin uncommon knowledge
To top with a tropical storm
Top of the morn dont let the obstacles stop you perform
You the chosen that wove and came out of millions of sperm
And got to the journey and somehow forgot you was one
With all that is possible  and all that is formed
And all that is not and yet it is all that there is
Its kind of hard to walk the walk that the carpenter did 
Could it be walked if we was taught about chakras as kids
And how to empower the powerful spark and the big
Vibration inside and around us embarking in bliss
Somehow without winning and lost and not conquering fears
Beyond logic and thought is where the true energy lives
We are not our thoughts and our bodies is lost in the mist
Yeah yeah yeah
Its the next logical progression
Its the next logical progression
Its the next logical progression
Its the next logical progression
You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold
You are that important
Rock rock rock on
Gift of Gab rock rock on uh
G Coup rock rock on uh
HeadNotic rock rock on uh
Blackalicious rock rock on uh
West Coast rock rock on uh
Whole world rock rock on uh
Whole universe rock rock on uh
Whole multiverse rock rock on uh
To infinity rock rock oh uh
Yeah yeah yeah
