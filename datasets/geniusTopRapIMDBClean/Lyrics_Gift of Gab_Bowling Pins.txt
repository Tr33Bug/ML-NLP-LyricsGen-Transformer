Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up as I go in
They call me Gabbin
I rap at the habittatattat
What savage is thatat
The average cat cant
Come rap and they cant stand
The rappers that act
Check they asses they cant stand
The album has rad stats
Banana the abstract
Anatomy smack cats
Inanimate black man
The animal advance
The radical rap chance
Command that you catch that
They cannot do jack rap
An amateurs ass crack
Examples of wack rap
The damage is back now
So stand your ass back and
Be glad that its that damn
Unanimous back packs
Are crammin with facts that
Examine the man  blast 
They cannot know that  that 
Fat album I passed at
You cannot I am that
Phenomenal bastard
My rhymer go blak blak
Im bombin music and
Theres honor to rap fast
Theres already blastin
Pass all of your asses
Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up  set em up set em up set em up 
Keep goin on til the daybreak
Was wanting to made great
Phenomenal great plates
Was rhymin on breaks
Make em fall in rows
Just like some dominos
Just cause Im on a roll
Just cause Im on a old quest
To demolish you
Just cause you arent too hip
Plus your styling is disgusting
Honestly kick butt
Whatchu tryin for pick up
Your garbage and get the fuck
Outta here
Here comes the nominate gift of
Abolishing liquors
They hollerin kick it
And trying to get the fuck
Outta my district
Im all about this shit
The rhyming and twisting
Ya mind up in this when
My kind of music interest
Shining and glistening
Cause i am that interest
You kind of a bitch nigga
I am the shit and you might as well quit
Be cause prior to this
You was hired on lyft till
Your rhyming got hit with
My fire then out went
Denial your outfit
Of liars got out quick
Retired and moved to
The eye of his child site
Admire the wild grind
And sparea spark to death aura
Sport the best aura
Rock the fresh fora
Audience aura crowd
It gets morea
Bout to rip more of
Feeble MCs are about to get tore up
Compton is global
Monstrous solo
Chop and will throw you
Out in space frozen
Far away so far out
Its not local wait
As I hold yall up in a chokehold
Choke till its totally done and over


Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up as I go in I knock em down like bowling pins
Set em up  set em up set em up set em up
