Verbally Im murdering the track again
I lyrically will kill em using synonyms and acronyms
Super rap avenger tapping into past Ill get ya pass
And drift into the center mass inventing rap adventures
Class is now in session children
Ill leap impressive buildings
Single bounds as phony rappers feel the pressure building
Their rhymes are less appealing then a crooked ex offender
I keep forever sending Heaven sent intelligence when
The parties over Ill relax in linen sexing women
Like Im perpetually better than the best that did it
I dont invest in critics views I manifest through lyrics
After the spot is blown to smithereens you guess who did it
Lyrically Im the purple kush after they let you hit it
Executive of wrecking MCs for the heck of it and
Ill be the letter man beheading MCs head and grill them
Over a fireplace at camp embedded in the hills
See that which never kills them is nothing that I rep
So any type of crime you seek is something Imma get
I shatter rappers worlds as if they was a China set
Even the thought of battling me is like a sign of death
I bout to rap circles around this nigga
Serve words with nerve
You cool at what you spitting
Dont fuck up rotation
Word damn you heard man you heard man
Guard your radius
Watching ceiling fans go round trying to catch that feeling
Rap circles
Thats the shape of things to come
MCs lyin is dyin shit off
Why dont you give that weak shit a rest and start rapping
Circles around circles
Certain now its curtains since my purpose now to hurt you
Serving power virtue through the verbs and nouns I lurk through
Murking peoples turfs and town that blurt the doubtful curses
Peep the metamorphis from the secret clever forces
They will be forever lost in sonic deep endeavors often
Here to lead the way of rhyme to each and every lost one
When I see a rappers head I seek to sever off one
Keeping every awesome bar discrete until I floss em
Keep excelling very far and free while letting off some
Shine 
My radiance exploding like some popcorn
Fly so high that literally coming down is no option
Circles around circles around circles around you all
MCs that wanna stand for nothing yall are bound to fall
They call me Gift Omega
I rip and drag you through the agony of tragedy
And sad defeat and drown you with the roar
