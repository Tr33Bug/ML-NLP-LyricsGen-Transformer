This is for the dreamer in you
Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do
Possibilities you cant out rule
Find the treasure that is hidden in you

Now Rubio was taught to gather everything that could be gotten
In school he learned an awful on how he could become a lawyer or physician
Not because that was his earthly mission but that lifes all about the jackpot
And teachers only in it for the earnins
Now memorize the knowledge only to forget it later now its worthless
But never taught a sense of purpose
Cause happiness is money focused on what you can get instead of service
In graduation he was nervous
He didnt know which way to go which way the wind would take him
Determined not let the pressures of life bend or break him
No more allowance now its him that must bring home the bacon
He stands behind the counter
And hour after hour
He takes commands that he cant stand
Feelin as though no power
Is in his hands to take a man
He wants to stop and leave
But remains realistic he was never taught to dream
This is for the dreamer in you
Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do
Possibilities you cant out rule
Find the treasure that is hidden in you

Now Ana graduated school with top honors
And to her parents and her family a lot promised
Started to study to become a doctor
When she was young she used to sing and mesmerize the crowd that used to watch her
She thought about recording
But then decided that was far from a sure thing
And with the house to ride the loot and all the money flowing
She feels a void inside does she enjoy the ride
And really wheres she going
And every time she sees a singer on a stage she ponders
The present circumstances is the life that she belongs to
And all the money does is seem to fill the empty void
Its like shes living out a life she really dont belong to
And will she ever know
May talent ever flow
Some people see the life of fear will make them never go
She saw the ledge but couldnt jump off of the top and leap
But remains realistic she was never taught to dream
This is for the dreamer in you
Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do
Possibilities you cant out rule
Find the treasure that is hidden in you

And were not taught to dream just get the dough
And wonder why the youth result to hustlin
And no one wants to be behind the counter money crunchin
And when you speak your dreams most people quickly change discussions
Cause dreams they come and go
And scientists deliver mail
Poets work customer sales
Authors teach at yale
Forces off and then derailed   
And money rules his soul buried deep in economics
He never smiles but deep inside him is a brilliant comic
Free thinkers caught behind limited logic
Will never look beyond the stars because they cannot see beyond their wallets
Dont keep it safe cause everything else will be too extreme
So on lunch break they drift off in American day dream
To the dreamer in you
Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you
Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you
Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you hey
This is for the dreamer in you
Never ever let em tell you what you can
And what you cannot do
Possibilities you cant out rule
Find the treasure that is hidden in you
