Its effed up when a girl treats you bad
And later on you find out shes doin bad
And deep down inside that makes you feel glad
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that
Yo met a fly girl by the name of Kay
Baby girl was sharper than a razor blade
Pushed up and I made my way  hey 
Hit it off great started dating Kay
Yo she didnt really even make me wait
Put me in a lovely kind of sacred state
Thinkin of a wedding and a cake to bake
Suddenly it started goin wrong
She started coming home more late and late
I was chillin at the bar to make a great escape
Seen her posted up with the homie Blake no way
Furious I started goin ape at Kay
Told me that I just had to take the ache
Left me standin ther with my face disgraced
Took a while to get over the case with Kay
But you know a bro gotta move on on
Months later to the date seen Kay
She had gained a massive ton of weight today
She told me what she did was a great mistake
Loneliness depression was the state she at
Told her Everything would be okay just stay
Positive and things would be okay But hey
Funny as I walked awah away from Kay
Inside my head I heard this little song
It went
Knew a golddigger by the name of Pam
Used to tell me that I was her favorite man
Travel with her everywhere LA to France
Europe and Brazil all the way to Japan
I said its nuttin Im a money makin man
Showered her with gear all of her favorite brands
Took her to the club so she could shake her ass
Suddenly it started goin wrong
Scuffled at the job had to take a stance
Fired on the spot tough break my man
Called up with my problems to relate to Pam
All I heard was click and then a tone
She told me I could go ahead and take my damn
Self and go another place somewhere just scram
It took a while to get over the case with Pam
But I gotta keep pursuin money
Months later and my papers stacked
One day just strollin around the way seen Pam
She looked like she was livin in a paper bag
All alone and pregnant all her days went bad
Goin crazy losin mental space real fast
She pulled a stogie out so she could take a drag
Gave her a dollar as I walked away from Pam
Inside my head I heard the little song
