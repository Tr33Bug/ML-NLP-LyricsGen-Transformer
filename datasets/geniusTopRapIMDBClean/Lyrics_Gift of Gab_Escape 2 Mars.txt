Escape to mars
It aint that far
Escape to mars
It aint that far
Verbalverbalverbalverbalverbalverbalverbalverbal
Verbally strike like
Lightning
Phenomenal
Abominable rhymer rally
Timin always automatic
Python clouds surrounded to
Gather all the planet
Night comes down
And all about theres a lot of panic
Gratification
Quick fix
Mind manic
In the wagon
Antagonizing the wind
All matter
It is the earth wholl stand through
The aftermath
Thatll bring forth many avalanche storms
In the canyons
Once filled with snow
Whether only the tarantulas and insects survive
Replacin all humanity
We crammin all the damage in the ozone habitat
And travellin into a savage end
I hope the tabernacle songs
Bring upon the awakening of the nap
And gonna be a long long summer bakin up a batch of that wonton soup
Plant life cabbage
That is guided by the powers
Of the dyin and the flowers cmon
Escape to mars
It aint that far
Escape to mars
It aint that far

Party over
Oops
Out of sight
Time mind
Illuminati death trap
Blind deaf and dumb
Crazy bent
80 percent
Wiped out sniped out
Burn baby burn get hit
When we couldve been turnin the cell phones off
Ripped through your city the Bentleys that sell most   
Fish than the fishes you catch
They smell so toxic from the rivers ingestin their flow now
Wait  til humidity
Summers are left cold yall
Kids gonna feel it
Theres no effect on yall
Since you directly dont experience no
Cause and effect
Drift inflicting the ozone wall
Gradually
Its all in our hands happening
Global warming on the rise
Sad to see
If we dont make a change now
Then the path that we choose
Is our own til we save our planet
Renovate all traffic
Innovate more atmospheric
Brace all damage
Done away with
Maybe some escape to another planet
Face mutated
In a spaceship
Travelling in spaces
Examining the ways of man
And how we take advantage of
The place we inhabit it
And taste more lavish shit
Racism hatred we did got past it
But we may all be prey to the wrath of Mother Nature  echo 
Escape to Mars
Escape to Mars
Escape to Mars
Escape to Mars
It aint that far
Escape to Mars
