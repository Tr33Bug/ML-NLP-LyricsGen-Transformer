Please Relax Cause everything is fine
Dont freak out  or we will judge  your mind
We are here to stimulate the rhyme
Please Relax Cause everything is fine
Yall all fall appalled and mauled  never stalled
On and on beyond songs peons long to bring on
Long winded aboard entering our yard
Yall all look small and frivolous
Damn near nonexistent at all
All your songs belong in a
Porcelain pond  underneath me 
Pom Pom
Whatre we on Some other beyond
The champions
Rugged and strong we gunning for yall
Comin evolved youngin
Awesome with no flaws in it
Sarstunned  and a longwinded this 
The authentic raw vintage
Take my temperature hot into the dark
Up into the art the thick and hard senses performer
Omnipotent  law  penmanship  partalker  for this shit
Lost up in the  gaunt authentic ship 
George would do when he was bit in the
August  fought like a dog that was a tom  and
All the militant diligent  innocents  involved
Extending my sentiment synonyms
Getting it from the wrong lyricists
Im killing the ignorants Im giving you more
To fear and Im delivering venom right into your paws


The father of funk with the heir apparent
Im the Godson of the funk aint nobody parallelin
Im a ball of sweet sticky chunk like a caramel and
So saucy of the skunk  Cheech Marinera
Yall cat be serious Im a top ten lyricist
Tiptop of the pyramids yall down with the villagers
Dont sass your superior shit runs downhill
Im highly decorated yall decorate interiors
Apparently yall aint get the memo
So let me very clearly illustrate the penalty
For insultin the sultan of funk and function
Im hostin a function I dont let you bums in
Posted Im  drunk in my palms  with the drums in
Dont know my lines I just know when to come in
Yall obviously dont have the type of following it requires to dominate this properly
By now I got a monopoly
This is a place of peace and privacy
Im a monk of the funk this is my monastery
Peace relax cause everything is fine
First  cut the drama
One thing you dont wants some whinin mama
Imma warn you not to take this any farther
Unless you wanna bear and witness to the trauma
Inflicted by the obit authors
Ask the doctors
Stressing it can lead to smoking Camels cigarettes unfiltered to the coffin
My advice stop your jaw from moving
Stop the java
Try a little lavender kava kava marijuana
Thisll be your prescription
Play it for your pharmacist and switch your addiction
Whatever it takes to get you calm or be funky
I go all war on you and start to bomb you
Give up the mic become a farmer
The way youre on my dick thought you could be a snake charmer
But I only play for the team that go for bombshells pal
And in addition to rocking this mike Im an MC embalmer
The working hands are calm and arms longer
Thats what I strangle you with mangle your neck
Dangerous with the onetwo check
I think youd better respect this psychos veteran sweat
When you start spittin your best to clear the stage and your desk
We mopping all of your mess with the cleanness and freshness
Lyricism suggested as a method for resuscitation
All across the nation play us if youre losing patience
