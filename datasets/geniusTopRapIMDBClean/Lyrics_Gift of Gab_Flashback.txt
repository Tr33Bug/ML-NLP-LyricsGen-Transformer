As we proceed
Welcome back welcome back welcome back
Welcome back to the days and the times of old
Welcome back to the classic stories thats been told
Welcome back to diamond back whites painted chrome
Back when life was a way more simple zone
Welcome back to 501 and acid wash jeans
If you had tough skins you didnt want to be seen
Welcome back to cap session til the sun went down
Slap box your way before you ever left the town
Welcome back to one on one fight with no grounds
Being fired fat boy signing session in tower
Run DMC Houdini my first rap albums
Krush Groove back when Run asked the crowd whos house
Breaking one breakin two beats street Wild Style
Jackson 5 Christmas playing on your radio dial
Reminiscing drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back welcome back
Welcome back to the crush on a girl next door
Fifth period in homeroom passing back notes
Welcome back to family barbecues every month
Sometimes there would be arguments but it was all love
Welcome back to coasters and karate shoes
The Great Space Coaster no Gnews is good Gnews
Way before you ever had a sip of your first booze
Drunk off life the simple things kept you amused
Welcome back to box cuts and jags
Jheri curl activate a rock in the plastic bag with a hat on the top
When niggas started to sag and gang bang
Even if you didnt you had to claim
Rocking corduroy hats with a crease on top
Stealing fake Gazelles out of the local thrift shop
Reminiscing drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back welcome back
We keep it moving yall
We keep it moving yall
We take it back yall
We take it back yall
Welcome back to summer time expos in the park
Beach cruisers padded with the black foam on the bars
Welcome Back Kotter Good Times Whats Happening Now
Sanford and Son The Cosby Show Thats My Mama
Gucci sweat shirt light blue furry Kangols
The Fila Mickey Mouse shirt that said yo baby yo
Spuds MacKenzie Pee Wees dance doing the bud
RoboCop the Cabbage Patch fake ID in the club
African medallion school days do the right thing
I get raw still number one microphone fiend
Reminiscing drifting on a memory in this rap
Welcome back welcome back
