Gift of Gab 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Enter my imminent energy element I am an entity walking
Ahead of the pack I really am out of my head and its evident that I will never
Be able to ever quit Melanin fellow with helluva relevance what isnt elegant
Metaphors ready to set it off dead on your pettier levels Im ready and able to
Murder and tear emcees all into pieces and murking embarrassees honoring easily
Crumbs chill it easily comes like breathing from deep in the seat of your lungs
I creep to the beat of a drum thats unique to me as I keep it a hundred
Leaping through regions and leading the dumb and feeble emcees sinking deep in the mud  the mud 
While some of them keeping it thug like there is a leak in their mug we better start
Reaching above we headed for economic decay what you thinking of bro
Im creeping beneath it and dug the surface will purpose Im healing delinquents of what
Emceeing should be its no interest of me if their mission is weak and theyre keeping it dumb
Keep sleeping Im tweaking the frequency of emceeing and being a piece of the puzzle
Rhythm we seeking the freedom and what it means to be free and be equal as one
The nation is bobbing and weaving afraid of the awful and evil Dont make it their power to
Lead you away from the power proceeding creation see all of the leaders to take us
Up out of the season I hang with the laws of receiving and giving and living if yall are
Believing and evident knowledge is breathing inhale and out and topple the greedy
Its indeed a great pleasure to present to you at this particular time 
Word is bond word is bond 
One two FRO Thizzle
Word is bond yknamsayin Word is bond man 
Free flow uhh yo
The path of the righteous person laughing and tired of hurtin
Im askin a frantic emphatic combatative idiot when is it past the millennium
Ash arise in the surface
Snatchin your wifeys purses
Im a little brother like Rakim
When I gotta rhyme on the stage for a good amount of time
Im grabbing the mic in an urgent
Smashin a dime for certain splash in the ice with bourbon
FRO gon spit so crazy hoes wanna give FRO a baby
Crash when you drive and you burning
I rap you rewind it the speakers aint working
Im clappin a nine at your Jeep and you swervin
Im black with the eyes of a serpent back with a nine for purchase Immaculate rhymes and the heat is conversin
Antagonist mind I am evil you worship
Here with a vengeance your fear appears in a mere sentence he the apprentice
FRO on the track with Gab and R combined with the beat that we murkin
Drama unraveled FRO commence
Llama in the shadows no defense
Calm in a battle most intense
Honey dips and them silly broads they got to do me I throw dick
But them money clips and them milly cars is not usually FRO shit
The ether writer the frequent feeder feeble freedom fighter with dope steez
The heat and fire the reason he beast cause he admire the OGs


And now RA what RA

RA The Rugged Man 
RA The Rugged Man 
RA The Rugged Man 
RA The Rugged Man 
RA The Rugged Man 
RRA The Rugged Man 
Yo Kubrick ride with us rivals fighting five of us
Bitches slide with us my dick is harder than elephant ivory tusk
Baphomet bison bite the dust slime and crust life of lust
Tyson biting knife slicing guts sniffing cyber dust
Filling their mind with the hatred and jealousy Fro and the Rugged like Mayweather  Ellerbe
Rakim and Eric B check out my melody duckin a felony nothing they tellin me

The freedom of speech is it hateful offending The weapon possession the second amendment

You could watch that Harry Potter Radcliffe rap his shit
Like when I gotta drop and its hiphop and it dont stop with the whole block and the hoes hot
Do the windmill do the wop do the robot flow hot never go pop no shot soul sock
Diggin the dick in a nun hun could blow cock at the church pope Benedict flopped
The white flame Night Train name James Brown but the bitches be riding my dick like greyhound
I aint playin with no gimmick when they faking every minute and I take it to the limit and they aching when Im in it
When Im making an exhibit is it entertaining is it Hate president race bigot
Slow deadbeat James van Bebber reign forever
Act like a dick Ill beat a pussy till he change gender switchin
Launchin the rocket and leakin their brain on the ceiling revealing opinion is sinnin
The fish in the sea and the birds in the heavens we living and given dominion and in the
Beginning the women Ive been in the devil is grinning the end of the inning the evil and
Tricking the murder religion the media spinning this pain that Im bringing Im out
