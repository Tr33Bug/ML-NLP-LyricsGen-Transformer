Keep growin
Keep growin
Keep growin
Keep growin
Its like we more like brothers than nephew and uncle
Comin up at times seem survival is like a jungle
Understanding takes time some lessons we gotta go through
I remember when we was young and the price tag on those days and nights
Cant be measured or bought
Sometimes I wish we could bring em back
Sundays at church comin home from work
Kept it on the low you lent me two dollars for them burritos
Headed out to the bay to focus on dreams
Sometimes I feel I shoulda been there for guidance
But I was learnin what it means to be a man still am
And every time I think I figured it out the universe expands
We was supposed to bring you out on the road
When dough got ripe
We aint even had a chance to chill its just not right man
I guess the street life had other plans but Im gonna see you in a minute doe

Upward onward and over the hump
