Clearer days crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard if you need
Me Ill be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas 
Lets take a trip today
A little getaway
So I can get away
From all the drama
So I get in the plane
So I can get some space
Clear out my mental haze
And clean my karma
So feelin really great
Flew to this little place
So I could stimulate
A happy aura
So I exit my base
This is a little taste
Of when I went to Vegas
Back in the summer
Clearer days crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard if you need
Me Ill be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas 
So I get off the plane
Smilin like What today
Right now a brother may
Take off his slippers
That was the purpose hey
Just to relax and maybe
Put some words on paper
But then the picture
Got cloudy with temptation
From all the gamble tables
To the pretty ladies
To all the bars for
Like every 20 feet
Now see thats plenty drinks
With all this Hennessey
Man Im a goner


Clearer days crazy nights
Heaven seems so far away so
Who am I
To deny
I could use some time to play so
All aboard if you need
Me Ill be ah in Las Vegas
In Las Vegas 
So Im corrupted now
My wallet was in doubt
But now theres fuzz and powder
Inside the content
My livers puffin out
My credits runnin out
Ill go for one more round
Cause maybe Ill hit
The lucky number slot
Won back what I have lost
I gotta taste ya now
Im goin nonstop
Now that my credits out
Although my head is poundin
Just then I jetted out
Up To the pawnshop
Sold everything I had
To a Korean lad
And in the back he had
A fly masseuse place
With ladies lookin bad
One of them took me back
The ending that I had
Was happy
Oops wasted
Everything again
So now my trip must end
These vices suck you in
I didnt come for
All this so I escaped
This is a little taste
Of when I went to Vegas
Back in the summer
