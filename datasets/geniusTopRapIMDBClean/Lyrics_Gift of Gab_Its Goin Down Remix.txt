Your diamonds is major my shinin is greater  yeah 
I silence the players with violence and chaos  my people 
Got dominate ways to abolish the haters shit
I spit so slick you can polish the cadence  playa 
The way I rock they study me like Geology
I make my point cuss loud swear solemnly
Probly change the music like Charlie did on Anthology
Try to front on me Youll be more sorry than apology
I holler B R doubleO K
Blackalicious done repped the whole bay
Oakland to San Jose
Vallejo and Humboldt County then blaze crops
My blades chop right into your head like J Pop   
My name pop up in conversation when youre talkin big shit
Your wig split when Im in the house you get evicted
Puff spliffs for upliftment relax and kick it
Dont get yo ass busted for some shit your lips did
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing   
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
Its Goin Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
Its Goin Down again
Starsll never shine as bright as these again
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing   
Och Katch Bo Botchy Banana Fanna Fo Fatchy
As I begin coopting your mindll spin backwards
Counterclockwise til the timepiece your watching
The foundation for the brand new hypnotic
Eavesdroppin it aint no stoppin it
So Olleyolley oxen free free free
All other MCs can come out from their places of hiding
With their toys GI Joes bikes and playthings
To be greeted by Lateef Gift of Gab and Kweli
To show all yall respectively
To approach respectfully
Each man I ever saw in my life
Was once a baby held protectively tight
To his mothers fresh milk recipe
So when it comes to justice dont test me
Trust me and let it be
That the bluebird on my shoulder should I kill it or will it be
The source of soliloquies when Im like 83
Still the call is militant
Only because we diligent
Tearin away the innocentsinnocence
Dont you dare get belligerent
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing   
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
Its Goin Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
Its Goin Down again
Starsll never shine as bright as these again
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing   
The verbal Matador and categories of our own
Ignite and have your blurry vision
Weary patterns turnin on the light
To wrestle with your thoughts
No more without the dawning of the Tights  
Within the lights cameras and actions
Of this happening called life
And when it all unfurls and nothings left
But just this fleeting second
Speeding decadently past you
Where you merely seein heaven being relevant
To right now in the present tense
In front of you is true and breathing live physical evidence
Existing all the tiiiime forever in this
Theres one Eternal Now that never ever ends
Thats right I said it go and tell a friend
I came to conquer villages upon the backs of elephants
I came to pour these lyrics in me out from out my head again
Come out Come out
Bring the inner feeling to the plane of physicality
And spread it all around
Drown in the aura for ya sure to lure ya
Auditory fully reaching deep and keep it tight its goin
Its goin down
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your radio or tv
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your books and in your cds
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your energy and feeling
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing   
Its Goin Down again
Peep it in your thoughts and in your reasoning
Its Goin Down again
Taught to hold it back and slowly ease it in
Its Goin Down again
Starsll never shine as bright as these again
Its Goin Down again down again
Sure act of breathing
