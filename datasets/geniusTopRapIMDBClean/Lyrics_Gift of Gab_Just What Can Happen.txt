Just What Can Happen x 5
Verb and add a metere
Prime time for your mind staff
Lyrically I be the illest monster
Stomp ya
One for the treble
Touching on board Concorde
Stopping the Flight 11
Soaring way beyond ya
Comprhension watch the engine
Toppling and mock the opposition
Not to knock my vision
Slaughtering and not to mention
Hostages and morph inside the fortune off
And while Im scoping
Popping open bottles
Dropping tokenswhere ill get off
And stopping aint an option
Dropping solar cosmic rhymes
And toxic poems Quannum sock ya
Who can rock and
Im a mess
Test a G
I rap and see
Youre back
Youre knowing me
A half a thousand penance back
I leave your Adams apple swelling
Felons laughing like Im Adam Sandler
Smack an average amateur
Towards your slacking savage radical oral path
Im motal rapping
Black immortal tan and tab
And over Spanish black
You know the man is
Cracking open planets graphics ultra maim
And that shows there has been infactual in
Gab and black you know its mass impact
You roll and pass and flinch
I make it happen
Just what can happen x 4
To crush a brain
You never bust in vain
And must you train
Amongst insane
The youngters craving
Aiming for the jugular vein
Complain above your range
I strain to shove you out your lane
Its pain
I came to snub your aim
And duck your lame
And uplift
Ancient culture angles
Tangle up
Your mangled structure
I done just broke your brain
Its over  novacaine aint up ta
My Alien Invasion yall
A crazy in erasion all
Occasionally making yall
Amaze ventilate win all
My    is gone
My nature is to take your break your arm
And leg and make it call me
Make it take it come away and hurt ya
ALL NIGHT  Crying in your dreams
And Rhyming when I scheme Im silent
Let you beam
And set your screen
Ablaze with FIRE
Its the pride humble markster
Posted like a lion
Sitting in the cut
Know when you sleeping on me
Bout to rudely wake you up
And who be take the cup to profit
And shake you up
Captain rapping
Rock the boat
I shock
You know Im not a soldier kid
I make it happen
