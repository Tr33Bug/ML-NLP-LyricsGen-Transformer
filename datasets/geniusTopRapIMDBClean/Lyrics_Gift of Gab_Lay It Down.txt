No exaggerating glad you made it
Have to lay it down
Mad as day Im travelin unravel too
Ill baffle you and rappers have to do what rappers have to do
So we slam and made a hammers patients
Land in the middle of the canvas
Faded aggravated weak defeated rappers praying
After they have passed away
Pass the J dumped it in the ashtray
I cannot wait I have to
Make ya clap and shake ya ass round
Cacklin Im navigating
Bastard haters after me
Im back to play ya ass like Sega
Smack and take ya back to base
Its mastery this aint a masquerade
I came to captivate and calculate it
Leave ya fascinated when I activate it
Packing major raps on niggas actually I mack
And play ya lacking nigga tackle daily
Write it like Machiavelli
I come in like Phillip Drummond
Son in when Im summoned
You better stand still and start runnin
It doesnt make a difference for instance
Thirty track stars that are turning to a cheese blitz
A chievements
Many emcees that think theyre very nice
Operation supper splice
Pawn em then
Bone em twice three times
For fucking with these rhymes
And drag ya over turf til your knees shine
While Im drinkin moonshine at noon time
Breakfast of champions
Bread egg and clavicle bones
Shit tastes magical hoe
Thank you for your donation
Youre helping me avoid starvation
Heres a solid gold urn for your participation
Forty karats a army barracks and green berets
With bayonets youre an amateur and they are vets
Plus a general has got to rest
And while hes cursin at you
His bullets verse a statue
Youre a chip off the old block
To we no longer speak of
Walk and nod your head
til your face fall off and speakers pop
Its the L the I the F with no T
Lif motherfucker go cop my CD
