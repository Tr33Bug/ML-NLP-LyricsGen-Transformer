The epitome of energy enhanced centering
Mentally beginning at the end Remembering entering the gates of the temples of infinity
Riveting innate sensibilities epiphanies levitating thoughts from the earth to begin to see
When the trees underneath my feet then begin to shrink Eye level birds eye view where the buildings be
Tendency to find my alignment It renders me helpless Submit to the force that is lifting me
Instantly the planet looks small but my senses free fall should I say rise
Seems Im in too deep whole life flash by my eyes in like twentythree seconds

As I pass mars mass stars planets all ajar in the solar system
See me float farther out of the galaxy I realize there are more How far does it go
I wonder if there are no endings beginnings Yesterday is just tomorrow
Seen another sun another earth another mars So far into space wonder will I see the father
Learn the mysteries that were written by the author If it doesnt end wheres it from whered it start though
Does it have direction or is all of this is all for nothing just a bunch of molecules who have lost our way
To my left thought I saw a flying saucer

Spotted a door floating in the distance it started getting more close
Felt as though I was about to have a metamorphosis Cold lavender colours everything was more plus
Seven discs on the door spinning in a whirl plus opened up my minds eye
Told me that a world was dwelling deep within way vaster than this world was
Flesh is temporary just a dream just a surface Everyones connected to one aim and one purpose
Empty out your thoughts tame the lions in the circus
Opened up the door just to see what was inside woke up in my room it was all in my mind
Its all in the mind
