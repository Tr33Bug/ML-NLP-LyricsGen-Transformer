Back on the journey again
Wanna cross the block to buy a loaf of bread
A homeless man yelled out
I havent had any food all day
Man Im down on my luck can you spare some change
All his friends looked up like as if to say
If you got it like that throw something my way
So I had to keep stepping put foot to pavement
I really would have liked to help up but hey
About twenty meters up the sidewalk
Eye contact with a girl that I saw
Soul windows as the cold wind blows
There was no one home she was gonna lie but
Dead to the world with a head in a whirlwind
Yes she was smiling she didnt look sad
Maybe in a mist shes oblivious
And they call ignorance bliss hey how about that
All walks a life all playing in the game
Aint a game to be playing some dont have a plan
All in the one block radius
Market off 8th summertime in the streets of San Fran
Its loud on the block now we got sounds
Yeah uh
Ten meters up seen a brawl
Two dope fiends going hard for a stray dollar bill
Owner of the Chinese food store
Came out with a pistol like Take it outta here
One man with a sign saying hungry
One with a sign saying buy me a beer
And you try to push through in your own zone
Chilling til you peep theres a guy in your ear
So I sped up my pace
Man I want these salespeople out my face
I dont know what they selling but I aint debate
For the hook line sinker man Im out
Its crazy when you cant mind your own cant find your space
And they take it personal then you walk away
All in a day deep in the heart at the Bay
Summertime San Fran Market and 8th Street
Its loud on the block now we got sounds
Its loud on the block now we got sounds
Everybody listen come to this town
Gift of Gab on the mic bringing it down
Taking it breaking it shaking it all around
