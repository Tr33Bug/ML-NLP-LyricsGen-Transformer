hummed intro melody
Findin out my way somehow
Heard those sounds up in the sky
Tryin to find a way up outabout
Darkness will not be my guide
Its been a long time comin as well
Lots of rises lots of falls lots of stories to tell
Lots of 40 ounce session couch surfin hotel
Residency got to pay the rent fuck it oh well
Came to a point where a drink meant death
Cold turkey nerves shook all the stress repressed
Bubbled up to the surface now Im lookin at me
Face to face with myself simply tryin to be
Sometimes its hard to just be when youre blinded in mist
I wonder if other people go through shit like this
Was about to call it quits then the moonlight spoke
I was sleepin on life suddenly I awoke
And now Im
Did some wrongs paid some costs
Skipped out on some roommates cussed out a few bosses
Explosion of the ego the power of the saucesource
I guess that I was lookin for a confidence loss
Somewhere along the road I must have made a wrong turn
But Ive come to realize that its just a long journey
Used to search for the meaning till one dark summernight
A cat told me that my words had inspired his life
And now Im
including occasional somehow in the background 
Now its all about purpose progress not perfection
Seeing beneath the surface faith followed by action
I live it all now with a hunger and a passion
And when I get stuck I let go and keep mashin
And when I get stuck I get still and just ask Him
For knowledge of His will then my third eye transcends
Thought and everything nows exactly like its supposed to be
Channel when Im givin and give it back out over beats
Every now and then I think of how things were
All thats fuel for fire now its funny how things work
And when Im flustered and I find Im slipping back in that space
I see that planet now its perfect in the middle of space
And I know that Im

  including occasional somehow in the background
