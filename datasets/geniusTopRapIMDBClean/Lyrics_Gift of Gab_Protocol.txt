MCs come and MCs go
Street cred big but they cant flow
Please respect my protocol
One by one Ill drop them all
Just call me a conscious fool
Who rhymes circles around you
Please respect my protocol
One by one Ill kill you all
Party people
Youre about to witness
Something ya never heard before
Thank God for listening
My hobby and job
Take yall to infinite states
Lost in rhythm its great
Your deliverance
Better than a case
Of eight ball or Guinness
This aint for the timid
I break jaws and ligaments
Rappers step up
And they take falls
I flow like the great falls
And rivers Yall aint raw
Yall niggas is cake
For the picnic plate
All ya lyrics I make
Ball up all of the paper
And throw it away
Aw ya kidding me right
Nah ya killing me
I should murder all yall
On documentary
Puncock    delivery
One thought from this
Is beyond ya whole clique ya squad
The whole chemistry
Yall possess isnt a fourth of
The rhythm I store
In one kidney come on
Yall come get me its war
You know diddly squat
I know rhythm
Its like Im Bo Diddly
Rock n roll history
Stocked in your memory box
Your flow itll be chopped
And whole cities and blocks
Will go instantly nuts
When Im killing the cut
Im not giving a fuck
Im hot living it up
Its quite iller
The knock is godzilla
I sock holes in buildings
With nocturnal vision
And rock for the children in Watts
And south central the Bronx
And Boston and the spots
Thats not loving the cops
They like nigga that positive
Shit is not hot
We dont listen come out
To our district and cop
The whole village and not
Cos your vision is not
How we living its hot
And blood spill in the lot
We aint dealing with chakras
We dealing with choppers
And innocent bystanders
Feeling the drop
We just getting it out here


MCs come and MCs go
Street cred big but they cant flow
Please respect my protocol
One by one Ill drop them all
Just call me a conscious fool
Who rhymes circles around you
Please respect my protocol
One by one Ill kill you all
