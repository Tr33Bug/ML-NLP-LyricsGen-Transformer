Running moving stressing fussing
Cussing drinking smoking killing
Dying stabbing shooting thinking
Walking pacing running falling
Yo check it out one time
All the bull stops here Im the matador
Here to introduce a new rap category
Climb on top of my music mine Matterhorn
Rhyme for rhyme you dont really wanna battle boy
Just another clip added in my catalog
Get your money young playa I aint mad at yall
Here to bring soul like stasgladisol   
Drop the fatter raw verbal mic analog
Sorry yall but I didnt bring a Gatt along
Just a pen that does tricks like a magic wand
Get my cadence and a whole rap pattern on
As the sky just falls over Babylon
Travel on Pluto Venus Earth Saturn on
To the place many sane brains havent gone
When it come to this here
specially in this year
Frankly I dont have it all
Running moving stressing fussing
Cussing drinking smoking killing
Dying stabbing shooting thinking
Walking pacing running falling
Striving climbing scratching clawing
Growing knowing guessing acting
Working looking peeking seeking
Peeking counting seeking searching
Its the Gift of Gabs new rap seminar
Male groupies please show me where the women are
In a world full of shyst type criminals
Make a LP feel like cinema
Bring light like a rhyme prime minister
Send ya up write it off on adrenaline
On a scale of one to ten its a ten and a
Half feel my wrath now sucka nigga what
Used to puff on a daily pack of cigarettes
Til I bought a pack of chewin gum Nicorette
Come to find that I had to get rid of that
Now at shows I got more wind in the set
Wrote a alcohol free song in the next
Thirty days drunk again like hypocrites
Dude my ego isnt quite that deflated yet
Signed a deal with a major havent made it yet
Got a past cable bill havent paid it yet
Crazy wit now I love my life takin it
Where it hasnt been taken yet
Go against the grain of the rat race daily its
Running moving stressing fussing
Cussing drinking smoking killing
Dying stabbing shooting thinking
Walking pacing running falling
Striving climbing scratching clawing
Growing knowing guessing acting
Working looking peeking seeking
Peeking counting seeking searching
