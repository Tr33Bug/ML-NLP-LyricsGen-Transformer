Oh baby Oh baby
Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby
He wanders and roams through the streets and resides in an abandoned home
Panhandles for dough standin in the chow line with a stench on his clothes
And he travels in a boxcar
Used to dream about livin like a rock star
And he carries no pass
Where he jots art down to a piece time passin as his thoughts form
But he smiles as he strolls
He appreciates the sunlight shinin
The glow of the moon
Every breath that he takes is a gift
Takin in every place that he roams as anew
Wait to see where his freedom lies
Funny thing you can see freedom in his eyes
Give him shelter food clothing
And he feels like hes rich
Cause he knows its a blessing just to be alive
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life
Oh baby Oh baby 
Hes got everything in life
Any man could want could buy
Anything in sight
He takes trips with his wife
Far away destinations
To cities that he likes
He owns buildings and property
Expensive cars
And he aint about modesty
Designer suits and the diamonds on his watches be
Shinin so bright they be blindin the eyes if you see em
But not everything you spot
Is as it seems to be
Inside theres a dark side
When he screams and he shouts
And his wife wears her shades
To hide away her dark eyes
And he hardly ever smiles
And hes so cold
Read his pupils
You would swear he has no soul
All his friends
Are the dead presidents
And hes dead like them
Cause his spirit is corroding
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life
Oh baby Oh baby 
I guess everyone would ride in a Benz
Rather than a bucket
Anyone reside
In a crib nestled in the hill
And just to get by
In a studio apartment
And live a better live
But dont all cars get you there
And dont all shelter keep the rain from in your hair
And aint lobster and tuna both protein
And is the price of your shoe a protection fee
And aint it all just for the next man to see
And can you take it all with you when your spirit leaves
And when youre gone
Will the people all remember what you had
Rather than who you were when youre mentioned
See
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life
Oh baby Oh baby 
Oh baby Oh baby
