Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
Many years ago I asked this cat if he could be my DJ
He said when I said forever
And ever since then my big pen
Seemed never to be able to resist when
I hear a beat I grip then
Through clarity and awe
Of where I see it all
Just cause Im rhymin from the spirit tearin free of all ego is
And please dont get it twisted never flee a star
If you ever try to block my path Im tearin through your jaw
When I write its like I get a greater sense of who I am
Way beyond this life and death every moment is new again
You gotta get into it to get into it intuitive
Synchronicity cause nothing is really coincidence
Livin for today yesterday and tomorrow
Cause its all a fleeting moment for a soul moving through time and space
And most the stuff I rhyme about some say I shouldnt talk about
But yet the words just seem to seep out way before I say em or think em
Im thinkin of a master plan
Rhymes all fall like avalanches with the force of Anakin
Walkin on the sky again
Zonin feelin higher than
Climbin to the highest land
Givin back what I am handed
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
I know you love to get your fly on
Buckle up and get your ride on
Fourth dimensional rocketships going up
