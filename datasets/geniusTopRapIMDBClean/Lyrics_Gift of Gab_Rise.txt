And through the trifling times Hail Mary to the world can we heal em with rhymes
Rise mighty warrior rise rise
And through the trifling times Hail Mary to the world can we heal em with rhymes
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials just let the rhythm guide you heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
They say that substance is a thing of the past in rap
And some holler that its even a handicap
I want to open up eyes but I find that I talk more than I walk so its sort of like the blind leading the blind
Still I see the divine inside all my people inheritance til the  Kingdom reside in the Matrix
Money is not the key of true freedom but when I say that to the starving it doesnt feed them
I speak of meditation people thinking Im weird
Im talking about yogis mothafuckas think of a bear
I want to empty out all the chatter and go in and dwell
To find an inner god with them and say youre going to hell for that
My fan base is not who I grew up around
Im touring the world but my folks is still struggle bound
The more I learn I learn I dont know nothing
I say lifes great brothas is like Let me hold something
And through the trifling times Hail Mary to the world can we heal em with rhymes
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials just let the rhythm guide you heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
Said Im a weirdo underground conscience and crazy
Can I scream God and at the same time Pay me
Would your head nod if I talk about ladies and how I wanna do them Is the whole song ruined
Im doing all my best play on lifes court
Can I study Rumi and still quote Too Short YEEAAAH
I am just trying to find balance do the best that I can
But I always backslide because I am only a man
Trying to be that change but things dont change
So tryna to change course but I am stuck in the same flow
Speaking on the highs and the rut of these same lows
Make me wanna cry too soft for you lameOs
Do I got to die for my art like Ramo to validate confusion that I feel Gotta say no
No cus still I rise and make a little progress through all my tries I rise
And through the trifling times Hail Mary to the world can we heal em with rhymes
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials just let the rhythm guide you heres a brand new style
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within


You might have heard me holler Jah Jah Buddha Allah
Praise be to the most High baba
And thats I when I fly like manna
Fall from the sky relax top gunna
And no wonder you can feel what Im under Im shooting up for heaven with my head in a slumber
Kind of sleepy but still you can peep me
Serving juices fruit like litchi See these speeches beseech me
And these leeches they teach me beef is beneath me
Tryna  fith  with the kitchen  greasy  and people believe wouldnt life be so easy
But the ice is so freezy thats between you and me that you cant feel my steezy
Its an everyday thang keep it breezy God is in all so its all to the geezy
And through the trifling times Hail Mary to the world can we heal em with rhymes
Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within

Rise mighty warrior rise rise again maybe one day well merge with the god within
Again maybe one day well merge with the god within
And through the tribulations and trials just let the rhythm guide you heres a brand new style
