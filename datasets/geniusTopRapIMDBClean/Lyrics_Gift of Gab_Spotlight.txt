Lay low  get dough control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Yeeah
I like to flow like water
They like to blow the fuck up
I get the dough
But on the low
Im about to show you whats up
Phenomenal the rhyming poet
Ive been holding your touch
It might engulf your mind
and goals in life 
To show youre not up
To par with
The rapper its not cool
To spar with
Finding it better to lay in the cut
And watch it
Unfold
Dont expose it
If Im folding large bills
Its not as valuable to me as the riches of the soul
Im lyrically intense as the vision
Of men and women
Scattering in the middle of an evacuation from villages
This is that instant vintage lyricism
Intended to get you lifted
Essentially your mental is targeted
Autistic expression
Is manifesting your limits
But not in my psyche
Thats why I cant be involved with it
All energy Im around is selected
Authentic
And genuine
Cause a lot of them would like to see you fall
So I
Lay low  get dough control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Yeeah
I never needed the gold or the diamond
Bagging more than my family
Man getting older
I find it aint important
To dazzle and impress thoughts
In the minds of strangers
Who wouldnt throw me a preserver if my life was in danger
Fuck it
Lay in the cut as these days are numbered
Some say that whats up is simply  abundance of life
Im about to reup my spirit today
And come with the verbal ingredients
To intoxicate your circumference
Operate at a speed or capacity thats not among us
Some will hate us
They are afraid of potential greatness coming through you
Later for that I could never stay in your dumbness
The game youre playing is sad and your energy may get selfdestructive
I thought your front
Thats why you stepped to the other side of the street
While youre crying looping and sighing
I kept on hustling
Not just for green but for any freedom of being me
Im forever shaking your opinions
And weak assumptions Buster


Lay low  get dough control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Yeeah  repeat
