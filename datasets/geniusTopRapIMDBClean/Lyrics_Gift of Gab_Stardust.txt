Yea
Yea
Rhyme to the rhythm
When I slip in to the zone
And zero deep into the groove
So as to astonish my opponents
When Im on it like I own it
Make the whole galaxy go nuts
Script and held ya deep within a different world
Like Lisa Bonet on DWayne Wayne mane
Never plain stained brains
Strive to elevate from here
Not just to simply maintain
To the bang bang boogie watch my spirit bling bling
I dont need no chains or jewelry
I dont need a dang thing
Hang rappers like a noose
That dont produce another product
Its my souls interpretation
If you want it here I got it
Only so much time allotted
Many thoughts that must be jotted
Clearing out the minds are clotted
Not Im writing on some Pac shit
In the month of August take a break out to the farthest region
On my rocket ship now yall MCs can eat my stardust
See the crew I rep is Quannum
Yall the bench we the starters
We the meal the main course
For your belly yall some toddlers
Keep it modest dope and honest
I dont claim to be the hardest Killer wit a gun I really
Only wanna be a artist
Travel the entire novice global trotter
Got a lot a proper type of sharper riper Ahnken conscious here to offer
In the middle of the sky you see my trail a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night its dusty yet its clear
Like as if you dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some psychedelic clarity to breath within the madness
When youre out and youre far away from home
And your heart and your mind they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned
When youre out and youre far away from home
And your heart and your mind they start to roam
Falling out from the night to spark the zone
Seeing trails from the night that got you stoned
Left the planet Earth to get a wider life perspective
On the bigger picture now Im steady cruising through the nebula
Headed out to Mars where souls and minds are more connected
Build with elders how to conquer ignorance
The mighty predator
I be the cosmic editor
And when it rains I let it pour
And if Im short on tour I guess Ill be the lyric peddler
Im deadly with the medley
Steady ready with the metaphor
MCs are RIP if they love life then why they set it for
Headed for your head its gonna erupt Im blowing up
And popping this its court I be the judge and jury
With the Johnny Cochran
Savvy plus I hit the cabby green up really often
When Im rocking like I rock it now stopping is not an option
Powered by a force inside that never will run out of ammo
Used to build with Pharaohs riding through the desert on a camel
Ran into a camel by the name of Joe thought he was wacko
All he did was smile and pose and get my folks hooked on tobacco
I crackle as I rap and pro attack a slacker
Never clever sever heads
Im clever yes Ill never dread a battle
If they white they put their thumbs up a black fist if its a Afro
In the Bay Im hella tight and plus Im filthy in Seattle
In the middle of the sky you see my trail a glimpse just passing
Middle of the night its dusty yet its clear
Like as if you was dipping your third eye into a tab of liquid acid
For some psychedelic clarity to breath amongst the madness
