Supreme
Supreme supreme
supreme lyricism 
You aint an MC you just a mocker a one
Chakra unopen
Stop it youre dumb
Popping your gums
Quannum dropping ya bums
Topple rocking watching ya crumble
Dropping your young
Logic cannot get caught with the stun
And talk that I brought that are hotter than tropical suns
Optical shots to the opposition and hospitals come
Melodic hypnotic apocalyptic pox get ya sprung
Atomic more chronic than chronic
Mixed with vodka and rum
Anonymous logic beyond youre lifting oxygen from
The toxic thoughts of a lot of nonsense
And popping of guns
Your ark and youre done
Your knowledge is preposterous son
With posture and form
Im monstrous youre lost in a storm
Youre docile and your confidence
Is why my offense is strong
Monotonous get out my office
Im your obstacle run
Im dropping your pawns
Im like a hippopotamus gone
Off of his rocket guarding
All his kids his pops and his moms
Im op an old army call the doctor sound the alarm
Its not the opera
Its your pop in top and optimum form
And partner Im the cop
Youre not about to stop with a gun
A copper a ton
Of weapons check it out youve been warned
This is supreme lyricism  supreme lyricism 
Supreme lyricism  supreme lyricism 
Supreme lyricism  supreme lyricism 
Supreme lyricism  supreme lyricism 
Check it out unh yo
Ay yo
They call me Gift I rip and lift the minds
Slick and twisted rhymes at em
Mr Infinite Divine
Into this defying letter
Isnt just a tip of time
Interesting lines
Thatll send the shift within your spine
Sent to get my grind crackin
When its pen and pencil time
Bent to get your dime askin
If the Gift could spend some time
With her my mind enter
Hither hints Im in a distant
Reminisce on rhythmless
Again from discipline I find
Instant mental shrines
Opening the great abyss of rhyme
Planets just align
If you slip you get your shit got by
Its horrific fly
Mystic twisted wordprolific guy
Just a bit of my
Swift and vicious wrist to get your eye
Lifted just a bit wider
Split the wit lyrical writer
Intimate with this style
Lyrics is just shittin fire
Ignorance exists
End it with a twist of this rhyme
Sent to get yall niggas lit
And bring ya to the sky
