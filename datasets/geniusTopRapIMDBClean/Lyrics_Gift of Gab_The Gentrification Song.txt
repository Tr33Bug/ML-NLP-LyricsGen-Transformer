Yeah uhhuh
Yeah uhhuh
Yeah
This aint the same place it was
Different space and buzz knowing dope fiends taking drugs
Thugs placing slugs in their enemies mothers waking up
Only just to fall on both their knees Whyd you take him Lord
No homeless people gazing up thinking vacant thoughts
Brand new condominiums sit where there was a vacant lot
And still surrounded by this commerce I feel shaken up
Nothing is familiar feels like money took the place of love
When I see the old ladies look afraid like they could run
At any moment even though me I aint taking nothing
Its like this place has lost the essence of the place Im from
Went to the barbershop I used to frequent place is run
Out of business and everyone I knew is straight just gone
Feel I should take the bong and hit it to escape the 
For feeling that you feel when those empowered take your home
That feeling is exactly why I had to write this song
It was a place I used to call home
I tried to chase the energy but now its all gone
And only memories remain
I tried to feel the feeling but the city aint the same
They say its all to improve
But tell me where communities are supposed to move
When they been living in the trap
And those who make it out are hardly ever giving back
Tell me
And where do all the people go who cant afford the change
They board the train ignore the pain of leaving all that theyve
Known all their life the only place theyve lived for all their days
Where they learned all their ways and spent a thousand holidays
I guess that life is really all about the dollar chase
Some move to live with family members or across the state
Some disappear and stay anonymous its all a maze
These people were pillars that made the hood a stronger place
The city lost its soul and gained a lot of hipsters
But does that really make it better or a little weirder
And will the idea of America come to fruition
Or is to push the poor away really the real agenda
No jobs poor education some things aint really changing
Its time we learn for self and do for self fuck being patient
Inflation rises people moving but the rich are staying
Sometimes it seems the future plans include a Third World nation


It was a place I used to call home
I tried to chase the energy but now its all gone
And only memories remain
I tried to feel the feeling but the city aint the same
They say its all to improve
But tell me where communities are supposed to move
When they been living in the trap
And those who make it out are hardly ever giving back
Tell me
