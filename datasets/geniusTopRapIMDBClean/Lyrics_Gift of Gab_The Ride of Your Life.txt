Enter in to the spacecraft filling up
That wont touch back again till the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
Its a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light
And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up its the ride of your life
Riffin in the octave of the
Infinite provocative
Come get within a rocket ship
Dimensions of a positive
Inventions that is monstrous
Im givin it my all
Its just my sentiments
Evolving as I give in
To the power of just livin
In the now I put the dividends
I holler from the spirit
Within all of us
Im driftin on a cloud up in
Your mental feel the shower
Follow in as I devour
Yall with synonyms and vowels
Ladies and gentlemen
Its our time to dig within a tower
Over ignorance the final hours
Here so come and crowd around
And listen up on how Im stayin driven
By the sound I feel it liftin
Higher how my daily livin is
The styles are like my children
Seen scoured through the villages
And towns and when the Gift
Is in the house
I bring the lyrics
That come down from up
Inherent to the sound
From a mysterious profound
Very indigenous way out
Chief innervision and
I think Ive really truly found religion now

Enter in to the spacecraft filling up
That wont touch back again till the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
Its a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light
And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up its the ride of your life
