Come lets sit
Where rappers have the rock flip scripts
And count the 12 up in the mix
Puttin down the Writz
MCs walk within
The round part offway beat
It took they on somewhere they drift
Puttin down the Writz
Ear duct probably jump into your mental
When you hear what rhyme inventions I been into
Just the clearcut uncut dope without delusion
Its the sheer rough raw preach skills that Im inflictin
In the rear cut now Im just spot peepin my competition
Hear what mere mortals could never pull up in my sphere pluck ports
Inferior years come and go its about to be one
Here cause now its all I know
And heres what they want up jump the frequencies
The Leer jet speeds like sound
Surroundin poundin in your eardrum  Watch out now 
Make preparation for it here it comes  Tumblin down 
For centuries to come and then some
Rhymes Menthol without the hedges
And the benz son time gets stalled
A rappers head is just a emblem on my wall
I like to welcome MCs inside of my melodical Monsters Ball
And yes yes yaaaalll
Look out below Sharky
Got a new machine and now Im feelin kinda cocky
When I grab a pen I hear the theme song from Rocky
Rhymes intoxicatin like a warm cup of sake
Sock it to me rock it truly we aint never sloppy
I could get you higher than the seed of a poppy
Choppy rhyme jalopy moppin oppositions
Starvin carbon copy rock me Ill be rockin noggin
Startin wars in your apartment lobby golly
Rhymin like a Simple Simon timin off and probly
Gobblin all them arts Im often flyin in the sky
Sire with the higher fire
Choirs till your psyche strikin mightily
I cordially invite you all to
MCGI people call me Gift
When Im tearin up a party I feel no guilt
I tilt scales build sell prevail and just wail
On MCs with these a 10th degree blackbelt
Verbal warlord
105 the zero look up at the scoreboard
Got so high you thought I couldnt ever soar more
Baby byebye my rock is takin off  All Aboard 
Into the sky we travelin through sound corridors
Way up high we take ya places that ya fourdoor
Couldnt explore and leave the Coliseum tour for
Ever and a day and a hour and 7 minutes and a second
Exactly and evermore
