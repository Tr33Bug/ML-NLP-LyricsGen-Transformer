Yo yo yo yo
I got it bad girl bad girl
Yo yo
I got it bad girl bad girl
I got it bad girl bad girl
I got it bad girl bad girl
When I first met ya
I was infatuated by your stature
Its like I knew your soul before somewhere in the hereafter
Straight off the top connection conversation and some laughter
I feel I got to have ya
Though the friendship part we mastered to go and past that
Like make it a little complicated at times I stand back
And wonder if Im missing my appointment on your Mtrack line
I really think its time for you and me to pass that line
This feelings here I dont normally feel its ill
I question if its real I feel ya vibrations Im losing my patience
Lets build and take it to the next I know youre feeling it too
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta
To know you
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta
To know you
Truly I wanna really deeply get tatatata
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta
To know you
Truly I wanna really deeply get tatatata
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta
To know you
Truly I wanna really deeply get tatatata
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta
To know you
Truly I wanna really deeply get tatatata
I digg ya whole style no other style is like yo style
I try to word it out to you and still I stall and hold out
I like the way you work out your mind soul and your body
Im googly and goggly eyed when you stand before me
Many have tried and I know that few have been chosen
But when Im with you I just get the sense that fate is closing in
Im frozen in time its more than just you being a dyme
I see the other half of me when I look in your eyes reflection
Soul connection for feeling circles still working on myself
You too I work with you through this cold world
Theres no girl thats making me do
The things I gotta do to betta get tatata
To know you
They say when you stop looking it unfolds in true
We come together through divine laws exposing you
To my life in my life full of these shows I do
What I truly jones to do is come home to you
The point of matter is Im finding it
Youre everything that I ever been looking for in a lady
Should I just ignore it and move forward
Sets sort to assure us a fortune and build a fortress transcending metamorphis
Take a vacation out in europe leave the whole continent tourin
Cant get enough of what you keep givin me more
And holding it back has got me torn in half
Its time to penetrate these walls and get tatata
To know you
I got it bad girl bad girl
I got it bad girl bad girl
I got it bad girl bad girl
I got it bad girl bad girl
Got it bad girl
