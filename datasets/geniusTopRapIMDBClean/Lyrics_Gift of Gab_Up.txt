Check it out Gift of Gab Fourth Dimensional Rocketships Goin Up
To the ink on the paper from the top of the brain
Ghetto youth zone rythms that are louder than pain
From Suedo to Cali its all the same people in chains
Where eight year old Children cock it back and take aim
See just the other day I was catchin a cab
The driver came from his country to America to grab
A slice of the pie he said my people havent seen
The extremeness of hard times I said what you mean
He said its people in his country that would love to live
Inside these ghettos they live inside of shacks and the kids
Dont see any kinds of education boys and girls
Starve and die and no money when your country is third world
I said I yearn for change all over the map
From a system deeply rooted in hate it sets traps
Crack liquor stores guns plus our culture was robbed
And we was sought selfhated major belief that God
Was outside denied free thought feelin the pressure
Of the hellish eternity visions of the oppressor
With the long white beard lookin down I keep hopin it
ll change til then please dont expect me to get over it
Before I bounced out I said Peace love
Aint no reason why nobody need to suffer in pov
Erty while others gettin richer its the same old song
Before I closed the door and bounced I told him change gon come
See I know they dont tell us that we really of Gods
Dwellin in infinity through the power of now
I spread the good Karma out grab a pen a sheet
And empty out my mind so the ancestors can speak through me
I tweak the beats rock eat the beats up
Dwellin in the Fourth Dimension of spirit Im Goin Up
And it cant stop dont stop wont stop aint gon stop
Aim for the top straight blowin up
Its like that  Thats whassup
