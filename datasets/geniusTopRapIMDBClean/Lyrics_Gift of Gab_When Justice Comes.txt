When it comes
The age of Aquarius has begun
When it comes
People work for more than crumbs believe it its gonna come all evil is overrun
When it comes
Daughters and sons move as one recognizing we are sharing the one son when missions is undone or done and it aint about where you come from when equality trumps corruption
When it comes

When it comes
Living in happiness and some fun laughing away the sunrise after the day is done what a feeling to actually stand as a planet one planet individual thriving and cultivating love
When it comes
Freedom and justice are one
When it comes
The age of Aquarius has begun
When it comes
