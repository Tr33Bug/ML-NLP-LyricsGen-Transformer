Both  Remix  Lyrics
Southside
If Young Metro dont trust you Im gon shoot you
I dont usually do this but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking bout decisions man I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie I cant trust her nor her booty
Every night she acting newschool I am not gon be a student
I got class I got trash I got bills I got pills
Heard them boys gon write me off I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam I got flash I got dreams and nightmares past
Im allergic to the brrrr Im using wings to wipe my ass
Right now Im high as shit Im on the Bumbu straight
I just got out my bitch felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face she give me highest praise
And when Im in LA Im smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home they would argue he didnt put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now Im on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix baby Tunechi
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now got me talking about my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now and I need ya in my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I got so many felonies I might cant never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon pull some strings so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them whatyoucallits and it boosted my stamina
Now Im fucking her on the banister guess I just East Atlantad her
Im in an allred drop tarantula fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes aint got no manners bruh wheres the manager
I keep throwing rubber bandies up hoe pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck youre just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you aint gotta fuck with me my nig but youre stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me my nig You grew up with me
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now got me talking about my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now and I need ya in my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
Yeah Im both
Yeah I had a drink yeah I smoked
Yeah you think I need you but I dont
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water my location is remote
Shoutout Yachty but this aint a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give I mean
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now got me talking about my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now and I need ya in my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
