Coca Coca  Mi Casa Su Casa  Lyrics
Coca coca CocaCola yayo bought me everything
Yola yola baking soda cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila boila boiling water damn I got a forced game
Snorta storta make an offer no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja than reefer farmers you couldnt see me with binoculars
White girl with me Cindy Lauper multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave ten birds to Waka Flocka told him drop em Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after try me then your skull get fractured
Ransom your little handsome son so sad that your first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriends a major snorter but that bitch aint worth a quarter
Dont give that another thoughta if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce a half a eighth a quarter send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard got from my father take no shit got from my mother
Never snitched and never will I put that on my baby brother
Coca coca CocaCola yayo bought me everything
Yola yola baking soda cocaine is my girlfriend
Boila boila boiling water damn I got a forced game
Snorta storta make an offer no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna my partnas get stupid guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Mi casa su casa partna my partnas get stupid guallas
Detail shops and beauty parlors to cover up these dirty dollars
Only one dude and Ima smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new twoseater
Stay lowkey get dough with my people
Maybe try to find me a blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and Ima ride around town
Work got low bitch dropped a few pounds
Count a few checks deal em out
Shoot a little dice blow a little loud
Sell a little powder make a few thou
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug every nigga on my team
Nigga say anything folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day they said I wouldnt be shit
Tell them fuck niggas Nigga look at me now
Money on my dick they worse than they bitch
It dont make no sense we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club everybody like Wow
Watch cost a car car cost a house
Catch me in the club Im stunting on the couch
Balling like a baller me and Gucci ballin out
Shawty got it for the low who said it was a drought
Swag run so hard man these hoes like  Ow
