Ear Drummers
Money owed dope sold bitch you already know
White birds black birds serving pigeons and crows
I whip the dope so good a benz jumped out the bowl
Motherfuck the ATF and the border patrol
Me and my amigos at the table shots of Don Julio
I fucked your bitch a week ago but I aint gonna fuck her no more  Psych 
I got the stacks under the mattress so I sleep with the dough
I got them bricks stuffed in the wall so yea I live with the coke
Its Bricksquad and I know you niggas mad cause you broke
He seen my video on the TV and he broke the remote
Im like Pablo in his prime shoulder deep with the snow
I read yo paper work nigga man yall niggas some hoes
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
Im a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit
I got all eyes on me like Pac did
But I aint trying to go broke like Joc did
I aint trying to fuck my dealer did like Block did
Im trying to stack them free bands like Rock did
Tell the truth I never thought that I get this big
I think Im about to buy some choppers like Tip did
I came in flexing jewelry like Flip did
Got every penny out the 6 I swear I milked it
That Bricksquad shit I built it
I put Flocka in the game and he killed it
I did a song with Lil Wayne and I killed it
My only wish my nigga Dunk was here to rip shit  Its Gucci 
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
Im a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit
My uncle Ronnie died from smoking cane
My cousin suicidal he blowed out his brain
They gave my nigga 30 years he in a chain gang
I just had to drop a 40 racks up on my ring
Im in Giuseppes walking in the rain
I cant even help it I been through some things
I put my heart in every verse and when Im on that plane
Im thanking God for all my watches and all my chains
Im in Chanel and Im in Ferragamos
These bitches know Im worth these commas
They know I got that llama
And my lil sister just got out that coma
That sickle cell hurtin her bones
Free my nigga Bomma
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
Im a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where Im at
These niggas dont want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit
