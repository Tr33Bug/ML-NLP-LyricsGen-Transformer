Can we pretend that Im your man and that makes you my girlfriend
And we have a one night stand in my brand new Benz
And we aint gotta worry bout nobody peeping in
The windows tinted black so it aint no lookin in
Bitches talking bout my house I think they tryna climb the fence
They say that when my dick come out that its a big event
Pool in my backyard do you like to swim
Cause imma work you out and Im not talking bout the gym
Gucci just got out but God damn he goin in
These lil boys dont ball like Guwop he play above the rim
Women on my page like damn he gettin slim
Caucasian women see me and be like is it really him
