Da Honorable CNOTE 
RIP To Pimp
And ODB
Getting head from a smart bitch
Im pourin up dark shit
And I might just have a change of heart
Better play your part bitch
Tryna get too smart bitch
I might just have a change of heart
Got a sixcar garage bitch
But I dont need you to drive shit
Cause I done had a change of heart
Woke up in a mansion grew up in apartments
And Im the nigga that broke her heart
Got a car dont need no keys baby
Automatic starter my finger baby
Point a finger start fightin like Springer
Cause Gucci Mane aint no average
Got a girl dont need no weed baby
You my dope Im your fiend baby
Like Billy Dee get in my ride
And girl get out my dreams baby
Work on your footwork like Hakeem baby
All this green between me and you lady
Put half on a baby with my homeboy
Cause every time I aint tryna have no baby
Smoking on kush got my eyes real lazy
You can ride me baby then drive me crazy
Rolling up half a pound no shirt cause girls around
All this money on me girl Ill treat you special
Let me be the manager girl I can help you
Let me be the treasurer get you a bezel
And you can be my trafficker send you wherever baby
Like Pun and Joe I dont wanna be a player no more
Zone 6 I cant be your mayor no more
Took all my jewelry all my money threw it out the door
Brick Squad goin broke Nigga thats a hell no
Am I fresh nigga Yes yes
And my bitch dressed nigga yes yes
Dress so fresh I impress myself
And Im smoking on a pound of the realest
Yes or no am I over dressed
Asked for a pick up said hell yes
Asked for the dick I said hell yes
Do you wanna fuck me
She said hell yes
Baby Imma go out my way just to please you
Please dont leave me now girl cause I need you
Ill cut these hoes off right now I really need to
And I dont even know why girl but I believe in you
Youve been stuck on my mind since you laid eyes on me
And I dont like your hatinass friend because she lied on me
And I just touched down I made my girl so proud
I know her inside out I know her upside down
And plus that girl stay down through all my ups and downs
Even the thought of losing her
Some niggas might say no to drugs
All my crew say hell yeah
We dont go get one pair we go get twelve pair
All my niggas got brick fair all my niggas got brick fair
At the Falcons game and your bitch there
I was worth ten mill when Vick was here
And the same hood you cant come to
Thats the one my mama pay rent there
Spin the globe every point ive been there
I went platinum in Australia


Like Pun and Joe I dont wanna be a player no more
Zone 6 I cant be your mayor no more
Took all my jewelry all my money threw it out the door
Brick Squad goin broke Nigga thats a hell no
Am I fresh nigga Yes yes
And my bitch dressed nigga yes yes
Dress so fresh I impress myself
And Im smoking on a pound of the realest
Yes or no am I over dressed
Asked for a pick up said hell yes
Asked for the dick I said hell yes
Do you wanna fuck me
She said hell yes
