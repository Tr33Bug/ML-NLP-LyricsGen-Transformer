Yeah hey
Gucci always talkin bout he love somebody
He dont love nobody  Uhuh 
Matter fact nigga you owe me some money dont you
Let me show you how I do this shit  Get money 
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit with my spoiled lil chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist match this yellow bitch
She a trip shawty she the shit she know she the shit
If you dont buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch shawty mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid give her candy stick
She a pit make her flip a brick make her sick a chick
Since a jit Ive been slangin dick Gucci Mane the shit  Burr 
I met a girl name Susie I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in 08 Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir better yet singing like Mya  Bitch 
Well my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think Im loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit all the ballas I be at all the spots
I might be in yo kitchen nigga cooking with yo pots

She sweet but keep kief she stains her Irene
Two piece she dime piece and jeans they dead meat
She sweet she so deep she read with good teeth
Two jobs she get cheese her dates are my treat
How neat she loves to eat we eat bon apptit
We feed shes so neat and like me she so neat


Nigga always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot my clique I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots expose the havenots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
