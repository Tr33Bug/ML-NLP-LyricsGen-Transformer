Intro  El Chapo  Lyrics
Hes known as El Chapo or Shorty and hes no doubt the most feared and the most dangerous drug lord in all of Mexico Police turned up four more bodies churned in the trunk of a burnedout car near the
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him Ima tell him bravo
I live a life so crazy make me start smokin newports
And you aint comin in Ima serve you in the front porch
My plug he comin in Im about a scoop him from the airport
And aint no room for nothin else but money in my condo
Ballin like a bitch you think my grandmother Griselda
These suckas they cant wait to double cross you like Diego
Im whackin niggas taxin niggas similar to Pablo
Im big chained touchin every penny like Im Castro
Boss shit mob hits Lucky Luciano
Bricksquad Records like the damn Gambinos
The shit that I done did has only been done by Latinos
Dope so good you think it came from El Chapo
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him Ima tell him bravo
Plane just touch down thanks to Amado
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load
Severing niggas heads off like El Loco
A hundred bricks is nothin if you Jesus Elizando
My big toy Emilio got it in the choke hold
Spent a half a million last year on Forgiatos
And no I am not a catholic confessin is a no no
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a snow roll
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo
A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo
And its a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle


All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him Ima tell him bravo
