Its Wizop
Huh Huh
I still dont give a fuck how a fuckboy feel
How you gon keep it real and your diamonds not real
I do it so big I make a hater feel little
I cant tell you why they hating but I have an idea
You never liked me probably dont like me still
But a nigga liking me aint never paid my bills
Im the realest nigga living lets get one thing clear
And if you wanna get it popping we can do it right here
I aint never been embarrassed I aint never felt fear
I got posttraumatic stresses like I cant shed tears
I aint even been out 6 months but I spent 6 mil
Got a million dollar grin and a 10 million dollar crib
And my heart done turned burrburr like my adlibs
In the kitchen going skrtskrt tryna make a mil
Got these bitches screaming BlingBlaww diamonds in my ear
I send my shooters then its powpow another tatted tear
Yeah its 2016 so its Guwop year
When I was 16 I was making drug deals
These niggas say they getting money I cant really tell
I made more money than them and I was in a jail cell
Ima say it once again trust God fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Say it once again trust God fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
Wop Wop Wop Wop
Im down on that red this right here gon get hard Gon get hard Every day Im getting fucking harder I am
Wop fuck 12 Wop fuck 12
Wop Wop
