Tay Keith fuck these niggas up 
DJ Meech lil bitch 
Them niggas get on yall ass yall play with me like I aint worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like yall aint said my name first
He a junkie he aint shot his gun yet he blame Percs
Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first
They like Smurk Your ass be tripping better put your case first
Choking who I heard them rumors niggas better play slow
I dont want no niggas who you catch I want the one I paid for
We on his ass he in the A you see how long they stay for
Aint no hotel room we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats they get off any scene the police chase those
Trolling ass we shot your homie we aint know he can take those
If I say your name dont post it opps be on all kind of shit
Aint got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up literally niggas dying to hit
In this industry aint what it seem this shit be counterfeit
Aint no lacking she say Im a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie why you asking
You got my number you post shit on the Gram you moving backwards
You lucky I dont be doing shit for the Gram you niggas cowards
Better not believe no rumors rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act I never drunk a cooler
They get your location they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets His ass a hooper
I know this shit dont matter I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement he gon kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning wake him up that boy a rooster  Go 
He took it to trial I tried to tell him it was stupid  I knew it 
They gave him so much time his knees got weak and he was woozy  Damn 
Watch the shit you say the feds be listening to the music  Woah 
And they gon take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
DA dropped my murder didnt have evidence to prove it  Nah 
I think my house is haunted yeah by who The ghost of Pookie  Woah 
He aint killed nobody but keep rapping about the shootings  Pussy 
Still aint got revenge yet but keep making up excuses  Wow 
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Guccis  Lean 
Told him quit while he ahead and dont go out like Whitney Houston  Huh 
He got caught without it now they robbing him for his rubies  Woah 
He wouldnt give it up so he got buried in his Cuban  Its Gucci 
Better not believe no rumors rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act I never drunk a cooler
They get your location they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets His ass a hooper
I know this shit dont matter I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement he gon kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning wake him up that boy a rooster
