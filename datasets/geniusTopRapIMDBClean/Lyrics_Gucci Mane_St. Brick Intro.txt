St Brick Intro Lyrics
An igloo full of snow and a white stove
House full of naked hoes snortin blow
Its so lonely at the top plus its real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin blow
Im in Zone Six aka the North Pole
Burr EA GA
1017 Wop six
Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert
Its the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
Santa Claus of the hood
I pull up with the work
They call me East Atlanta Santa
Run up on me get murked
Im just trappin through the snow
Sellin nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK  gra gra gra 
Im a neighborhood philanthropist
Im sellin bales of cannabis
Preachin like an evangelist
But I dont fuck with amateurs
I drive spiders yeah tarantulas
My diamonds are immaculate
Im not on no romantic shit
But Im cookin cocaine candle lit
Im so trill your ho cant handle it
But damn that bitch can suck a dick
Skeeted on her face and lip
Guwop cant fuck no basic bitch
The teacher teachin arithmetic
Show you how to whip a brick
Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch
My young girl she a freaky chick
But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
I sell more meth than a Mexican
My dog food yea its excellent
I done started sellin Christmas tree
Im tryna jingle bells ho
Its Christmas time its Hollis Queens
Im stompin in my shell toes
Christmas time in 96
I asked Santa for twelve golds
But now Guwop got gifts to give
But I dont fuck with twelve though
Santa Claus in the city bag full of goodies
I wish these faggotass cops would let a nigga live
Im tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil
Im the Bricksquad boss Im like Santa Claus
