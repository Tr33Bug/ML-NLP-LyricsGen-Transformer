Who me Aint shit
Sittin courtside at AllStar
And this Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And yall wasnt wearing gold watches
Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh lawnmower just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh Encore they want more theyre fans now
Got your girl ass clapping hands down
Dont approach me with your hands out
Sittin down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
Its me and Im cool with it
You dont know what to do with yourself
When I do it Im doing it fresh
Born to do it so I do it to death
Calm in the steps walking my dawgs
We dont get along Im tellin em fetch
Hit em like PA Hit em like PA
Shoot up the spot and Im leavin like Ah
Okay you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire I buy a new car
You know what time it is check the Rolex
If you keep whining baby you gon lose me
Better choose me baby come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I dont ever get used up usually  turn up turn up 
Baby use me  baby use me
Baby use me  baby you can use me
Baby use me  you can use me
But I dont ever get used up usually
makin no noise
That nigga aint makin no noise  nah nah 
makin no noise
No niggas aint makin no noise  shut up 
makin no noise
Them niggas aint makin no noise  nah nah 
makin no noise
That nigga aint makin no noise  shut up 
If youre an ugly ho I cant leave with ya
If youre a broke nigga cant smoke weed with ya
If you aint a boss then I cant sip lean with ya
Im not a rapper bitch Im a mob figure
458 its a centrepiece
These ho niggas aint seen half a million
Got a pimp cup Im in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me
LaFlare nigga Im rare nigga
Caveman Shit Drag Her By Her Hair Nigga
You a bear nigga Well Im a bear killer
You a fuck nigga I dont fuck with ya
2 Chainz nigga my cuhcuh
All my cousins sell drugs
My brother sent a pack I fell in love
And told everyone I know I sell bud


All I rock is designer clothes
All I take is designer drugs
So geeked up couldnt find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud  damn 
2 Chainz two times got major money
More money than a label tryna sign a thug
And ya CEO say he wanna sign with me
Cause the artists youve got aint hot enough
If you keep whining baby you gon lose me
Better choose me baby come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I dont ever get used up usually  turn up turn up 
Baby use me  baby use me
Baby use me  baby you can use me
Baby use me  you can use me
But I dont ever get used up usually
makin no noise
That nigga aint makin no noise  nah nah 
makin no noise
No niggas aint makin no noise  shut up 
makin no noise
Them niggas aint makin no noise  nah nah 
makin no noise
That nigga aint makin no noise  shut up
