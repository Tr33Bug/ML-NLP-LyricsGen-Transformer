We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
Even when it dont go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms cant fight we ride
Get somebody that gon ride for you  Even when I lose my breath
Who gon die for you  Even when I hurt myself
Who gon cry for you  Even if it means my life we ride
Look I dont trust nobody like I trust  you
I know youll never hurt me cause it will hurt you
Everybody turn their back on me but you
And when I did time you was doing time too
Looking back at it Hell what we went through
Its like I prayed for an angel and he sent you
They used to say you was a fool cause you loved me
Now look at them they like damn I wish it was me
But tell me can you hold me down in the bad weather
Cause anyone can hold it down through the fair weather
Thats why the rock so big cause when you wave at em
I want them hoes to run and hide like you sprayed at em
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
Even when it dont go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms cant fight we ride
Get somebody that gon ride for you  Even when I lose my breath
Who gon die for you  Even when I hurt myself
Who gon cry for you  Even if it means my life we ride


Its me and my ride or die thats my right hand
Got me thinking Damn who gon be my best man
Built a house for 10 mil on your own land
And showed your best friend how to build her own brand
Have you ever seen a street nigga slow dance
In a white tux with a live band playing
Its like the new Gucci talking to the old Gucci
Gotta have 20 Ms to see what Im saying
Whod ever think Id get this far I was just trappin
Who ever thought Id get this rich when I started rapping
This make a street nigga stand up and start clapping
Id never thought I feel this way but then God happened
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride we ride
We ride we ride
Even when it dont go right
Even when the shit go left
Even when my arms cant fight we ride
Get somebody that gon ride for you  Even when I lose my breath
Who gon die for you  Even when I hurt myself
Who gon cry for you  Even if it means my life we ride
