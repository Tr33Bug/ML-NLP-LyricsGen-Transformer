Yo my girls heated
Cause I told her I was busy workin and I couldnt talk
I told her Id call her back later and she still got mad
That was all I said word up
Why she buggin if I promised that Id call her back
Of course Im honest plus Im keepin things all intact
I be stressed out baby sometimes on my grind
And on my mind is a paperchase with minimal time
She should know how it goes  Im still into her
I got feelings for her I been caring for her
But really though I mean she ought to know the deallyyo
Especially if Im in a meeting or out shooting a video
I love her yo but Im just doin my job
Aint no need for confusion what Im doin is hard
Im the type of man with a serious type of plan
Im calmer no drama no need for gettin hyper
And upset with me because Im busy a lot
And if I could you know I would bring her with me a lot
Aint nuttin wrong word is bond its all in her head
I was handling some business and thats all I said
All I said Ill call you later
Sometimes I forget
I love you baby dont be so upset
Ill call you later is all I said
Im confessin no question yeah I chill with my boys
Still she gotta keep it real either build or destroy
This is deep right here she completes my square
Without a doubt if she needs Imma be right there
This world is crazy shes supposed to help me stay sane
Supposed to help with the pain supposed to help me maintain
And quote this Im focused on the dreams we share
I got her all up in my mix so it means I care
This job of mine goes on and on twentyfour hours a day
And with trust we can win in a powerful way
When I get home Im gonna love her down
Ill be like Teddy get some hot oils and rub her down
I know shes bored feels ignored all by herself alone
And she hates it when I turn off my cell phone
But its alright dont wanna fight its all in her head
I was takin care of business and thats all I said


Baby when youre speakin like that it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine Ill crush you
Baby when youre speakin like that it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine Ill crush you

variations
Baby when youre speakin like that it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine Ill crush you
Baby when youre speakin like that it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine Ill crush you
