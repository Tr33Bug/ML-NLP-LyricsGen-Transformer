Plus Im jazzy and like to dress to impress

Tinted window whips lots of chicks lots of chips
Anything aint right then the brothers gotta flip
Or skinnydip after a sip of Cognac rap
Any wack wimp with whiskers I bomb that cat
Alarm that cat that when we slide through abide to
The rules thats been laid down by    true like bibles
Im liable to come through seven deep with Wizzies
And ditch em while other ladies whisper who is he
Then later leave with eight new ones me an airtight Willie
Bout to smack you silly with two guns
So hereby I certify dont care if you feel hurt if I
