Chorus Guru and Stikken Moov  repeat 2X 
Whats the question Why are you flexin
Heres the answer  choice of weapons
Yo The  Remainz kid why you flexin like a bicep
Heat on your hip just to get a rep it aint worth it
Just because you pack a biscuit doesnt mean you cant
Become another statistic you figure it
Lifes a gamble even for vandalz I handle mine with minds
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest
The fear of layin in wreck causes the stress
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when its best
Yo little big man feelin your oats because youre strapped
Bustin a cap at another kid whos black
It aint all that when the shots are flyin back
You made a choice and the choice you made was wack
Kinda tipsy with the liquid confidence
Pullin your pistol when it doesnt make sense
To be the bigger man you figure
But in the end it dont pay when youre livin by the trigger
Chorus 2X
Yeah its the master of the who what where and the why
But still I got a problem with seein my brothers die
Ive been around and lived past the average age of us
In every obituary a full page of us
The game is money but what about inner wealth
The mental the spiritual and physical health
But still everyday the city is a test
Thats why some people feel a gun is the best
No doubt I pack protection but every altercation
Or situation doesnt deserve blastin I mastered precisions
Choice of weapon should I peel or peel out
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

Chorus 2X
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam Stikken Moov swarm
Ready to bust off like Ron Jeremy but I chill G
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three
Thats why I wield the steel yes my microphone is crazy real
Im not the one sellin out to get the mass appeal
But jail cells are filled with my peeps
While the rest are gettin killed in these ill ass streets
Chorus 2X
So pick your weapon a mic or a gun
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns check it
Leavin the spot I seen some wild kids
One stepped to me asked me to freestyle kid
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side
I looked him in the eye smiled and walked to my ride
He was actin kinda hard on the surface
I said to myself that it really wasnt worth it
Yo you think youre all that cause you pack heat
Seein your own brother play the concrete in defeat
Tryin to prove yourself while you put the next man down
But what goes around comes back black best believe that
Chorus 2X
You know what Im sayin
Thats all the real heads all over the world
That realize that this music is real
That we keep it real like that
Peace to all my brothers on the third
And all the real brothers in hiphop
Its like a raps new generation thing baby
Peace to Guru
Its Panche the wild comanche suicide
