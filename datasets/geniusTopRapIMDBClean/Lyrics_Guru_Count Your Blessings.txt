Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Yo just count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
I say to thee well count your blessings 
I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasnt right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky like Im walkin on a tightrope
But now I see its time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me Imma light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love so I ought give my thanks first
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
I said you better count your blessings 
Too many times I asked Why me
And I recall when things werent goin how they sposed to be
Yeah I know you dig what Im relayin
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I aint saying that I dont do no wrong
Im saying I aint trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
Im building with my family my loved ones depend on me
Ive got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner powers too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But Id rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs feel the vibes Im tryin to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who cant find a open door

Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Now as we head into the year 2000
And more and more people cant even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures so some choose illegal tools
By all means you know we must survive but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing well hear is the cries and the screaming voices
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times I felt bad
Too many times I couldnt see what I really had
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings 
Too many times I felt bad  count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
Better count your blessings   fades
