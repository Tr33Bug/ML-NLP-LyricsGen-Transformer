Yo here goes some info on my flow and how I move
To a def groove I keep my rep smooth
On the downlow I travel with my mind to the street
Concrete like the gravel Im in deep
So I gotta hit ya from a real perspective
Cause anyone whos talkin that crap will surely get his
Im not the one to act flashy
Cause man where I be at we dont have to be classy
Down the backstreets down the backstreets

Check it stupid
While youre out there on the main streets frontin
Your games week so Im huntin you down clown
Cause you need to learn somethin
All that bluffin wont get you nothin but killed
No mission fulfilled because theres others who will
Get jealous hell if they can take clout from you theyll do it
So thats what Im about to do Ill step to it
And strip you of your pride  your pride 
And then Ill stick and Ill rip you up from all sides
Or possibly Ill let you slide slime
Cause youll set your own death in just a matter of time
Yeah and Ill be somewhere on the sidelines yknow

Cause I been out here for a few
So all that youre doin aint really nothin new  nothin new

Cause I dont have to be a pop star to rhyme great

Or else were gonna have to run up and SMACK all the weak
Comin straight from the backstreets
And Im out ninetythree its all me
