Feel the music
Feel the music
Times like this make me clench my fist
Then Im caught up in the midst of the musical bliss
Guru blow a kiss to the ladies in my corner
Caress the mic and kick my game like I wanna
What You never see the brother Guru falter
Respect is due praise me like the altar
The crew were as true as they come son
We come from ill life experience and take rap serious
Feel the music
We hold the key to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane were goin
Can you feel the music
Feel the music
Original baldhead Crooklynite rudebwoy instructor
I came back to lay down law to the suckers
Ill crush ya if you aint actin like my brother
Make one false move and with the mic Ill bust ya
Just lay back and feel the music
We hold the key to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane were goin
Can you feel the music
Feel the music
Feel the music
Feel the music


When I step into the club I come to do work
No hesitation because Im fully alert
Like Max Julien Im an authentic Mack
Many others cant compare Ill bet on that
Dialect and vocal tone completely exact
I react then I max in this mellow track
In fact Im knockin MCs out the frame
Cause Im smooth like jazz Guru is my name
Feel the music
Feel the music
We hold the key to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
New reality a higher level of consciousness
Dont play yourself get out of line and get stomped with this
Negativity is a chronic disease
But Im like the cure causin infections to freeze
Im not gonna let up until you get the picture
My sound gets around so you know Im always with ya
Feel the music
Feel the music
We hold the key to our destiny
We can make it everybody
Feel the music
Just free your mind sit back relax and unwind
To a higher plane were goin
Can you feel the music
