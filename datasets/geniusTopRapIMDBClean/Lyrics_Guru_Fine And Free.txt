Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
Fresh off tour Im the best Im sure
More thirsty than before Boy I guess Im raw
Im like James Bond mixed with Julian Bond
Thats why bouncers never frisk the side my toolie is on
Now the venue is bubblin gettin close to a frenzy
Ladies rush up to the front with high hopes to tug me
They lust for me They know Im trustworthy
Rich girls wanna empty out their trust for me
So city by city and town by town
My performance is gritty you know how I get down
And Imma bless you with more than just a nice song
Yeah Imma leave a mark thats lifelong
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
Im married to this heart yo I love my spouse
The stage is like my crib and yo I love my house
Im shoppin with switchblades my presence is felt
Anything I desire Imma get it myself
Im prettier smarter wittier harder
Its time to push the envelope a little bit farther
When I touch the mic aint no fuss and fight
And if theres somethin out of line then Ill adjust it right
I can be cool and calm but when the duel is on
Might even spaz on that ass until your cool is gone
I heard you sold your soul for a hundred Gs
Guess thats why all you can rhyme about is pumpin kis
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah


They say that good things come to those who wait
I found that bad things come to those who hate
So to each his own and when I reach my zone
Hearts throb the hunnies cant leave me alone
See my voice is like an aphrodisiac
Soon as they hear it they dreamin bout me in the sack
See Im sort of like a tutor in Kamasutra
Im like Dexter St Jock when Im punchin the clock
Well enough about my prowess with the ladies
Man the culture is sufferin cause these cowards are lazy
Their whole repertoires consist of jewels and cars
Whats the point Hes just another foolish star
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
