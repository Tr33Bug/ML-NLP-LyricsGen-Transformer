Dedicated to all my peeps who looked out over the years
KnawhatImsayin This ones for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true

To my moms and my pops Im glad you stayed together
I dont know too many people to demonstrate true love better
Nowadays kids dont have anyone
But you were there and determined to make me get plenty done
Yes to achieve although a lot of times I hurt you
But Im matured now Im showing you my true virtue
As I deliver to you an oath of never ending love
Admiration and respect for there is nothing above
A mothers strength and a fathers concern
There was guidance no matter which way I turned
Yo pops if I could be half the man you are Id be a star
Moms thanks for pushing me real far
As I proceed through the tundra and harsh winds
I think reviewing what youve instilled within
So Im taking time out to let you know
Once a boy now a man thanks for helping me grow
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
Going out to my peoples for all the times weve spent
Fifty deep up in the party getting crazy stupid bent
Around the block puffin lye cruising in the car
Whatever we was doing I wont forget it Baby Pah
When I had no dough you were there
You hooked me with some ends to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other faking clowns tried to start hanging around
See you were always genuine
Thats why respect is due and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
Were rolling thick hitting harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
Id rather check my man so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college some MCs would flunk out
Sending shouts to my peeps crazy love no doubt
For you dedicated true
Im doin this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doin this one for you
A true friend kid is mad mad rare
Trusting others is a risk a lot of things aint fair
Cause where I be at a lot of strange things happen jack
You can know a kid for years and still hell stab you in the back
But thats alright cause Im a good judge of character
And me and my family we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealing with the struggle The Good the Bad and the Ugly
Yo under pressure were the best
No matter what the circumstance no matter how much stress
Our force has the power to bring forth change
Id rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always I said always be applauded
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doingthis one for you
For you dedicated true
Im doing this one for you
