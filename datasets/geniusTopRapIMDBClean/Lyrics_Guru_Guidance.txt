Dedicated to my son thats about to be born
So by the time you people hear this record
My sonll be born
And I gotta teach him about life
Listen
To my little man you can never have too little plans
Always bring your game direct cut out the middle man
Life is full of sacrifice for truth you might have to fight
Someonell bring you down cause they aint livin right
Be sure to use your mind though look for all the signs yo
Dont want to make a move too quick and get left behind yo
Be in command of whatever you encounter
Appreciate your blessings son youll see what it amounts to
Obtaining your goals maintainin control
Selfrespect helps you to protect your soul
Never give up always be ready to try
Walk your own walk and keep your head to the sky
Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
And to my home boys who clearly understand
What it really takes to be a man and what it means to be the head of fam
The ups and downs of life plus the choices we make
Causes to reevaluate directions we take
And being up in the club is mad fun til they act dumb
And everyone still packs guns whether nines or mac oneones
Its time now for us to separate
The mediocre from the great keep all the jokers from the game
Ive played my position so why dont you try to play yours
Ive made my decision plus youre in my prayers
My life is changed now plus I got a shorty now
Mad responsibilities its like Im almost forty now
All the young girls wanna swing my wifey says she wants a ring
I wonder what the next days are gonna bring
We must live and fight for the right causes and be ready to die
I love you kid so keep your head to the sky


Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
Baby child did you know
Ever since you fell out the heavens you made me wanna grow
So Ill share with you everything
Make little girls and boys grow up to be kings and queens
Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
