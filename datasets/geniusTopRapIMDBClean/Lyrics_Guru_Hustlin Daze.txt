Baby Thad
Its ninety degrees on the corner in the summer heat
Dreamin of beach houses mad ladies and Hummer jeeps
Got another beep now its time to watch a brother creep
And pull another scam not hit the man but the brothers deep
Aint tryin to stay in this life for too long
You tellin me that Im bound to lose but you wrong
Im too strong plus me and my teams got a true bond
Ill stay in these streets you stay in the house where you belong
Yo whos wrong you never had to live in my shoes
And my views that every second is vital
The way I see niggas the way I G it
A raw ghetto entrepeneur yeah I be it
Not as glamourous as the gangster flicks
Ill show you some gangster chicks that hold me down we get rich
And get this bet this Im after payola
The loot the paper til my hustlin days are over
Im a hustler a hustler hmm
Gotta get the dough to win
And Im a baller yeah baller
Shot callerrr
I pack plenty of steel plenty of steel
For niggas that wanna be actin ill
All the player haters stay off my nuts
While Imwe handlin business
Illegal business I need to invest in somethin legit
This moneys comin too quick I copped a house and two whips
Who switched it not me Im keepin it real
Keepin the steel while the envious watch hungry Im eatin my meal
Late nights there aint no time for stage frights
This aint fiction its my mission to get paid alright
No need to speak about greed long as Im feedin my seed
Then Im completin the deed so Im keepin this cheese
Highpriced lawyers Im too nice for ya
Never touchin the work no more too precise for ya
Controllin the town holdin it down
Im the Master Allah Now Im showin you style
I go in your file and make you hard to locate
Delete all your data dont disregard your fate
Ill off you then Im off with a honey like suave bola
Shit Im livin this life til my hustlin days are over
Bouncin in and out of town hope I dont step out of bounds
Chicks love to crowd around cause of my rep how that sound
Enemies are growin in numbers hopin to catch me slumber
I wonder how many are hopin to take me under
NARCs and Feds throwin darts at my head
Some new cats tryin to make me part with my bread
Now Im in a zone worse than Nino in Sugar Hill
Now Im all alone the piper wants me to foot the bill
Now Im facin the judge my name on a folder
In jail for life my hustlin days are over
Baby Thad
