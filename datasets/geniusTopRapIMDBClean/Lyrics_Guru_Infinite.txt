We got infinite possibilities right now
Guru Blackalicious super producer Solar
Lets go
As I inhale the haze tip the scale beat the maze
Bearing scars from the days of when the master beat the slaves
I use the language of the drums to translate
Rhythmic messages to diffuse the hate
I refuse to wait
Things are harder than before
Cant believe we havent learned from the martyrs like Shakur
Im harder to the core and now I channel my bitterness
I handle my business and leave no witnesses
On your mark get set
All your marks get wet
On these stress you could meet your darkest threat
And every hoods got rapper that are very good
But I put scars on their petty bars
Im very hood
I serve a rapper like a Ace from Agassi
No other rapper in the place as bad as me
Picture me ever leaving the game
You better picture your brain never being the same
Serious these aint just words that rhyme
Theyre infinite thoughts to be preserved in time
Whole new meanings to define what livin is
Traveling the ways of the mind that is infinite
2x 
These days the inner lights so dim
Mental quite not so in the right
Zero skills with a mic
We are in fight just to be livin right
Youth we dont give em sight
Clock strikes midanight
Little time left hope we can get it right
Resurrect the mindless souls that are driven right
Into the den with a pen I deliver light
Keep on extending lights filled with verbal gigabytes
In a minute when I spit a bit a
Literate you get a bit of it a little wit her
Free slaves with lyrics right
Yall jump on in ride
Burn your own path
And let your spirits shine
And time and after
And grind after line
Put minds in a line
Grinds how I grind
Please pay attention
Bright rays of new visions
Spike rays from the flames of the infinite night
Serious these aint just words that rhyme
Theyre infinite thoughts to be preserved in time
Whole new meanings to define what livin is
Traveling the ways of the mind that is infinite
2x
