Insert A  Mental Relaxation Medicine Lyrics Nas my medicine sample plays in background throughout song 
Yo son pass me the medicine
Ah
Yes Ini Kamoze alongside the Guru
Baby I got red eyes
What I got red eyes
I got red eyes what
I got red eyes
Gimme the medicine I am no leprichan
Its the healin of the nation
I used to understand but now I overstand
African Herbsman Yes I am
Yes I am
My skills boom through the smoke filled room
Feelin the contact like the Mack I then consume
All fools who blunder so I take them under
Ground cuz I got the crazy phat sounds
I blend it with jazz and mystify the masses
Huh we teach blunt rollin classes
My dialect reflects hip hop at its best
After I fat burn of cess and yes I guess
That you could call it habitual
Why  Cuz every day is a ritual
Hit from a Thai stick not come from cocoa whip
My knee gonna never skip cuz a man like me dont never slip
As we elevate my ghetto mindstate
Cooked like a dove plate but wait but wait

Red eyes what I got red eyes
Huh tell ya what
Red eyes what I got red eyes
Hey
Determinded energetic born to suceed
Independently minded  Are you ambitious  Indeed
New Breed and suckers cant compare
To the Master the truth got you trapped in the square
Youre restricted while Im unlimited gifted
And Im even iller when Im lifted
Stimulated in the dome on the microphone
After a bone Guru why dont ya take em home
Yes I bring heat so feel the warmth from my free speech
Believe in Ja the ganjha helps me reach
My creative leaves of enlightenment
And when Im writin then you know just whos on the mic again
Fools on the map kid you took a nap kid
Takin me out is an impossible task kid
I spark you up lock you up huh now you gone
You shouldve paid attention way back when you were warned
Youre too into business I take gifts of my spliff
I change into what an expert will never quiz
The medicine the medicine the medicine
Lah will bring us back again
The medicine the medicine the medicine
Ja is comin back again
Now Im comin up so dont be runnin up
On my crew big up Guru pass the cup
Red eyes what I got red eyes
Pass the medicine I am no leprichan
Its the dealin of the nation
I used to understand but now I overstand
Im freakin herbs man
Yes I am
Red eyes I got red eyes
What I got red eyes
Redredredred eyes
What
