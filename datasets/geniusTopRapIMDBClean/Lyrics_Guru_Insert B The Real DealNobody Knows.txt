Insert B  The Real Deal Nobody Knows LyricsSo when you think you know the whole
You dont even know the half  Guru Mostly Tha Voice
Chorus Shara Nelson and Guru  repeat 2X 
Guru 
Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
What Im goin through Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams
Im catchin a flashback of the days when
My pockets were dry I only had a few friends
Those same brothers now my family
Weve been through it all in this industry
Mad frustrated ready to flip
Because the company was playin me like some dumb kid
Video out and Im still ridin the train
Workin and hustlin no pain no gain
Now here comes the spotlight still somethins not right
I gotta pay my rent by five oclock tonight
Livin on fifty cent noodles
But Im playin the game that the brothers know Im true to
Cant let up although the journey is rough
Focus on the goal like its the Stanley Cup
I gotta play this thing for keeps
My only stress relief is the hiphop beats
Chorus Shara Nelson and Guru
Guru 
Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
When I close the door Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
They try to kill my dreams Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams


Skippin the turnstyles everyday lifestyle
Lookin at this world with mad anger cause its wild
People thinkin that Im blowin up
But they dont understand the young man is growin up
Now who you think I should trust
Better rely on self no time for missin the bus
Fake people phony characters
They begin to swarm so I built up barriers
To block em out but they still dwellin
Makes me wanna just start yellin
But I play it cool though cause Im no fool yo
See chumpsll always try to break down your flow
Chorus Shara Nelson and Guru
Guru 
Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
What Im goin through Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams
No time for misery no time for empty wishin
fridgerators bare killin roaches in the kitchen
Just spent my last on a 40
To sip away my troubles now its worse cause Im hungry
I check my man for advice
He lent me 20 dollars and we lounged and got nice
I told him nobody knows about the wack side
I feel like a slave gettin whipped on my backside
Chorus Shara Nelson and Guru  repeat 2X 
Guru 
Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
When I close the door Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
They try to kill my dreams Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams
Chorus Shara Nelson and Guru  repeat 2X 
Guru 
Nobody knows Nobody knows the insides and out yall
What Im goin through Nobody knows whats behind the scenes
Nobody knows Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow
What I feel inside Nobody knows about the dreams bout the dreams
