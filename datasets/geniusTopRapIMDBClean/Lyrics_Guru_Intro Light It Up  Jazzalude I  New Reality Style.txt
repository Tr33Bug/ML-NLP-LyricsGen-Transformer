Intro  Light It Up   Jazzalude I  New Reality Style Lyrics
Bring the lights downbring the lights down
We all gotta do something really serious
If you have a lighter in your pocket
Light it up
All the way in the back
From the back to sidesto the front
Bring the lights downdown wit the lights
Word up
All the lighterslight them up
This is for a real good reason
I wanna see everybody do it
If you have a lighter light it up
Lets see it
Okthe right side is better
But the left side fill it upfill up the middle
In the middlein the backwaay in the back
Cmon yall
Yeah
Welcome to Jazzmatazz II The New Reality
Stressing the importance of family
For too long the black family structure has been systematically divided
And specially here in America
We must start pay more attention to one and other needs
We must start showing more respect for one and other
Knowwhatimsayin
Im talking about a mind revolution
A 360 degree mind revolution
Redefine our purposes organizing and utilizing our resources to gain focus
So we can create positive changes yo
This is serious
I take this rap stuff really serious
Anyone that knows meknows this
Plus I got a whole mob of incredible jazz artists and vocalists on this album down wit me
They gave me crazy love
So with no further delay
Dig the viberelax max and enjoy
Yours truly  Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
The GURU
One love
