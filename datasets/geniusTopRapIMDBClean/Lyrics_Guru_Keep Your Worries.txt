Yeah yeah my brother Guru
And Angie Stone  oooooohoooooh 
And DJ Scratch  yeah mm mmm 
Uhh Guru and Angie Stone
Angie Stone keeps harmonizing
Keep your feet out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name out your mouth
Until you got somethin worth talkin bout
Keep your hands to yourself
Cause I belong to someone else
Its the GURU once again settin it off
Lettin it off my chest plus bettin it all
Record sales awards accolades Im gettin it all
Mad chips right above my grip Im lettin em fall
Who said the GOD wasnt comin to do his thing
Who said the industry wasnt gonna bow to this king
I paid dues stayed true so I made it through
If you handle your BI fly guy you can make it too
Your potential is infinite be wise visualize witness it
Why waste your time focusin your mind on limp shit
Angie understands me and Scratch got my back
So keep away from the fire burnin desire yo we got that
Keep your feet out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name out your mouth
Until you got somethin worth talkin bout
Keep your hands to yourself
Cause I belong to someone else
Ive never been a
Stranger to struggle gotta maintain my hustle
Used to let the anger bubble
These streets can bring mad danger and trouble
And I can do bad all by myself
Do me a favor  dont be concerned about my wealth
If youre one of my peeps youre gonna know that
But if I aint feelin you player huh
My face is gonna show that
So keep your eyes off my pockets
Dont be surprised if I cocked it
Cant outslick a can of oil you never spoil my profits
See how Im flippin this here
Things are different this year
Aint got no time to listen to niggas
That be trippin this year
Cause and effect I always get applause and respect
When I rhyme universal laws truth and righteousness connect
You see the knowledge that Im kickins for you
And there is nothin that another can do
Try to stop me but I make it through
Recruitin angels as a warrior Im true
People need people its true
True pride will sustain
In order to do what I do I can let you live
With me inside my brain
Keep your feet out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name out your mouth
Until you got somethin worth talkin bout
Keep your hands to yourself
Cause I belong to someone else
Ive been tellin you that theres war out here
And Ive been tellin you that theres more out here
So stop limitin your thoughts
Stop reconstructin your plots
Its more than luck its an art
No more duckin from NARCs
Haters stay at a distance haters keep away from my fam
Haters stay in my business haters still playin this jam
Mad Wisdoms reflect the light of this man
Some jealous rappers tried to pick a fight with this man
But despite all the nonsense and false pretense I bomb this
Peace to those I get along with my real nigga Im strong with
And never get me twisted with no wack shit
And all that foolishness you was kickin heh
I know you wanna take it back kid
Keep your feet out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name out your mouth
Until you got somethin worth talkin bout
Keep your hands to yourself
Cause I belong to someone else
Keep your feet out my shoes
A nigga like me done paid my dues
Keep my comb out your hair
Unless you bout ready to take it there
Keep my name out your mouth
Until you got somethin worth talkin bout
Keep your hands to yourself
Cause I belong to someone else
