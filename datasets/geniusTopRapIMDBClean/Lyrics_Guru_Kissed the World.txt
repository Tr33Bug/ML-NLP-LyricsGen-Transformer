Georgie Georgie dont run
Kissed the world and made it cry
Gonna just say no this has gone too far
You better kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care
Mamas birth    isnt ready for this
You need to handle yours
This land is my land this land is your land
This land is my land youre sure man Sure
Cause Georgie wanna rage war on all fronts
And me Im a peace seeker when its all said and done
We got enough problems here why we messing with that
Politics in the mix and now were guessing again
Speculations as to whos a threat
Shoot shoot shoot em up Georgie cause youse a vet
Whos up next now I guess the Rootin Tootin
Invading and raiding is what youre used to doing
And I can understand war tactics
But without dialogue theres just more caskets
And everybodys scared to death
Turn on the news bad news be prepared to step
And there goes our favorite guy
George kissed the world and made it cry
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world  made it cry
Gonna just say no  this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth    isnt ready for this   
you need to handle yours
How dominating do you have to be
When it only ends up as a disaster G
After me there will be no more to warn you
There will be no emails no voice messages to inform you
That Georgies got a beef to settle
And you say no to weapons he says keep the medal
Sending troops of our native sons
Straight into battle no talking just blaze your guns
And Im from the home of the brave
You go against the mission youre gonna go in a grave
And thats the way Georgie wants it
Cause I dont think hes happy unless theres conflict
So many soldiers on the front line
Its getting tense everywhere when theyre in a crunch time
And there goes our favorite guy
Georgie kissed the world and made it cry
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world  made it cry
Gonna just say no  this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth    isnt ready for this   
you need to handle yours
Chorus
Georgie Georgie dont run Kissed the world  made it cry
Gonna just say no  this is gone too far Gotta kill the storm and restore the calm
Waste the bodies this you dont care Mamas birth    isnt ready for this   
you need to handle yours
Chorus  contd
Why do you want to do it like this I dont wanna    of your diss   
Kissed the world and made it cry Whyd you kiss my world good bye
Chorus  contd
Why do you want to do it like this I dont wanna    of your diss   
Kissed the world and made it cry Whyd you kiss my world good bye
