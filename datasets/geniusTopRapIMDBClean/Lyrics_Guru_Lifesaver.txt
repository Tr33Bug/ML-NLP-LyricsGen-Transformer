Mmm is this really the end or is it a new beginning
A new reality
So many misconceptions  Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions  Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
Scooby doo wah scooby doo wee
Like a jazz player I improvise wisely
Free with the style I flow like the Nile
But remember dont mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin
Like ancient African griots precise is my timin
But let me get to the essence of what Im sayin here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend
But dont bend to the mental strain
Against all odds we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life the Lord gave ya
And thats a message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver
So many misconceptions  Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions  Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  Oh I am I am I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
Oh I am the life  I am the lifesaver 
I am the life yeah
It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off knowledge Ill let some off
Cause nowadays everybodys a killer
And as for me no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life thats been torn apart
Over nonsense no law no order its evidence
That the money only takes precedence
Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die during every hour
I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver
So many misconceptions  Oh dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions  Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions  Oh I am I am I am 
Ive come to give direction  The life 
For I am the lifesaver
People talk about the Armaggedeon
And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son
Each days another test
Ayo I better do my best cause a lots ridin on my chest
So when I lead you to the water
You best know how to swim across so you can reach the border
Its international the message and the flavor
So heres some more important words from the lifesaver
The lifesaver  I am the life 
The lifesaver  I am the life oh oh yeah 
Garon fch grandissant dans la violence et la pisse
Le mot peace cest pour ceux qui prissent
Chaque jour aux alentours dans le monde et ses tours
En prison ou retour en arrire dans les fours
Et les conds font leur rondes les villes grondent
La terre chauffe les sommets de montagne fondent
Blondin a passe black a casse
Tel est mon uniforme dans une guerre entre races
On me regarde me met en garde  vue
Certains cafardent dautres bavardent et tuent
Ddicace  tout quartier toute cit aux pas de chance
ceux qui sont tombs mais pas pour la France
Pays trop bidon vivement Armageddon
Jai raison priant Jhovah pour mon pardon
Car si un flic me juge je le droite
Enfonant mon doigt dans son oeil et le fond de son cerveau je gratte
Goes off to fade 
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
Ive come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver
