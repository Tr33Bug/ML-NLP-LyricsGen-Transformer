Yeah Guru huh The Roots
Yeah cmon yall uh lift your fist
Uhh yeah lift your fist cmon
Uhh 
To all my people just lift your fist
Seem like it aint no peace no justice
How you want it the bullet or the microchip
Either way you got to lift your fist we get it down like this
To all my people ball up your first
Seem like it aint no peace no justice
How you want it the bullet or the microchip
Either way you got to lift your fist
Yo cmon
We livin life close to the edge dont push
But this aint eightythree and its not the Cold Crush
Its kids on the street strapped huffin that kush
They eyein the next cat livin all plush
I guess frustration make a brother do what he must
Whats the combination that can make a human erupt
Team leaders gettin mutinied up who couldnt read
The signs thinkin the day and times is like Tariq
Indeed we blast refuse to kiss ass
Quick fast ready to mash cause of a bugged out past
Swallow the pain follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of a man nowadays to maintain
Garments bloodstained face bruised and battered
Our eyes reflect the agony of dreams that were shattered
And they love it when we wild out and kill our own
But the greater responsibility yes is still our own
Uhh worldwide famine ghetto people demand
That somebody do somethin soon and lets examine
The facts behind the violent attacks
Behind the daily gunplay the cocaine and the crack
Thug season  whats the reason for the treason
Everybodys gotta eat some gotta resort to thievin
Take money money make money money money
Yo  from the time they eyes open til the clock strike death
Brothers is stressed walkin round holdin they chest
They got the government surveyin they steps and cant breathe
They dynamitin them projects to smithereens
Money comin but them days too few and far between
You tryin to taste just what the worlds offering yamean
I seen enough to make a grown man scream
Brothers thirsty and hungry to get that thing
Too many tears of pain too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available too few schools equipped
Too few role models just gangsters and pimps
Will you succumb will your heart grow numb
Or will you save the world and use your mind like a gun
Im the one  I turn a stickup kid to a soldier
Me and The Roots word up we takin over
w variations  2X
