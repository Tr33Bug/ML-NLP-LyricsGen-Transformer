Whats happening check it out
Its critical the situation is pitiful
Bear in mind you gotta find somethin spiritual
We never gain cause we blame it on the system
You oughta listen whether Muslim or Christian
Or any other type religion or creed
Cause what we need is less greed
We cant continue to kill ourselves
We gotta build and expand our wealth
So one more time Ill design a rhyme divine
To educate and elevate your mind
Nowadays we gotta fight to live
Human means we got a right to live
Without the homicide without the genocide
Dont tell me let it slide Im feelin ghettofied
So be a soldier of truth
Protect the lives of our youth

In the land of the free home of the brave
Too many of us reach such early graves
They tell us to behave but they dont know
About the neighborhood drug flow
They dont know about the drama or about the guns
I ask how many politicians steal our funds
And how many officers will turn up corrupt
The governments dont care they pass the buck
Im growin tired of the trickery
And the misery its makin me kinda sick you see
But now I meditate so I can get it straight
My thoughts penetrate so I control my fate
So be advised by the wise and concious one
We take the easy way out too often son
We better get some kind of work ethic
Realize it and correct it

From New York to LA dead children lay
Victims of an unfair society
But for those who are blessed
We must correct this mess or dissapear into nothingness
Were living in the age of doom
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom
The beast is stalking us but theres no stopping us
As long as we maintain the strength within us
Cause were winners descendants of the kings
They try to hinder us from doin our thing
So get the money but spend it wisely
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me
Realize that the key
Is for each to master his own destiny
Deal with reality and keep a tight focus
Cause theres a lot we got to cope with
