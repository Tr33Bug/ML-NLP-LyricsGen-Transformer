I keep the city balanced
Meet every gritty challenge
Stay low baby bro things get pretty violent
I got love for my people
Bust a slug for my people
Whether booshie or ghetto theres some wonderful people
Im the man of the year
You better clam up and hear
What Imma say cause I dont play
Youre gonna stand up and cheer
At the top of your lungs
Aint no stopping the Sun
Its a movement so move it
Yes the prophet has come
Bringing truth that was hidden
From the proof that was given
Make you forget about the life you used to be living
Time to make a change cause nothing stays the same
With discipline we can win and escape the pain
The spark will be within
Then hearts will beat again
What weve been taught must be forgot its time to see again
Up from the bottom we rise like the cream
They cant fool us nowadays were too wise for their schemes
Cut all the tough talking
Weve seen enough coughing coffin
You better recognize the time and get some stuff popping
No way to cheat us now
The babies need us now
Dont run look to the Sun
They cant defeat us now
See us now as we expose false knowledge G
Give new meaning for your life and for your own psychology
Bring our people higher
Begin reaching higher
For sure its time to nurture grow a deep desire
You see nothings going to change unless we change ourselves
Thats why I dont complain instead I came to help
Its like War and Peace Yin and Yang Life and Death
You have to respect someone with my type of rep
So ink to the paper and paper to ink
Yall go ahead and be stupid for me its safer to think
I speak to those who hear me
I speak to open minds
I speak of more than theory
And we shall know in time
