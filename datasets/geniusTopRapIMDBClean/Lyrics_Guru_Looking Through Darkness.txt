You know sometimes I be lookin through the darkness
Tryin to find the light
Tryin to do whats right with all my might
Lookin through the darkness
Yeah Im lookin lookin at you 
Lookin through the darkness
I see you lookin at me whatcha wanna wanna do 
Lookin through the darkness
Here we go take a walk with me 
Lookin through the darkness
Check it out now now now now now now 
Now as I peer through the window of gloom and everyday living
And all the hardships one faces to make you give in
I dig more intensely finding greater strength
A lot of heads is empty Ive got a greater rank
Than MCs not aware of situations
Thatll force one to understand true stipulations
Thou shalt not bite thou shalt not front
Fake it if you want but for the battles Ive come cause Im
Lookin through the darkness
Yeah Im lookin out lookin at you 
Lookin through the darkness
Lookin at me my style is free do you wanna be 
For me this rap life is real life I dont have to create
Some false image to make the crowd get hyped
Too many children get the wrong message from clowns that walk around
Hopelessly lost thinkin that theyre the boss
Theyre in a daze while dope MCs dont get the front page
Me  I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly
Turning the anger and frustration straight into energy
Yes you will remember me as the brother who cared
To dare to step up with his soul bared
But never fearing cause Ive got instructions
From Him to go and fight the corruption so Im


Lookin through the darkness
Ive got to look through it try to try to find the light 
Lookin through the darkness
Uhh maintainin 
My granddaddy always told me to keep the light shining
So as my mic illuminates you can feel the state that Im in
Thoroughly immersed in a verse way more than hardcore
I endure cause in myself Im secure
Delivering syllables and selections with profound perfection
Comin back like the resurrection
In this session Im professin that those who dont
Hear and understand never loved me and so I planned
To take a stand as one who is firmly focused
Plus Im mad worthy with words
I rock from East New York all the way to the suburbs
The lightkeeper knowledge seeker
I switch the stress thats on my mind
Into the voice that rocks your speaker
And I get deeper than the ocean when Im
Lookin through the darkness
Yeah Im lookin through it 
Lookin through the darkness
Aint nothing to it but to do it
Gotta freak it now let me freak it check it out 
Lookin through the darkness
All my life 
Lookin through the darkness
Yeah ohh yeah 
Yo Im so ill I go ill when beats with jazz
Fill my need to express myself like the blues I cant lose
Weak MCs theyre seekin refuge
From my barrage theres no rescue
Then I look through the madness finding sanity
Im crazy alert I never swim in vanity
I do this rap stuff every year
Aiyyo peace to my fam especially my man Premier as Im
Lookin through the darkness
Yeah lookin out to the wilderness 
Lookin through the darkness
the jungle uhh everybodys got to rumble 
Lookin through the darkness
Lookin through the darkness 
Lookin through the darkness
Lookin through the darkness
Got to find my way doin my own thing 
Lookin through the darkness
Walkin through the darkness 
Got to find a way
Got to get got to get it on
Can you see the light 
Got to get got to get got to get it on
Peace aight 
Lookin through the darkness
Lookin through the darkness
Got to get got to get Ive got to get it on
Lookin through the darkness
Got to get got to get Ive got to get it on
Got to get got to get Ive got to get it on
