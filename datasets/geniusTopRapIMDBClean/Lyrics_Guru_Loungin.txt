Yea Im loungin I got my man Donald Byrd on the horns
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man Miko hes 2 years old
Hes away visiting his grandmoms but I miss him dearly
Check it out
If I rhyme this you will find this situation shall advance
You could take a glance or dance
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd
Now tell me whos the man to show you how
Many legacies of brothers who get busy
And I do it fluid til the suckers get dizzy
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street
And check the flow thats unique
For loungin loungin mellow out and just loungin
Loungin loungin mellow out and just loungin
Cant refuse this never lose this its the choice this
Cause my voice is the smoothest
Dominating to your boys cause Ive been around doing work
And sold tons of other jerk
Donald Byrd word on the track quite exact
Giving you the format Jack
See we gotta pave the way and display
How to loungin loungin mellow out and just loungin
Loungin loungin mellow out and just loungin
Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try and clear
My throat check out what I wrote
You cant tap into this unless you know the roots
Word shoe like life absolute
For real so now you gotta know the deal
For loungin just loungin mellow out and just loungin
Loungin loungin mellow out check it out and loungin
Loungin just loungin mellow out and just loungin
Loungin loungin peace to Brooklyn where I live


Realistic kind of mystic when I kick this
You should witness the slickness
Of the horn player and the dope rhymesayer
Quite emotional and inspirational
Philosophical and yes very logical
Teaching you the method for loungin
Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back
Kick their feet up yknow
Listen to some good music and just lounge
Thats right I said lounge
