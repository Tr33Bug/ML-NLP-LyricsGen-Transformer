Sound your horn
Stiggettyyooourhiggetyhorrron
Yeah Sound your horn boy
You see
Dem want to kill de youths
Kill de youths and Kings
Dead first at eleven
Never tell de youths that Pokemon be the settin
Never tell de youths
Send down to earth be the endin
Now look what I did
Mashin Up Da Earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before
Not to mention Rikers Island to see dem youths dem sleepin on the floor
Check the cycle God ended
Whats the fate of this planet
Black on black love and hates got my people frantic
Peep the criminal mind
The subliminal line
Such difficult times
Automatic pistols and Glock nines
I wish I could stop time
For the cat who drop dime
Thinkin about his lifeline
A young man told me that my wise words saved his life
It made me feel good
Made me feel real good
Back in the day I used to steal goods
Dreams without means is like a lack of selfesteem or lack of CREAM
I go for delf or roll out for the team
Chorus 2X
Line 1 only


Feel the pain of the ghetto through a teardrop
My peers stop and listen from eighteen years
Muslim and Christian We all face conviction
In this moment of oppression The world is like infection
On this block we confessin
I use my mind as a weapon
Like I told my brothers Glock and Snub
Aint No HalfSteppin We gotta live Heaven
And watch our seeds taste the blessin
I learned my lesson bout havin snakes around my crew
Now I know the evil that men do and bitches too
We had thought by our riches
Some called thugs and snitches
Through the different timeframes
Kid I watched crime change
In the time of fame
My man is like crackcocaine
But through the black rain I seen many suffer in pain
We go for gain and pain
Now they rock some fat gold chains
Icedout name perform a concert sellin out in Maine
Own the properties and all types of things
Some say the drug game and the music game is all the same
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
We can no longer put all the blame on the man
For those sellin out Im sayin Shame on the man
For those fallin victim Im sayin Make a new plan
And for those that need a way Im sayin Take my hand
See this mental slavery causes rash behavior G
And I have to say for me that I wish it would all stop
Before we become extinct before we all drop
And RIP to the rappers thats been slain
And RIP to the fine young men whove lost their lives
I feel the pain
And do you know what its like to lose a loved one
It makes you numb
Especially when its over somethin small but aint no fun
I lose four friends in one year I could feel
Them watchin over me see their faces still
Some clear and some fear whats out there
For me I have no time to and may I remind you
This is a corrupted world of our design du
Peep my discussion no one can changes these things but us son
We didnt ask for the liquor crack and guns
We didnt ask for the poor eduction and lack of funds
But I know one thing none of us wanna die
But still were Mashin Up this World and I dont know why
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
Mom and Dad wipe the tears from ya eyes
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
Oohoohooh Riot in the prison
Rikers Island
When a gust of GPE Babylon will stand to see
So the sentence cant be free
Oohoohooh Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
Oohoohooh
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry
Oohoohooh
