When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
You can see a lot of things if you look deep enough
Its all around
The city skyline in the nighttime be the right time to ball out
Yeah  Whos the real pimp gangster hustler you call out
Is it him is it him or is it Dukes over there
Real recognizes real so yo no one cares
The chief executive mack in so deep you cant imagine
Ive seen the beatdowns the gunfights plus the paddywagon
See daddy with his pants saggin pushin whips thats too fly
Switchin up to a suit and tie ladies say hes too cute to lie
Forget about it  And none of my girls wanna talk to you
Plus none of my boys gotta talk to you
Cause when you see me theyll be somewhere in the cut
And you cant be me so nip that weak talk in the butt
The partys crowded and everyone is showin love
Whassup whats the deal hows things holdin up
Whassup young blood 
The smooth dude that moves through with the utmost precision
Truly a wiseguy seein life with my night vision
See that young blood comin down the street
Dont be hypnotized by the stride of his feet
Pickpockets streetwalkers number runners hustlers
Lots of ladies wanna check me out
And lots of haters wanna X me out
I got more style than Gucci Louis or Prada
Drop more jewels on you than your uncle or father
Once this envious kid was temptin me kid
To stoop down to his level and cold empty his wig
He was mad cause his girl wanted up in my world  hahahaha 
I looked the other way and she was still stuck in my world
Aiyyo baby wants to run with me come with me have fun with me
I be the man when Im dipped or in a tshirt and dungarees
I overheard her man that was screamin in her ear
While I nodded to my peeps who was schemin in the rear
If hes gon flip hes gonna find out quick
That I stroll with a click and we roll mad thick
He shook my hand and laughed it off that was his best decision
We keep it tight aight Hangin out with that night vision
I bust into this night club
I can see you perpetraters
Passin out your BIDness cards
Wearin your knockoff gators
Pimps heartbreakers dumbass Johns
You got to make a decision to go witcha instincts
And rely on your night vision
