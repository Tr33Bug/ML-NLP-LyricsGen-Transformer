Aight aight dont be yellin yo
Calm down man can we talk like civilised people
I cant take this no more
I dont love you
No More
Come Ill show myself to the door
I dont love you
Cuz I dont love you no more
Im out the door I cant take it no more
Things have really changed its not like before
I mean the vibes between us nowadays are quite shaky
And lately I aint been feelin you baby
Somehow you left my interest wander
And now Im fond of someone else whos diggin me for me
Its what I longed for
About our current arrangement I aint sure
Cuz I dont think I love you no more
And yo I had a major effect on you I know
But sure you be showin disrespect to me so I gotta go
You never gonna see it how I do
And I dont like your attitude and I dont like being lied to
Im not a door you cant push my buttons
We tried to make it work still weve come up with nothing
So now my patience is thin the fighting is a bore
And I dont think I love you no more
I dont love you
No More
Come Ill show myself to the door
I dont love you
Cuz I dont love you no more

Girlfriend Im walking to the door
Aint gonna see me no more
All you seem to do is bore
Me since I came back off tour
See if I can take your ways
Im walkin away from only bad days
I know there is no easy way
But theres nothing you can say
To change my mind yeah
I wish I didnt feel this way wish I was kidding
But another girl has stepped on the scene to put her bid in
I never would have looked in another direction
But you got a strange way of showing love and affection
So I told myself that I deserved better
You only came my way because you heard I had cheddar
And now you seem to me to be so immature
And I dont think I love you no more
And plus I know about that stuff you told your crew when we met
I gotta go somewhere so please let me jet
See you forget about my generous ways and my good heart
You never wanna admit youre wrong but you should start
Lets put our differences away and end this peacefully
We havent been getting along at all recently
Ive been thinking about this since I came home from tour
And Im sure I dont love you no more
Now I gotta explain that Im loving and feeding you no more
Everything keeps sticking around since I came back off tour
So tell me why do I have to explain myself baby ey
Cuz girl you gotta admit that theres nothing more for me to say
Ooh yeay
I dont love you
No More
Come Ill show myself to the door
I dont love you
Cuz I dont love you no more
