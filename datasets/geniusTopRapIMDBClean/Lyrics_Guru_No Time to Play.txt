Your time is runnin short sport
Make a move or get caught
Nothing lasts forever nothing lasts forever baby
Maybe you shouldnt act so crazy
Instead of tryin to be the man
You could REALLY be the man if you had a plan understand

I need the cash I need the cash money
With my rhyme display I may take all the paper
Wild I guess I have the knowhow
When you see me in the house you better go Whats up G
Whats up Gang Then give me a pound
Because Ive been down dedicated and Ive waited
For my turn cause respect is somethin you earn
