Watching her driving by in her new whip so fly
Wish she could sing me a lullaby
And set me free like a butterfly
In her eyes is a flame that burns right through my soul
Cant pretend to be cool about to lose my control

Like an exotic fantasy into a frenzy she sends me

I wanna caress those hips now wanna kiss those lips now
