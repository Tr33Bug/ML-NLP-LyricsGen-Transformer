So respect the architect  BizMarkie  cut 3X 
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Im mystical dont be deceived by the visual
Visible preference is pure patent it back to metaphors
Greetin em Illadelstyle wild
Analyze my memoirs runnin on 84 poetic meter
Soarin way beyond
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam
Unsyncopated soul piercin earlobes and egos
My vocals read these thoughts  am I hardcore
To the grain
Lame game plain Jane MCs cant approach these
I shake chumps like fleas I hold the keys
To drive you guide you provide you
With the real joints ahem I clear my throat of phlegm
The architect selecting the blueprints
To rid the game of nuisance
Sucker reducin with the fusion
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution
Stackin concrete flows look out below
So respect the architect
BizMarkie  cut 2X  
as I begin to build
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles
Most MCs couldnt see me with bifocal spectacles
Theres no protectin you with realness Im wreckin you
Im beggin you take a look into the cypher
Youre dirt on my windshield so Im turnin on my wipers
And I can see clearly now
No other rapper is near me now
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now
Never flip folklores only realness
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck
Respect the Architect in this division
Rhymes written to be hittin like antiproton collisions
Rap newest edition bringin the feminine in renditions
In rare form defined as optimal for my pedigrees
In skill three like threesixty degrees as in wellrounded
Leavin the competition dumbfounded
For when I catch wreck I astound
So respect the architect  BizMarkie  cut 3X 
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Floor to ceiling constantly building
With power to construct towers of rap CREAM kid what
Dreamin youre lyrical physical mystical
Your concepts mediocre plus your way too typical withcha
Corny delivery and crazy wack voice
Mad corny image thats why I give you jitters
It figures Id have to dust you off the scene
Like a wiseguy with my New York lean
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate
From state to state universal be the orals that I create
Top notch and on lock like Sentry opponents could never tempt me
Samplin my style like an Akai S950 and still cant get with me
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic
Conductin phonics like the Philharmonics
I make in measured melody kids praise me like the crucifix
So place Bahamad amongst your top ten of emcees
So respect the architect  BizMarkie  cut 3X 
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Yeah neverending knahmsayin Always buildin
My homegirl Bahamadia in the hidouse yeah yeah
And of course my man the legend
Ramsey Lewis
So respect the architect knahmsayin One love
