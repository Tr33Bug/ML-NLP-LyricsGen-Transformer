Intro 
Thats right Boston
Yeah Boston niggas be rollin dolo from state to state
Its nothing we do this
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Yo jealousy can kill so I test my skill
Any pomp I can romp and stomp at will
Now as I gets my thrill its like my daily drill
You spill raps and invade cause Ive been made to ill
You cant talk the talk you cant walk the walk
Been dwelling with the muggers and the murderers talk
Your shocked by the way I regulate ya obliterate ya
Erase your obsolete weak cheap data
Its this hiphop art I stay true to crack brew to
I fuck your girl a lot better than you do
The type of lyrics I spit will never fail you
Battle you online type a letter forward it then email you
Take you off the track and derail you
Get the hell out my face dont want to be near you
Dont want your snippets hate your album or your headshots
Its ED OG in the blackfitted Red Sox
Thuggin the streets but you soft at home
You got skills off the dome
Im a off your dome
This is a battlefield no time for screaming and yelling
You get smacked in the face use your ice for the swelling
Besides the records Im selling
My momma raised no felon
On the hunt like Helen
For whack rappers whos jellin
This is drama not a kitty show
You want to get fucked up
Like the lowbudget video
I know a lot of times passed
The ED OG is still here and yall still halfass
Yall still half ass
Yall halfass rappers
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Its the return of the mouthmusher skullcrusher
Pack myself with two nines and cold crush ya
That nigga all day beating down suckers
Sporting the game making it get more rougher
The facepuncher the hotcruncher
The have it with gods for the law outtoluncher
The seventhirty know Im more than a sick man
The streets raised this wild ass nigga from Murderpan
The real rapper the pimpslapper
The put on the socks with your suit and stay dapper
Whoa the chumpchoker the backwood tree smoker
Stash the gats in the sofa its all over
One life to live and thats that
I keep my lyrics heavily packed and cocked back
Ill smash you right in your fucking face black
Im the realest nigga what you know about that
Im a let my skills shine like brand new chrome
And tell them sonniggas you run with that daddys home
I roll dolo from state to state it feels great
And in two thousand get on the stage and demonstrate
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
No holds barred Im going all out
I dont think your for real I think your all mouth
So bust one for my dogs locked down
And for my real rap lovers know I got it locked down
Untill your blocked down punks get beat down
You cant rock a party take a seat you clown
I frown upon scavengers and wannabes
Commit atrocities upon MCs who think they heart is mean
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Smokey gray Lexus diamond necklace
We livin wreckless and die for these inspectors
The four pounders cock the name on you outoftowners
And what henne filled cups peep the diamond cut
Ice paradise living in the thug life
Married to the game fuck a lame diggin out your wife
Loving all these block wars do shit thats uncalled for
Make money in your spot get it locked shoot down four
For all your ghetto revenues
Spraying through any avenue
Running Ill be grabbing you
Hogtied and smacking you
With heaters on purpose
Hold you hostage like you was Turkish
And your pussy ass elevated gut it down your worthless
These thoughts is vivid and we talk if you live it
Rappers brag about a town but dont get respect in it
Aint a damn shame whats thats mans name
That got a flame to his nut
Clearing out his spot with a rusted hook
Trust me its not this entertainment
Ask the judges that face me on the arrangement
Plus I came with hundreds of niggas that think the same
The plastic hotter than acid to melt the brain
You know the rest man
