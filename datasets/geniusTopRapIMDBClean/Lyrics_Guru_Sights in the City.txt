One Saturday sweet Renee ran away
Couldnt take moms yellin didnt wanna stay
Her girl told her that she could get quick cash
Goin on dates for Pimp Daddy Nash
She said Well I dont know I gotta meet him
You say hes fly mmm I gotta see him
The next thing you know shes out late nights
Makin dollars for Nash wearin her skirts tight
Now shes a victim of the system
Man what happened to her dreams and her ambition

Old Mr Fillmore he owns a grocery store
Its a small little shop the children call him Pop
But of course he keeps a shotgun
Just for protection cause hes got a little grandson
On Sunday while he was there cleanin
He heard the front door slam a lady screamin
He grabbed the shottie and walked out from the back
All he saw was two kids wearin black ski masks
He fired they fired all at the same time
Now theres a funeral on Wednesday a quarter to nine
