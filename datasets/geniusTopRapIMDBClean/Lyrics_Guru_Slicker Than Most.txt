All around the city and from coast to coast
Im slicker than most Im slicker than most
All around the city and from coast to coast
Im slicker than most Im slicker than most
Who put the jazz in the hiphop funk
Its me chump the originator with the flavor
Just like a finetuned sax Im all of that
Im gettin fatter than fat to be exact
So when you step to see the man command
Dont get too close unless you cant withstand
The pressure cause now Im the aggressor
Callin you out to test skills
Lets see who get props and who gives the best thrills
Chill kid you gotta acknowledge

Lyrics are tight with much insight bro
So never secondguess the smooth one
And if a sucker tries to diss then Im the rude one
Cause I can kick it you know I rip it
Yo pass the brew so I can sip it

So in 93 Im takin whats mine
And this you gotta acknowledge
Cause Im slick so watch me clock the dollars
All around the city and from coast to coast

All around the city and from coast to coast
