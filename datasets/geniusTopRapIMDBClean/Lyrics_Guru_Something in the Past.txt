I havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize it was something in the past
Yo you look good how you been
Hows my little man hows he doing
And umm did you get the package that I sent
I hope that he knows that theres someone who loves him
But Im gettin vexed at you and I
I cant front baby yeah you still look fly
And as I try to get my words together
Theres a lot of nice times that I start to remember
The good shit always outweighed the bad
I never wanted to make you sad
So think of me as one man
Who has crazy respect for you as a woman
Although the plans didnt work out
It doesnt mean I wont look out
For you and yours I wish you the best
Because its over I guess
I havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize its something in the past
Now Im livin the life of a true mack
Devoted to my music tryin hard not to look back
But on occasion I can see your face
The memories they got me driftin a little taste
But now youre doin your thing Im takin care of mine
And so were movin on leavin the past behind
I guess relationships they aint for me
Thats why I had to set you free
I havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize its something in the past
Havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize its something in the past
My personality is magnanimous
Thats why the ladies always cause a fuss
Its in the past what we had
Aiyyo respect to your moms and peace to your dad
Im glad that weve been through this
Because you know what Ive noticed
A lot about myself see I wanna gain wealth
They say that chasin women is bad for your health
I havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We have the joys and pain the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize its something in the past
Havent seen you in a while since you sparked the flame
We had the joys and pain the sunshine and rain
Now you got your man I got my staff and we laugh
Then I realize its something in the past
Somethin in the past
Somethin in the past
These moments never last
Somethin in the past
Dedicated to all the ex girls
You know Im on with the next girl
Peace
