My mind blows decisions at times indecisive
I think about the paradox that life is
Keep my head to the sky and understand what Christ is
Turn off the news cause every day is a crisis
Lifeless niggas on the couch weeded out
Its certain types of niggas in my life I weeded out
I believe in the route of soul before paper
No gold before labor truth told with no glaziers
Days are getting darker quick
I was told it was written Ima author it
Wanna go the same place that the martyrs went
The black figures on the wall in my apartment
Like LaDainian yall I be charging it
Touching down with the people from my town
Its the Chi that be giving me my ground
Dug in the crates of my soul and I found clarity
Be yourself  ah and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself  and be so clear 
So just be yourself  yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself  and be so clear 
Be yourself  yeah and be so clear 
Ayo just be yourself  and be so clear 
So just be yourself  yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself  and be so clear 
Toiled in the trenches faced judges on benches
Betrayed by some that I fed not to mention
Standing here now in the best condition
Up outta the dirt so I suggest you listen
See money cant make you or me
Protect my mind with nines cause it shines more than jewelry
Used to do things that werent too productive
Now I breathe life into mics for your comfort
I see past the groupies and golddiggers to fine women
How Im living Doing me and not savagely driven
Taught the game of fortune and fame
So Im not playing no more I hold the torch with flames
Ive lost and gained at the same time
MCs biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes
Once you see past the surface
That trash is worthless with me you get a lasting purpose


Be yourself  and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself  and be so clear 
So just be yourself  yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself  and be so clear 
Just be yourself  ah and be so clear 
Ayo just be yourself  and be so clear 
So just be yourself  yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself  and be so clear
