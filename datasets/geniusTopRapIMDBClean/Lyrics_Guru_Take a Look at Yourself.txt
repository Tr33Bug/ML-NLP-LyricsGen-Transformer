Take a Look  at Yourself  Lyrics A lot of people dont realize that
The reason why Im talkin is Im tired of most 
And Im tired of suckers always complain about your situation
Cause you frontin  you dig  
Take a look at yourself
Take a look at yourself
Take one big look
Take a look at yourself  you dig  
You came up short man  thats right 
Yes just one time too many  too many 
Dont try to get too friendly  nah 
I shouldnt give you any  none 
RESPECT you know respect  yeah 
Youre messed up son tryin to play mack money  mack money 
You went for self for the fast wealth but you know whats funny
Now youre fallin crawlin cryin out for reasons  oww 
Should I sympathize or let my lyrics give lesions
And cuts Cause I can straighten you up
I aint on no crusade  nope 
Its just that your games played  yup 
But are you afraid to make moves and get really paid
You might fade  goodbye  cause punk you live for today
And most of your chances already blew away
Take a look at yourself
Take a look at yourself
Take one big look
Take a look at yourself  you dig  
Listen  check it son 
Forget the dissin Im admittin
Ive done some wrong also wrote some dope songs  word 
My man Roy he brought the vibes along
Now Im there in here gettin funky with the track
I used to drive a Cadillac it took me there and back  right 
But seriously black how you livin  how you livin 
From what I can see word to mother youre slippin
If I were you Id stop this fantasy world stuff  quit it 
Cause the real worlds tough you aint equipped enough
Step back analyze and use your own eyes to see  take a look 
I cant be you you cant be me
For your problems yo you cant blame no one else


Take a look at yourself
Take a look at yourself
Take one big look
Take a look at yourself  you dig  
I aint runnin away  never kid  yo are you
I been through the BS I got scars a few  many 
But I cant dwell in the hell that Ive passed through  nope 
Ima blast through  yup  and do what I gotta do  have to 
Amazing suckers think this rap stuff wont phase them
I wait then and cross the ceilings til they cave in  boom 
Or give in cause the power keeps me driven  thats right 
Ill destroy the weak noise with much poise and no toys
Or tricks  nope  so stay off my tip
And get a grip on your own and get a life of your own
And stop waitin for things to come to you
Thats for chumps  thats right  I know what you oughta do
Take a look at yourself
Take a look at yourself
Take one big look
Take a look at yourself  you dig  
Yeah I wanna give a big big shout out
To the Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and the Group Home
To my man Premier
Crazy shoutout to all the boroughs of New York
Know what Im sayin
Cause my man Roy Ayers is in full effect
Take a look at yourself
Take a look at yourself
Take one big look
Take a look at yourself  you dig
