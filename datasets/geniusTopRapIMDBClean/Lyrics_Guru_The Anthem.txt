Yo fuck the kiddy crap I did that stupid shit already jack
Many rapper talk about how they come strapped with plenty gats
And how they were sellin many cracks
I take my belt off and give em a hundredtwenty whacks
So many act so I treat em like my sons
And nowadays you got frail niggas frontin trife with guns
But Im the truth like Beanie none of yall can see me
Cause my family ties go as deep as Genovese
Baldhead to the SLICK
Wanna rhyme take a ride down my freeway
Peace to all the PJs and all the DJs
My word are like multitude so keep my shit on replay
He say she say niggas know Im the man
Leavin emcees depressed tryna find a new plan
And few can ever measure up to these standards
The name is Baldhead Slick and yo this is The Anthem

One of the first real niggas to ever rock a baldie
Slick Daddy thats what my ladies like to call me
Trained in combat still smooth in approach
Live from first class while you snooze in coach
Coppin cruiser boats so I can rule the coast
Any altercation our peeps and do a toast
I go from rockin Timberlands to wearin Gucci boots
Never chasin a silly bitch even if the groupies cute
Im stakin my claim breakin you lames
Ill choke you out into submission you aint takin a bang
Fuck it Im takin the blame for straight shakin you up
Wakin you up that doorag aint makin you tough
Honestly you suck like an infant on titties
Like kamikaze fighter planes I bomb your city
Call me gritty plus Im spittin at random

Drop you  right where ya standin
