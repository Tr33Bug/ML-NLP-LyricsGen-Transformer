Somethin to motivate to
Somethin to motivate you
The more travellin I do
The more wise I become
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Yes the traveler always on the move  keep it movin baby 
Makin power moves devourin the grooves
Goin city to city with the illest force  aiyyo 
Spannin the glove like Wild World of Sports
I go to Japan with plans to slam  aight 
I go to Spain and England with knowledge to bring them
crazy knowledge  I go to Holland and then to Germany
You better learn to see Ill be here for eternity  a long time 
I go to Switzerland and travel to Sweden
And give the real heads jewels that they needin  droppin jewels 
I go to Italy and also to France
With the chance to enhance the dance  cmon 
I tore up mad spots doin shows all over
I wreck the stage with East coast flavor  East coast 
But I go out West too and build with my peoples  true 
Some cant conceive how I do what I do
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Im the traveler I go place to place
They see my face then Im gone
Around the world and back yo the steelo is fat yo  huge 
From blocks to continents with mad impact  SMASH 
I got it like that ringin bells in the street
Midwest to Down South I turn it out kapeesh  you understand 
Wherever I go they give it up  uhhuh 
They wanna see me on the stage when I rip it up  rip it up 
Uptown downtown Crooklyn Queens Strong Island
Bronx Shaolin New Jersey the brothers know Im worthy  right 
Got to get the dough got to run the show
My mental pops the topics when its time to flow  word 
With expertise I release more techniques than 1200
Styles more than a 100  mad styles  yes I run it
More game than a little MCs dribble from the mouth when I hit
uhhuh  The fuse is lit makin your whole crew split
No myth  word  yeah
Im whippin evil everywhere ratification severely severe
aight  So clearly you hear
Original aspects unlimited significant thoughts
That make me different than  different than 
Most men who play the edge too close
And while they fall I fill halls coast to coast  everywhere 
The dressing rooms I roam in is the scent of blessings  boom 
Soon as we rockets to the next spot to wreck em
I put the pure in the store I got the cure  cmon 
Like a doctor switchin from planes to helicopters
MCs with your fake scowls you smell foul so I drop ya
you stink  And then I walked away with your propers  allathat 
Of course I had stop ya
See now you lost your spot ta the traveler
Makin it right
