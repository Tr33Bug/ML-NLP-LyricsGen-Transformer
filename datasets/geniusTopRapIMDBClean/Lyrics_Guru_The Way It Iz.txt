Yeah  New York New York 
Time to get up in that hitass  Brooklyn 
Uh the rap savior  representin kid 
Ill behavior  lets break it down 
This world is full of thugs hustlers big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause its my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
Your raps get bombarded
Allahu akbar baby pal dont disregard it
Wanna be slick chicks why you act so retarded
All you pseudotough guys end up dearly departed
As a young juvenile I started learnin from some older dudes
From the pimps to stickup men
And back then you had to know the rules
The peer pressure it can get ya knocked and lockedup
Or laid the fuck out upon a stretcher
This world is full of thugs hustlers big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause its my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
Peep the melody Brooklyn is deeper than a felony
Raps are full of violence who wanna challenge
Cause Kai rap whatever Kai choose to kick
A mans child from the Nile
Look at my style aint it raw
But too mature to be labeled wild
Aint nothin fake I create I dont tolerate static
My brainll cause drama like an automatic
So bang Im livin large like a king
The addict Im kickin pure mathematics
With the power to rule I give my knowledge as a tool
Plus Im invisible and I apply by usin my third Eye
Stimulation and high off the lie
And better yet Im a vet as I manifest
Wise words from my breath
And my wisdomll flow until my dyin day of death
With topics and subjects to every aspect
I bless the mic with intellect


Dont pay attention youll get stuck youre straight outta luck
Cause niggas been beamin you and they schemin for fast bucks
While chickenheads be awestruck by the thugs
With ill mugs who act bugged and dont give a fuck
Its systematic when flippin dough like acrobatics
Fiends and addicts gettin served by cream fanatics
Its savage Jakes more corrupt than we are
In the alley behind the bar
Bringin product from Panama and Bogota
Rulin the game superior
The crime biz the way it iz in America
Im killin rappers like Ive gone mad
My heat is righteous too many brothers have gone bad
At times I lay in my bed holdin my head smokin weed
Like a dred drinkin liquor for dough fact of myself
One question  Yo whats that huh 
Why adolescents gotta get murdered to learn a lesson
Stay on point with the joint in my Guess
Cause aint no tellin us when slugs might touch my chest
Feelin like Im blessed
Livin life by the day Monday through Sunday
Involved in gunplay its like a warzone
Thats why I think with the chrome and hold my own
Whenever walkin these streets alone
Its like I walk on top of high heat with no shoes on my feet
Watchin the flames get higher as the gun shots fire
This world is full of thugs hustlers big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause its my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
Im supposed to give up guns til my probation is done
Still Im waitin for son to bring the threeeight long one
They try to deny whats happenin to us
But nowadays it pays to be strapped ready to bust
Lets discuss what would you do
If youre confronted with jealousy you at least get a twentytwo
Plenty of us go through this syndrome
Its better to fight than die poor and alone
The mob guys be gettin loot for protection
They live and die for their profession
This world is full of thugs hustlers big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause its my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
Yeah we doin it low budget environment style
Its like walkin through the ghetto when the feelin is fine
Everybody know the time uh East New York Style uh
Yeah East New York Style
This world is full of thugs hustlers big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg cause its my job to
Separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate
