Watch the closing doors  cut and scratched 4x 
Right now Im gonna take you for a ride
Hold on tight so you dont slip or slide
This train is packed you dont get no seat yup
You gotta stand on your tired feet
Where we goin dont worry youll be there in a hurry
But you better watch you pockets cause the thieves work quickly
This is a New York transit thing
Dont wear too much gold and hide your diamond rings
And dont smile at anyone
Cause people out here they like to travel with handguns
You say you like this trip well are you sure
You better step lively and watch the
Watch the closing doors
Watch the closing doors  cut and scratched 3x 
Here we go as we ride through the underground
Coming from Uptown taking you downtown
Headed for Brooklyn Brooklyn the planet
Somebody stinks in here  I hope you can stand it
Homeless people everywhere holdin cups for change
And if you dont have none they may look at you strange
But this is all part of the scene
And yo check those kids cause theyre startin to scheme
See them lookin at you up and down
Oh yeah they can tell that youre somebody from out of town
Think they wont harm you Well they might
And that aint right but every day is like a fight
Watch the closing doors  cut and scratched 6x 
Ah ahh ahh ahh ahh
I cant quit I gotta do what I must
Cause I can take you on a ride with the lyrics I bust
Cause Im a master try to diss and Ill blast ya
Any wack MC that steps up is gettin plastered
Straight against the wall cause I dont stall
I give em drama and trauma til they all fall
And for those who dont know about the city life
Its where we take no pity and the kiddies are trife
Takin the train is just part of it
The next stop is Brooklyn youre comin to the heart of it
You never know what will occur
So just keep to yourself and watch the closing doors
Step lively  cut and scratched 3x  and uhh
Watch the closing doors  cut and scratched 2x 
Yeah

Takin you on a transit ride with my man Branford
