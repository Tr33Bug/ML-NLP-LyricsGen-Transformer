Its a struggle  its got a hold on me
The universal struggle  its got a hold
From Sofia Bulgaria to the New York interior
You see poverty and crime throughout these areas
And people with tattered clothes babies from battered homes
Pure hard times just theyre dying from that alone
From US shores to countries overseas
This universal struggles got a hold on me
Every citys got a ghetto the prisons are filled
The police and the military in position to kill
And I just wanna live my life with less pain
Seems like only a few moves left in this chess game
I guess change has gotta come soon
I cant live my life in fear waiting for doom
And actions of course speak louder than words
Its much harder when you standing in a crowd to be heard
So I walk alone and look forward to better days
Im not the same anymore I endured with better ways

Its a struggle  its got a hold on me
The universal struggle  its got a hold
From the hoods of Los Angeles to Toronto Canada
You can picture the struggle without no camera
The wealthy get wealthier cause thats the aim
The less fortunate get desperate and thats a shame
Whos to blame we complain nobody responds
So our only alternative is to try to move on
And show resilience in the face of danger
Determination and strength to replace the anger
Great people of the world rise up from despair
Historically our kind has always been here
To lead effectively when we need the recipe
For peace so we educate the seed respectfully
And this is how we beat the struggle
Staying tuned and keep out the reach of trouble
The bloodshed the oppression the violence the famine
We can trace it through various events we examine

Its a struggle  its got a hold on me
The universal struggle  its got a hold
