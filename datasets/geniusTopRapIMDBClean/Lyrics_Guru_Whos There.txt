These distraught thoughts of a single mother in a homeless shelter
About pain and heartache aint nothing you can tell her
The case worker says that she should find a job
But does this worker know what kind of jobs that there are
Degrading things like cleaning up peoples vomit
For a little bit of dough and plus your brain gets nothing from it
Im smarter than that this girl thinks to herself
Im worth more than that she thinks to herself
She pours a drink for herself while she stares out the window
This guy says he got work for her maybe she should go to him yo
The moneys good and plus hell dress her up nice
She left her babys daddy cuz he beat her up twice
She dont really like sex
But she hates welfare checks
And where theres money thats where she thinks theres respect
And whats this girls purpose Will she selfdestruct
When this sisters about to go down whos there to help her up
Qui prendra soin de moi quand dans mon coeur il fait trop froid
Quand dans la nuit je trane ma peine
Dans lindiffrence gnrale je taille ma route
Qui prendra soin de moi quand je serai au plus bas
Qui me dira lve la tte
Tu vaux mieux que a Whos there Whos there 
These distraught thoughts of a young man in a rooming house
This messed up life this poverty he could do without
But what options does he have when all hope is gone
A brother gotta eat plus all the Henny and all the smoke is gone
All it takes is one quick stick
Gotta fill his belly now which vic should he pick
He does his dirt all by his lonely forget his homies
He doesnt fell like splitting any loot them suckas be acting phony
So much potential but all gone to waste
Now he lurks in night with a loaded gun on his waist
Too late for this lost soul his lifes in a chokehold
Mentality is weak and doing crime is all he knows
Never caring who he hurts as long as hes taking money
Forget an education and legal ways of making money
And whats this kids purpose Will he selfdestruct
When a brothers about to go down whos there to help him up
Whos there for my people on the streets  Whos there Whos there 
Whos there for my people who got nothing to eat  Whos there Whos there 
They build more prisons and close down schools
Whos there to teach the children the golden rules Whos there Whos there 
Whos there for my people in the streets Whos there Whos there 
Whos there for my people who got nothing to eat Whos there Whos there 
They break our family neglect the elderly
Whos there to bring a cure Wheres the remedy Whos there Whos there
