Say look at this
Ive been cleaning out my nest and I found an old book of my poetry
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin to the nation
But thats not likely so heres my application
Pass it to the man at ATT
Cause when I was in school I got the AEE
But theres no SC for this youngsta
I didnt have no money so now I gotta punch the
Clock gotta slave and be half a man
But whitey says theres no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock Gs
But welcome to McDonalds May I take your order please
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cause my son doesnt take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers bottles and Similac
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill what the hell
Crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po
To a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin broke to be Republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Til I stopped fillin out my W2
Now senators are gettin high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry this is our only room to walk
Cause we dont want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than a Bush
Tell the politicians the hustlers
Live and let live  Yeah 
Tell the politicians the hustlers
Live and let live  Yeah
