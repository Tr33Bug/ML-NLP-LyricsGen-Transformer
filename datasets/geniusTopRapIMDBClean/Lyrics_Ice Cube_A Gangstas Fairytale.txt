Once upon a time in the black part of the city
Yo G yo G you better get out of here man 50
Door swings shut car peels out
Yo Ice Cube man
Whassup man
Why you
Whassup
Yo Ice Cube man why you always kickin the shit about the bitches and the niggas
Why dont you kick some shit about the kids man The fuckin kids
Word
Little boys and girls they all love me
Come sit on the lap of ICE
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punkass nigga I knew
Named Jack he wasnt that nimble wasnt that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two and he had the ho
At that type of shit hes a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr Bombay
Got a shot in the ass and he was on his way
To make some money why not
Down on Sesame Street the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front but in back marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out Little Bo Peep smoked out
Saw her and her friends sellin sheepskins
Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo my empty sheepskins
Yo baby whats up with that
Hickory dickory dock it was twelve oclock
Cinderella aint home must be givin up the cock
I dont doubt it she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors too
Red Riding Hood and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence Yo I dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the story should go
Yeah money thats it yeah money thats it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey rock that shit
Well you know the rest
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint drinkin some 8ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin for the wolf to kill
Theyre fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now theyre enemies cause hes a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
Were gonna fuck up the pigs and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence Yo I dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the stories should go
Ayo man was that dope enough for you
Yeah you aight you in the house
We outta here seeya
Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass
Some bedtime story huh
Its a nice place to visit but I wouldnt wanna live here
Ay good ol Mother Goose remember her I fucked her
