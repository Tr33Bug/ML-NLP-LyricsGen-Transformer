For the day one of my homies wanna squab

Americas Most Wanted 
Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me you know that Im liable
To bust a cap cause its all about survival of the fittest
Im a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people

Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue but they cant catch me yet
Cause Im slick and slippery

I cant dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad mad cause Im the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKas Most Wanted
Aiyo heres what the poster read

Thats all it said

Hear shots and sireens
When I fiend first they yo rings now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
Its the American way
Cause Im the GANGSTA
Ice Cube a motherfuckin klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept so
Who gets the worm
And if Im caught in a trap wou know Ima beat the wack
With a payoff cop gotta lay off

So get the Kryptonite cause Im a rip tonight
Cause Im scarin ya wanted by America
Aiyo Cube man they on your ass 
Word but who the fuck is Herb
Its time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer didnt crack no smile
Take me to your house pal
Got to the house my pockets got fat see
Crack the safe got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later Im at the PAD
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin in the den yo it couldnt be
What up G  Saw my face on TV
Damn  oh shit  I didnt know I lucked out
Struck out I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol bitch down the street mustve turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didnt pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now Im in the pen with the soaponarope
I said it before and Ill still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted
AmeriKKKas Most Wanted uh  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the uh Lench Mob Uh also in the group they have JDee Chill TBone YoYo Del KDee
Sounds like a black thing
