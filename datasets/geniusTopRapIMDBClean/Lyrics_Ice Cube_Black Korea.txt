Every time I wanna go get a fuckin brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin every brother in the worlds out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I dont pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store but bitch I got a job
Look you little Chinese motherfucker
I aint tryin to steal none of this shit
Leave me alone  Mother fuck you yo yo check it out 
So dont follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey assll be a target
Of a nationwide boycott
Juice with the people thats what the boy got
So pay respect to the Black fist
Or well burn your store right down to a crisp
And then well see ya
Cause you cant turn the ghetto into Black Korea
Mother fuck you
