At these up late times hardcore funkateers before the bop gun

Cause Bertha Butt did her fuckin boogie with her crew
But Id rather fuck you boo
And make you say humdrum tweedee dum
Humdrum dont succumb when Im done buckin shit
One nation under a groove gettin down for the fuck of it
Tear the roof of this motherfucker like we did last night son
And hit you with the bop gun
Heres my chance to dance my way

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There aint nothin wrong so hit the bong
Waitin on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin for the theme from the Black Hole
Now Ill big bang you with my black pole
Flashlight red light we dont like cops on the bike
Just made bail tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail

Ready or not here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in 
One nation under a groove
