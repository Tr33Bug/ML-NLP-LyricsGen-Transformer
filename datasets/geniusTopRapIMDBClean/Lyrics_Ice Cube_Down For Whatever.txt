Damn Im broke
My feet hurt
Inside the mind of a car jacker 
And that bitch is slipping
It makes me wanna creep
It makes me wanna creep
Damn Im such a G its pathetic
Here comes the bigheaded
Nigga thats dipping
Sipping on Courvoisier
Goddamn I must have to floss today
Now pimping aint easy but its necessary
So Im chasing bitches like Tom chased Jerry
Ill put the pedal to the floor
In my twotone Ford Explorer
You know how its done
Sounds bumping
Aint that something
Jumped on the 110
Shes flying in the Blazer
Like go Speed Racer
But I aint gonna chase her
Like Racer X
But I wont flex
Til its time to have sex
So when you wanna get together
Cause you know a nigga like me
Is down for whatever
And Im down for whatever
When I was little I didnt wanna be like Mike
I wanted to be like Ike cause
Papa Was A Rollin Stone in the sixties
And he liked green like Bill Bixby
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
Pockets never skinny
Played Lets Get It On in the living room
And when he got drunk youd better give him room
Cause hell turn the party out saying
This is MY muthafuckin house
And yall gots to go through the door
And if you cant find the door
Hell help you with the fourfour
Talking much shit on the grass
And straight down to blast
Im still in my PJs
Hes in a turtleneck sweater
And we down for whatever
And Im down
Solid Pro is down for whatever
The Don Jagwarr is down for whatever
And it dont seem to stop
I dont talk a lot of shit
But when its time to get busy with these hoes lets go
Cause Id rather see a skinhead dead
Then my niggas wearing blue or red
Cause I got the gift
To hit these hoes swift
And Im smelling like a fifth of something
Yeah thats right
Im standing in the store
Koreans act so nice
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells
Donut
And you know what
Im Cool Like Dat like Digable Planets
But dont take a nigga for granted
Cause whether its a verdict or the LA four
You just dont know
That this rappingass nigga will change with the weather
And be down for whatever


And Im down
Creep
And Im down for whatever
Ice Cube  Dvoidofpop
And I will never dance for you trickass niggas
It makes me wanna creep
It makes me wanna creep
