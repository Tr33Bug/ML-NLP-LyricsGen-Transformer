This aint no white boys rehabilitation
This is crazier than a boat full of Haitians
This is inflation mixed with degradation
This aint no dead rappers reincarnation
I heard it was a New West Coast I aint worried

I got more bars than the penitentiary
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary
Young bucks try to step up to the harim
Looking for some pussy Im an old buck I dare them
