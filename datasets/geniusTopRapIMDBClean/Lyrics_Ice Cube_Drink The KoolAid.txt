From the Holy FatherThe Rock of Gibraltar
Step up to the altar Step up to the slaughter
Get circumsize son and turned into a daughter
Niggas know they oughta drink the fucking KoolAid
Industry laid out authorities are too late
MCs passed the due date Niggas They do hate
You are Bobby Boucher Im the Mane like Gucci

I aint the Doctor This aint the patient
This aint that nigga always on vacation
This aint no white boys rehabilitation
This is crazier than a boat full of Haitians
This is inflation mixed with degradation
This aint no dead rappers reincarnation
I heard it was a New West Coast I aint worried
I murder more stars than Conrad Murray
I got more bars than the penitentiary
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary
Young bucks try to step up to the harim
Looking for some pussy Im an old buck I dare them
