Endangered Species  Tales from the Darkside  Lyrics
At the bottom of our news tonight theres been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth Yes young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest and the newest creatures added to the endangered species list As of now no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks When asked why a top law official adds Because they make good game
A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown 
Peace Hahaha dont make me laugh
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin succotash
Livin large tellin me to get out the gang
Im a nigga gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say Peace and the gunshots will cease
Every cop killing goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old theyd probably be a friend of me
Since Im young they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve protect and break a niggas neck
Cuz Im the one with the trunk of funk
And Fuck tha Police in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz theres more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color dont know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside
All of us are endangered damn
A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown 
A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown 
You wanna free Africa Ill stare at ya
Cuz we aint got it too good in America
I cant fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over keys
Of cocaine it was plain and simple
The 9mm went  buck  to the temple
Buck buck buck  was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck thinkin about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
Its gettin critical  I stole a 50
I let it go  drive real slow
I yelled out Ice Cube sucka
The shotgun kicked and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawedoff bodies are hauled off
Its a shame that niggas die young
But to the light side it dont matter none
Itll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside


Standing in the middle of war the minute we flex
When we die we wont make Jet
Ebony cant see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want cause Im comin from the corner
Same applies to a PhD
Whos black  dont wanna roll  sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin
Who the fuck are they foolin
Nobody knows but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
Standin on the verge  of them gettin brown
Thats a fact got a fear of the bozack
Run run run their ass off they can not hide
Yeah Cube they cant fuck with the darkside
