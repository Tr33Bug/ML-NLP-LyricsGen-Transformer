You know it aint no stoppin all the dogs Im droppin
Its Friday night so everything is poppin
I gots ten to spend on the Hen
So let the games begin
Yakety yak dont talk back or its on
Callin up Earl on the car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court
Rollin through the hood in his super sport bumping Too hort
Eighteens got the rear view mirrors vibratin
And deepdish Daytons
You know how we do it
Aint nothing to it but the floss
Overcrowding HarrisonRoss
Cause if you fuck with ours
We leave scars
Out of Gride cars
Livin like stars
Might hit the highway
On the Vegas run fool cause its Friday
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Standing outside on a Friday living on the edge
Cause we all got them hard heads
Its seems like we all are waitin
For a driveby playing tag with Satan
But we chillin yeah we ready and willin
Ya hear about the latest westside killing
Forty sippin set trippin fo dippin
Pistol grippin neva slippin
BGs trying to hang out
But OGs sayin Take your little ass in the house
My big homie just got out
Used to be down now hes just cracked out
Hes bout hard as Darth Vader
In his sweatshirt khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just seen him in the driveway
Getting beat like a smoker a fool cause its Friday


Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Fool
Why must I be like that and chase the cat
Or settle for a hoodrat
Dookie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin in and out of town with half a chicken in her cock
And I love her cause she down
To fuck around with the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up make a nigga down to ride
Smoking indo playing that Super Nintendo
Hear a rataTatTat on my window
Gave her ass that pelvic thrust
Dont trust the rubber cause its bound to bust
In the oven in the nappy
I had on two so I was happy
Cause that HIVll make your dick hang sideways
And that aint cool fool cause its Friday
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you dont care
Throw the West side in the air
Throw the East side in the air
Throw the South side in the air
Throw the North side in the air
Oh yeah
