Prior to gangsta rap music the world was a peaceful place And then all of that changed violence rape murder arson theft war These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music But wasnt Compton dangerous before gangsta rap 
Wrong Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits When gangsta rap came along they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects
Maestro  Blame me
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
Its RAW RAW
You lookin at the grand wizard
Warlord vocal chord so vicious
And I dont have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it aint about chivalry
Its about dope lyrics and delivery
Its about my persona
Aint nothin like a man that can do what he wanna
Aint nothin like a man that you knew on the corner
See em come up and fuck up the owner
See em throw up Westside California
Nigga Im hot as Phoenix Arizona
Im Utah I got multiple bitches
Its a new law keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga dont spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize Im a captain and you a lieutenant
I can say what I want to say
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
Im raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle just to feed all my people
Lyrically Im so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Yall spit saliva and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Dont get near this ho if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta and why should I change that
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin to change rap
But aint you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back
Im tryin to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me dont say that
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971
So if I act like a pimp
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappyheaded ho
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back
Use your brain not a gat its a party not a jack
Dont be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And dont be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I aint gotta be fake cause he is my homie
If I sell a little crack
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flowflow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
Its RAW RAW
Oh yeah and another thing
For all yall niggas that dont do gangsta rap
Dont get on TV talkin about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times out of 10
You dont know the fuck you talkin about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine
