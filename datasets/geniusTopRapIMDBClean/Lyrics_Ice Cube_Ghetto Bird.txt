Why oh why must you swoop through the hood like everybody from the hood Is up to no good
You think all the girls around here are trickin
Up there lookin like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I aint got shit but the pad and pencil
I cant wait till I hear you say
Im going down mayday mayday Im gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Yall rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force but we dont want ya
Standin on my roof with the rocket launcher
So fly like an eagle
But dont follow us wherever we go
The shit that Im saying make sure its heard
Motherfuck you and your punkass ghetto bird
Run run run from the ghetto bird
Run run run from the ghetto bird
Now my homeys here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo next
Now the fo I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didnt see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
Calling all cars I think weve got em
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central Compton and Watts
Long Beach bust a U here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on Ds I look suspicious
You know that Im running
Shit I hear it humming
Fuck I see it coming
Is it a bird Yup
Is it a plane No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla had to ditch the Impala
Lets see if they would folla
Me hit a fence hit a fence and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
Cause Im getting chased by the ghetto bird
Just put his hat ehrrr he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On Errr hes acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit going 115
Miles an hour with the police chasing him Ehm theyre not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him no matter what the eh
Ehrr they hate they hate a bigmouth even worse
Officer Birds on his way and I dont wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the BM
See I didnt want to gank you
But dont make me bank you thank you
Tried to get to the hood and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito Ghetto Eagle
Saying Fuck where did he go
I bust me a left on Ruthelen Park
The 735 and Im bailin
Went to my homegirls house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the fo on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I closed the blinds cause I didnt wanna catch a case
All that night I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two AM I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird
Which way is he going now
Ok nownow heshes actually southboundon a service street
And uhGee whiz uh Im gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service street he suddelny turned off on Uh the sherriffs
Arearewell I know thatSherriffs ground units got thrown off
