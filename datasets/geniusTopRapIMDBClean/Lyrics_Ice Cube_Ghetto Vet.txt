Hey 
Hey Chop
Hey 
These haters tried to blow me up man
Who is this 
The Don Mega nigga who you think
Ey homie what happened 
My whole life flashed before my eyes man
Life
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at Ill clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause Im down for my set
Im a vet smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Dont give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And bustaass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little  what 
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I dont give a shit
Fool Im a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
Its raining bullets and Im still there
Im still there
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the pedals the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said are you from the Westside is it so
I said hell yeah and who want to know
Me
In slow mo 44 slugs face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead the pain starts to spread
Now I cant feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter ICU
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I cant move my legs he said dont try to
Now this aint the end my friend but youll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick dont work it dont even hurt
Now whod ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
Abe pissing through a tube
Fool Im a vet


Fool Im a vet you can bet
I can dance underwater and not get wet  check it 
Its raining bullets and Im still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Fuck a VA they need GA
Gang Hospital for a cripple
Now Im drinking Ripple
Same corner same hood Im still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes Im fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I wont get searched by the LAPD
Im sittin in a doorway deucefive
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I dont got bows but my arms about a onesix
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I cant deal
Got to beg the BGs to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now Im on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldnt make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2yearold
You cant get a sip from the brew I hold
Its the only friend to a stranger
AKA handicapped gangbanger
Theres a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool Im a Vet
Fool Im a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
Its raining bullets and Im still there
Im still there
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets
For every nigga that done took one for the hood
