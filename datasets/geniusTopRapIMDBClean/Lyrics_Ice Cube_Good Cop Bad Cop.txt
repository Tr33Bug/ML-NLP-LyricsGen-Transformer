Turn me loose
Break em off some
Yeah
Good cop good cop rollin with that bad cop
Whatcha doin boy Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots they fly through that drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop clean cop fuckin with that dirty cop
Dont act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop clean cop rollin with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind Patty Hearst
Bust a verse thatll make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast warlord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they aint actin right
Good cop good cop fillin out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course
Black police showin out for the white cop
White police showin out for the black cop
Black police showin out for the white cop
White police showin out for the black cop
Lazy cop fuckin with that crazy cop
Always bragging bout the new case he got
Doordie cop with that suicide cop
Tellthetruth cop with that youalie cop
Are you fuckin high cop Dont even try cop
Aint no mothafuckin drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin tickets to the skybox
Hold up nigga Im a rider
Yous a rollup yep the controller
Make me mad thats when I get swole up  Dont touch me 
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs knock off the rust
Throw my hands  Whats up  up you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive niggas off the porch  Cmon 
Black police showin out for the white cop
White police showin out for the black cop
Black police showin out for the white cop
White police showin out for the black cop


Good cop good cop where is your dignity
Wheres your empathy Where is your sympathy
Bad cop wheres your humanity
Good cop is that just a fantasy
Tell on that nigga snitch on that bitch
Truth be told mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the popo actin like Deebo
Already know Craigll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
Cause all they wanna do is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin place  Let me out 
The kings all hate the fuckin ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin case
Racist motherfucker
Black police showin out for the white cop
White police showin out for the black cop
