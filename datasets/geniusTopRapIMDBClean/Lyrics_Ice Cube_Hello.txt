I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get
The motherfuckin world is a ghetto
Full of magazines full clips and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
Im just lookin for a big yellow
In six inch stilettos
Dr Dre Hello perculatin keep em waitin
While you sittin here hatin yo bitch is hyperventilatin
Hopin that we penetratin you gets naythin
Cause I never been to Satan for hardcore administratin
Gangbang affiliatin MC Renll have you
Wildin off a zone and a whole half a gallon
Get to dialing  911 emergency
And you can tell em  Its my son hes hurtin me
And hes a felon  On parole for robbery
Aint no coppin a plea aint no stoppin a G
Im in the 6 you got to hop in the 3 company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers follow the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete Nigga Im a scholar
The incredible heterosexual credible
Beg a ho let it go dick aint edible
Nigga aint federal I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin up transcripts
