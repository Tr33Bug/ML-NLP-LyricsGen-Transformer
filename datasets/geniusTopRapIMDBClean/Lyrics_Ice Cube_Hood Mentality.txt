Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler
Black nigga draped in gold with a nine milla
Love money love jail love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggas smell keep coming back cant you tell
Love to see my mama cry love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got to hustle
I dont give a fuck how my life go
Now Im a slave man to this caveman without Geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he aint never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunning niggas down cause they dont got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes
First I was blood thirsty Mister Mister Controversy
Now I wanna beg for mercy should have took my ass to Berkeley
