And now the wonderous world of
Hey come to Los Angeles
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement
Hey Bone hey nigga where you at though
Hello my name is Elaine
And Ill be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles
How to survive in South Central  what you do 
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No you cant find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look at a rap crook
Rule number one get yourself a gun
A nine in your assll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
Cause jackers  yo  they love to start shit
Now if youre white you can trust the police
But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And dont get smart
Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central yeah thats how you survive
Hi this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles
Or has somebody taken your things
Have you witnessed a driveby
Okay make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape over and over again
This is Los Angeles this is Los Angeles
Rule number two dont trust nobody
Especially a bitch with a hookers body
Cause it aint nuttin but a trap
And femalesll get you jacked and kidnapped
Youll wind up dead
Just to be safe dont wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either LA Compton or Watts
Pissed off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sightseeing
And if youre nuttin but a mark
Make sure that youre in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch aint a Section 8
Cause if so thats a monkeywrench ho
And you wont survive in South Central
Now you realize its not all that its cracked up to be
You realize that its fucked up
It aint nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches
Id advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on punk motherfucker
And youll get your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill Sir Jinx
Aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers dont know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers whats happenin
Tell these motherfuckers dont fuck around in South Central
God dammit
Rule number three dont get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything thats thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
Cause South Central LA is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin kis
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And theyll smother a out of town motherfucker
So dont take your life for granted
Cause its the craziest place on the planet
In LA heroes dont fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybodys doin a little dirt
And its the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter the concrete Vietnam
You say the strong survive
Shit the strong even die in South Central
Yeah you bitches you think I forgot about your ass you trampass hoes
You better watch out
And for you so called ballerass niggas you know what time it is
South Central aint no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit
Youll sho get got just like that
This aint no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shoutout to EDog the engineer
Puttin his two cents in
This is Los Angeles
