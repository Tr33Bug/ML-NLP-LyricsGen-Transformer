It Was a Good Day  Remix  Lyrics
Hahahah
Thats right
Smooth hah
Yeah
Hahahahah
Just waking up in the mornin gotta thank God
I dont know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dogs no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on but didnt pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do
Thinkin Will I live another twentyfo
I gotta go cause I got me a droptop
And if I hit the switch I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can do it all night
Called up the homies and Im askin yall
Which park are yall playin basketball
Get me on the court and Im trouble
Last week messed around and got a triple double
Freakin brothers everyway like MJ
I cant believe today was a good day
Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didnt even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin didnt even look in a brothers direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to hort Dogs house they was watchin Yo MTV Raps
Whats the haps on the craps
Shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
Roll em in a circle of homies and watch me break em
With the seven seveneleven seveneleven
Seven even back do Little Joe
Picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and Im yellin Domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day
Hahah
Hahah
Left my homies house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna do since the twelve grade
Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my Jimmy runs deep so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the threewheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter lookin for the murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cubes a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didnt even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day
