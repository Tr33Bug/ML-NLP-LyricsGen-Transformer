This is the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angeles
On destination to St Louis thank you
Damn G the spots gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot
Police looking at niggas through a microscope
In LA everybody and they mama sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit
Catch a flight to St Louis
Thats cool cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the threeeighty
Cause where we stayin niggas look shady
But they cant fade South Central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Peepin out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a U Bone and lets clear these niggas out
Ayy ayy man wassup nigga
Yo well this Lench Mob nigga
Now clearin em out meant casualties
Still had the LA mentality
Bust a cap and outta there in a hurry
Wouldnt you know A driveby in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took they corner next day set up shop
And its better than slangin in the Valley
Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali
Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble
Cause them markass niggas dont want trouble
And we aint on edge when we do work
Police dont recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Gettin bitches and they cant stand a
1991 Tony Montana
Now the shits like a war
Of gang violence where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin up dust
And some of them are even lookin up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss
Givin up much love
Dyin for a street that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers wanna stand strong
So you know the phrase once again its on
At the top of the news tonight gangs from South Central Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings
Have migrated into East St Louis leaving three dead and two others injured
No arrests have been made
Police say this is a nationwide trend
With similar incidents occurring in Texas Michigan and Oklahoma
Boom my homie got shot hes a goner black
St Louis niggas want they corner back
Shootin in snowy weather
Its illegal business niggas still cant stick together
Fuckin police got the 411
That LA aint all surf and sun
But we aint thinkin bout the boys
Feudin like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shits gettin tricky
Cause now they lookin for the colors and the Dickies
Damn the spots gettin hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle
But the NARCs raid about six in the mornin
Try to catch a nigga when hes yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryna give me fiftyseven years
Facell be full of those tattooed tears
Its the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender aint givin a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and the Bloods by hand G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride dont like no side
And its a riot if any one of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young mans summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin years that Im facin
Ima end it like this cause you know whats up
My life is fucked
Come on G
Police eat a dick straight up
Look here you lil goddamn nigga youre not gafflin nobody
You fuckin understand me  Kick his ass put him down 
Thats right get down on the goddamn ground now
Fuckin move now  Let me take a shot at him let me take a shot him 
Were gonna do you like King
What goddamn King
Rodney King Martin Luther King and all the goddamn Kings from Africa
Look out motherfucker
