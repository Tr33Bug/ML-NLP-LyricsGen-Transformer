Damn
Forgot to do somethin let me see uh
Oh yeah it aint over motherfuckers
The motherfuckin saga continues
Yall motherfuckers ready for NWA Well get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch so if youre poor
It was once said by a man who couldnt quit dope
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now since he stepped the fuck off
Heres what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube
Heres what they think about you
Cube was suckin so much New York dick
Heres what they think about you
Real niggas Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Heres what they think about you
Why yall let his punk ass in the group
Heres what they think about you
When they was in London they wasnt no good without fuckin Ice Cube
Heres what they think about you
When I bought the tape all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin money back
Heres what they think about you
I smell
Heres what they think about you
NWA aint shit without Ice Cube
Heres what they think about you
Heres what they think about you
Cube was suckin so much New York dick
Heres what they think about you
Real niggas Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Heres what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube
Heres what they think about you
Why yall let his punk ass in the group
Heres what they think about you
I smell
When I bought the tape all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin money back
Heres what they think about you
NWA aint shit without Ice Cube
Fuck all yall
Goddamn Im glad yall set it off
Used to be hard now youre just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michelle
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming thats why I went solo
And kept on stompin
While yall motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now Im making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes Who you foolin
Yall niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boys on your team so youre losing
Ayy yo Dre stick to producing
Calling me Arnold but you been a dick
EazyE saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But Im a man and aint nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkkas Most
You could yell all day but you dont come close
Cause you know Im the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles but you still got one to go
With the LENCH MOB
And yall disgrace the CPT
Cause youre getting fucked out your green
By a white boy with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Damn it feels good to see people on it
The bigger the cap the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punkass villain
Youre getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Rens shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho so
I couldnt stop you from getting ganked
Now lets play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube it wasnt worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair Nah cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gangbanged by your manager fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and highheels
So dont believe what Ren say
Cause hes going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you Toby
Used to be my homie now you act like you dont know me
Its a case of divide and conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton but you moved to Riverside
So dont front MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It aint my fault one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done without Va Va Va Va Vaseline
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again Ill be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch fucking your homeboys you little maggot
EazyE turned faggot
With your manager fella
Fucking MC Ren Dr Dre and Yella
But if they were smart as me
EazyE would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light em up burn em up flame on
Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga what you thinking bout
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you cant be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget whos a punk too
Tryin to fuck me but Id rather fuck you
Eric Wright
Punk always into something gettin fucked at night
By Mister Shitpacker
