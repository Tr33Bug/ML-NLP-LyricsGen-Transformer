Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Yall thought I was soft as cotton
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messed around and forgot I was rotten
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
You know my resume
You tell em Im on my way
But nobody  You tell em Im on my way 
Ah nobody wants to die
I keep my mind on my money I keep my hand on my gunny
Dont get to playin with sonny unless you Playboy Bunny
Ill put four in your tummy tap two in your brain
See the man aint playing if you think its a game
Haters whisper my name suckers want what I slang
Arrogant and Im vain DA want me to hang
But let me explain like Abel and Cain
That the black Grim Reaper is not my brothers keeper
Revenge revenge a killers on a binge of revenge
It depends if I can live with my sins
Lose family and friends  lost em all 
Now you got to lose life and limb spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim homey jokes aint allowed
And you boy aint scared to move the crowd with something loud
If you doubt what Im about go ahead an run your mouth
Im the last thing you see when your time is running out trick
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Ill send you fast boy with a blast boy  first class boy 
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin with the wrong one send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven  I aint the one son 
Pop you like a pro now you good to go  yeah 
But nobody  Nobody nobody nobody nobody 
Ah nobody wants to die


You forgot where I come from you forgot what I do
You forgot what you was sayin cuz Im blockin your view
Now I got you on cue you about to turn blue
Get around me now you actin like my little nephew
Boy what you wan do You aint gon do ish
But go take a ish is bout as funky as it get
Now Ima have to admit that I was prolly too nice
But take my advice or Ill take your life
Now if you still wanna slice lets start with the fingers
Lets move to the toes and end with the penis
See men are from Mars now you from Venus
How dumb you got to be tryin to think with the genius
Its the big payback you cant clown James Brown
See a brother been down ever since Jamestown
You either swim or youre drowned you either gagged or youre bound
Now you cant make a sound boy look at you now
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Ill send you fast boy with a blast boy  first class boy 
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin with the wrong one send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven  I aint the one Crip 
Pop you like a pro now you good to go  Go on 
But nobody  Nobody na 
Ah nobody wants to die
