Once upon a time in the projects yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door Who is it
Its Ice Cube come to pay a little visit to ya
And whats up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said Fuck em cause they get sparked a lot
I sat on the couch but it wasnt stable
And then I put my Nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in hes into gangbangin
Cause he walked up and said What set you claimin
I dont bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times
I dont like to feel that Im put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
Im thinkin to myself wont this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said Please excuse my house and all that
I said Yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin at a fucked up black and white
Her moms bitchin cause the county check wasnt right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids
They was runnin and yellin and playin and cussin and tellin
And look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her moms got the twelve gauge Mossberg
The nigga said Yo whats for sale  Yo whats for sale man 
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
She made the drop and got the twenty dollars
From a smokedout fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said Bitch I didnt know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly
Stop the police dont move
Freeze Ill kill ya
The cop busted in and had a Mac10 pointed at my dome
And I said to myself Once again its on
He threw me on the carpet and wasnt cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up wrap me up rough me up
They couldnt do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer youre making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldnt hear my case
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge
His reply Tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasnt sayin nothin
I said Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon
Now I beat the rap but that aint the point
I had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Dont fuck with a bitch from the projects
