Thats that gangsta shit
Check the original yall niggas digital
The pyroclastic flow this insane
Motherfuckers love me
Youngass niggas they wanna thug for me
Wish I was the Godfather sell drugs for me
But all they can do is tap cuz for me
Look homie you can be my cronie
If you figure how to get a check out of Sony
Oh Lord  Oh Lord thought I was preaching to the choir
When Im in this pulpit I might catch some fire
Glass full of gas do you got a lighter
Hand full of ass why should I retire
The shit I spit might inspire the messiah
To throw these lives in a lake full of fire
Aint nothing flier than my fuckin rims and my tires
And a word to the wise you better fuckin recognize
That I been on the block since bitches did the wop
Since Floyd and Damien kept rocks in they socks nigga
Taught 2Pac how to keep it gangsta
I showed Biggie Smalls how to release his anger
Who came before me Melle Mel IceT
King T KRS and the homie Chuck D
PE DMC nigga know your history
If Cube aint top three then yous a bitch to me
Ice Cube the name will live in infamy
Ask the young nigga that invented EazyE
West Coast bitch yeah thats all me
With Too hort and the DRE
We made it too hard check our family tree
See you try to make a Snapple out of all them bad apples
Nigga no
Leave you baffled and gaffled
And running through your house like its a motherfuckin raffle
Im a asshole with Tabasco you the last ho I would ask for
If I had to leave Morehouse and walk into a ho house
The drink that I pour out the weed that I blow out
Its all for my nigga Big Herc when I show out
Picture this in a frame get tore out
When I wanna go out red carpets get rolled out
Theres a lot of yous  A lot  theres only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
Theres a lot of yous  A lot  theres only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
Original original Im the prototype
Original original he the copy right
Original original Im the prototype
Original original he the copy right
So what you from the gutter
We all had to struggle if you got a Black mother
We all had to scrap with our uncles and our brothers
Bedroom window no curtains used covers
Motherfuckers always claim to be the hardest
But these motherfuckers never claim to be the smartest
Im a artist thatll paint your rigor mortis
You silly rabbit nigga here come the tortoise
Fast is smooth and smooth is slow
And thats how you get it twenty years in a row
Advance how you get twenty years in a hole
Pretend that your ass aint got no soul
Grab that coldass white man steel
Cap pills run like an oil spill
Big drills found him in the landfill
You got thirty years but you my man still
Fuck them tears Tony Montana
Caught you in Montana extradited to Atlanta
This aint the banana nigga this is Alabama
Nail in your coffin when the judge rock the hammer nigga
Theres a lot of yous  A lot  theres only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
Theres a lot of yous  A lot  theres only one of me
They are not confused by the wannabe
