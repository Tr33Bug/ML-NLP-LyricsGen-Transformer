I think they spotted me
They call me Sasquatch please check the watch
This is Bigfoot dont get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa King Kong gorilla
Michael Joe Jackson used to call me Thriller
All my enemies swear Im Attila
Vietnam vet burn down your villa
Captain Crunch scream serial killer
Out in OTown Im a fucking pirate
Think Im Rodney King We can start a riot
To a fat bitch Im a fucking diet
You in solitary Im piece and quiet
This a nightmare on Elm Street
Youre just a runaway where the pimps be
Youse a thirsty man Im so empty
At your funeral no sympathy
They call me Sasquatch please check the watch
Please check the time Im like turpentine
And its burping time you exhausted I know
Cause Im overtime and Im over the line
Come over to mine I already left
You wanting a rhyme bitch Im So So Def
You ready to shine Im already blind you already lyin
A nigga aint buyin what you selling always open 711
When I blow niggas know here come tsunami
You got a bucket list my list
You that drowning kid at the pool party
Im the carnivore over your body
Dont make me dont make me put this foot up your ass
Dont do it 
Dont make me dont make me put this foot up your ass
Dont 
Dont make me dont make me put this foot up your ass
What you do Bring it down and bring me my cash
Youse a fucking prick but Im Moby Dick
Im Darth Vader you Obi Wan Kenobi bitch
Hes Jim Kelly yall Im Terry Bradshaw
He is baby ass Im like diaper rash
Im like stinking trash Im like party crash
Like getting caught with hash
Im like your stolen cash
I like you feeling bad they call me Schleprock
I like the whole country looking at the debt clock
Pyroclastic flow this is Pompeii
Whoever in the way turn you into clay
Call me out my name and thats a hurricane
Ill send the wind and the water and the pouring rain
I am boring mane I am snoring mane
Im the pain thats wearing off the Novacane
Im the weight you gained I make your titties hang
Im the crowded train that just hit the mane
