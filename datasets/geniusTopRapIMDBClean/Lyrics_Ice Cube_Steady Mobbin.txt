God damn
The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
And when dealin with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers thats known to break em off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent front and back glass got tint
Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools cant hold us
Every chance we get we hittin up the rollers
Comin up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin bean pies
Or the bootleg tshirt of the month
With U Cant Touch This on the front
Im out to get rich
Cause life aint nothin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didnt know Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
Im out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause Im ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch cause Im steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood


Bustin caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause Im gettin major
Fuck PacTel move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Dont drink 8Ball cause St Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad tempers are flarin
Cause they got a few bitches starin
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss em
Out cause I just dont trust em
And if you tell on me Im bombin on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Since onetime so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
Cause Im rollin on rims
Eating soul food neckbones from MMs
Grubbin like a motherfucker
Greasyass lips now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin
When I hit a left on Ruthelen What up loc
Dont you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke Get in nigga
Ill take you to the pad soon
Went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bones house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob aint nothin but tramps
For hoes lickin nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I dont want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash
I said Yeah but I dont play sex
Without puttin on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night no longer steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
Get the radio get the radio
There goes the neighborhood
