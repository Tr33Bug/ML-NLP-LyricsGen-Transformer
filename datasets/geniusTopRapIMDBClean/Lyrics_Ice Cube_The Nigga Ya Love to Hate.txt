I heard paybacks a motherfucking nigga
Thats why Im sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk cause I aint him
You gotta deal with the ninedoubleM
The day is coming that youll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down its all about coming up
So what they do go and ban the AK
My shit wasnt registered any fucking way
So you better duck away run and hide out
When Im rolling real slow and the lights out
Cause Im about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a droptop Brougham
When Im shooting lets see who drop
The police the media and suckers that went pop
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put em overseas they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college
Because of that line I might be your cellmate
Thats from the nigga ya love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube 
Yeah haha Its the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube 
Ay yo baby your mother warned you about me 
Its the nigga you love to hate
Yo you aint doin nothin positive
Yo you aint doin nothin positive for the brothers what you gotta say for yourself 
You dont like how Im living Well fuck you 
Once again its on the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitchkiller cappeeler
Yo running through the line like Bo theres no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now who do ya love to hate
Cause I talk shit and down the eightball cause I dont fake
Youre begging I fall off
The crossover might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
Well gank in the pen well shank
Any Tom Dick and Hank and get the ass spanked
It aint about how right or wrong you live but how long you live
I aint with the bullshit
I meet mo bitches mo hoes
Dont wanna sleep so I keep popping NoDoz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if youre locked up I dedicate my stylin
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep make the old ladies say
Oh my god  brake its the nigga ya love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube 
Yeah come on fool its the nigga you love to hate
Fuck you Ice Cube 
Yeah what up punk Its the nigga you love to hate
A bitch is aohhhh
Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me did I like Arsenio
About as much as the Bicentennial
I dont give a fuck about dissing these fools
Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say what I portray and all that
And aint even seen the gat
I dont wanna see no dancing
Im sick of that shit  listen to the hit
Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to outdance each other
Ima tell TBone to pass the bottle
And dont give me that shit about role model
It aint wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start locing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga you love to hate
