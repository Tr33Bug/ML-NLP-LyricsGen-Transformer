Ayy
Yeah you motherfucker
You know who Im talking to
Yeah you that motherfucker that betrayed your homeboys and you aint shit
Yeah you about to get your motherfucking ghetto pass revoked motherfucker
Punkass mark bitchmade
Punkass trick in a basket
Caught up in the mix
Its the nigga you love to hate with a new song
So what really goes on
Nothing but a comeup but aint that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I cant move to the snow
Cause soon as yall get some dough
You wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavors good
Little kids jumping on me
But you you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
Nigga go home spraypainted on your house
Trying to be white or a Jew
But ask yourself who are they to be equal to
Get the hell out
Stop being an Uncle Tom you little sellout
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I aint saying no names
You know who you are you little punk be true to the game
Yeah motherfucker
Yeah you thought we forgot huh
Yeah get a little money and moved out the neighborhood and shit
But you still aint shit
When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasnt fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hiphop
Now look at yourself boy you done flipflopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Dont you know they aint down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On MTV but they dont care
Theyll have a new nigga next year
Youre out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks dont want you back
And you know whats worse
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop sellin out your race
And wipe that stupidass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now Ima be brief be true to the game


Yeah motherfucker I see you got your fancy cars and shit
But you know what You still aint shit
Thats right I caught you slipping
You know I couldve gat you yeah but I didnt even trip
A message to the Oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look G
Do you like what you see
But youre quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish you little guppy
Black man cant be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You dont associate with the Negroes
You wanna be just like Jack
But Jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off genius
I dont need you to correct my broken English
You know thats right
You aint white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you cant pass
So why you keep trying to pass
With your black ass
Mister Big
But in reality youre shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip Oreo and be true to the game
Uh yeah
Uh yeah
Haha
And Ice Cube practices what he preaches
He continues to live in South Central Los Angeles and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood
Be true to the game
