Yo where the fuck is that little boy at
Stanley bring your ass here god damnit  Man fuck you punk ass nigga 
But anyway man yo Bone man
When I get fourteen man I wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold things  Stanley 
Man fuck that shit man
You need to take your ass to school get you a motherfuckin job and shit
Man fuck that man fuck you man look here
When I get fourteen man I wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold with a threewheel motion
Chin wheel pull out  Ah shit  three finger ring fat ass link  Stanley  and a big booty go bitch to with it
Man fuck all that
Break em off something
Aha its really sad
Young brothers and sisters today have a lack of understanding on
What it really means to be Black
Could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct  Uh 
And the white man sittin there tickled pink  No shit 
Laughin at us on the avenue
Bustin caps at each other after havin brew
We cant enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous at each others wealth  Right right 
But comin ups just in me
But the Black community is full of envy  Oh shit 
Too much backstabbin
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood  Yup 
Build a store and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know us po niggas nappy hair and big lips  Thats right 
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out  Shit 
We aint nothin but porch monkeys to the average bigot redneck honky
You say comin up is a must
But before we can come up take a look at us
You dumb ass nigga
Break em off something
And all yall dopedealers
Youre as bad as the police cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin dope
But you aint built us a supermarket  So shit 
So when can spend our money with the Blacks
Too busy buyin gold and Cadillacs  Huh 
Thats what ya doin with the money that ya raisin
Exploitin us like the Caucasians did  Yup 
For 400 years I got 400 tears for 400 peers
Died last year from gangrelated crimes
Thats why I got gangrelated rhymes  Right 
But when I do a show to kick some facts
Us Blacks dont know how to act
Sometimes I believe the hype man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But dont point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon Hip Hop wont be so nice
No Ice Cube just Vanilla Ice  Man fuck that 
And youll sit and scream and cuss
But theres no one to blame but us
Yeah but why is it that one motherfucker can ruin it for twentytwo thousand motherfuckers
When they wanna come see a good jam you know what Im sayin
Ayy Cube tell em something shit you know how I feel
Break em off something
Us well always sing the blues
Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
Cause Ill beat you down like it aint nothin
Just like a beast
But Im the first nigga to holler out peace black man
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hogmogs and chitlins
Bet my money on the dice or  the horses
Jobless so Im a ho for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
With a picture of a blueeyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time Im still bustin up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And Im havin more babies than I really can afford
In jail cause I cant pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us but yall think its dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about
