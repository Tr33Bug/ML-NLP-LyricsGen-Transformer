They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

Im from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little aint a goddamn thang changed
Its the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit daytoday
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelicans Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But whos the animal that built this prison
Whos the animal that invented lowerlivin
The projects thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
Im putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Yall know what it is scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us


Its boys in the hood its toys in the hood
Yall wanna know why theres noise in the hood
Cause theres drugs in the hood thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
Cause when niggas get tribal
Its all about survival nobody liable
I got caught by FiveO
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now Im too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the DA before I got gaffled
Owned by CA State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me a oneway ticket out
Dont understand whats so hard to figure out
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
Damn I cant take the pressure
Pulled the 44 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Popo coming but Im scared to toss it
Yall know what happened last time I lost it
Cant tell you niggas what the fuckin boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what
Breaking these laws thats so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin them up
Some powder keg shit thats about to erupt
Aye yall Im about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand what the fuck
In the hood dont press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up word up
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
