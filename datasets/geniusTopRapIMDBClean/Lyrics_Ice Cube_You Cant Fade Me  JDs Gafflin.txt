Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
Whats the date and time it dont matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homies Impala
She said whats up yeah whats the deal
Check the hairdo of course it aint real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long Well about seven months
Oh how time flies when youre having fun
She said Yeah but the damage is done
Where you been On a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Whos the lucky man I dont have a clue
Then she said The lucky man is you I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said Yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said Damn are you sure its mine
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said That day no I wasnt whoring
Your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw cause then Id really get faded
Thats murder one cause it was premeditated
So what Ima do I dont have a clue
How many months left damn only two
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
No cigar G
Ay yo homey man Im getting faded
Its crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo ho I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and Im knowing
That Im a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ay yo you know what time it is
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah 
Nine months later shes ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
Its supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube cant be having that G
Im thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now Im in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and TBone wont let up they wont shut up
Im gettin fed up bitch
Cause I know youre tryin to break me
But if I find out your tryin to fake me
Im a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my nextdoor neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But lets check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live
After that I shouldve got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch its a switch
You cant fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you aint playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I dont fall for the okeydoke
And before I fall for the okeydoke I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ha ha yeah baby you cant fade me
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah 
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Nah unfadeable baby yo
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah
