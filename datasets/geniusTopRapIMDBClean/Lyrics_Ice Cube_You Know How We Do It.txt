Yeah yeah
Fool you know how we do it  Wohuhohohoh 
Westside
Comin from the Westside
Nothin but the Westside  Wohuhohohoh 
Aint nothin goin on but the bombass rap song
Hittin all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin six on artillery  Wohuhohohoh 
You dont want to see a G
Break yo ass like dishes
Busterass tricks sleep with the fishes
Runnin from Lennox up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes  Wohuhohohoh 
Like Dennis the Menace
But that aint poppin aint no stoppin
Fohoppin ass droppin Coupe DeVille
My troupe can kill  Wohuhohohoh  fool I got skills
So back on up fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and Im full off Henn
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool you know how we do it
Comin from the Westside
Comin from the Westside
Westside comin from the Westside
Wohuhohohoh 
Chillin with the homies smellin the bud
Doubleparked and Im talkin to Dub
About who got a plan who got a plot
Who got got  Wohuhohohoh 
And who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin out the window
Fool I got them bombass tapes
Da Lench Mob  Wohuhohohoh 
Planet of the Apes
Im down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb  Wohuhohohoh 
Just like George Clinton
SKP is down to catch a body
Put on Knee Deep well turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool  Wohuhohohoh  you know how we do it


Wohuhohohoh  You know how we do it
Wohuhohohoh 
Jack be nimble and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
Cause Im that fool from South Central
Youll think you stuck yourself  Wohuhohohoh 
With a number two pencil
Thats how I poke hot lead in yo ass
With Mo Bounce to the Ounce in the dash
Mash up Van Ness headed for the West
Everything is great  Wohuhohohoh 
Slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin
Dont drink and drive to keep the fo from crashin
Stashin a Glock and I thought you knew it
Wohuhohohoh  You know how we do it
Comin from the Westside Westside
Wohuhohohoh  Nothin but the Westside
Its hittin on the Westside
Fool  Wohuhohohoh  you know how we do it
Wohuhohohoh

Wohuhohohoh 
Wohuhohohoh
