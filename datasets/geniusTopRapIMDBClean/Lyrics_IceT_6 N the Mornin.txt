Six in the morning police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Didnt even get a chance to grab my oldschool tape
Mad with no music but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck my pistols close at hand
Im a selfmade monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hiphop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didnt know what the cops wanted didnt have time to ask
Word
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told em bout my morning cold bugged em out
Shot a little dice till my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies said we all werent shit
As we walked over to her ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didnt know what hit her didnt have time to ask
Word
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior
Solid gold the ride was raw
Bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Seanesean was the driver known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin off like a highschool bell
Looked in the mirror what did we see
Fucking blue lights LAPD
Pigs searched our car their day was made
Found an Uzi fortyfour and a hand grenade
Threw me in the county highpower block
No freaks to see no beats to rock
Didnt want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker shanked him in the eye
But just living in the County is a serious task
Nigga didnt know what happened didnt have time to ask
Word
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track
Told me Es rolling Villain BJs got the sack
Bruce is a giant Nat Cs clocking dough
BeBops a pimp my old freaks a ho
The batterrams rolling rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said Man you out early we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy he didnt waste time to ask
Word
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didnt want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew some punks got loud
Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit two punks died
All casualities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didnt know who they were no one had time to ask
Word
Swatteam leader yelled Hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my fortyfour
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the backdoor like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didnt even see us they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadnt done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops woulda shot us on sight they wouldnta took time to ask
Word
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real it was no LaDiDaDi
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing sixty one police car spun
And all I was thinking was murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew were gone into the night
Broke to my old ladys who drew me a bath
She didnt even know what happened didnt care didnt ask
Word
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission thats what she was
If there had been a crowd she wouldve got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
Then she backed off and teased me so I couldnt cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop while I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def she didnt waste time to ask
Word
Up the next morning feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my AMG
Hos catching whiplash trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when Im in my car
Was my homeboy Red some say hes insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said hes jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didnt know where we was going didnt care didnt ask
Word
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he woke up chilling in NYC
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devils nest the rest we passed
Backdoord the Palladium just for class
About 4 am we crashed the deuce
We never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shootout jumped off nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning we didnt wake up to ask
Word
