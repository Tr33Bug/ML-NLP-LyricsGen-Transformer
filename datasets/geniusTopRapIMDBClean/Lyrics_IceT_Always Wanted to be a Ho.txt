This goes out to all you ladies out there
A lot of you wont grow up to be lawyers or doctors
But you have a dream And I think you should follow your dream
When you was just a little girl you used to love nice things
Pretty party dresses candy and rings
You was your Mommas little angel Daddys little girl
They used to fix your hair up in pretty ribbons and curls
Your sex drive was much deeper than the rest of the girls
You used to freak your boyfriends take them round the world
As a teen you didnt like school that much
Your moms drank your daddy likes to cuddle and touch
Too much so you hit the street looking for love
Affection and devotion met none of the above
Met me in the club working your fake id
Looked me in the face like a slave set free
I said walk into my eyes baby come with me
I can show you things that you dream to see
Take you off the street get you something to eat
Something nice to wear and a place to sleep
My name is Ice Im the nicest guy youre ever gonna meet
Tell me what you want Ill make your life complete
She said  I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho 
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby and your dreams came true
The first thing were gonna do is buy yourself a new dress
Take some pictures put you in the LA Express
Teach you how to walk in some high heeled shoes
Let you strut your stuff by the House of Blues
Or farther down Sunset where the tricks all cruise
Are you my pimp
Oh dear God dont say that
Im your manager your boyfriend youre agent your mack
Now Im a do my hair baby Ill be right back
Because we gotta look good when we hits the track
Now your real name Shirl
Yeah we gotta change that
I think Ill call you Apple cause your ass is kinda fat
How old are you 16
Well thats just right
But youre 18 if anybody asks tonight
Im a teach you how to get this long paper right
Catch a trick suck his dick break his ass for life
Cause I love you thats all you really need to know
Im bout to miss my hair appointment girl I got to go


She said  I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho 
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby and your dreams came true
Now what if I meet a trick that got long cash
Thats when I call the crew with the black ski masks
But right now well only worry bout the basic stroll
Hooking up my Cadillac and upping my gold
A hundred for a full hit 50 for a hand
Throw in a blow job theyll fuck off grands
I may even put you where the real johns at
Some call the strip club I call the indoor track
They got lap dancers table dancers mad back rooms
And you can double up your profit if you take them home
I wanna be the best
Well this games the test
Gstring bikinis and silicone breasts
Suckas break themselves just to sniff your nest
And if you get tired I got crystal meth
I think Im in love
Baby doll its on
You were made for me baby since the day you were born
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby and your dreams came true
