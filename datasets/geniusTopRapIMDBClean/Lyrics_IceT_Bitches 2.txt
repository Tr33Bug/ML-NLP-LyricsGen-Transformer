I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car He could use mine too
But bust this
Out on the street
People say he was riffin
Callin me a sucker
Talkin bout how foul Im livin
Someone heard him
Poppin that shit last week
Frontin for some pussy
From some bigbutt freak
Sayin Im his worker
I was on his dick
Talkin that crazy old weak assed shit
And after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play
And when I stepped to him about it
He said Who snitched
Yo how did he go out
He went out like a bitch
So ladies
We aint just talkin bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too
You aint nothing but a Bitch Nigga
Some of you niggas are bitches too
I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl in five minutes hed lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
And vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
And watched his back
Thats the only way
To roll on the track
But yo
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
They snatchbared the trunk
Of his white Cornice
Took a look inside
And what did they see
Two keys and a gallon of PCP
Oh shit The thought crashed
Mitchs subliminal
Three strikes thats called
Habitual criminal
So instead of goin under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch
Yo how did he go out
He went out like a bitch
So ladies
We aint just talkin bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too
I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldnt act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin the cool part
He had the color
But was missin the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
And he still got his ass kicked
But now hes married
And he kicks his wifes ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesnt like Blacks
Claims hes upper class
Joined the police got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
And hes out to jack
Doggin young brothers
Cause they usually dont fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
And every night
Another head they crack
So now hes big man
But he really aint shit
Yo how did he go out
He went out like a bitch
So ladies
We aint just talkin bout you
Cause a lot of these pigs
Are bitches too
Out one night with my crew
And some new kid
I didnt know homeboy but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on some OG shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
All of a sudden
Niggas started trippin
Flippin the record started skippin
Wildin fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin up
Me and E hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch
Yo how did he go out
He went out like a bitch
So ladies
We aint just talkin bout you
Cause you scaryass niggas
Is bitches too
So if youre wonderin why we lookin at you funny its cause
some of you niggas are bitches 2 
You always tell a brother youre gonna loan him money but you dont cause
some of you niggas are bitches 2 
Yo Aladdin you know why they be frontin Imma tell you why
some of you niggas are bitches 2 
You always act like you can fight but when its a real fight you find out
some of you niggas are bitches 2 
Yo Imma do it Ice Imma do it Ice No you aint no you aint cause
