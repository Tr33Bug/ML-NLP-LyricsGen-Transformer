IceT after your tremendous success on your past album
Some have said you have sold out
Because of the use of rocknroll in your music
How do you reply to that
You see a lotta people dont realize that you know
RockNRoll is truly black music
It was created by Chuck Berry Little Richard
Even black people like that who started it off back in the day
You know and as far as Im concerned music is music
I dont look at it as Rock or RB all that kind of stuff
I just look at it as music you know
And anybody who said that Ive sold out they can basically suck my dick
Cause I really dont give a fuck about that shit you know
But uhh I do what I like I happen to like RockNRoll
And uhh I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know right now I got my own Rock band its got to jump off
Its really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh on some of the records Im like laying some vocals on it
And uhh I got a tape of it right here yo check it out
You know sometimes I sit at home you know and I watch TV
And I wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know The Cosby Show Ozzie and Harriet
You know where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see I live in South Central Los Angeles
And unfortunately SHIT AINT LIKE THAT
Its real fucked up
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and blue
What I gotta die before you realize
I was a brother with opened eyes
The worlds insane while you drink champagne
And Im living in black reign
You try to ban the AK
I got ten of them stashed
With a case of hand grenades
Tell us what to do  Fuck you
Tell us what to do  Fuck you
Tell us what to do  Fuck you
Tell us what to do  Fuck you


Youd know what to do
If your kid got killed on the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard
I hear it every night another gun fight
The tension mounts on with the Body Count
Yo Beatmaster V take these motherfuckers to South Central
Ha ha ha yeah fuck that
I hear it every night another gun fight
The tension mounts on with the Body Count
Last weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard
NO NO NO
Yo Ernie C take these motherfuckers home yeah
Yo were in the house Body Count fool 1991 motherfucker
I hear it every night another gun fight
The tension mounts on with the Body Count
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and you
What I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with opened eyes
The worlds insane while you drink champagne
And Im living in black reign
Dont you hear the guns
You stupid dumb dick sucking bum politicians
Tell us what to do  Fuck you
Tell us what to do  Fuck you
The tension mounts
