Yo Iz lets do this
I am a nightmare walkin psychopath talkin
King of my jungle just a gangster stalkin
Livin life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Vendettas of death back the colors I choose
Red or Blue Cuz or Blood it just dont matter
Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of LA will never die  just multiply
You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us man
Its like a war ya know what Im sayin
People dont even understand
They dont even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs its gonna take a lotta work
But people dont understand the size of this
This is no joke man this is real
You dont know me fool
You disown me cool
I dont need your assistance social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream reality is a knife
My colors my honor my colors my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me what have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mothers on crack
My sister cant work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin theyre understandin me
Give me a break what world do you live in
Death is my set guess my religion


Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I dont know why I do it man I just do it
I never had much of nothing man
Look at you man youve got everything going for yourself
And I aint got nothing man Ive got nothing
Im living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man look at me
My pants are saggin braided hair
Suckas stare but I dont care
My game aint knowledge my games fear
Ive no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You aint in my set you aint my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicides my favorite binge
Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do dont ever join a gang
You dont wanna be in it man
Youre just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail
I know if I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didnt have a chance
You know I wish I did
Ill just walk like a giant police defiant
Youll say to stop but Ill say that I cant
My gangs my family its all that I have
Im a star on the walls is my autograph
You dont like it so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terrors my show
Psychoanalyze tried diagnosin me why
It wasnt your brother that brutally died
But it was mine so let me define
My territory dont cross the line
Dont try to act crazy cause that shit dont faze me
If you ran like a punk it wouldnt amaze me
Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war wont end
Till all wars cease
See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But I dont wanna be down with this situation man
But Im in here if I had something better to do I think Id do it But right now Im just down here boy
Im trying to get money cause Im smart
Im gonna get paid while Im out here
Im gonna get that paper ya know what Im saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But Im not Im out here living day to day surviving
And Im willing to die for my colors
Yo please stop cause I want yall to live
This is IceT peace
