TS Yeah man we just sitting back chilling
Bunch of players listening to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doing his thing with my nigga IceT
Dont fake the funk
I IceT baby this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin like a brother done did somethin wrong
Cause he got his game tight
Dont hate the player hate the game
Dont hate the player hate the game
Niggas sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searching fortune and fame
Some come up some get done up except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar you got to go high risk
Sometimes I get illy cock back the ninemilli
I choose not to bust smack your punkass silly
Just bought a crib it cost twopointfive milli
Swimming pool in my livin room I guess Imma willy
I dont get high so I dont split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say Oh really
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straightlace pimpin I know you hoes feel me
I come through  make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go I blast make the whole cub echo
You dont really wannna test an LA vet though
Most of my crews on Death Row  the real
Quick with the trigger nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You whack you looking for a record deal
Bow down on second thought punk bitch kneel


Dont hate cause my games much tighter than yours
My girls finer than yours my jewels shine brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face
Then you act like you dont see me
You wanna be me you hate my motherfucking guts
Licking nuts  whats the deal Its a level playing field
My games against yours hustling wars
Roll the dice risk your motherfucking life
Bank rolls and low hoes anything goes
Ridin rolls in a week clap a nigga who speaks
Im suceedin in tryin to keep from bleedin in the lane
Crystal Meth FCC and crack cocaine
Got a nigga tryin to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view too but Ill shoot
Every bitch I meet is fucking up to something
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumping
Gat pumping theyll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game motherfucker dont hate me
Yo my name will sell better than rap like the Acropolis
Suckers might as well step back there aint no stoppin this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus and gators on my shopping list
Make a fist take your best shot bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy they said about the pig
Baldheaded hoes step back bitch go and cop a wig
When I do a show best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops Im still folding fat knots
Catch me on the weekend floating my yacht
Say Ice kick some game and Ill teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block
I dont know why a player wanna hate T
I didnt choose the game the game chose me
