Cruisin for a bruisin Im takin no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk got a nine in my lap
Im layin for a sprayin tonight theres no playin
The posses most strapped tonight the crews weighin
Dust is burnin the steering wheels turnin
Im out a week Im already earnin
Suckers crossed tonight its their loss
Payback time boy lifes the cost
Gauges out the window one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers aint bulletproof
Im rollin death tollin of course the cars stolen
But Im blind to whats wrong all I want is whats golden
A fool in a fight too dumb to know right
Fuckin blue light read em their rights
Drama  x4 
I copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that dont know about the rest
Copped another piece hit the dark streets
Rollin once again fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe a roof job pro 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleek he cased the joint a week
3 am on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines Fishes JVCs
Motorola Phones Sony Color TVs
Had the ride packed up til we heard Freeze
Fuckin blue lights read em their rights
Drama  x4 
4 in the morning lights in my face
Thats the time you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the twoway glass
Detects in effect cold doggin my ass
Whats your date of birth Whats your real name
I stuck to my alias I know the game
If they dont know who you are then they dont know what youve done
Youre just makin this harder on yourself son
I know this shit by heart Im too clever
Have you ever been arrested before Nope never
DA reject all over his face
You see no confession no case
Then my boy started illin talkin and tellin
Son of a bitch he was a snitch

Drama  x6 
Under I went I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet then the judge laughed
Now Im in the penzo chillin like a real pro
I cant move til the man says go
A puppet of the big game an institutional thing
I wouldnt be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
Youre just a number another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you greet
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you sees a priest
The lights dim your life ends
Drama
