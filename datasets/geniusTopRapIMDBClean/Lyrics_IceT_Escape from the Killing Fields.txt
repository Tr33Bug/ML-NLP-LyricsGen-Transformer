Here we go Im movin off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops ya cant be slow
Cause their towers are high they got the high gats
Check the perimeters good Read the maps
Its night they might not see us
Cause if they catch us out there theyll bleed us
Shoot us kill us dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move cause Im a renegade
I recognize when mind techniques are being played
Its a plot they use to keep down another
Here comes another brainwashed brother
Yo man it sounds like youre selling out to me cause Im from the ghetto I lived in the ghetto all my life
We aint supposed to leave here Were black Were supposed to be poor
Shut up Do you know how dumb you sound
That mentalitys  what keeps my people down
No one wants to live in an urban war
You live there cause your parents were poor
They live there because theirs were also
Get yourself together hit the gates bro
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Cause the fields are where you die
I escaped from the killing fields
I escaped from the killing fields
You try to keep us running and running faster
But I aint runnin from ya Im runnin at ya
And my posses thick about a mil strong
Too late to make up now cause its on
Im the one thats got ya in constant fear
Im the nigga ya shoulda killed last year
But you played yourself you let me gain wealth
Now I can change the way the cards are dealt
Ive schooled my homeboys made em all understand
The tricks and twists inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think to be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin battleground

We got the Puerto Ricans where we want em we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want em Well shit theyre all Black We gotta keep em together the same way we got those fuckin Indians
Therell never be any good schools in the hood
Therell never be any cops that are any good
The hospital is a great place to go to die
Real estates cheap let me tell ya why
The mans got a sure fire system
An economic prison
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Ya gotta get out Ya gotta get out Why
Cause the fields are where you die
I escaped from the killing fields
I escaped from the killing fields
I escaped from the killing fields
