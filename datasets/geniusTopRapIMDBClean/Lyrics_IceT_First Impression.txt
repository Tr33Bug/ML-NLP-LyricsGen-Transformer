Upon initial contact with IceTs music I had envisioned him to be an illmannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto
However after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle
But to make things more plain and simple to the layman I find IceT to be the dopest flyest OG pimp hustler gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today
To be honest Im totally and completely on his dick
