One two in the place to be Im MC Donald D
And in the house Nat the Cat the Syndicate Mobb boss
And standing after me IceT the OG Gangster
Syndicate is about to jump off on a buckwild freestyle
Ice drop some dope shit
Everybody step back from the mic cause I set it off
All playing the wall its time to sweat it off
Anybody with static awww please try
Ill do you like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I dont rap with girls in my LP
I dont beg for pussy I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now whos the mack
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you think you got a S in your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back your front I always hit dont bunt
Crazy posse when Im out on a duck hunt
Emcee IceT answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock them like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and thats right they oughta
Before my crew gets to their daughters
Ha ha ha yo Nat the Cat youre next baby
Yo why dont you get on this Mic
And jump off like suicider off the Brooklyn Bridge baby
Yeah youre a player kick it
Do you know me
Right thats why carry the mic
Im not flashing my American Express
Im playing my cards closed to my vest
My name that you say what Im vesting
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black panther resisting that situation
Executing with tact jumping exact
Ripping up slack on the tack
86 didnt mack turn tales and back up at stack the jack
Cause Im venerish Nat The Cat unloading like the million tons of TNT
Yes thats me you see you wanna be but cant MC
Cause on the real the science  the knowledge behind your capacity
The simplicity thats how I say
But I said it you know you wonder how did he say that anyway
To you its complex when I flex for flex flood
Stimulates the opposite sets and thats dope
Though why you cant cope
Im throwing you a rope Im about to draw you as you dont rock the boat
Or you be back inside the ocean this time it wont float
You be stuck on the bottom with other suckers I got them
Sporting to see me woof while Im banking the loot
Just off the end you travel around the world in a fly silk suit
My style is custom made suede and leather
Down to fly by in any weather
Donald D the smuggler goin for the juggler
Firing wild out here police sirens
Whats up Do you wanna die by
The Syndicate sniper tonight on a fly by
Swing while I came into the tune that grip ya
Flip ya trip ya rip ya I keep dipping ya
In and out back and forth up and down
Me be sleeping with the heat I cant fuck around
City sounds I proceed with caution
Teach you that BSCs another fortune
Im here to sink your brain Ill take the thought you think
Make you walk the plank to watch you sink
The MOB needs a hitman
Well here Im Uncle Cocaine floods your membrane
As the black ball swings from the chain
Learn to steal learn to wheel and deal
When things got hot caps got peeled
MCs come on step with your rhyme
Whats up put your life on the line
I shall robe them headlock choke them
While you walk them when the Syndicte Sniper get stalk them
Red Beam on target you cant dodge it
Wouldnt wanna be ya ABC ya
Aww yeah man that was MC IceT
Nat The Cat and Donald D you know what Im saying
In your face for 1991 and did something
We outta here for sure it was a homicidal fly by
So peace to Syndicates elders
