Ayo Ice man Im working on this term paper for college Whats the First Amendment
Freedom of Speech thats some motherfuckin bullshit
You say the wrong thing theyll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says Profanity  No Airplay
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore
Yo PMRC here we go raw
Yo Tip whats the matter You aint gettin no dick
Youre bitchin about rocknroll thats censorship dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip your argument is weak
Censor records TV school books too
And who decides whats right to hear You
Hey PMRC you stupid fuckin assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes em sell gold
Cant you see you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us the larger we get
Fuck that right I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak I want the right to walk
Where I wanna yell and Im gonna
Tell and rebel every time Im on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We aint the problems we aint the villains
Its the suckers deprivin the truth from our children
You cant hide the fact Jack
Theres violence in the streets every day any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say Americas some motherfuckin apple pie
Yo you gotta be high to believe that
Youre gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the worlds up shit creek
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus Georgia said theyd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said Fuck
So I thought for a minute and said No
I wasnt even gonna do a damned show
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos theres no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo they got theirs comin cos Im mad and Im gunnin
Homeboys and theres no runnin
Im gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull no lies no slack just straight fact
Columbus Georgia you can suck my dick
You aint nothin but a piece of fuckin shit on the damned map
Freedom of Speech let em take it from me
Next theyll take it from you then what you gonna do
Let em censor books let em censor art
PMRC this is where the witch hunt starts
Youll censor what we see we read we hear we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel yell out whats real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours my opinion is mine
If you dont like what Im sayin Fine
But dont close it always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
What theyre trying to do with radio with this uh McCarranWalter Act and a lot of other ways is start by saying that theyre protecting the public from wicked rock bands or girlie magazines or whatever But if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what theyre really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself
If they cant do it by law they know theres other ways to do it
