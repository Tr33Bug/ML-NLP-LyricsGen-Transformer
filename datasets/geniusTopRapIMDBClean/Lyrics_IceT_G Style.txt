Yeah Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me IceT
To bust some freestyle shit but I dont do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
With my nigga Alladdin SLJ LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah we do the shit like this
The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
Thats me the motherfuckin T
I got juice I ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I cant afford
Thats everything thats why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup to jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and youll lose
Or you might die
Cause Im the wrong Ice for your bruise
And thats no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggas
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies
Pigs call em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a Gman
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop Pop Pop To the dome
Its the Gstyle
Gangsta style
G Style The gangsta talk on the full plex
I got a teflon 9 and it eats vests
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA Atlanta New York
Yo my shit rocks
Chitown Miami Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every streets the same street to me
I dont bullshit
I dont quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And its sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer
Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I cant right
Stare at the blue lines
I think Im a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin LP
G Style the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
Its no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
Cause its my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
ABCDEF and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
Whatcha fraid of
Whatcha made of
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street nigga
Straight gangsta beat
Many like to dress the style and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Dont smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved mack cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool relaxed bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too hort let her know
Right off the top whats my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin on baby doll
But I wont sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you dont
Youre either rollin tonight
Or you wont
She likes the style
Cause it dont bullshit around
Tounge in my ear real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you dont like the style as I get wreck
Ease back nigga catch a knife through the neck
