someone whistles 
Whats up
Whats happening Cous
WESTSIIIDE
Here we go another one
Iceberg Gangsta Rap 2006 8th album SMG
Time to take you back to the days of old
64 Chevys big fat gold
Out to the west where the gangstas roam
South Central LA my home
We was out there feeling that HipHop beat
But couldnt connect to the New York streets
So we took our bandanas and we tied them up
Rolled up in the studio and laid it rough
Ice Cube and them niggas with the tudes
Showed a motherfucker how to blast at dudes BLAW
COME ON Dr Dre NWA
EazyE and Ren Fuck what you say
Too Short kept it raw for them niggas up North
Geto Boys we was like to fuck the law
WC nigga sag your pants
We taught you how to gangbang and to crip dance
This aint no RB this is Gangsta Rap
Bitches get smacked busters get jacked
Front if you want youll get laid on your back
Its about guns and drugs and hos and clubs
Cypress Hill made a nigga understand
How I can just kill a man
Long Beach out of the dark came Snoop
Skinny little nigga not scared to shoot
Dogg Pound Gangsters Kurupt and Daz
Suge had the whole Death grow on blast
King Tee motherfucker Warren G
Nate Dogg reppin that 213
Dont front motherfucker dont hate
Comptons Most Wanted MC Eiht
Throw your sets up niggas like you dont give a damn
Inglewood Mack 10 Watts was KAM
So you wanna really know whats real on the Mic
My little homie Pac lost his life
East coast West coast Guntalk rules
Cocaine big wheels hos and jewels
Down South gold teeth niggas is real Dirty South
Gangsta Rap got mass appeal
Little white boys in burbs got heat
A ghetto is a ghetto and a street is a street
Eliminate the poverty disease
And well start rapping about birds and trees
You can get shot no matter how much fucking cash you got
You can never get away the streets stay hot  Gunshot 
And gangsters aint the ones to push
Theyll kill you a second ask president Bush
