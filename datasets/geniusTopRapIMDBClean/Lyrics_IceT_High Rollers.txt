Speed of life fast
Its like walking barefoot over broken glass
Its like jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush females rush
This high profile personality who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar schoolboys admire
Young girls desire very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme dress code supreme vocabulary obscene
Definition street player you know what I mean
The high rollers  x2 
People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash theyll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes Ferraris trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to bigtime deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And youre living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
Youre a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game thats why yall boast
Because youre high priced high speed high post
High roller
Now when I say high rollers I mean the best
Forget the halfsteppers eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin through their veins
Silk shirts leather suits
Hair always fresh eelskin boots
Large hearts  though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin Pusherman
Yes their fashions high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Guccis not the swap meet
Eat very well much clientele
And whatever you need they probably sell
The high rollers


Oh yes Im here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo or hot as a flame
Theyll shake ya break ya and you wont know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men dont understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
Theyre junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers
Now radio stations probably wont play
This record because of the things I say
Theyll say Im glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But Im not here to tell ya right or wrong
I dont know which side of the law you belong
Yes the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake hard times lurks
And jails not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M16
But to each his own choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit the luxury home
Youll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And youre much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller
You better watch your back if you wanna be a high roller
