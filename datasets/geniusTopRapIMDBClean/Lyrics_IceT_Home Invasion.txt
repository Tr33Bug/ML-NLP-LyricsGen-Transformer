Song Home Invasion
All right When we go up in this goddamn house
All I want is the motherfuckin kids
As far as pops I dont give a fuck what you do
Bust him in his motherfuckin head
If he got any money take it
If there is money there rob the motherfuckin joint
As far as moms bust her in her goddamn head
Dumb bitch thats the reason were going up in there
She dont know what the fuck shes talkin about
Everyone get back this is a rap jack
Im takin your kids brains you aint gettinem back
With a move of perfection my dissection
Some call it lethal injection
Im gonna fillem with hard drums
Big drums bitches hoes and death come on and get some
Im not the nigga that you want to leave your kids alone with
Cause I got my own openingdome kit
And once again Im gonna put them under my fuckin spell
They might start givin you fuckin hell
Start changin the way they walk
They talk they act now whose fuckin fault is that
The home invader
Yo moms you can basically just suck my dick
This is a home invasion
Yo pops that shit you talkin is noise Word You full of shit
Check this out moms I said time bomb
And they sit in your house and remain calm
Till you feedem lies and the flip
Start talkin crazy shit  Fuck you 
Might call you and pops a fool
Tell ya thats why they hate school
Been offensive and askin questions
Give your brain indigestion
Why Why Because I have indoctrinated the youth
Theyre mentally intoxicated with truth
So they know the noise you talk are lies
Pretty damn soon theyll be by  Im outta here 
They listen to me and I giveem the real
And every night caps get peeled
And every night a ho gets smacked
A fool gets jacked
Now whose fuckin fault was that
The home invaders

Yo Yo Yo
All that shit you taught me mom was full of shit
Know what Im sayin
How the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin life
Bitch You dont even know who the fuck you are
You talkin about you dont like rap you dont like how I dress
Yo Fuck you and pops Im outta here
Both of yall can kiss my ass
All cops want me so does the FBI
Because my rhymes are fly
They still tryin to stop me shut me down block me
Make motherfuckas boycott me
But that will never happen its impossible
I move straight through all obstacles
They say Im fuckin up the minds of little kids
But half of my fans are in college
PMRC suck my dick please
You can kiss my ass while youre on your knees
Word Youre listening to the verbal assassinator
Es the crossfader your factual updater
Until your cranium grows like uranium
Hard as titanium parents Im blaminem
For teachin you lies about life racist viewpoints
And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day
While I learned about death from an AK
But theyll never quite understand
Bam bam bam no gat is the Walkman
Boom bash yeah yo its goin down
Me and Ice Cube are in town
But the fuckin pigs cancelled the concert
Theyre just scared of some niggers that do work
What they do What did I do
Just say truth motherfucka and its comin through
I tell you what we did we stole your fuckin kids
The home invader
All right we got the motherfuckin kids
We outta here Cmon
