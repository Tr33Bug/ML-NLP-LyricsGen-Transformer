Ice MF T LyricsYeah 1993 Im back motherfucker this is Ice T
Got my nigga Ice Cube in the motherfuckin house
Yeah Up here in the Ammo Dump studios I got my
Nigga Aladdin SLJs in the motherfuckin place
Behind the mixin boards
We about to do dis shit like this here
Verse 1
Its goin down tonight in LA
Buckshot and uzis spray
Microphone blowa
The bitch checka the ho wrecka
Ice motherfuckin T nigga step to me
But grab ya hoes quick
Cause the Syndicates throwin that crazy dick
Punk motherfuckers run up
Youll get done up
Well have your ass gunned up
Before sunup
So whats the color Im raggin
Been a millionare for years
Still saggin
Left pockets stuffed with a huge ass brick
380 in my right so it sags a little bit
More than the rest of my gear
When Im on tour
I empty clips bust lips and I break jaws
Cause I love to loc up
So punk motherfucker dont choke up
When youre talkin to me
Chorus
Ice Ice motherfuckin T  x4 
Verse 2
Bush Quayle and Clinton got a problem with me
The motheruckin T
I give less than a fuck about any of them
Or their fuckin police friends
Theyd like to take me out
Make me a goner
They even tryin to sweat Time Warner
Why
For tellin the truth to the youth
That a lot of motherfuckers are hot
And want police shot
You cant stop the shock   
The fires are out
But the coals are still hot
I got juice to bring pain
You tryin to fuck with the Ice
Are you insane
This shit is bigger than me
Be warned
Its the lull before the storm
And every fuckin thing I write
Is gonna be analyzed by somebody white

Chorus
Verse 3
Run motherfucker hide motherfucker trip motherfucker die motherfucker
You dont give love and you wont get loved
You dont push and you wont get shoved
No joke I aint here to laugh I aint here to cry
But every night of the wee kone of my homies die
Eeny meeny mynie moe
Bloods pourin out the naps of your afro
It could be you could be you could be you
Could be your whole damn crew
It happens real quick
Screechin tires next thing youre hit
Your bodys cold your bodys hot
You feel your chest you gasp for breath youre shot
And now your homies is trippin
Lookin for a gat to put they clip in
Street crime
Thats the thing I bring Ice T
IceT I rap BC I sing
They call it controversy
I call it truth with no mercy
The beats are phat Ammo Dump tracks
The kind that make speakers crack
Not made for squares or the weak punks
That made to bump trunks
Press get the fuck out my fuckin face
I aint got no more time to waste
A ho is a ho a bitch is a bitch a nigga is a nigga and thats it
Im through explainin the shit
You just makin me backtrack
The next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack
Plus every one of my true fans
Totally understands a nigga like me
Chorus  x2
