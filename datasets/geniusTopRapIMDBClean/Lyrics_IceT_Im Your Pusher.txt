Yo whats up man I need to get high man
I need to get hold of some big time dope man
You know where I can get a ki
I know where you can get an LP
LP man Have you went crazy man
Im talking about some dope man
I need to get high right now man
Why dont you hook me up with a 5O
I can hook you up with a 12 inch
12 inch Man have you went crazy
You dont even know what time it is
Out here on the streets and dont know what time it is
Man youse a fool
Yo homeboy you a fool
You dont know what time it is
Out here messing up your mind
You know what Im sayin
This is IceT talkin to you boy
Imma tell you what time it is
Yo its time for me to pump the volume
No problem the records revolvin
Evils the mixer Im the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice coolin yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Dont try to size up you better wise up
To the rap criminals were succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics no beepers needed
For this drug deal Im the big wheel
The dope Im sellin you dont smoke you feel
Out on the dance floor on my world tour
Im sellin dope in each and every record store
Im the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You dont need it just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high Let the record play


Aww man I like this dope here man
Its feelin alright boy
What you say your name was man
Im your momma
Im your daddy
Im that nigga in the alley
Im your brother when you need
A true player to emcee
You know me a true friend
Your main boy thick and thin
MC IceT
Im your pusher
I know youre lovin this drug as its comin out your speaker
Bass through the bottons highs thru the tweeters
But this base you dont need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin like I see you doin
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high why That aint fly
And anyone who says it is lies
Move like I knew you would like I knew could
And if you aint cracked out then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap to match exact with the track
And since I know that you aint I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit its like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
Ill make a million bucks pack my dough in trucks
From sellin dope beats dope rhymes dope cuts
Ill be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that IceT
Aww man you aint ever lie man
This dopes alright man
I gotta get back with you man
Let me get your number man
Ill bring it to boil Evil E rock it up
You want it I dont think you got enough
Last suckers crossed Syndicate shot em up
Cops found em in the lake bottom up
I dont play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close like with a microscope
I dont clean em up with no Ivory soap
I leave em hard and pure hope that you can cope
Because you might OD if you overdrive
This record tape or CD because the sound Ive
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give makes me invincible
Aww Mr Dopeman
Im lovin you man
You got it goin on man

The cops dont know what to do because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do my stuff gets to you
Kickin on the Boulevard my tempos hyped and hard
I dont ask the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out with Warner Bros clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut then removes it
IZ checks for purity then approves it
And then you get it try it and like it
And if it aint potent we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope not a noose in a rope
Because if youre doin crack youre on death row
Youre just a toy punk to mess with that junk
You want some real dope come look in my trunk
The dope Im sellin is life 100 legit
So get real fool and try some real hit
Word up my brother
You got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight
IceT man you alright
Im your pusher
