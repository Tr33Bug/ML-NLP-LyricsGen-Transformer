Yo Ice
The organization say they cant stay in business with us any longer
What you gonna do
We always knew we were gonna come to this point sooner or later
We have absolutely no option but to move forward
Well have to set up our own distribution manufacturing
Run a totally indipendent organization and operation
We still got our connections in Texas Miami New York Chicago
Detroit and soldiers on the street willing to die
I cant put any cut on the product
I just cant live like that
But from now on if any cops get in our way
Turn up the mic dog so I can get off
Find me Charlton Heston and I might cut his head off
Im not to be fucked with
Step in the range of my Gauge and get bucked quick
Niggas hoes I dont know who you are my friends or foes
Smile in my face and plot to kill me behind doors
I got a new attitude no trust
Got me in a corner all a nigga can do is bust
It may be you
Theres gonna be a lot of dead before Im through
Im bout to break off niggas who play me and dis me
Try to switch from side to side like they whip me
The damage is done
Source Magazine youre the first one
You try to dis Chuck Cube and me
How the fuck you pick us 3
You punk motherfuckers aint shit youre just a bunch of hoes
Makin money off the pros
And when I see I get you in my sights
I give your ass a story to write
Cause its on
Its on
Its on motherfucker and you cant turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your assll get tossed
Bang Bang Bang Cause it aint no thang
To put in work and watch your head burst


A lot of fans aint shit
Let me repeat
A lot of fans aint shit
Quick to flip if our group dont hit
They dont make you nothin but a pop ho bitch
And I dont need ya
I love to bleed ya
All I ever wanted was a real niggas praise
But the sad motherfuckin fact
Is that aint that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many true players to name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes thatll work still got crews thatll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think theyll stop me doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
Youd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets
You dont want that
Cause I break ill
And youll really have to Body Count the cops Ill kill its on
Its on motherfucker and you cant turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your assll get tossed
Bang Bang Bang Cause it aint no thing
To put in work and watch your body jerk
Its on
Its on motherfucker you goddamn right
Its on my royalty cheque yeah fool I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about
And all the suckas that said I was through
You need to wake up to my view
Im fallen off
Ha Ha Thats a joke
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And Im stankin rich
My fuckin maid lives better than you bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game you dont know jack
CIA FBI IRS
Try those letters out for sweat
But theyll never sweat you son
Cause youre broke and youre dumb and youre no threat to no one
Them fools dont play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
Theyd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like Im Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin dope on the street for years and dont give a damn
So Im thinkin about them friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas wanna see me end
Its gonna end up in a bloodbath no doubt
Thats the only way Im going out its on
Its on
Its on motherfucker and you cant turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your assll get tossed
Bang Bang Bang Cause it aint no thing
To put in work and watch your head burst
Its on
