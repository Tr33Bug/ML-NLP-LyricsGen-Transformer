EVIL E and IceT are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck youll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck waxin those who talk junk
Dialing you in I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I dont care
Nuttin bout you your crew because you talk shit
Im the Lethal Weapon boy ridin the apocalypse
If youre in my way then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool the microphone of doom
Mission thats to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back my ammunition hollowpoint raps
You try to run that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex but guns theyll never find
My Lethal Weapons my mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
You hit the deck as rap busts from my lips
You think Im finished  I load another clip
Look in my face I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac10
Sucker MCs you aint down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game but end up talkin weak shit yo
Youre weak youre wack you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face Im tired of the press too
You write about me I write about you
You think Im violent but listen and you will find
My Lethal Weapons my mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
Up against the wall  its Valentines Day
The Massacres about due for a replay
Im about to explode  like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
Evil E scratches Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite get iced my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand youre dealt
screaming Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Cause theres no let up you walked into a set up
Its suckin you down and now you cant get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk I go head up
I aint no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul where only facts are kept
Many rappers sellout pop and other MCs slept
I aint in no playin mood so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy dont diss the Syndicate
Cause when we chose to move youre gone
And no remains theyll find
My Lethal Weapons my mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
More bodies than John Gotti the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book thats ammo to the brain
What really matters is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon many pages
From Martin Luthers dream to Hitlers psycho rage
Whats more powerful  the brain or a twelve gauge
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence I really have to disagree
Its entertainment like Terminator on TV
But somell never see youre stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapons the mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
The mind
Think
The mind
