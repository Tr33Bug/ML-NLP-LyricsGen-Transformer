The other day I spent a million on a def gold chain
It weighted thirty nine pounds my name plate the same
I put it on it was too heavy
So I hired me this brother to wear for me
One night we was out chillin he and I minus crew
I was held at gun point by a thugs 22
But when I told him that I was the LA player IceT
The brother robbed somebody else and brought the money to me

The Lakers wanted to pick me but I said Step
Cause takin Magics spot could be bad for my rep what

My girl was pissed so she tried to diss
The D until I showed her my fist
I argued with her in the pouring rain
After the fightin with her I missed the train
It was delayed for an hour so I fell asleep
When I woke up I was on 14th Street
By the time I got there it was way too late
Came back uptown and decided to wait
Ran into her cous and hung with him
Met Billy Joe Bob Frank Chuck and Slim
Went back to the crib to watch a VCR
And then I had to pick up my fathers car
Looked around for my brother to see where he went
And then I had to pay my mothers rent

So many houses sometimes I forget
I brought a yacht and a brand new lear jet
I flew to Paris just for good meal
Then to Rome to sign a record deal
Off to London to kick with the Queen what Queen
Back to LA I bought a football team
I just cant stop spendin that green
My girl loves the water so I brought baby a submarine
But see I left my house without my credit Cards
