Hustler word I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth spray till every niggas gone
Got my block sewn armored dope spots
Last thing I sweats a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll hops
You try to flex bang another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause theres no way out
Why Cash money aint never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose much to gain
In my brain I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight you muthafuckin right
Pickin my grip check my bitch keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock think Im a movie star
Nineteen I got a 50000 dollar car
Go to school I aint goin for it
Kiss my ass bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I dont wanna hear that crap
Why Id rather be a New Jack Hustler
Hustler

Yo man you know what Im sayin
You got it goin on my man I like how its goin down
You got the fly cars the girls the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know its real its gotta be real
Man you the flyest nigga I seen in my life
Yo man I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down
Whats up You say you wanna be down
Ease back or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face fool Im the illest
Bulletproof I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect I bought em new Jags
So much cash gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that me workin at Mickey Ds  ha ha ha ha 
Thats a joke cause Im never gonna be broke
When I die therell be bullets and gun smoke
Ya dont like my lifestyle Fuck you
Im rollin with the New Jack crew
And Im a hustler

Here I come so you better break north
As I stride my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothin bout you and thats evident
All I loves my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy Well it isnt
The ends justify the means thats the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets checked a grip and now I got clout
I had nothing and I wanted it
You had everything and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine my success came speedy
Got me twisted jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get another brother drops
Maybe thats the plan and I dont understand
God damn you got me sinkin in quicksand
But since I dont know and I aint never learned
I gotta get paid I got money to earn
With my posse out on the ave
Bump my sounds crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare Or the American dream
So think twice if youre coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens childrens screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You dont come here much and ya better not
Wrong move  bang  ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what some motherfucker gets shot
Thats how the game is played another brother slayed
The wound is deep but theyre givin us a band aid
My educations low but I got long dough
Im raised like a pit bull my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk lie like a politician
My Uzis my best friend cold as a mortician
Lock me up its genocidal catastrophe
Therell be another one after me a hustler
