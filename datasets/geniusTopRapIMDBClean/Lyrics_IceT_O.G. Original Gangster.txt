OG Original Gangster Lyrics
Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said That aint you Ice That shit sounds like them
So I sat back thought up a new track
Didnt fantasize kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was Who dared
A motherfucker from the West Coast LA
South Central fool where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties it didnt fit
6 N the Mornin that was the real shit
OG Original Gangster
When I wrote about parties someone always died
When I tried to write happy yo I knew I lied
Cause I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know Im
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane drop ya on death row
Cause anybody whos been there knows that
Life aint so lovely on the bloodsoaked fast track
That invincible shit dont work
Throw ya in a joint youll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes Im ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
Id be a true sucker if I acted like I didnt care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move and your caps peeled
I aint no super hero I aint no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game Im atomic
At dropping it straight point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed cause I lived it
This aint no fucking joke this shit is real to me
Im IceT OG

Hook
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said Hey yo Ice
We dont think youre down What set ya claiming
E drew the Glock yo my sets aiming
Dumb motherfucker try to roll on me please
Im protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We wont even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when Im on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didnt figure
That my wits as quick as a hair trigger
Hes not your everydaytype prankster
Im IceT the original gangster
So step to me if you think that youre ready to
Got on your bullet proof Well mines going right thru
This aint no game to me its hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets so I dont claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping I cant even get worked
But I dont slip that often theres a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
Im from South Central fool where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast youll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers dont carry no switchblades
Every kids got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirtyseven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
The children have to go to school Well moms good luck
Cause the shits fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe its just cause of where Im from
LA  bang  that was a shotgun
