Deuce deuce revolver
Was my problem solver
Had a def girl really didnt
Wanna involve her
In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now Im locked up
Im just a punk low rankster
Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like Ive built on earth
My own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell
No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain  x4 
Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor
But now Im on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crimesmart searching hard
For some new street tricks
I think Ill join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name
Fresh sneakers silk shirts
247 work
Ninetofive to survive
You gotta be a jerk
I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me At Micky Ds
It wouldnt work no way
Im a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras
My banks bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years
But Im unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money true wealth
My eternal quest
I hustle all night long
There aint no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Bloods on my chest
I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up
This wound would never mend
No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain  x4 
Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Cant hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn
From too much poolside sittin
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there aint no quittin
Minds in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie
Got a female overload
Young street messiah
Professional liar
19 got a Benz
21 Ill retire
Crazy money it aint funny
Suckers lovin my jock
But theres some people at my door
That didnt even knock
Task force boomin
Doggin my crib out
Cant shout
FBIs got a gun in my mouth
Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten Gs out my mattress
And was lookin for more
Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max
When they seem my money kickin it
In twentyG stacks
Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue
Some that I couldnt pronounce
They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin out with a crook
She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the citys health
The sweat of hustlers greed
Is not reserved for men
Its always fun in the beginning
But its pain in the end
Pain  x5 
Yeah that aint nothin
Cause when I get outta here Imma get right back in the money
Cause they dont know that I know what time it is ya see
I done learned something I did half my time but I can learn more when I was in here
And Imma go right back out and get paid you understand what Im sayin Cause I did half my time Word
I only got nine years left
PAIN
