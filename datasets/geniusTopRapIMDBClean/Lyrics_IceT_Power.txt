Im livin large as possible posse unstoppable
Style topical vividly optical
Listen youll see em sometimes Ill be em
Cops critics and punks never ever want to see me in POWER
Well thats too bad Apocalypse Now Im back and Im mad
Were comin youre runnin cold and cunning
Ice T on the mic TopGunning
After your neck checkin respect makin you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy in effect
The rap motivatorteachertalkernight rhyme stalker
Words thrillin so real theyre chillin the hit author
Gettin louder than a shot gun you dont want none
RHYME PAYS was the name of the album
But that was number one this is the number two
The posse grew were gonna break through
Power
Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posses growin and its gettin larger every day
Detroit ChiTown Pittsburgh Houston LA
Come on come on come on toys lets play
Circle the calendar perpetrator doomsday
ICE T fool man of my own fullgrown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
Im outspoken no jokin get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin it sayin it then youre playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin it
Hated by many but I hateem back
Loved by troopers who know where its at
You might like me might think Im wack
But dont step to me cause the boy stays strapped
Im taking no shorts hatin the courts hatin the judges
Punk DAs with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats no jeans no sneakers no what
No beepers no gold Yo kiss my ass
Well wait and see who gets the last laugh
Well have the power
Power  x3 
Power it starts with P like pussy
She knows shes got it she doesnt worry does she
Spendin your cash leavin you in the trash
While your little heads thinkin theyre gone in a dash
They got it know it thats why they show it
The power of sex if man could overthrow it
Hed be king in a day no way
We get rich hard give it away
Were weak and as we speak the girls are hawkin
Sizin me up straight out as Im talkin
You gotta have control if you want the gold
I dont wanna be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin bout the green
And stop dwellin on the inbetween
I got the power
Power
Im on a mission mackin hard as a hammer
Take my picture I might take your camera
My posse might move and they move fast
A fools move could be a punks last
Aint no criminal although I used to be
Aint no new jack rappin aint new to me
I been makin records on wax since 1982
Now its 1988 finally Im coming through
That adds up to six years of makin ok jams but now Im mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin out concerts housin the industry
Lovin all the fly girls screamin for ICE T
Rollin with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medallion
Gainin velocity momentum and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power
Power
So you say that Im a fake think you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at shot back hit and seen my buddies killed
Thats the foundation upon the raps of IceT are built
I say what I think the system does stink
Money you walk you short youre writin from the clink
Come on whats up you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame release those with pull
Power I know you wanna try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin
The knowledge of power is mine so just listen
Money controls the world and thats it
And once you got it then you can talk shit
Power
You have the power
Power
You have the power
I got the power fade out
