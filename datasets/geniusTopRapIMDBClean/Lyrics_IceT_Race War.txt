Yeah
Yeah
Check this out now Im black
But black people trip
Cause white people like me
White people like me
But dont like them
Whats the fuck up
Are you my friend
Hell no youre a racist
You say you got one black friend so youre in
Sorry homie no win
Check the facts
Mexicans are still gettin pushed to the back
PuertoRicans gettin dissed the same
Wont speak on the Indians shits insane
Fuck John Wayne
I dont hate whites
I just got a death wish for muthafuckas that aint right
You got black skin
Still you gotta show and prove friend
Back to the facts
What about Australia
A fuckin failure
The Aboriginal people are black
So they got jacked
You ask me about free speech and the Riots
So whats in store
Im talkin bout a race war
Get yourself together 
Open your eyes
Get wise 
Put your brain in gear 
Race war
People gettin killed in the street
Blood on your feet the ends dont meet
And who they gonna blame it on me
Try the media
Try the PD
Try your TV
Try your quest for wealth
Anybody but yourself
But once the bullets start flyin
People start dyin
Its all because were lyin
History books that teach hate
A kid has no escape
From the racist fate
And pretty soon South Africa
Will stop chillin
And start killin
Race war  8X 
Every night I pray
That people get this shit together one day
But this country aint with it
America was founded on that racist shit
I judge the devil by his deeds
Its usually connected to the size of his greed
And keep the hope
Even though theyd love to give a nigga like me the rope
And when this shit hits
Theres gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans
You cant sweat skin
Cause therell be a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans
This shit dont have to happen
Thats why a brother like mes still rappin
Just treat each other right
Either that or youre lookin for a sure fight
Fuck the police
We already know they aint about no fuckin peace
You wanna know what I thinks in store
Justice or a race war
Get yourself together 
Open your eyes
Get wise 
Race war
Get yourself together 
Open your eyes
Get wise 
Put your brain in gear 
Race war
Get yourself together 
Open your eyes
Get wise 
Put your brain in gear 
Race war
Get yourself together 
Open your eyes
Get wise 
Put your brain in gear 
Korean people live down in the hood
