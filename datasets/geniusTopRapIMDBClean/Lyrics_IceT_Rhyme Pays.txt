Magnificent rhymer Im the ill beat designer
If they ask you if Im def dont front and say kinda
Merciless meticulous so fresh its ridiculous
Im raised in the heart of Los ANGELES
King word connector the vocal projector
Your girl tried to jock me I had to reject her
Always adventurous voice some say is sensuous
Now Im on the mic so I think I better mention this
I dont like Gucci Fila Louis or Fendi
Those are fads and I aint trendy
But whether your names Lucy Terry Laura or Cindy
Ice got the beef and this aint Wendys
Bust a move while Im talkin
Sucker rappers I be stalkin
When they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin
They slow down turn around and ask was that Ice
Then they see me cold countin my cash
Rhyme pays
Moves must be busted girls cant be trusted
I looked at your lady and I was disgusted
Came into the party just to rock the place
And your big zombie lookin freak still wont get out of my face
I dont mean to diss her but do you kiss her
Look at her lips she got them crazy blisters
Body that smells like the New York Mets
Arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat
I hope this something that you never forget
Tie that freak outside next time you come in the set
Because my jams be crazy packed with all fly ladies
Im talkin def girlies and I dont mean maybe
The way I rhyme no one will ever slay me
And I aint lyin rhymes do pay me 
Rhyme pays
Im notorious Im infamous like a snake Im venomous
For those who may diss I think you should consider this
I can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle
Dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle
But this record is for radio STEREO
Its not to be banned or for some underground mix show
My hearts in my pen every time I begin
Sometimes my lyrics go crazy and I just cant control em my friend
I try to edit what Im rappin about
But I cant write polite my anger just jumps out
Perpetrators in the business claim theyre hard as hell
Talkin that gangster shit known theyre soft as jell
Oh I better chill out before I ill out
And my negative potential just might spill out
And then this record wont be gettin played
Ill save that rap for another day
Rhyme pays
The front stage area goes into hysteria
As I start to rhyme and unleash my criteria
Of what is to come during the beat of the drum
And Evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb
Using his intricate moves the record stays in the groove
My boy cuts like Jason its easy to prove
That Evil E is the great his cuts are real not fake
Not emulated effects or a play back tape
So suckers witness your fate while Evil demonstrates
Im bout to get off this mic E dog the break  Kick it
Like me if ya wanta diss me if youre gonna
But my jam will still be kickin on your neighborhood corner
As my bass is maxn out the VUS on your box
Therell be no doubt within your mind whether this MC do rock
Like granite I planned it So you could understand it
If someones talkin when Im rhymin
Then just say Damn shut up
While Ice is breakin the boy dont be fakin
Maybe theyre just jealous of the dollars Im makin
But youre down with me You know god gifted me
Black kids say Im trech white kids say Im nifty
Spell out my name ya go ICE T
But right now its time for Evil E to hit me
Rhyme pays buys my food every night and day
It pays my rent my bills I guess Im doin ok
But when I say rhyme pays I mean in different ways
Cause rappin gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day
It makes me feel real nice when someone likes the Ice
Or some young MC asks me for advice
But there will always be rappers who hate Ice T
Maybe I dogged em in a battle or just jealousy
Inevitable situation sucker rapper frustration
I rhyme too tough to bite too intricate for notation
Syllables jumble competitors crumble as they witness mic attack
And the microphone rumbles like hurricane
I maim sometimes I go insane
Step toward my rap and I inflict the pain
No shame Ice capital Ts my name
Damn there I go illin out again
Rhyme Pays
