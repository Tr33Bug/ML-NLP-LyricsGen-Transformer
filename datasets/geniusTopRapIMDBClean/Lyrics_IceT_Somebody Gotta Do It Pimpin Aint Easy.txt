Somebody Gotta Do It  Pimpin Aint Easy  Lyrics
My lifestyles crazy Im luxury lazy
So much gold that jewelry dont faze me
Cordless phone eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with an IceT jones
Bank account boomin fastlane zoomin
Known around the world for my high post groomin
Mac like a preacher love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes got a ragtop Rolls
1000 Watt system and my speakers are Bose
I kick it like a champ I thought you knew it
Pimpin aint easy but somebody gotta do it
My thumbs are tired just from countin cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filin my nails is such a tirin task
Gold knobs on my Benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please dont dare
Youre takin a chance if you just stop and stare
Livin my life is just so hard to do
Makin deals a million one or two
Buyin new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris Es black mines blue
Cant swim a lap in my pool because its just too long
Could never go broke because my banks too strong
No matter what I do I simply cant go wrong
And Ill make money I dont need from this damn song
But somebodys gotta do it
When I walk in a joint punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin in my mansion so big its silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed thats what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchen so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin on my boat I might
Just helicopter to my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book it weighs a ton
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there aint nothin in the world
That me and E aint done

But somedody gotta do it
