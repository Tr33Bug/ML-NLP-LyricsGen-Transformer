Yo Evil whats up man They be buggin they wont play our records on the radio man say we violent man They need to look at the news you know what Im sayin Somebody need to kill that noise Man what you doin with that up under your shirt Aw man its time we put some head out word Lets get busy E Come on home boy
Squeeze the trigger
Man Im tired of this nonsense sweatin my crew tryin to come to the show searchin my car man Im sick of the cops
Rampage on stage my crews in a rage
Searched my posse found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac Im a rhyme brainiac livin on the edge of a razor remember that
Cold rollin thick as a shake Im rockin hard as a quake
I can live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My minds a riot gun there aint none bigger
About to unload the ammo E squeeze the trigger
You fight  Got im  to live 
Police still have no leads for the apprehension of the south side slayer Death total stands at ten
Has it ever occured to you The president might be the one who wants you dead
They say Im violent they should watch the TV
You say Im brutal you should check your PD
You made me now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder intrigue somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time LAs the big league
From the Rollin 60s to the Nickerson Gs
Pueblos Grape Street this is what I see
The Jungle the 30s the VNG
Life in LA aint no cup of tea
And they be sayin Im illin yo
Squeeze the trigger
Got im
Violence erupts at a Los Angeles hiphop concert Rap music is blamed for violence
Violence erupts at a New York hockey game Hockey is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a European soccer game Soccer is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a nuclear peace rally Peace is blamed for violence
Ive been dogged out by cops shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by squares workin nine to five jobs
But like a panther I prowl like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
Im the voice of the youth the prophet of truth
What I speak is reality though some may say ruth
less tactics are takin by me to awaken
People to life but I feel no fakin
No jivin no lyin no frontin no playin
Say exactly whats up understand what Im sayin
Ban me try it you might cause a riot
What the radio wont play the underground will supply it
Im an MC pirate thats loud not quiet
Radical as they makeem make a rule Ill defy it
Critics may say Im wise some may call my words lies
Ive lived more in one day than they will in their lives
With most due respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun or cut MCs like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So dont diss me dont dare I feel you should care
You may think Im soft but youre just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged prepare
For a true nightmare

Squeeze the trigger
Cops hate kids kids hate cops cops kill kids with warnin shots
What is crime and what is not What is justice I think I forgot
We buy weapons to keep us strong
Reagan sends guns where they dont belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter the lies we all know whos wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin to die with nothin to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in Queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets a goddamn disgrace
Just because of his race his life went to waste
And not one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption Its all interlaced
How can you swallow this I cant stand the taste
Squeeze the trigger
LA drug war continues Three killed in execution style murders Film at eleven
All flights are delayed at LAX due to terrorist bombings Five adults and two children are dead
I get paid for illin cold makin a killin
My pockets keep fillin I got dollars to the ceilin
Got a safe in my floor car got bulletproof doors
Every time I rock the mic I leave you wishin for more
Cause my raps aint bull got cold stupid pull
You wanna eat my rhymes like candy til your minds over full
But most MCs today aint got nothin to say
A to the motherfuckin K
Get him
Yo E man im tired of this lets call up the posse lets end this noise word
Now you think you know what time it is Word we out of here
Los Angeles rapper IceTs records banned because of his blatant use of reality
This album is dedicated to Rhyme Syndicate
They hear my records before theyre made
When theyre just on paper when theyre demos laid
At 6am when the cops run their raid
We dont worry about suckas cause they will get sprayed
PEACE
