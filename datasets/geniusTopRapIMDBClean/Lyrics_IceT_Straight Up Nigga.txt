Yo check this out
A lot of people get mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what Im saying they dont like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you a black man I tell em Im a nigga they dont understand that
So Im a say what I wanna say I call myself what I wanna call myself
You know what Im saying
So they can stay off my dick
Damn right Im a nigga
And I dont care what you are
Cause Im a capital NI doubleGER
Black people might get mad
Cause they dont see
That theyre looked upon
As a nigga just like me
Im a nigga not a Coloured man
Or a Black or a Negro
Or Afro American Im all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you
Im a nigga a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I dont care that is you fool
Im loud and proud
Well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner

So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant stupid inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish

And that much I flaunt
Cause when I see what I like
Yo I take what I want

Thats why Im not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga
America was stole from the Indians
Show and prove what was that
A straight up nigga move
A low down shame
Yo its straight insane
Yet they complain
When a nigga snatch
Their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do
Wait around for a handout
From a nigga like you
Thats why a low down nigga gets hyped
But Im not a nigga of that type

Billionaire meetin
Cash money makin movin shakin
Corporate jet glidin
Limousine ridin
Writin hits filthy rich

Though the radio wont play it
But I got freedom of speech
So Im a say it
She wanna be lez he wanna be gay
Well thats your business Im straight
So nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got somethin for ya
Im a nigga with cash a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon chitlin eatin nigga down south
But a nigga thatll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking best champagne drinkin
Ten inch givin extra large livin
Mercedes benz drivin strivin to survivin
All the way live n and kickin hi fivin
Strokin rap and happenin deal doing

Horny gun shootin long hair havin

Ease back fool cause Im a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin
But I dont celebrate bullshit Thanksgiving
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
Thats the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twisted up a niggas brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But Im a nigga that youll never forget
A black bad iron clad always mad
Fly nigga takin off from a helipad
Rolex drivin buck wilin cash pilin
Sportin link chains and medallions
Intellectual hitech cashin seven digit checks
And still breakin necks
The ultimate male supreme white womans dream
Big dick straight up nigga
