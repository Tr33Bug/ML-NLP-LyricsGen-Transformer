Some people claim that Im born to play
Cause Im your IceT on a sunny day
I make the goers come the leavers stay
I make the lovers kiss and the workers play
I make the runners walk the quiet talk
I bust so viciously I make the blind man see
Im the ladies cream the virgins wet dream
I got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend
Im tired of these DJs going around
Talking about how they go down to town
Cause Im the best Rapper that you have found
So all you lovely ladies lets party down
Take all your rapping records throw them in the trash
IceT is the only brother that you got to blast
Hook up the stereo turn up the watts
Were gonna rock til the niggas call up the cops
We rock rock yall with no fear and
If you dont dig it turn off your ears
We rock rock yall and keep on and
If you dont dig it take your damn self home
Cause Im a player the best alive
I prefer fast money to a NinetoFive
From the womb to the tomb I run my game
Cause Im cold as ice and I show no shame
Well Im IceT Im terribly bad
Im here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad
I may be small but Im willing to say
I jam this party in one hell of a way
The powers I got are hard to find
Ill be breaking womens hearts while Im blowing their minds
They be giving me money and buying me things
But I spend their cash and pawn their rings
If they treat me right Im willing to show
The coolest young brother theyll ever know
But if they do me wrong I hate to say
Ill never teach them how to rock this way
Cause back in the thirties when times was hard
I had a sawedoff shotgun a marked deck of cards
A turned up collar a turned up hat
A 38 hustle and I stole that
I walked in the party there were women for days
And I started dancing one hell of a way
I was dancing so hard couldnt no one compete
I turned out the party with my Icecold feet
Cause Im a player thats all I know
On a summer day I play in the snow
From the womb to the tomb I run my game
Cause Im cold as ice and I show no shame


Were born to play and brought up that way
We catch the women night and day
And when I want to Ill talk to you
And youll become one of the chosen few
Cant you see that now Im me
Im the brother known as IceT
And umm Im the brother whose like no other
Whos black in soul but not in color
You dig the race and a hit to the case
When youre trying to get outta my face
Im trying to tell you Im a brother thats nice
Im sweet as honey Im cold as Ice
But if you say something to me that aint too down
Youll be picking your booty up off the ground
You can ask your father your sister or mother
I got a Rolls Royce in every color
I keep my rides tuned to perfection
I got a Stutz for every direction
Im the pimp the player the women layer
The holy dueler the whorehouse doer
I just play young whores slam Cadillac doors
Im the black Mack of the heart attack
But I dont smoke no whack I dont cut no slack
Im here to rock yall so rock rock
Im IceT when I dress I never jive
I do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive
When I leave the pad Im never loud
Im just so sharp I cut through the crowd
I got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days
When I put some in I got to throw some away
Cause Im a player some call us Macks
With private phones in our Cadillacs
From the womb to the tomb we run our games
Cause were cold as ice and we show no shame
The ladies say that Im heaven sent
Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride RagTop Rolls with rocks on my hand
Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have an ocean liner private jets
BelAir bookies place my bets
I own islands off the coast of France
Now I wear designer shirts and pants
When I was brought into this world
My mamma never asked if I was a boy or a girl
First I rolled over to her and gave her a kiss
She said Your daddy dont rock me like this
When the doctor hit me on the behind
I broke on down with a funky rhyme
The nurses said I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo please please please check it out
Cause Im a player Im always clean
I bought a Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb I run my game
Cause Im cold as ice and I show no shame
Then I met this madam named Angel Adams   
She said she liked my style
She said sit down T let me rap to you for just a little while
She was a gravedigger pulled 38 triggers
Shes a lady in love and sent from above
She wasnt sly she wasnt slick
Just made that money real quick
She had a way of getting it fast
It came from dealing in cold cash
She ran her game with the utmost ease
To break a player down to his knees
I said lady put freeze on that rap and
Prepare yourself for a heart attack
I took her by her hand I said come with me
We drove off in my vicious eighty three
I took her to diner I took her to the show
I took her to the Snooty cause she begged me to go
We got to the room    man after long snaps
So she shook herself and broke herself came up with a gat
She went through the door I didnt cut no slack
I had her on the floor on her stomach on her back
I had her on the wall on the hall and on her knees
I put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze
I took her out the hot tub then I put her on the floor
She said Ooh IceT I cant take no more
I put her in the bed then she looked up in the mirror
Screamed so loud I think the East Coast could hear her
I rolled on my back I put her on the top
She said Ooh IceT will this ever stop
I said No The freaking has just begun
We hit fifty more positions before I got done
When weve got finished it was no longer dark
We had rocked so hard made the Snooty Fox bark
Then she rolled over to me she looked me in my eye
And said these words to my surprise
She said I tried to catch you cause I knew I could
I came here with you cause I thought I should
I tried to freak you cause I thought I could
But oohh baby you sure are good
She said baby youre one hell of a man
Aint no better riding than Disney Land
Now to all you ladies that think youre fly
And can out freak the average guy
Dont ever come venturing through my door
Ill have begging to stop while youre screaming for more
Yo please check it out
All the ladies in the house come check it out
Cause Im a player with jewels on every hand
So deeply in pocket I control demand
But we all know how I earn my pay
Cause you dont wanna work when you got to play
Brothers when you wine and dine a fox
You dont take her to McDonalds or to Jack In The Box
Dont pick her up in a bus or a cab
She needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap
You can take her to dine at the finest spot
Or you take her to a disco thats really hot
You can take her home and while youre all alone
Dont forget to disconnect the phone
You can take her to the bed you throw back the sheets
Rock her butt to the rhythm of the beat
