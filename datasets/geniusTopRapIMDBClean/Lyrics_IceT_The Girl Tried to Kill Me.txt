Yo I met this girl the other night
Hype superdope body and face her miniskirt tight
Talkin bout legs and lips mindblowin hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told meI was the one
I said Why she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now thats the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said Fast slow hard or soft baby
She said All the above
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now I aint no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you she was on some motherfuckin sex trip
Took me to her crib that night leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobelight
And started buggin lightin candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
Yo my pants were on but so what
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkeyass up
Faster than I could say No
It was like a rodeo I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip I said Shit
This girl had crazy plans for the night
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now whips aint all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitchs pad
Im talking about latex suits spikeheeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said Dontdontdont whip me
Ill do anything you ask
And then homegirl stripped 38 tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin baby oil on her chest
And then she said Gimme gimme gimme
Jumped on my Jimmy and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin husband sixfoot ten
I knew my life would soon end
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yoyo nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin his wife
Yo
