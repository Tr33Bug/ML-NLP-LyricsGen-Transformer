Time to bleed slaughter slice
Try to say I wasnt nice as we waxed them punks like lab mice
Dice em up slice em up dissect
Put you in a boilin pot and let your ass sweat
Cos I rap on game you think Im weak in a freestyle
Well 911 you should dial
Before my posse makes a move on your moms crib

Blow up your whole block you hear the gunshots
Throw you in the Syndicate cellar and let your body rot

Evil E was out coolin with a freak one night
Fucked the bitch with a flashlight
Pulled it out and left the batteries in
So he could get a charge when he begin
Used his dick the shit was tight
Bitchs titties start blinkin like tail lights
Rolled her over to change a connection
Bitchs ugly face cold spoiled his erection
Im the Ice rhymer a big timer
And yes Im a pimp and a player and a hustler and kinda
A mack and a poet impressive I know it
