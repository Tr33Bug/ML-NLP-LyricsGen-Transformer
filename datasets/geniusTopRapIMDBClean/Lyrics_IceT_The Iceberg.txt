Time to bleed slaughter slice
Try to say I wasnt nice as we waxed them punks like lab mice
Dice em up slice em up dissect
Put you in a boilin pot and let your ass sweat
Cos I rap on game you think Im weak in a freestyle
Well 911 you should dial
Before my posse makes a move on your moms crib

Blow up your whole block you hear the gunshots
Throw you in the Syndicate cellar and let your body rot

Kick that fly one to me about my man Evil E aight

Evil E was out coolin with a freak one night
Fucked the bitch with a flashlight
Pulled it out and left the batteries in
So he could get a charge when he begin
Used his dick the shit was tight
Bitchs titties start blinkin like tail lights
Rolled her over to change a connection
Bitchs ugly face cold spoiled his erection
Im the Ice rhymer a big timer
And yes Im a pimp and a player and a hustler and kinda
A mack and a poet impressive I know it

But she said she never felt it
Maybe Charlies dick melted
Yes Im the rhyme kicker the hard liquor
