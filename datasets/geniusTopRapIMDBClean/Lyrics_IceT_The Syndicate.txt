Liquid solid gas  well be kickin ass
In any form or matter or mass
This aint science class  I know but its science
From the rhyme boss of the Syndicate alliance
Ballin makin ya feel the growth
Rhyme Syndicate brotherhood we rock a blood oath
Radical posse down to death
While your crews on the tape DonaldD break
Syndicate comin through Im talkin to you
Flexin hardcore what could you do
When we roll up you send your girl up to the cribo
Is it Rambo No the mic ammo
Stompin you down on the ground task forces
Let you know Rhyme Syndicate bosses
Any show any tour we house program
DonaldD is who I am damn
Attempt to do this boy youre takin a risk
Cause my voice sounds doper than a compact disc
Styles and lyrics precise right in the pocket
Stupid dope beats and Evil E rocks it
straight from my heart
My jam is sure to hit the top of the charts
Ram is my sign hes different from all kinds
Rock you all of the time just form a single line
A lot of MCs like to talk bout they self
A firstgrade topic I think you need help
How many time on one album can you say youre def
Im baaaad  Yo punk save your breath
Thats weak shit from a weak mind
And a weak mind creates weak rhymes
You aint never kicked knowledge one time
Just livin on your own dick  thats a crime 
Homeboy why dont you talk about somethin
You just talkin loud and sayin nothin
And if you get mad sorry brother
And when youre in LA watch your colors
Im a MD but no medical doctor
MicDominator DonaldD has got you
Comin to the jamboree to hear the poetry
And when you break north the melody
Stick to your mind like paste it cant be erased
Face to face I overpower like bass
To the climax I dont carry a sax
I carry a axe to tax and wax those who rap


Born in Brooklyn crib West Coast
MCs I toast you that talk most
Trash noise cant throw get with it
Comin from the mouth of HenGee from the Syndicate
Ballers mafia down to throw
Gangsters convicts throwin solid blows
Start prayin your sisters Im layin
Im HenGee a Spinmaster hear what Im sayin
Party on the dancefloor 
Evil Es in the place 
Doggin the wax 
An organization alliance no duplication
Rhyme Syndicate a strong creation
The Syndicates stronger day by day
12gauge leave suckers brutally
Layin in a   
Your lines are thin HenGee came to win
Dont talk a bunch just known to crunch
My onetwo punch will put your butt out to lunch
Fullcourt pressures what Im applyin
No relyin on the next man roar like a lion
Flexin plexin ultra the Bronx is my culture
Strikin hard like a vulture
Flingin Im slingin my hammer like Thor
No singin bringin it raw to the core
Shogun assassin maxin in a limousine
You stick your head in out comes the guillotine
the game as I kick it
Dont miss it get with it
Diss it youre a knucklehead evicted
From the crowd thats proud to be the Syndicate connection
Respect mandatory up is the direction
I stand alone one man thats true
But you my crew youre on my side
Were on a ride
Power and pride is our gift
And youre down with
The Syndicate
