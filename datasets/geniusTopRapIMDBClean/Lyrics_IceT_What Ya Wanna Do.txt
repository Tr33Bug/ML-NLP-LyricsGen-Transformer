Yo Yo MC Ice on a Syndicate Rhyme spree
You say you wanna be down you gotta talk to me
You wanna get in Put a suckers head out
Sound a little hot for you boy Then toy get out
Syndicate mob aint nothin but hardened crooks
You try to diss your butt is on a meat hook
Want some of me Youre on a mission
Bad move you end up missin
Lets get it straight for the 89 tip
Randy Mac is clockin a stupid grip
On the party track Im cold lampin
But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin
You thought I fell off I aint even slipped
The Mac is cuttin records and punks are gettin ripped
Gangster I am bust the lyrics like a driveby
You wanna sleep Well its lights out beddybye
Notorious Asiatic tough talented
A power entertainer
Catapultin above the top
Nat The Cat too swift to be stopped
Im like Jordan a team player on a solo flight
Lookin down on MCs faces full of fright and fear
I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear
Eureka I just struck a platinum fame
In the game thingsll never be the same
Because money changes everything
Once again comin at you hyper
Donald D the Syndicate Sniper
Boston Strangler Charles Manson
No matter what killer I mention keep dancin
Five Fingers Of Death Fists Of Fury
St Valentines Day Massacre on a jury
Wanna convict me for kickin black on wax
I walk the street with a battle axe
Life aint nothin but a piece of existence
Cause when you die yous a past tense
So I like to live my life like a big carnival
Get drunk act like an animal
I like the rocknroll the funk the jazz and hiphop
Suckers get loud I drop em
I like  Fab Five
Im Bronx Bob bring the beats and Im live
Black stallion knockin on concrete walls
Standin tall rappers in my face they stall
Stutter softer than melted butter
Theres no other word go ask your mother
Hard solid as your city sidewalk
Born in Brooklyn can tell by the way that I walk and talk
Strollin with a slight limp
Flyer than any big city pimp
Gold girls cold cash
On the mic Shaquel Shabazz
Supreme the Lord the God
Down with the Syndicate posse
Its you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect its time to school
Im the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be
I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme thats dope
Cause Im a cliffhanger no I aint a stranger
Yo Im Toddy Tee and Im a Compton banger
Wanted by the FBI for transport of
Sucker MCs across the Syndicate borders
No they cant give me no time cause its my rhyme
Everlast get funky for me one time
Everlast is in effect gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1s 5s 10s and 20s
A 100 gs and Im pullin honeys
Left and right day and night
You gotta see it to believe it its quite a sight
Theyre all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer thats fully equipped
Yall played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beats too fast slow it down or I quit
Im not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead so I pause
I give you 5 4 3 2 1
If that aint enough sit down till were done
Syndicate scorned you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme  ingredients
Black on black while styles 
of brothers thats gotta be
Circlin cyphers into molecules
Takin over your space thats illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break  gotta rap
Syndicate posse growin goin out of control
You say were weak This records shippin gold
Power strength my posse got unity
We stick together and were soon to be
In your town we gonna bring the roof down
IceT and the syndicate underground
No sellouts cause its caps we peelin
Girls we love em and shows we steal em
Knowledge and wisdom its a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know its me
You say Im dope cool it makes sense
I aint conceited Im just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin
The mic the mixer then the show is stolen
The pimp the player hustler ass kicker
Watch your girl cause I stick her
Nat The Cat my man will rap when Im playin the back
Some think my stage presence is low I think its loud
Enough to see me flowin and showin
Go psycho breakin backs like bolo
Give me the mic a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand I kill ya like a hitman
And come out kickin with the 
Rockin on a rappin rampage
In control of the stage
Theres a mouse in my house so I bought a cat
The cat ran away so now theres a rat
Im on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rat brought many others back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But nowadays I dont know how to act
So now I feed the rats crack
Back and Im statin the fact
I know youre waitin for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob a Bronx  Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and tizzy to the file
79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey yo icecube chillin
Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin
Impressionalist not a ventriloquist
Dont hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my nine when I aim I dont miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin
On my tip when on the radio my records be rockin
Dont come frontin askin me for a pound
If yall aint invited means you simply aint down
Wake up its time to be noticed
Ima do this Im gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicates in the house lets get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicates chilllin out tonight
They let me loose and now its war
Bust the mix and let the rhymes roar
Grab a partner and hit the dance floor
Cause Im back to rock for you once more
I dont worry about what he said or she said
As long as whats saidsaid is donedone in my bed
The Juvenile Committees on my side
And Im kickin knowledge on a natural high
And Im feeling strong
Yo take this mic and get the party on
This is mortal combat there aint no comeback
Youre tryin to get with me but you dont know where Im at
Cause in this world theres no bombs or guns
Just a microphone metaphors words and puns
Sentences and phrases no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War Ill take the floor even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar
Are yall set all prepared to start
Move in close cause here comes the dope part
By the way Im the Taste if tracks
Could talk but they  but here go the facts
Brace yourself you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan cause were about to trip
Bass reflex the kicks that drive divide
The weak from the rest  cant survive
Syndicates housin all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorant pop thats ignorant listen
Divine is  no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
Cause Im the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack  stylistic black
The reason were bustin these raps are what
To make all you wack MCs shut up
Youre always buyin rap records jammin def beats
Then dissin rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yoursll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see disrespect is your last resort
Youre like Howard Cosell you never played this sport
But youre always talkin mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
Were the MCs that cold be doggin the mic
You may be good but theres no one better
We rock you so cold you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon
Yeah Rhyme Syndicate we in here
We tossin it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin it up you know what Im sayin 
Kid Jazz and Bango couldnt be here
But we gon to it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are youre a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set
And the one and only DJ EvilE we in here
Yo we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and ABC ya
