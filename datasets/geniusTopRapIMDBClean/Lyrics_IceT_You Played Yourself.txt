This is it dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers youve lost cause players youre not gangstas you aint
Youre faintin punk if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo the pusher the player the pimp gangsta the hustler
High Roller dead pres folder
Is cold lampin like a black king on a throne
Evil Eturn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin tape
Another album to make Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science Youre dumb
Stupid ignorant dont even talk to me
At school you dropped Math Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing you got heart
To perpetrate youre bait so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now why not
You start to sweat and fret it gets hot
Howd you get into this spot
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
Im no authority but I know the DEAL
When it comes to dealin with the females
What you got they want cash is what they need
Slip sucker and theyll break you with speed
But you meet a freak you try to turn her out
Spendin moneys what Im talkin about
But you fool out your pockets got blew out
And after the date no boots you got threw out
Mad and shook cause your ducats got took
Call her up phones off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip
You cant buy no relationship
You played yourself
Yo homeboy you played yourself
Im in the MC game a lot of MCs front
And for the money theyre sell out stunts
But they claim that theyre rich and that they keep cash
Yo let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin bout gold
You better double that then double that again
And still dont get souped my friend
You think youve made it youre just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny fans
But you diss em cause you think youre a star
That attitude is rude you wont get far
Cause theyll turn on you quick youll drop like a brick
Unemployments where youll sit
No friends cause you dissed em too
No money no crew youre through


You played yourself
Thats right you played yourself
You played yourself
Yo yo you played yourself
You got problems you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent trying to scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count FiveOs
Lyin and cheatin everybody youre beatin
Dirty clothes and youre skinny cause you havent been eatin
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robberysmooth
But everything went wrong somebody got shot
You couldnt get away the cops roll youre popped
And now youre locked yo lampin on Death Row
Societys fault No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool Fool
You played yourself
You played yourself
Aint nobody elses fault you played yourself
