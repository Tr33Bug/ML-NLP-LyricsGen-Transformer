TrapGold
I got twenty racks on my new jeans
I got ten more in my blue jeans
I walk in and I turn up pimp tight like Im permed up
I heard broke bitches talkin like they rollin like us
Man these bitches sound shermed up
And these bitches be mad at us cause these bitches so down to fuck
Claim that shit I can bang that shit
Fuck me fuck a team Imma train that bitch
I hope you aint wife that bitch
Cause I know a couple homies thatll pipe that bitch
Lifestyle flashy like a Nikon pic
And your bitch chose me cause you walk out with
My ass thick and my drinks mixed say Im sick I say no shit
Better fo drip and thats a fo sip and all my flows is slow piff
Closed case Im killin shit heard your flow Im not feeling shit
My brand right and Im on one and these bitches dont want none
These bitches dont want none 
These bitches dont want none 
I shine bright cause I grind bitches hate I dont mind
My hearts in it Im authentic its clear to see its my time
I shine bright cause I grind bitches hate I dont mind
My hearts in it Im authentic its clear to see its my time
I shine bright cause I grind bitches hate I dont mind
My hearts in it Im authentic its clear to see its my time
I shine bright cause I grind bitches hate I dont mind
My hearts in it Im authentic its clear to see its my time
