Ima make you beg Ima make you beg
Pulled up looking picture perfect baby
High price  Oh  but Im worth it baby

Gettin faded in the European swervin ayy

Hit the stage ass shakin like Im nervous  Shake shake 
When in New York I be parkin right on Madison

Baby ride with me fly living there aint nothing to it
And my waist slim ass fat you gotta have it

Ima make you beg Ima make you beg for it
Ppppussy power pay me by the hour  Right

I tell him if he aint ballin he should hit the showers
If I pick you you lucky baby this money ours   Right 
All yellow gold on me like Im Trinidad  James 
Sittin drop top wondering where the ceilings at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang baby I aint feeling that

That everybody wanna put they hands on me  Ay 
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me wait
I know you like the way I turn it on

Imma make you beg Imma make you beg for it
If you dont do this right youre going home alone
I guess youll have to beg
Imma make you beg Imma make you beg for it

If you want my love make me give a fuck
Make you beg for it Ima make you beg for it
