Ima make you beg Ima make you beg
Pulled up looking picture perfect baby
High price  Oh  but Im worth it baby

Gettin faded in the European swervin ayy

Hit the stage ass shakin like Im nervous  Shake shake 
When in New York I be parkin right on Madison

Baby ride with me fly living there aint nothing to it
And my waist slim ass fat you gotta have it

I tell him if he aint ballin he should hit the showers
If I pick you you lucky baby this money ours   Right 
All yellow gold on me like Im Trinidad  James 
Sittin drop top wondering where the ceilings at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang baby I aint feeling that

See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me wait

If you dont do this right youre going home alone
I guess youll have to beg

Make you beg for it Ima make you beg for it
