Im gonna love ya until you hate me
And Im gonna show ya
Whats really crazy
You shouldve known better than to mess with me harder
Im gonna love ya Im gonna love ya gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow baby
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First were both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we just fucking
Its like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us aint no place in between
Might might be me believing what you say that youll never mean
Like itll last forever but now forever aint as long
If it wasnt for you I wouldnt be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldnt be clearer now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace  Its all over with now 
Im gonna love ya until you hate me  Right 
And Im gonna show ya  Show em what show em what 
Whats really crazy
You shouldve known better
Than to mess with me harder  Its all over with now 
Im gonna love ya Im gonna love ya gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow baby
Black black widow baby
Im gonna llllove you until it hurts
Just to get you Im doing whatever works
You aint never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
Thatll bring you to your knees praise Jesus hallelujah
Ima make you beg for it plead for it
Til you feel like you breathe for it
Til youll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it wake up and dream for it
Til its got you gasping for air and you lean forward
Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And its nothing but me on it  On it on it 
Now its me time believe that
If its yours and you want it I want it promise I need that
Til Im everywhere that you be at I cant fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I dont want shhh
You used to be thirsty for me  Right 
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace  Its all over with now 
Im gonna love ya until you hate me  Right 
And Im gonna show ya  Show em what show em what 
Whats really crazy  Oh 
You shouldve known better than to mess with me harder
Im gonna love ya Im gonna love ya gonna love ya
Gonna love ya like a black widow baby
Black black black black widow baby
