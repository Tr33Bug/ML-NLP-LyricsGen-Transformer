Scalez thats a Scalez track
Ayy tell em run it back

Paid for this body and none of its cheap
I heard your song now Im goin to sleep
Boys in my yard but this aint from Kelis
Look at my cars you see nothin on lease
Look Im showin my cards how I play with a King
Heard they was sleepin Im breakin the dream
Closin a deal while you makin a meme
Superstar status I stay in the Hills
Light hundred thousand to play in some heels
Festival season Im out in Brazil
See that Im hot and I aint got no chill uh yeah
Mercedes the Benz and I park on the curb
Your man wanna pitch but Im tossin a curve
The way that I live you might call it absurd
I got it
All I got is these racks in my pocket
Stick my tongue out Im feelin erotic
Hear my accent he think Im exotic
And still I got it
Hands all over my body
Hands all up in his wallet
Baddest bitch up in the party
For real I got it
All I got is these racks in my pocket
Stick my tongue out Im feelin erotic
Hear my accent he think Im exotic
And still I got it
Hands all over my body
Hands all up in his wallet
Baddest bitch up in the party
Im showin my cards how I play with a King
Heard they was sleepin Im breakin the dream
Closin a deal while you makin a meme
Superstar status I stay in the Hills
