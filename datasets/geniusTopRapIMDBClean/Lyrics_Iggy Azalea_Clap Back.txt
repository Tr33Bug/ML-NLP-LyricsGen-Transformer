They call me racist
Only thing I like is green and blue faces
None of my exes could say that Im crazy
We not the same baby you shop at Macys
Take a pic and then go say that we date
If they dont got a story I swear they gon make it
No more questions I aint giving no statements
The shots I send back do not come with a chaser
Heard em say that I got dropped from the label
But that did not happen please stop all that capping
Im clapping Im off now I own all my masters
My downfall they pray on that shit like a pastor
I love all my haters Im being sarcastic
I left but Im bout to bounce back like elastic
Fuck all these other bitches Im the baddest
From now on you can call me Iggy the savage
Cause I talk like this and my ass fat
They be saying Iggy tryna act black
Hatin broke hoes get laughed at
All they do is cap like snapbacks
He hit me up he said he having flashbacks
Youre my ex for a reason I dont backtrack
Gimme 50 feet bitch back back
