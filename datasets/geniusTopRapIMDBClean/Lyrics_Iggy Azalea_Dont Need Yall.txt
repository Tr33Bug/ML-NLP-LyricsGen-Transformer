I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money that we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that its too much on ya
But think what Id be doing if this wasnt going on
So I just keep pushing when Im being pulled in every direction
Now Im popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord if you hear me I dont need not a new friend near me
Cause I dont want none of that fake love
Cause how Im looking at it all of that be made up
I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still aint forget the times when I didnt have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
Thats when I took time and I figured it out
Id rather deal with the stressing more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadnt seen
Talking bout no money no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldnt stand me
Now we talking bout VMAs and a Grammy
But in due time turn nothing into something
So now I need money put it all in my discussions


I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall
And if you wasnt here when I was down
Then you wont be here when Im up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Aint it funny how this life thing works
When you think its finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I cant even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high
I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall
