But aint no returnin the favor
When you get done put your name on this waiver
Makin a statement bout how you ate this
Banana pudding and vanilla wafer
Im givin it to you no chaser
But this Meow be wet on the rocks
Iggy do fades and braids it really dont matter
This pussy gone drip on them locks
That Hello Kitty no pencil pouch
This pussy neat like its stenciled out
I got his tongue shinin call him Mr Clean
Its like Listerine when he rinse it out
Got these girls callin on missions now
And they say they mad cause they missin out
But Im verifyin his face card
And he say he love it when he kiss it now

Jumping out the gym like a motherfucking Laker ho
Do me one favor dont do me no favors
And I get 380 every time he 360
Got my old dude calling

Started in the A then he licked me to the Bay
Pit stop in Texas slow it up drank
Asking Baby how it taste I bet it taste good
I be cooling out on Slauson I bet it taste hood
Got me like Yeah Im Gucci FeFerragamo and Louis
No department stores Im in boutiques
If it aint high class it dont suit me
Got that bubblicious that chewy
Make your man act like a groupie
You like fruit Then imagine Im smoothie
Pussy monster give me that Tunechi
Said he wanna blow fish Im hootie
Fofofollow my legs to my booty  Booty 
Self sufficient I do me  Do me 
Broke hoes think Im bougie  Bougie 
Moody  Moody 
Who me  Who me 
Wild and unruly
So I drop the top on that twoseat
While his tongue roll on my tootsie
Im looking up North while you touching down South  Mwah 
Im saying where I want it so you takin it out
