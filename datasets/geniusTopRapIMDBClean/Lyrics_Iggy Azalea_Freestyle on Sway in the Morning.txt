You got a house on a hill
Sits in the valley
Said he tryna move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride cuz I dont want us overlappin
She spendin money on MAC thats cute
I get checks from them in Paris
Better check my tax bracket
What you think was gon happen
Naggin now hes leavin
And yall broke up like madmen
These exes excessively hatin on the next bitch
She no house wife just desperate
And I know you tryna let it go but accept it
Cuz the whole world is watchin
And the paparazzi is flockin
And we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down yo party
Man his and her gold chains
Gold watches everything
His old girl she gon hate she gon have somethin to say
When I hop out his new whip fresh in some new shit
Damn she is too thick who is this
Yeah Im his new bitch
