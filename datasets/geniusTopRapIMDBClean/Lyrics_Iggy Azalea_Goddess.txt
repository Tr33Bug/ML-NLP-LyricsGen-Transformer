Aint this what yall need me for
You done pissed me off what is yall leaving for
Oh what A white girl with a flow aint been seen before
Bow down until your knees get sore
Treat Neimans like a grocery store
And Selfridges get the same rapport
Ask Bey when we off on tour
Hopping out a fly whip screaming This aint yours
How famous can one get fore she get tired
One phone call that make all the money get wired
Uh spit fire thatll burn down an empire
20 deep in the Sprinter tryin the Benz tires
Wave hello when I breeze by ya
Make enough in ten months I could live off or retire  woo 
But I just wont quit
Tryna figure out which part of this you just dont get huh
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Goddess got it
Same critics wondered if I had it in me
Now want me to play friendly
But how the hell you play friendly when the mention of my name could cause a media frenzy
The cameras flash everywhere make it hard to miss me
Lately I been crazy tell a psych ward commit me
After any competition coming up against me
You think its anything better then come convince me
Until then Ill be leading the race
So bow down put your knee to your face
While I make wine outta water turn rappers into martyrs
Set it off whenever IGG in the place uh
Young rapper Goddess yall a boring read like Rappers Digest
I could never see you fall like I skip through August
Im thinkin bout now would be the time to start this
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess


Put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
They wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die
Put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
They wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Goddess got it
