Life been crazy all advice has been to chill more
Ironic I been livin off what people down to kill for
And I find no comfort in numbers knowin theres always a mill more
Fact was that cat dragged my pretty ass right on the top of that billboard
And all of my folks who done been here from jump you the ones Ima cover the bill for
And as I get ill more we gon triple the order of champagne and spill more
Lets handle the real score been wonderin what the public got a feel for
So lets keep it real yall you know Im killing game soon as I step on the field yall
The top where Im at now theres no turning back now
I wont ever back down they feel me like they givin Iggy a patdown
I needed a moment I found it lately Ive been on my runnin the town shit especially walkin around with
This heavy crown
You cant always please the crowd
But I am still not bowin down
This heavy crown
It comes and goes around
And when its time Ill pass it proud
But bitch I got it now
So keep it cute chick and dont be hatin on the new chick
Go back and check the stats and bet they let you know I dos this
Glasses full or empty dependin on point of view chick
If you was mad before I bet you hate me for this new shit
Maybe you should watch what you got comin out your two lips
Get cool with how I kick it or else you gon get the boot bitch
Iggy AZA AKA captain of the cruise ship
Dont penny pinch I promise baby I dont need your two cents
Get rid of the makeup let em see just who you is
But if you feel like that girl bless your heart go get it how you live
When you hear my name you gotta know that shes somethin regal
Im one of one aint no sequels when wearin
This heavy crown
You cant always please the crowd
But I am still not bowin down
This heavy crown
It comes and goes around
And when its time Ill pass it proud
But bitch I got it now
