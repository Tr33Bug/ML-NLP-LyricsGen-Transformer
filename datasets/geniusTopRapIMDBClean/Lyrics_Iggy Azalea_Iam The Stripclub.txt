Hit it one time two times Too live
Laying poolside and it made me woosah
Too fine do ya own thing Ima do mine
Im on Cloud 9 cause the vibe too high
Fat ass lap dance pop it on a handstand
Big bags big cash
Hit a hundred car fast dont crash
If you aint ready dont ask
Talk a big game but I know you wont last
Keep the dollars on me keep designer on me
Man start trippin Ima find a homie
Swear he Ginuwine tryna ride the pony
Face get exposed you cant hide the phoney you know
Top of the line bitch numero uno
New coupe two door two high Pluto
Trippin said he wanna kick it like judo
Miss him Iggy been pimpin listen
Dont need dark rooms  I am the strip club 
Dont need red lights  I am the strip club 
I do the lap dance  I ride the pole up 
I am the the strip club
Dont want your love dont want your problems
Just need all of all of your dollars
I do the lap dance I ride the pole up
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club

I woke up like a badass bitch
Pretty face with some perfect tits
Called my job told em suck my dick
Send my cheque Im not clockin in
Dick magnet whos askin
Big Birkin put cash in
Hold my bag Im bout to get ratchet
Get ghost and twerk on a Phantom
Like when girls come back from vacation
Brand new ass she use to get payments
Use her mouth for more than just statements
Wanna be rich she dont wanna be famous
Run it back yeah lets do it over
Wanted dick but I lost composure
2PM on the Rum and Cola
Sloppy drunk but I do it sober


Dont need dark rooms  I am the strip club 
Dont need red lights  I am the strip club 
I do the lap dance  I ride the pole up 
I am the the strip club
Dont want your love dont want your problems
Just need all of all of your dollars
I do the lap dance I ride the pole up
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
Dont wait for the night time  No 
We can get dirty in the daylight  Go 
Watch sweat drip from my waistline  Oh 
Four shots deep its playtime  Yeah 
Dont need dark rooms  I am the strip club 
Dont need red lights  I am the strip club 
I do the lap dance  I ride the pole up 
I am the the strip club
Dont want your love dont want your problems
Just need all of all of your dollars
I do the lap dance I ride the pole up
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
I am the the strip club
