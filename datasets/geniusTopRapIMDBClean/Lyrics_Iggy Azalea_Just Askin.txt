Wassup in your world
And are you still coolin with that lame girl
I aint a hater it dont matter though
I kept it cool but you made me wanna slap a ho
I look good what does she have
I was down no knee pads
Look this kinda sound like a poem
If you relate then point em out if you know em
Hey boy hush that I remembered joyriding on your mustache
You was hanging so hard you nearly lost that
Little trick you like to do yeah I taught that
I got a brand new man and a brand new place
If you played your cards right you coulda had that space
Im alright and Imma play it cool
I cant cook but I made a plate for you
You wanted something more than what we had
Whats up with her She aint all that
Im not trippin on what coulda been
I know its kinda weird Im just askin
Just askin
I know its kinda weird Im just askin
I just happened to run into you and I noticed your reaction
You couldnt say shit I read your caption
She a onehit wonder and you missin my classics
Damn thats tragic I would hate to be you
Tell the truth she could never be me
I got a new man with a few new bands
Give me what I want and he got that D
I got a brand new man and a brand new place
If you played your cards right you coulda had that space
Im alright and Imma play it cool 3089451
