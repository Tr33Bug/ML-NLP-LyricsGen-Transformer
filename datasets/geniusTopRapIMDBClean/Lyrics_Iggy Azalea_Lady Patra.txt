No pussy can come in our place

And act like them dont know where we from

Ya dont know how we a gwan and kick up

Paper planes roger that 104
Got money been had it still gettin more
Oh yall in the building but on different floors
Yall couldnt see it how we see it on yo tippietoes
Iggy so killing so pretty still pretty
Talkin hits on hits McGuire Bonds Griffey
Mash it up bring the queens of the dancehall with me
Pearl handle on the pistol tell this world to come and get me
And Im thumbin through designers to pick whichll fit me proper
Paid dues climbed through the ranks but we aint Shabba
Need me a rude boy something straight outta shottas
That could drive a girl crazy all the way off my rocker
Versaces over eyelids lookin like Biggie Poppa
Know they thought I wouldnt make it Im lookin like whats the matta
But tell them money talks and them man not saying nada
This the new classic signed sincerely Lady Patra
