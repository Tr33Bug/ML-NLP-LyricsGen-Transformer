He got a house thats too big sits on a hill in the valley
Said he trying to move on with life but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride cause I dont want us overlapping
Spendin money on Mac thats cute I get checks from them in Paris
Better check my tax bracket what you think was gon happen
Naggin now hes had it and yall fell off like Mad Men
These exes excessively hatin on the next bitch
Shes no housewife just desperate
I know its hard to let go but accept it
Cause the whole world is watchin
And the paparazzi is flockin
Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
His and her gold chains
Gold watches everything
His old girl she gon hate
And they gon have something to say
When I hop out his new six fresh in some new shit
Damn she is too thick who is this
Yeah Im his new bitch yep Im his new bitch yep
And Im spending his new cash few trips new bags
Damn she is too bad oh you mad
That Im his new bitch yeah
Im his new bitch yeah
She be the one that be like
Hey girl whats up You in town
Yes Im in town kissing  on the face and you know this
So just say it
Its always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes
But Im a debut you a deja vu
Girl you know the drill I got a couple loose screws
Driving riding all black suits
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew
And what I do it cant be compared
You well done and bitch Im rare
So stop popping up unexpected
Stop sending threats and text messages
We too grown for this messy shit
Thisll be my last conversation
If you dont want no problems move yourself from the equation
Cause the whole world is watchin
And the paparazzi is flockin
Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
His and her gold chains
Gold watches everything
His old girl she gon hate
And they gon have something to say
When I hop out his new six fresh in some new shit
Damn she is too thick who is this
Yeah Im his new bitch yep Im his new bitch yep
And Im spending his new cash few trips new bags
Damn she is too bad oh you mad
That Im his new bitch yeah
Im his new bitch yeah
Tell your friends to tell their friends too
He got a new chick but it aint you  What 
Im just saying you know its true
Cry a river and swim on through
I know you hoping we wont make it
Clyde and Bonnie let the world chase us
Ride or die where the world takes us
If we end up poor or rich and famous
Im all he needs and more chick
His home chick his tour chick
His 4th finger left hand chick
And all those people go Damn chick
When I hop out his new six fresh in some new shit
Damn she is too thick who is this
Yeah Im his new bitch yep Im his new bitch yep
And Im spending his new cash few trips new bags
Damn she is too bad oh you mad
That Im his new bitch yeah
Im his new bitch yeah
