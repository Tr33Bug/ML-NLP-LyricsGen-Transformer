You used to be everything now that mean nothing
Thought this was poker with the cards up but we were bluffing
I miss you but pride wont let me tell you
Thought that we had all the time
But Im guessing that plans fell through
Yeah we fell off I wont ask you to climb back
I paid twenty for that Rolly I just want my time back
Was wrong too but I see it now that you dont give a damn
I got you tatted you took off before the ink dried on my hands
I was down to give you the world instead you gave me hell
I lied tried to be perfect and I played myself
And it hurts so bad we coulda worked on that
Cause you say you love me but real love dont work like that
The truth is I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to dadate you
Rolexs dont ticktock
But damn it baby my time costs
And damn it baby my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it baby my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost
Say that you love me I say that youre lying
Cause I said we could work on it you said lets leave it behind
Couldnt put together the picture I paint in my mind
So how I see you now insulting me is wasting my time
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
Cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before
Another hard lesson stressing taking personal notes
Remember sweet nothings like baby whats the purpose in those
Both of us saying it shouldnt have went like that
But sometimes in love it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong wed get right back
You know Cupids got another arrow and shit like that
And for all of yall watching I hope that this entertain you
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you
Cause Im still here laughing when it get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to dadate you


Rolexs dont ticktock
But damn it baby my time costs
And damn it baby my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it baby my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost
Rolexs dont ticktock
But damn it baby my time costs
And damn it baby my time is money
So I need payback for all the time lost
I need payback for all the time lost
Said I need payback for all the time lost
Damn it baby my time costs
So I need payback for all the time lost
