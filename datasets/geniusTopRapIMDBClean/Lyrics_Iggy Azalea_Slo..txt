Slo Lyrics
You once said I hate to throw the old quotation back at you that you thought it would be nice to a machine
Well I I still wanna be
Do you believe in feelings and emotions
Well no I dont but I have them I wish I I wish I didnt
But youd like to get rid of them all together wouldnt you
Uh it would be a good idea yeah
When Im alone I check the time
I hit you up youre on my mind
You love the light the fast life
Fuck that though
Id rather go slo
Used to be happy but now shits unpredictable
I smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though
You fucked her on my birthday and thats what really hurt the most
You tell the truth half way guess thats why this unfixable
But still 
When Im alone I check the time
I hit you up youre on my mind
You love the light the fast life
Fuck that though
Id rather go slo yeah
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
When I call sometimes I wish you pick up
But most days the call is declined
Its okay I dont give a fuck
You outta sight so you outta mind
Im doing alright know Ima be fine
I gotta few candidates standing in line
Broke up before but I wasnt like this
Not many regrets I wish I could rewind
Damn We both got our lives so its no surprise
The schedules conflict and we cant coincide
My hearts cold feels like I got no insides
We rushed it to the finish line we should have took our time
You make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements
Cant even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it
If I could try this shit again Real shit Id probably do it
Thats why its hard to act like you someone Im really through with


When Im alone I check the time
I hit you up youre on my mind
You love the light the fast life
Fuck that though
Id rather go slo yeah
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
When Im alone I check the time
I hit you up youre on my mind
You love the light the fast life
Fuck that though
Id rather go slo yeah
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
Id rather go slo
