Can I help you
You wanna buy some ignorant art Ten bucks apiece
No I think its ok
Of course Mr Bischofberger
Gee ignorant art
Yeah you know like  stupid ridiculous crummy art
Ohhh That sounds good
Ten bucks
Gee you didnt work very much on these
All I hear is bitches aint shit
All men are liars
You can only trust yourself
And oh that weed is fire
It cant last forever
True love died in 96
There is nothing left now
Replace hearts with business
Damn well
Without meaning to seems I
Think I met someone
But he aint really my type shit
He only 21
His fingers do the talking
Where hes from will be his coffin
Every time his homeboy drive me round think I might die on Slauson
But I still wanna keep him
Cook him breakfast in the mornings
We havent even kissed yet
But that just make me want him more
Plus he love his mama yep
He a family man
And even though the ratchets love him
I still think he a gentleman
Oh oh oh
Lifes a trip and baby you the plane
And Im just tryin get a seat next to you to stay
Put his fear in his nose
Why he do that I dont know
I lost a couple friends to that
So I hope he is in control
Every time he swear he gonna stop
But I know that he wont wish
I could be the only angel he need to be strong
This could be dangerous
Man I got a lot at stake
I aint even graduate
So I dont have room for mistakes
No oh oh oh
Lifes a trip and baby you the plane
Im just tryin get a seat next to you to stay
Yes I am yes I would
When For good For you For ever
All my friends think that Im crazy
They tell me I could do better
Fuck all that boo
Its you that Im trying to get to heaven with
They say that youre a hindrance
But I think that you give me wings
They say hes no item Please dont like him
He dont wife em he one nights em
But I dont give a fuck if my friends dont like him
I dont give a f
They say hes no item Please dont like him
He dont wife em he one nights em
But I dont give a fuck if my friends dont like him
I dont give a fuck if my friends dont like him
