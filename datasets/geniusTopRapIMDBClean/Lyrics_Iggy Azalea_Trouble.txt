Right I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cause most guys only want one thing
But Im undecided tryna figure out if thats you
Either way though I think youre worth a test drive
Cause  Ooh  youre so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign
Dont you come here thinkin you ballin  Oh nah 
Aint down for it you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean smells like trouble to me
Opposites attract I guess this is that
Good girl bad guy what a perfect match
And if we  Ooh  youre gon want to pay back tithes
Cause when you finish you gon feel like you was baptized
See baby now you fiendin for a test drive
Cause you dont wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign
Dont you come here thinkin you ballin  Oh nah 
Aint down for it you seem like trouble to me

And you turn up so fresh and clean smells like trouble to me
