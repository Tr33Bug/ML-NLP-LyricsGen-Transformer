Look let me make something abundantly clear for people that are so bereft of activities they feel like they gotta comment on every one of mine
First of all being a vegetarian should never be associated with being a revolutionary or being openmindedthats a dietary choice
If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance were supposed to be fighting by thinking that youre just fuckin yourself
I dont go around promoting beef and poultry shoving it in peoples faces I dont castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches and I would never diss someone for being a fuckin broccoli head or living off radishes or eating grass with tofu
I like a lot of vegan cuisine but the illogicality of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea of what being healthy is is just preposterous
Ive seen some of you herbivores and if you wanna argue health yall need to eat some kind of supplement because some of yall are so skinny that its disgusting
Lookin like the only hip hop motherfuckas on Schindlers list
Being a malnutrition ass got nothing to do with being revolutionary or being on point
Ill be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me
You know I dont eat pork not cause Im a MuslimI just dont really like it but I really will fuck a bird up and fish is good when that shit is fresh
Its like my nigga Vast Aire from Can Ox said If you dont like the smell of burning meat then get the fuck off the planet
You know I dont criticize people for eating moss
And dont open your fuckin mouth about my food man
I like beef and broccoli motherfucka
Mind your goddamn business
Matter of fact you know what Im out
I feel like asome arroz con pollo a banana daiquiri and a motherfuckin bistec empanado
