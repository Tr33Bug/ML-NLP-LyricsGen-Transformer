Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day man
Its like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what Im sayin Its wild
Listen
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
I pledge no allegiance nigga fuck the Presidents speeches
Im baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drownin you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Actll track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you and say you was tryna sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas that show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians fake politicians
Look at they mansions and look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen but they dont really tell you they mission
They funded alQaeda and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 911 Thats just scratchin the surface
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers


They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But thats bullshit Ill show you why its totally wrong
Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight
Itd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights
I wouldnt be fightin for Bush or White Americas dream
Id be fightin for my peoples survival and selfesteem
I wouldnt fight for racist churches from the South my nigga
Id be fightin to keep the occupation out my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you and was rapin your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit after Ronald Reagans election
Mercenary contractors fightin a new era
Corporate military bankin off the war on terror
They controllin the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryin to distract the fact that they engineerin the crack
So Im strapped like Lee Malvo holdin a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and I dont mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas that support you and like you
Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This aint no alien conspiracy theory this shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal
I dont rap for dead presidents
Id rather see the President dead
Its never been said but I set precedents
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth nigga
Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you nigga
Tell the truth nigga
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the Towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
