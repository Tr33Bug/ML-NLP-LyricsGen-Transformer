They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors in the Childrens Hospital
But I never lose hope success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shapin the nation like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So Im focused on my economic situation
Im like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science but they dont know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
Its funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out Freedom at last
The cold war is over but the world is still gettin colder
Atlas walkin through the projects with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then a general will decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personalitys split
Like the Black Panthers into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit but now I sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous and it murders the soul
Spreadin like a virus runnin rampant out of control
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else
Immortal Technique in the streets back on the hustle
Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin cracks in a duffle
Upstate behind steel gates attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils hacked through your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And its the lawyers not the inmates schemin to fuck you
Tryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you
But thats what you get when you put a corporation above you
And its the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die you find yourself cursin their ghost
But you make success nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take
Since prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes
And thats the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car rims and your ice
Cause even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But Im going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semiautomatic barrages that empty the cartridge
Posttraumatically scarred kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility addicted to greed
Beatin their girl purposefully losin a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive


So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else
I used to wonder about people who dont believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin ourselves
I used to wonder about people who dont believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin ourselves
I used to wonder echo
