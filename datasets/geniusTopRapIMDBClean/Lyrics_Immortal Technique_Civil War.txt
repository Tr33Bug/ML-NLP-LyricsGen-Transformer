Like anybody I would like to live  a long life longevity has its place
But Im not concerned about that now
I just want to do Gods will
And Hes allowed me to go up to the mountain
And Ive looked over
And Ive seen the Promised Land
I may not get there with you
But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land
So Im happy tonight
Im not worried about anything Im not fearing any man
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
And its hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But its harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically runnin from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South I respect they vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of Americas vision
They want us dancin coonin and hollerin
Only respect us for playin sports and modelin
More than racism its stay in your placeism
More people are trapped in practical blackfaceism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
Its between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Crip niggas Blood niggas eses Asians
Why the fuck we warrin with each others population
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans hatin on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other straight hatin
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness inwhat Im sayin
You gotta recognize another G aint the enemy
When the police ride and kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets we should really end war
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Our hearts were torn apart just like yall was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us ask if were jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of selfdefense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom justice security
But theyre only pure when theyre applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Urgently puttin fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qurans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me my wife and babies we aint never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesnt come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you Civil war
