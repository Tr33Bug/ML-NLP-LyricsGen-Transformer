Danger Beat Bandits nigga
Yeah Harlem to Chicago to LA to Toronto
Philly motherfuckin Rio De Janeiro nigga
Cape Town South Africa
I never make songs to disrespect women
Or to judge people about the way that they livin
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys losin my religion
I used to be a Christian and a political pawn
The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you tellin me bout makin a song
Come in the studio and tell me that Im makin it wrong
Pissed off cause reality is makin us strong
Like the ghost of Timothy McVeigh makin a bomb
Ayo Marvin Gaye what the fuck is goin on
These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
But its the Gong Show amateur night at the Apollo
My dick is like my music but harder to swallow
So children follow me like the Pied Piper
And sing the chorus in the air with your blunt and your lighter
Sing that shit nigga right now
You played yourself thinkin you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
You played yourself thinkin that you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
Yeah yeah
The second verse is worse than the first in this respect
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed you aint fuckin shit to me
And underground labels know that I dont trust you
You only independent til you major so fuck you
And if youre pissed off cause you think that I dissed you
Ill rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue
Dance with the Devil remember that youre not on my level
Stupid youre not ready
I won Disypher Bragging Rights from Rocksteady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And Ill still murder rappers on the street for sport
Doctor Guillotine cuttin you short little man
But you dont give me props cause I never won at Scribble Jam
Well fuck you I hope someone you love dies
So fuck your crew And fuck your family too
Technique said it bitch what the fuck you gon do
You played yourself thinkin you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
You played yourself thinkin that you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
Yeah wrap it up on these niggas man
Wrap it up yeah
Immortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag
I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelry in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers
House niggas get your head severed tryna be thug
You dont concern me Im tryin to hurt the people you love
Word of mouth is Im in the club bein sneaky
Im like the body snatchers and your girl is gettin sleepy
I murder you indiscreetly right at the source
Like the Roman legionnaire that stabbed Christ on the cross
This is about you though it aint about Jesus
And you shouldnt fuckin talk about telekenesis
Nigga please movin shit with your mind
Try movin your moms out the projects with your rhymes
And next time Im comin after cualquiera
Profanity fuckin carajo maldita mierda
Roll up the hierba y pasala para la izquierda
Put the price up to listen to me pop shit
Cause I got Martha Stewart givin me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbuscom nigga fuckin your bitch
Yeah played yourself nigga fuck all yall
You dont know shit about me
Why open your mouth and discuss who the fuck I am
I thought I told yall niggas on Volume 1
I wasnt fuckin around you just slept
Cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
When niggas would buy anything on the shelf
Those days are through and you are through with them
