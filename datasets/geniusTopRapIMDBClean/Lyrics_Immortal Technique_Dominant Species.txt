Yo in a hundred years from now
Everyone whos living on this planet will be dead
So its inconsequential really all the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
Its more important what what youre ready to build
What youre ready to pass down to your children
What youre ready to create
You better fuckin remember that
When you challenge a motherfucker like me
Remember Im the dominant species
Im stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socioeconomic
Neurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war and every days a battle to me
Im on the brink of insanity
Between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spittin out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupiditys not allowed by me cause I dont got time to play
Im the black hole lyricist thatll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
Im the Technique and youre nobody so what you tryna say
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
18 billion tons per square inch confinement
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
Im the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
Yo yo lyrically Im infinite like possibilities
But you dont have the capability like infertility
Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like tryin to contradict the theory of relativity
What I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me like the bitch in Misery
But break out like a father runnin from responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility with brutal instinct
Ill make your whole cypher look like those crackers from NSync
And I dont care about your link or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea Tar Pit thick so dont ever talk shit
And remember somethin nigga while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head but you cant
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
Im the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
Im explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggas are too stupid to understand it like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite Ill make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic
With anything but success when I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with Kaprosis sarcoma coma type sickness
My style is like a tenyearold child with a slit wrist
Too much reality for the fuckin hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist
So you can get dissed even if youre locally gold
Vocally bold or globally multiplatinum sold
Im emotionally cold disciplined and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you Im givin you chills
I drop knowledge while these motherfuckers clumsily spill
And I drop it so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
Im the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
