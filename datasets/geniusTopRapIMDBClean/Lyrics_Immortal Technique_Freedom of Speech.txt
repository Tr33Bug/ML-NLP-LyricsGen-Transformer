Heh heh heh
Freedom of speech motherfucker
I got no strings to hold me down  Okay 
To make me fret or make me frown  Somethin for the kids hahahaha 
I had strings but now Im free
There are no strings on me
Step into the club smoothly with a L in my hand
Bitches know that Im a freak like the Elephant Man
Intelligent plans fuck a record deal
I want development land with my benevolent clan
And thats the reason that I only trust my fam
40000 records sold 400 grand
Fuck a middleman I wont pay anyone else
Ill bootleg it and sell it to the streets myself  Haha 
Id rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
And because of this executives try to diss me  Fuck yall 
Racism frozen in time like Walt Disney
And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors
If I switch up my politics and change my behavior  Huh 
Try to tell me what to rhyme about over the beat
Bitch niggas that never spent a day in the street
But I repeat that nobody can hold my reins
I put the truth on tracks nigga simple and plain
I got no strings so I have fun
Im not tied up to anyone
Theyve got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
I guess to America Im a disaster  Oh no 
A slave that was destined to own his masters
Independent in every single sense of the word
I say what I want you fuckin little sensitive herb
This is America I thought we had freedom of speech
But now you want try to control the way that I speak  What 
And OReilly you think that you a patriot  Yeah right 
You aint nothin but a motherfuckin racist bitch
Full of hatred pressin a button tryin to eject me  Hahaha 
But I aint got no motherfuckin deal with Pepsi
No corporate sponsor tellin me what to do
Askin me to tone it down during the interview  Never 
Tryin to minimize the issue but Im keepin it large
I love the place I live but I hate the people in charge
Speakin is hard when you got strings attached
So Ima say it for you cause I dont got none of that
And if you didnt understand what I spit at your brain
Ayo son let this little nigga explain


I got no strings so I have fun
Im not tied up to anyone
Theyve got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
Come on son yall niggas know the way I do
Immortal Technique dot com live for you
And I know sometimes it be makin you nervous
The way I snatch puppet rappers that belong in a circus
You motherfuckers just cant compare
Lookin for a fanbase thats no longer there
I know that youre scared and youre hidin up in the cut
But this is freedom of speech nigga tell em whats up
Word nigga Fuck John Ashcroft
Nigga fuck Fox News Fuck those snakeass bitches
Tryin to manipulate your opinion tellin you what to think
