And its not smart to be dumb
Its not smart to be dumb
Bumb de dumb dumb dumb
Back where I come from
Its not considered smart to be dumb
Okay little empanada time for bed
Uncle Felipe
What What is it now
I heard that you and my dad used to be in a gang Is that true
Who told you that man Your mother
It wasnt a gang we were just a group of friends
Did you do bad things
No no no look we just used to draw on stuff play karate borrow things throw stuff you know run around at night like Goonies
Whats a Goonie
You never heard of Goonies before
I couldve chose another life with the feds tryna get me
Little kids puttin work in like at Gap and Disney
In the whip high as shit like Bobby and Whitney
Grab your hand and push the motherfuckin pedal to sixty
Harlem cops frisk me to get me to make their quotas
But I told ya Siempre hay que separar las drogas
Bar brawl in the club poppin and rockin jaws
Shot it out leavin bullet holes the size of Matzoh balls
I love thick chicks never fucked with a slim broad
Played soccer and hammered nails into their shin guards
Gambled at cee lo with Dominicans locked in the tombs
We was there for robbin niggas for them Spanish doubloons
Remember Goonieera graffiti of all sorts
Now they wanna foreclose on the hood to build a golf course
Ill put your hand in a blender to make an entre
Then cut your dick off and glue it back on the wrong way
All my revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch numbers never lie
So even if they tell you Im dead Im still alive
Because motherfucker Goonies never die
Witness protection program rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer niggas never slide
So if they tell you Im gone and you safe niggas lied
Because motherfucker Goonies never die


Im a certified Goonie the type to burglarize your crib
And leave it smellin like sour and Afghan gooey
Life is a movie but yours was filmed on a greener screen
I give you pure uncut raw no deleted scenes
War with a broadsword dumpin a TEC9
Slit your throat give you a Colombian necktie
The best buy to get we let die
Let fly the next guy to try some shit
Listen a few words just to describe my clique
We like a gang of Spartans walkin on the Gaza Strip
Never say die its time to fight and we never run
My Goonies rob niggas for jewelry
We call em treasure hunts
Let him front like he a tough guy with me
Ill hit him slug turn him to OneEyed Willy
Watery grave hide your chips
Ill hijack your boat load and cruise away on my pirate ship
All my revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch numbers never lie
So even if they tell you Im dead Im still alive
Because motherfucker Goonies never die
Witness protection program rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer niggas never slide
So if they tell you Im gone and you safe niggas lied
Because motherfucker Goonies never die
Before Duncan Pinderhughes was runnin with Doug E Doug
My team got away with murder we aint fit the bloody glove
Those jungle breeds and we come to feed our hungry cubs
With hoes pullin out our pipes
Like Goonies under country clubs
Let these funny thugs know whoever steps in Bolics spot
Is gettin crushed with solid rock like Chester Copperpot
I suggest the drama stops Ill flood blocks with mustard gas
Youre up shits creek in a rubber raft cut in half
Cross my fuckin path I dare you Ill mangle who lit the fuse
Quick to lose my marbles like Mikey replacin his with jewels
Watchin yall enslave the game Im forced to say the truth
Break the chains quick as Sloth reachin for a Baby Ruth
We got 80 proof and whores in Daisy Dukes extra low
While fat bitches do the truffle shuffle just to get in shows
Fuck what your record sold Respect the code and recognize
The rebel tribe that my people kept alive will never die
All my revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch numbers never lie
So even if they tell you Im dead Im still alive
Because motherfucker Goonies never die
Witness protection program rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer niggas never slide
So if they tell you Im gone and you safe niggas lied
Because motherfucker Goonies never die
