Let me welcome both of you to the show this morning to talk
About what I consider a very very important topic of the Harlem Renaissance
But before we get into that
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people dont own their homes
Cause the racist bank wouldnt fucking mortgage a loan
Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation
Thats not negotiation and its frustrating to look at
Every day like watching a porno on 56k
Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
Whats next motherfucker projects as dorm rooms
You aint fooling nobody in this community duke
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy League real estate firms are corrupt
They lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riffraff
While politicians get the corporate kickback
Harlem Renaissance a revolution betrayed
Modern day slaves thinkin that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood economically
They wanna kill the real Harlem Renaissance
Tryna put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators
When I speak about Harlem I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy and the Bosnian girl
The African of Sudan the people of Kurdistan
The third world American indigenous man
Palestinians Washington Heights Dominicans
Displaced New Orleans citizens
Beach front Brazilian favelas that you livin in
The hood is prime real estate they want back in again
I didnt write this to talk shit I say it because
Some of yall forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution music and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinsons
Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people outta the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
WEB Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey
And we ended up selling out to everybody
The Dutch Schultz and John Gottis
Banksters modern day gangsters
Immobile army
They wanna move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews
With the Alhambra Decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic
When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem
They didnt mean that we had stake in that
They meant to say that they could make money out of us
They are coming in with all kinds of prejudices
In Brooklyn theyre doing the same thing
In Queens theyre doing the same thing
The Bronx theres hardly any place which is affordable
I mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars
How many people in this community make that kind of money
How many people HAVE that kind of money
People of Harlem they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world
Whether the struggle is in Panama in Africa Cuba
We spend money with the wrong people
We are looking for love with people
Who dont love us
Whats wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected
