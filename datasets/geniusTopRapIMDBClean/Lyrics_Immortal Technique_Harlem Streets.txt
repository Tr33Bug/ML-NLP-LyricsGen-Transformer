Yeah Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those motherfuckers runnin away from the Twin Towers
Gunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower
Bowlin For Columbine fear givin the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check constant struggle to make the payments
Workin your whole life wonderin where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multicultural slave ship
Its rush hour 230 to 8 non stoppin
And people comin home after corporate sharecroppin
And fuck flossin Mothers are tryin to feed children
But gentrification is kickin them out of their buildin
A generation of babies born without healthcare
Families homeless thrown the fuck off the welfare
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Homicide Harlemblaow Whats the problem
Its like Cambodia The Killing Fields uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us like a casino
Think about it most of the Army is black and Latino
And if you cant acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb
Tryin to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you cant read history at an illiterate stage
And you cant raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
I give niggas the truth cause their pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But Im sick of feelin impotent watchin the world burn
In the era of apocalypse waitin my turn
Im a Harlem nigga thats concerned with the future
And if youre in my way itd be an honor to shoot ya
Uproot ya with the evil that grows in my people
Makin them deceitful cannibalistic and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust
