The day of the geechee is gone boy
And you goin with it
Yeah nigga
Immortal Technique
Metaphysics
The blingbling era was cute but its about to be done
I leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch
And now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But heres a quotable for every single record exec
Get your fucking hands out my pocket nigga like Malcolm X
But this aint a movie Im not a fan or a groupie and Im not
The type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
No ones as good as methey just got better marketing schemes
Ill lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream
And thats the primary reason that I hate yall faggots
Ive been nice since niggas got killed over 8ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didnt do shit for the sneaker
Im a heatseaker with features thatll reach through the speaker
And murder counterrevolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and forcefeed his kids mercury
ARs tried jerking me thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox
Youre all getting shot you little fucking treacherous bitches
This is the business and yall aint getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke then Im taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga  Industrial revolution
I want fiftythree million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams nigga learn to speak and behave
You want to spend twenty years as a government slave
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a sixbyeight cell alive in the grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club toast the truth  Reach for your glasses
Ill burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casketColombian fashion
Intoxicated off the flow like thugs passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting
Youre better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
Youre better off begging for twenty points from a label
Youre better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique chemically unstable set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code
So if your message aint shit fuck the records you sold
Cause if you go platinum its got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground a general that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers a deal or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets
This is the business and yall aint getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke then Im taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga  Industrial revolution
