The things Ive seen in life will make you choke by surprise
Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened its eyes
Provokin my demise Ill leave your spirit broken inside
Like the feeling of 50 million people hopin youd die
And niggas wonder why my heart is full of hatred and anger
Cause some bitch killed my firstborn son with a coat hanger
I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty and cold
Crippled and worthless so I thought that it could never be sold
My mother told me that placin my faith in God was the answer but then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer
Killin her slow like the Feds did to the Black Panthers
The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
Carefully hidden woven into the holidays of a Christian
I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
And this is prophecy the words that I speak from my lungs
The severed head of John the Baptist speakin in tongues
Like Che Guevara my soliloquies speak through a gun
Pain in slow motion like trees that reach for the sun
Nigga the preachin is done
Cause I dont got a DJ like Reverend Run
I curse the life of any man who kills benevolent ones
I never asked to be the messenger but I was chosen
To speak the words of every African slave dumped in the ocean stolen by America tortured buried and frozen
Written out of the history books your children are holdin
Internally bleedin coldblooded stripped of emotion
I go through the motions but theres no life in my eyes
Its like Im hooked up to a respirator waitin to die
Hooked up to the fuckin chair waitin to fry
Soothin an electrocution currently used in my execution
Producin thoughts at the speed of light burnin confusion
Im losin my sight breathin is tight the evening is white
I made my peace with the Lord and now I stand on his right
Death is a another part of life 
These are my last words Im havin difficulty breathin
Dyin on the inside internally bleedin
Angel of Death draggin me away while Im sleepin
Watchin my world crumble
In front of me searchin for meanin
These are my last words Im havin difficulty breathin
Dyin on the inside internally bleedin
Angel of Death draggin me away while Im sleepin
Watchin my world crumble
In front of me searchin for meanin
