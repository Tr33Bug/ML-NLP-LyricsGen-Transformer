They told me I would never make it I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment but people dont believe it
I guess its hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
Its a dirty game and nobody is willin to clean it
But this is for the paraplegic people dreamin of runnin
Ladies married to men who dont please em dreamin of comin
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when Im gunnin
Some cowards on the Internet didnt think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person cause they stuck in a shell
And couldnt understand the pain of bein stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go if youre not a Christian
Its the failure of your lifes greatest ambition
Its a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I dont see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin the clips at little kids and they moms
Are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanitys gone smoked up in a gravity bong
By a DemocratRepublican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique you never heard me preach in a song
Im not controversial Im just speakin the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since lifes a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny its not written in pages
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our peoples history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept a secret
This is the exodus like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth in your face with the style I run with
Like the Navy missile that shot down Flight 800
Im like the Africans who came here before Columbus
And from the 1500s until after the morrow
I watched Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see the Spaniards never left despus de Colon
And if you dont believe me you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast all of em white
Its like apartheid with 10 percent rulin the rest
That type of stressll make me put the fuckin tool to your chest
Step in my way nigga I wouldnt wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissin drunk with gonorrhea
Ill do a free show in North Korea burnin the flag
While J Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Tryna confuse you makin it hard to follow this
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But thatll never be me cause Im leavin the past
Like an abused wife with the kids leavin your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober leavin the stash
Unbreakable Technique leavin the plane crash
Im out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
Cause Im the only motherfucker that could change my life


Some people think I wont make it but I know that I will
Escape the emptiness cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill I made yall believe it at last
You can make the future but it starts with leavin the past
