Get ya dough watch it go back to the people that holdin some
Basic ancient secrets they keeping its us they stole it from
Peter Joseph told us so only those that seem to know can counteract the status quo balance act which way to go
My RFID CID used by the beast to track you
Yeah charge in the car can cause an alarm
Thats part of the arm that traps you
Now bags you check in you go inside you prepared to fly
Watch for scannin you cannot hide comfortable
You go no matter what you done what treats for sky 
Climbing a tree while Im getting high
That big brother eagle start to die
No matter what degrees they weave and devise a plan to decease all that sees they provide
Waitin for us to breathe out the evil inside
No need to kiss the dream is alive
Free us from the evils of the demons outside
I blame it on the government say it on the radio
I have a devil in my infrared scope
Every president weve ever had lied
Buck Buck Buck Cause I dont give a motherfuck
Yo the world a mess we all lust the flesh
I wont stop till the people see success
So many beat to death so many people left
With the mark of the beast cant cheat the test
You bear the mark I bear the mark
With the blood in the waters theyre for sharks
Now everybody want to be quoting Marx
Less of the bite and more of a bark
In a world of fakes heres what it takes
Gotta have big balls not baby grapes
At a crazy pace lets do it facetoface
The whole race chase waste space age sensash
With a warm embrace they go and stab your back
Its so wack that the hacks flapjack the tracks
And when the bombs attack we gon bomb em back
Whit the cold facts rap tracks catch a jax
Theres no latch attached you cant own a soul
So dont go go scroll Po Po Patrol
Lets go toe to toe like pro dojo
Throws sold yo soul so dont go so slow
No need to crow no need to flip
What we need is a change in leadership
Wont even give a chance to plead the fifth
Before the radar go from bleep to blip bitch
I blame it on the government say it one the radio
And if you dont already know
I have a devil in my infrared scope
Buck buck buck Cause I dont give a motherfuck
I blame it on the government
Every president we ever had lied
And my hands on the 16shot
Semiautomatic crooked cop killing Glock
You think I dont notice the line when you cross it
Im like the mind of a genius trapped in a cerebral palsy
You underestimate the hood you think niggas is stupid
We read the countrys credits niggas know who produced it
Why the fuck you think theyre pushing military recruitment
America been platinum and she afraid of recoupment
So when you try to close the border and dont let us in
Ill overthrow California with 20 million Mexicans
Cubans and Chinese who came looking for freedom
Till they realized America was run by demons
And I dont mean George Bush he was a fuckin zero
More like the Roman emperor Nero
Who did nothing while the black slum turned to Atlantis
I mean those behind the canvas that made the mechanics
And then planned it
It sounds simple but stupid niggas wont understand it
Until the mark of the beast has your face branded nigga
