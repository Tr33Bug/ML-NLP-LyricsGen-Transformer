Yes I did I made a mistake yes I did 
Huhya know living this type a life
Makes you grow up faster than youd expect to sometimes
Fuck around and be in your late twenties
Feelin like a old man and shit
Yeah for real son let em know
Its hard to breath and hard to run when your lungs blackened
Coughing up blood like what the fuck happened
Raising my risk of cancers the answer homie
But after drinking something theres nothing like puffing a bogie
Now I can blame the same product placement in movies
Or the commercials or Scarface in a jacuzzi
But now Im living it
Damn I should a never took that first cigarette
I made a mistake 
I fucked up like your girl was riding on top of me
I should of took her to trial and never copped a plea
But this aint a Christian nation motherfucka please
America never taught me to turn the other cheek
Cause Im from Harlem the north of Manhattan
We knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton
But wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border
I made a mistake 
I knew she was a virgin when I first met her
Rockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater
Mom told her she could do better than a criminal
Seventeen yearold psychotic trying to be lyrical
I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
But I was careless instead of treating her right
I seen her again at some club strippin and wondered
If I could have made her life different
I made a mistake yes I did  
Tech talking over the beat
Damn shortie you got me on some singin the blues shit
But you gotta stop looking backwards and remember to look ahead
This is for all my dudes on patrol in the desert right now for real
I made a mistake 
Yeahyeah I joined the army looking for money to go to college
But they aint pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised
Extended my tour treating me like a sucker
Thats the reason officers get fragged motherfucker
Dont give me speeches on how you respect and you love me
But no body armor in a lightly armored humvee
My familys lonely and you want me to reenlist for 30 grand homie
I made a mistake 
When I was young I got signed to a record label
The deal looked so good when it was on the table
It paid for my cable cribs cars and jewelry
The studios the women theres nothing they wouldnt do for me
Except stop screwing me for publishing and royalties
How the fuck are you my dawg when theres no loyalty
Word to the street
I shouldve gone independent like Immortal Technique
I made a mistake 
Some people learn from mistakes and dont repeat them
Others try to block the memories and just delete them
But I keep em as a reminder they not killing me
And I thank God for teaching me humility
Son remember when you fight to be free
To see things how they are and not how you like em to be
Cause even when the world is falling on top of me
Pessimism is an emotion not a philosophy
Knowing whats wrong doesnt imply that you right
And its another when you suffer to apply it in life
But Im no rookie
And Im never gonna make the same mistake twice pussy
