Their lies cant fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Dont forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny whats natural
They corrupted the priceless African image of Isis
Replaced with a lifeless anorexic white bitch
The fashion industry got em in a funny spot
Selfhatred leakin our their mouth like a money shot
Moviestar Hollywood Babylon fantasy
Bunch of peacock bitches in a cocaine canopy
And if youre healthy they make you think youre a manatee
Look how they invented this Eurocentric insanity
Got your brains washed to the point youre bleachin your skin
Blind to the truth and cant see the beauty within
Cause aint nothin wrong with exercise
And tightenin your thighs but theres somethin wrong with contacts that lighten your eyes
Were goin backwards from hip hop in the park
To the experiments by Dr Kenneth Clark
So after the cannabis Ima have to handle this
Release the pressure on her and open her like an amethyst
Their lies cant fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Dont forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny whats natural
The business of beauty isnt a natural model
Its built to be the opposite of the cultures we topple
These magazines got you caught in a hustle cause when you starve yourself your body doesnt burn fat it burn muscles
And men who dont even like women control the business
Thats why the women look like men and the men like bitches
Ill break it down as God as my witness
Remember Sambo caricatured characteristics
Now who got the collagen under their lipstick
Implanted Arabic hips surgical sickness
A bipolar society that claims to be righteous
Sprayed paint an artifical melanin tryin to be like us
Livin in a pathetic epidemic
Schizofrenics buyin a syntetic body with credits
You mad that I said it but you know that Im right
Find the natural beauty and get you some natural love tonight


Their lies cant fade your beauty
You gotta know who you are
Stay strong and always remember
The truth in your heart
Dont forget there are those who
Benefit from your scars
And who deny whats natural
