Brothers and sisters and friends and I see some enemies
Laughter and then applause
In fact I think wed be fooling ourselves
If we had an audience this large and didnt realize
That there were some enemies present
Im a weapon that fires lyrical projectiles
With no mercy Im coldblooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of xfiles
Enlighten juveniles livin life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devils nervous
Competition is worthless like the electoral vote
If you provoke Ill break your motherfuckin neck in a yoke
Your better off throwin your shitty life away sniffin coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
Ill fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talkin shit or Ill make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But Ill break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
Ill burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary chemistrys my destiny
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
When I fight you I wont snipe you
Ill use a HIVinfected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you Ill force your children
At gun point to bite you and rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
Im comin atcha to catch ya by surprise in the cyph
Nobodys stupid enough to back ya when I tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And youre a playedout dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher but Technique never get captured inside the rapture
Cause I mastered the art of causin natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin decibels
Even though my starvin people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist corporate tentacles
I spit raw kinetic energy thats immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
Ill break your fuckin brain down into psychological chemicals


No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your lifes a fuckin mistake technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future youll worship those that descended from me
