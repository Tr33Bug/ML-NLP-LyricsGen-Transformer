Ive heard whispers about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry
Well the irony of this of course is that this money which is in the billions is coming from your country You see you are the major purchaser of our national product which is of course cocana
Cocaine On one hand youre saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets At the same time we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine
Mm mm si si Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this tragicomedy
Oigan ustedes ahi Ustedes trabajando Sigan trabajando carajo
Oye Luis Cundo van a terminar
Ahorita
Bueno que se apuren los burros Ahorita viene el camin apra diles
Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos aprate
Im on the border of Bolivia working for pennies
Treated like a slave the coca fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution  Revolucion  looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away I know theyd probably murder my moms
So I pray to Jes Cristo when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine paste and play my position
Ok listen Juan Valdez just get me my product
Before we chop off your hands for workers misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids I need these bricks
Forty tons in total let me test it indeed I 
Shit this is good pass me a tissue
And dont worry about them I paid off the official


Yo it dont come as a challenge Im the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a Third World fascist state lock the nation
With 90 of the wealth in 10 of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine youll see
Honey Im home
Never mind why your bank accounts suddenly grown its  What 
Funny were so out of this debt from this money we owe would you
Run if I told you that I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen  Whoa 
Come on our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of their souls of course this countrys running coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know
The CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough
I dont work in the hood  Hit my connect  Thats
Whats really good  They supply work to the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up
Scrutinized like we inferior  Petrified when we meet in my area  Calm down 
My dudes dont shoot until I say so  You got the loot
Give me the YayYay like Ice Cube so dont play with
My llello
We wont stop for you bastards
My street scramblers chop it and bag it
Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Fast to cuff or blast the fo
On any hustler stacking dough  Get on the ground 
Theres probably crack or blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
Ill gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us cause we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting popped with weight The prison sentence is due
Make the call and then leave with two kis out the evidence room
With my fame truck boat or plane they watching you
You think you got work They copping too
We control blocks they lock countries and own companies
We had nice cars and sneaker money
Now theres players out there talkin bout they holding
With bugs in their house like they down South with windows open
Your dough aint longyou wrongyou take shorts and soon
Fedsll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush live plush off coke bread
Soon youll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez
In a school I was a bully now life is fully a joke
I keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke
Players do favors for governors and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears you bigmouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier
The story just told is an example of the path that drugs take on their way to every neighborhood in every state of this country Its a lot deeper than the niggas on your block So when they point the finger at you brother man This is what youve got to tell them
Im not guilty Youre the one thats guilty The lawmakers the politicians the Columbian drug lords all you who lobby against making drugs legal just like you did with alcohol during the prohibition Youre the one whos guilty I mean cmon lets kick the ballistics here aint no Uzis made in Harlem Not one of us in here owns a poppy field This thing is bigger than Immortal Technique This is big business This is the American way
