Big Zoo uh
Technique uh
Positive balances uh uh
Pound for pound Im the most positive when I bust mine
The Zoo adds on like a plus sign
Addition thats the key in the ignition
With no pause I propel to pole position  Vroom 
Ahead of the pack light years ahead of the wack
I give a fiend a good book instead of the crack
Thats the gold mine negativity cant hold mine
The black bears headed for the gold mine  Look out Look out 
And then Im positive at Showtime
I make negative MCs switch styles in no time
They change teams rhyme about kings and queens
Instead of how they sellin work to fiends
Then I switch thugs into soldiers
Those that have given up on God to praise JayHova  Damn 
The rap Ice Age is over
And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder
Yeah you know how it goes
Positivity yeah
My opinion is solid ground but youre a common hater
Splittin and dividin on numbers like a denominator
Thirdeye navigator movements are necessary
Everything you see in videos is secondary
You need positivity like you need respect in jail
Because without balance youll be makin negative record sales
Negnegnegative record sales
Zigazam Technique like this
I jerk off inside books and give life to words
Leavin concepts stuck together you probably never heard
I love when people think Im psychologically disturbed
Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves
Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence
But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance
Meditatin with Native Americans close to Providence
I speak to the spirits of ancestors at powwows
But rumor has it that you gettin raped like Lil Bow Wow
Now listen industry motherfuckers dont get offended
Remember that Ill bring an end to your pretender agenda
And render contenders dismembered
Bend the fabric of time and put your soul in a blender
You livin a lie like thinkin Jesus was born in December
Instead of caterin to labels somethin gotta give
Ill rip the electrons out your body and make you positive
I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks
Because without balance you dont last more than a minute
This aint a game Ill beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage
I rock shows in the ghetto nigga you stuck in the village
I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven
But I cant afford the payola for Hot 97
So I make paper underground and Im soon to blow
Movin tapes like Biggies ghost at Bad Boy studios
Biggie  Hypnotize sample
My opinion is solid ground but youre a common hater
Splittin and dividin on numbers like a denominator
Thirdeye navigator movements are necessary
Everything you see in videos is secondary
You need positivity like you need respect in jail
Because without balance youll be makin negative record sales
Negnegnegative record sales
