Hypocrites hookers sex offenders
Yall niggas wanna be pimps and players
This aint 1997 nigga
Id rather be rich and unhappy than broke and miserable
Cause the game dont give a FUCK if you lyrical
And thats pitiful so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution the governments not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela trick knowledge they pimpin you
All up in the hood like McDonalds and liquor
Selling AIDS medicine when we know you got the cure nigga  woo 
You leery of conspiracy theory but hear me
From a business perspective it makes more sense clearly
Cause moreover thats what we go to war over
And numbers dont lie unless we do Bush and Gore over
Free markets make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture biochemistry
Smart nigga from the hood pussy what type of crime is that
But execs are like You from Harlem Where your diamonds at
Stupid
Cant dodge the game
If you lookin for the money or the fame  ohohh 
The players and the rules aint changed  oh no 
But see we tryin to leave a name
So were turnin out
Yeah this is how pimps get pimped and players get played
Rich people get robbed and broke niggas paid
New York London Chicago Philly and LA
Miami DC Bmore and out in the Bay
Were tearin it out of the frame
See we deserve to stake that claim
If we didnt its a cryin shame
What were concerned about is how to turn it out
Show me a pretty girl with the world stuck to her
And I bet you theres a brother thats tired of fuckin her
Lots of niggas girls is someone elses one night stand
I probably made some bitches nervous listenin with they man  ha ha 
And if that offends somebody Im sorry fuck you
What you think revolutionaries dont like to fuck too
You just gotta beware of dangerous coochie
Cover ya head like a kufi some rappers think that they live in a movie
Until they get herpes or clap from a groupie
And I dont need to shout you out nigga you know who you be
Look most people are only players cause they got played
And have not let go of that shit since the 7th grade
Yeah you got your heart broke life sucks doesnt it
But you shouldnt fuck up someone elses life because of it
Someone did your mother like that thats why you fatherless
Before jail or racist cops thats what the problem is


See whos the one to place that blame
We getting trapped in cycle of pain
With a generation headed down the drain
Thats how were turning out
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters strayed
Jersey Detroit Denver Phoenix Atlanta
Texas Vegas Seattle and fuckin Louisiana
Regardless of the money youre paid
You spend it on a watch and a chain
But cant offer your children a thing
What the hell is goin on in your brain
Yeah Im not a crack rapper Im not a backpacker  ha ha ha 
Im not a wack rapper moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects cause Im a hater  what 
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Cater to hustlers crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album to reach customers  yeah 
Every city state and country the hood love me
Even Aborigines in Australia bump me
They say underground fans are all the color of talcum
But who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum
Call up any major record label and ask em
But theres some devils in disguise in hiphop
That belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock  bitch 
I hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot  bitch 
And blames it on Acid Prozac and Slipknot
You a pussy actin hard like a bitch cop
Ill drop you to the floor like a reverse wristlock
Eat your food and shit on you like a highway pit stop
And make revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks
The government pimped 911 to go to Iraq
And history repeats itself right on track  how 
First as a tragedy and then the comedy begins  why 
Cause its funny motherfuckers dont see it come around again
Where can we be free  FUCK we gon be free man 
We only wanna live our lives
Live our lives with our eyes open
Open your eyes open your eyes
You stupid motherfuckers  you stupid motherfuckers
Open your eyes before you die
