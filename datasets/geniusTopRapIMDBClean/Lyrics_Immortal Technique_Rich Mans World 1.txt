Rich Mans World  1  Lyrics
You get up and howl about America and democracy
There is no America there is no democracy
We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies
The world is a college of corporations
Inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business
The world is a business
And I have chosen you to preach this evangel
For all my free market health carerobbing
Stockstealing retirement fund fuckinwith niggas
Fuck you little credit cardscamming jewelrystealing
Crackselling liquor storerobbing motherfuckers
Shout out to the homies Carnegie OG Willy Randolph Hearst Farouk Rockefeller  the real Rockefeller
My main bitch Leona pour out a little Louis the 13th
Scott Rothstein Jack Abramoff hold ya head
My Rothschild niggas Lets get this money
I spend my day pairin America overseas
Pension for the workers nigga please
Embezzlement etiquette private settlement
Im better with confederate rhetoric
From my mansion in Connecticut
Foreclose evict hoes out of tenement
I twist words like a speech impediment
I hope you got good credit bitch
If not better get a new job with benefits
While I play golf with niggas I get cheddar with
New money buys brand new carats
My old money bought your great grandparents
You got grills in your mouth I aint mad at ya
I own every goldmine in South Africa
Thanks baby you made me a billion
Plus I own a building
For each one of my childrens children thats the shit
Snort coke in the whip Miss USA suckin my dick
Yeah what Fuck the law cause real jail is for suckas
I go to country club prison you dumb motherfuckers
I am the 1 percent fuckin bitch 
You know my CEO corporate steeze please
Overthrow governments overseas in a breeze
Politicians in my pockets for a few hundred Gs
So if Im ever in court my assetsll never freeze


I got a job and a house and a bank account
When Im out I doubt thats something you can say
And if not then Ill fake death like Kenneth Lay
Make money everyday the world burns on its axis
While yall strugglin to pay taxes
Im gettin my money the fastest
Memos and faxes shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they dont want me indicted
Cause they dont want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it
Dont get my lawyers excited
Cause what good is a law if you cant rewrite it
I got CIA traitors dictators
So fuck yall whistleblowers and haters
Sheeeiiitt  Ill invest money from alQaeda
In the bank 911 widows go to later
Capitalisms who I pray to fuck the state of the world
Money talks so what the fuck I need to say to your girl
I dont pay them to fuck I pay them to leave 
You know my CEO corporate steeze greed
I treat countries like the IMF down on your knees
Real gangstas run the world fuck what you believe
Ill cut down a forest while you niggas burnin some trees
Ill get your family murdered for a couple of Gs
Cause your working class money aint fuckin with me
You think rappers are rich cause of songs you heard
My labels make the money and havent rapped a fuckin word
Yacht in the ocean coastin with the sails out
Hey America thanks for the bailouts
I made off with the Banco Ambrosiano
Got away scottfree like El Vaticano
Activists act a bitch get mad at me
Cause of my taxfree charity
80 percent to the staff and company
And 20 percent to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the Fed Reserve
Kick back to the bankstershavent you learned
You protest cops or patrols on the street
But I bought city hall so I own the police
Email Facebook and the shit you tweet
All the phone companies so I heard you speak
And my suggestion is your correction
No elections sex with no affection
No invention will benefit the world of man
Will exist til Ive got the money in my hand
World Bank interest rate damn rape on the spot
But Im a gangsta you gon take my money like it or not nigga
I got your country in my pocket motherfucker 
You know my CEO masonic steeze cheese
Only little people pay all these taxes and fees
Since you were born weve controlled what you watch and you read
And pretty soon were gonna own the fuckin air that you breathe
I take what I want fucker I dont have to say please
I convince you that its good for you take it and leave
You think presidents are a face of a nation
I put em all where they are end of the conversation
