TranslationsFranais
You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind
Every time I speak my mind Im lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied thats metaphysical
Man fuck a minority Im not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
To individuals who believe in Biblical miracles
Instead of themselves cause theyre not thinkin original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched with the umbilical
Only a fuckin imbecile would think theyre uncorrectable
Cause youre susceptible to becomin more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh your blood and your body are dissectable Ill beat you until youre a vegetable
And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position with your face sewn to your testicles
Thinkin that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart Im the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique Im like your soul nigga indispensable
With no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution
Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that youll have to violently silence me
Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me but now I can see
Now Im mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadenin horizons about what my people could be
If we wasnt set up to get shot locked or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizin weed is virtually impossible
So it wont be legalized and thats another obstacle
But Im still rollin up pocket fulls of tropical
The governments involved directly so its unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins
That invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop thats in high demand
And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
Cause Im tryin to save the Earth
But youre just gettin in line to rape her
