Invasion 
Ok lets go talk to em holler
Dont you get tired of hearing niggas say that shit all the time
Why cant you shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga
Yeah yeah
Used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like a crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back of a holding van
Used to be offbeat like the white girls shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes a acappella no beat behind bars
Shed blood to make it like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
Cause I never snitched and thats backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you dont ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hardcore lyricist
Your wax is useless rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution nigga picture this
Motherfucka what
Yeah
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery Im shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
Thats not misogynist you ostriches cause I could just apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
Thatll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen I bring the drama on
Im sinful I eat you broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop reparations now we taking back Delucci
Dont tell me you spent it on coke like Danny Bonaduce
Were tired of being on the outside looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop wouldve been
This is what it is as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant species the new breed that wont let you breath
Ill make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There aint no comparison
You got beef with niggas I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps and fake vegetarians
The resurrection ripping a ball through the record section
Flight connection to the Chechen border for guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor I got a choice now
This aint Volume 1 I got a grown mans voice now
Toured the country four times over Im older and wiser
Poisonous words youll find strychnine in my saliva
motherfucka what Bring it to em raw 
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets I dont need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
You the shit nigga I dont care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps and make all of this shit drown
No one out there can fuck with me 
motherfucka what 
I speak that real shit 
to smash the airwaves 
I dont want to tell you motherfuckers again 
Deep Cover1992
