3rd World motherfucker  Yeah 
Im from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality is not half as nice
It makes the hood in America look like paradise
Compared to the AIDSinfested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passports an American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin to deny it
Im from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist
And niggas grow coca cause the job market doesnt exist
Except slave labor modernday company store
And peacekeepers dont ever ever ever come here no more
From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Still has children born deformed eight months before they gone
Im from where they lost the true meaning of the Quran
Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam
And niggas know that but grow that poppy seed anyway
Cause that fooddrop parachute does not come every day
Im from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors
And practically every presidents a money launderer
From where the only place democracys acceptable
Is if Americas candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president but hes useless
Cause he does not control the economy stupid
Lock and load your gun where Im from the Third World son
Been to many places but Im Third World born
Guerrillas hit and run where Im from the Third World son
You polluted everything and now the Third Worlds gone
The water is poison where Im from the Third World son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolutionll come where Im from the Third World son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn
Im from where the Catholic Church is some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spanish Jesus whose face is this
But never talk about the black pope Gelasius
Im from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Militarys like the Mafia you pay for protection
Catamite sex tours is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientle
Im from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder CocaCola union organisers
Im from where the justice system est podrido
Fuck government niggas politic over perico
Rebelde conocido enterado vivo
Como otro Argentino desaparecido
Cause RICO laws dont apply to the CIA
And motherfuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
Im from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers
From where blacks indigenous peoples and Asians
Were once slaves of the Caucasians
And its amazin how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in the place they was raised in
You kept us caged in
Destroyed our culture and said that you civilised us
Raped our women and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah
So Im a start a global riot
That not even your fake antiCommunist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine tryin to murder me
The immunisations you gave us were full of mercury
So now I see the Third World like the rap game soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over
Lock and load your gun where Im from the Third World son
Been to many places but Im Third World born
Guerrillas hit and run where Im from the Third World son
You polluted everything and now the Third Worlds gone
The water is poison where Im from the Third World son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolutionll come where Im from the Third World son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn
