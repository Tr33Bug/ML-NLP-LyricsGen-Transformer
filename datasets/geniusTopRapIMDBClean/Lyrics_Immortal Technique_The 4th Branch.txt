The new age is upon us
And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
Shall stand before God  God God God God God God God 
It has begun the beginning of the end
Yeah  yeah  yeah yeah
The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Quran
They bombed innocent people tryna murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him stole his religion and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political rightwing ideology
Glued together sloppily the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall cause Im facin assassination
Guantanamo Bay federal incarceration
How could this be the land of the free home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust and the home of the slaves
Corporate America dancin offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country never sponsored terrorism
Human rights violations we continue the saga
El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that you still want to take me to prison
Just cause I wont trade humanity for patriotism
Its like MKUltra controllin your brain
Suggestive thinkin causin your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin for freedom and fightin terror but whats reality
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a womans heart abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war bottled up like a miscarriage
And they refuse to even mention European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin the innocent screams
USmanufactured missiles and M16s
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship blockin out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin
The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin
And the world doesnt believe that you fightin for freedom
Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
Its open season with the CIA buggin my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
Im tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
But when Im gone theyll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks
You dont give a fuck about us I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard


Its like MKUltra controllin your brain
Suggestive thinkin causin your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin for freedom and fightin terror but whats reality
Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you
While you hangin your flag out your project window
Yeah
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for exmilitary officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldnt speak for men
So shut the fuck up you mindless drone
And you know its serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you theyre fair and balanced
When theyre some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars we dont get the contracts to make money off em afterwards
We dont get weapons contracts nigga
We dont get cheap labor for our companies nigga
We are cheap labor nigga
Turn off the news and read nigga  read
