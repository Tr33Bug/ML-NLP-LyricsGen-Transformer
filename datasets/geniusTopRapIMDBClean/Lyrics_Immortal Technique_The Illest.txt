I burn my bridges with a blow torch
A rebel born from verbal holocaust
Dirty and never try to cleanse to get the drama off
Swiftest stealth assassin snipe you from balcony shots
A terrorist position professional from the opera box
Rhyme documents infamous like the Bill of Rights
Illa tight havin niggas open like the thrill of dykes
Jean Grae Yakuza mass murderer
Friends who got the dirt on her
Foes who never heard of her
Wild Style my mouth bomb the train up
I spit Krylon in five colors when I speak I spray my name up
Split your wig up like Denny Bruce
Splash your remains and brains out
On the street like Henny and juice
Noose your neck and loosen your spine from back
Shift your spleen rip til its just obscene
From downtown swingin it New York illest who rip it
Ever flow like a river fuck your girl like a nigga what
Ive been through hell and back scars swell on my back
I spit bars yall spit repetitive raps
Im a street dude who decided to rhyme with lines thatll crack the disc between your mind and your spine
Thats why yall wanna bite my design
And thats why usually I hold the mic like a 9
Pistolwhip you on the side of your eye watch it pop out
We knock out cats and wipe the floors with their rocks out
Shocked now Like you drivin in a lightning storm
With the top down we got this locked down
Like convicts on the run gettin shot down for phone time
We gainin yards in the whole nine
See me and Tech we steadily building
And we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building
And all them niggas get mad when we step in the building Cause we make the crowd jump
And hit they head on the ceiling what
I spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia
Bury competition like Mesopotamia
Emanatin radiation pissin liquid uranium
I bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums
Ill split your cranium with perfect symmetry lyrically
If youre not the illest then you dont deserve to spit with me
OBSobliterating bastards sacrilegiously
I sacrifice niggas who talk shit ritualistically
Meticulously makin all my rivals suicidal
Like white suburban kids on acid readin the Satanic Bible
My arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus
Exterminatin races of wack MCs that walk among us
Ive just begun to bust Ill make this place open candela
These racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela
Pissed off Im makin hella paper East to West Coast
And I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin joke
Cause if Im willin to smoke the President
While hes sniffin his coke
You know it dont mean shit to me to cut a fuckin cops throat
