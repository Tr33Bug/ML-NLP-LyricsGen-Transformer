I am content to die for my beliefs
So cut off my head and make me a martyr
The people will always remember it
No they will forget
A man who walks with God can walk anywhere
Hence I fear nothing
The point of guerilla war is not to succeed
Its always been just to make the enemy bleed
Deprivin the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation cant afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
And you refuse because you dont see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are wellequipped
Is to paint the people fightin for freedom as terrorists
Then find a faction lookin for foreign investment
Install them in power and murder any objections
You cant stop a revolution from breathin
So to beat em they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when youre done dreamin and wake up tortured for treason
Then you can see them hidin behind the god they believe in
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So Id rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
I dont need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop bein a servant
Pawns only move a square in the game that theyre used in
And realize it too late like the shooting of Huey Newton
Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende
Slaughtered by the powerhungry branches of their own gente
Ghandi wasnt killed by Pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
And Che Guevara rebel to a US continent
Was sold to the CIA by Bolivian communists
Wasnt Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist
And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence
Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the FBI
But to blast em they used Muslims from the NOI
Even the 35th President of the Republic
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that its proven that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire disguised in a constitution
Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the selfappointed rulers of the planets corporations
So Ima need every generation to put your hands up
Cause you can only get em off your back when you stand up
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on 
I was a man blessed by God
To survive some of the worst circumstances
I had many things a beautiful woman I loved a home money
And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free
Sometimes I look back on that life
And I wonder what it wouldve been like
And in moments of weakness I think about trading it
Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality
And I realize that Im in the heart of a war
And thats the place a martyr is born
