Before we go any further
I would like to send a message to all the underground mcs out there working hard
The time has come to realize your net worth in the market
And stop being a fucking commodity
And if you didnt understand what Ive just said then you already waiting to get fucked
For example a lot of these promoters are doing showcases
Throwing events and not even paying the workhorses
They trying get us to rock for the love of hiphop or rock for the exposure
Now look man I dont mind doing a guest spot for my peeps
Or or or doing a benefit show but dont lie to me pussy
Coz I find out Im paying your light bill Im fucking you up nigga
Besides you aint doing this for the love you aint doing it for the exposure
You charging up to 10 at the door and you aint tryin to give me shit
So wait a minute you want me to go shopping cook the food and put it in front of you
But you wont let me sit down and eat with you The fuck is that
Niggas need to start playing their position man
Just cause you throw a party a hosting event or an open mic or a showcase or a battle
That dont make you important at all
Without me and everybody like me out there
You aint nutting but a good idea motherfucker
So stay in your place
And to all these bitchass ARs who are too lazy to come up with a way to sell records
That they keep recycling marketing schemes and imagery
Cmon
There is a market for everything man
There is a market for pet psychologists nigga There is a market for twisted
Shitfetish videos For nipplerings for riverdancing for chocolate covered roaches
But you cant find one for cultured hardcore reality and hiphop
People like you the house nigga executives
And them rich motherfuckers that own you you the motherfucking machine man
You and all these niggas talking about the same shit
With the same flow over the same candyass beats
But I refuse the feed the machine
And Im not giving any magazine money
So maybe my album wont get 5 mics or doublexls or 5 discs
Whatever man fuck it
But then again you dont own me and none of you niggas ever will
If Im feeling what you fight for Im rolling with you to the end
But if not then FUCK YOU
And the more that mcs producers djs
And independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality
Of what their contribution to the business of hiphop is
Rather then just the music  the more the industry will be forced to change
Oh  heh and one last thing
You dont have to agree with everything Ive said
But dont ever be condescending to me
Picking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like
Ow yeah Immortal Technique  hes aaiight
No nigga
Your mom is pussy thats aaiight ok
Your peoples getting shot dead in the street thats aaiight
Im the motherfucking Immortal Technique nigga The message and the money
And you aint got either
Remember that
Punk ass motherfucker
