Yeah its that real this time around
Immortal Technique Revolutionary Vol 2
Its on now motherfucker lock and load
This is the point of no return I can never go back
Life without parole upstate shackled and trapped
Livin in the hole lookin at the world through a crack
But fuck that Id rather shoot it out and get clapped
Ive gone too far there aint no comin back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of ZyklonB
Just like the Spanish exterminatin Tainos
Rapin the black and Indian women creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of selfrighteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Dont you understand theyll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitchfork and machete
The end of the world motherfucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs changin the Earth
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin em nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomons Temple
AlAqsa the name is not coincidental
I know too much the government is tryin to murder me
No comin back like cuttin your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Geneticengineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin dog rippin off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me motherfucker cause Im not comin back
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin the struggle I know Im alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place that Im from doesnt exist anymore
This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machinegunnin your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians criminalminded
Broke into Hell tore it down and built a city behind it
Southpaw murderous methodology nigga
Remember that Im just a man dont follow me nigga
Cause once you past the point you can never go home
Youve got to face the possibility of dyin alone
So tell me motherfucker how could you die for the throne
When you dont even got the fuckin heart to die for your own
It rains acid one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And youll be lookin at the world livin inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie


This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin the struggle I know Im alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place that Im from doesnt exist anymore
