Rest in Peace
Heres another warriors song rep this life to the fullest
Rest in Peace
Mothafucka say yo prayers
For brothers who died from blackonblack violence
Rest in Peace
You aint payin respect when you spose to
Rep this life to the fullest
Rest in Peace
This aint for yall this a toast to them
Rest in Peace
Heres a toast to the dead
If you dont drink smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the feds
For those who died hard in the streets soakin in red
And died slow asleep in a dream chokin in bed
Heres a toast to the dead for my enemies that are gone
Im not a coward so celebratin that would be wrong
I pray to God that your soul will come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead for criminals burnin in Hell
I wonder how many presidents are burnin as well
Emperors popes senators generals
Amputees feel unlucky until they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead for those who are forgotten
Written out of history by the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista
Thousands of Indios Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence I need a moment of violence
Like the 19th century Caribbean islands
Long live those who came before that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable
Take your clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical
Presumptuous halfhearted homunculus
Selfdestruction is the power without knowin what the function is


Heres a toast to the dead for all of my fam
I will never let an idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines designed to give a view of this
J Dillas still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead for rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy wont be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and wisdom of the present
Ill teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead for children with cancer and AIDS
A cure exists and you probably could have been saved
Sad to see medicine divorce morality
Corporate homewreckers pimpin up the salary
A toast to the dead for those thatll die today
The victims and those exonerated by DNA
The only thing worse than givin freedom to the guilty
Is killin the innocent and leavin your soul filthy
Immortal Technique remember me when Im gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in a song
So youll always keep a piece of my spirit inside
When you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you wont survive the changes the Earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis hurricanes and earthquakes
And thats just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways
And realize that we are one regardless of our birthplace
My last toast to the dead is for the listener
Human being or extraterrestrial visitor
Remember us for more than our primitive ways
When you study us long after the end of our days
