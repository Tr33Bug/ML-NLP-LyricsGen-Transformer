She was on her way to becomin a college graduate
Wouldnt even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina Id sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit her love was never for hire
Disciplined intellectual beauty is what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me kickin it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought she didnt mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talkin about how they smoke kids
But the rich sniffcoke kids got no play
Im not even interested is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way gave up tryin to get in it
It didnt matter how good your game was she wasnt with it
On the block bitches was jealous but wouldnt admit it
Talk shit and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonalds and diddick
Smokin weed with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it always tryin to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style all her own respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her and there wasnt a cure
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
Her eyes are brown and beautiful yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally and she was glad
That I wasnt just another nigga tryin to get in it
So every now and then wed stop and talk for a minute
I didnt have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousins baby shower
We talked about power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin it real
Perfectly honest and complete
She would always call me cario and never Technique
Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
Forever changin the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me to stop hangin out on the streets
To stop robbin and stealin from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
I couldnt live without her so I told her facin my fears
But honeys only response was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically holdin me tight
I tried to speak but she wouldnt stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didnt burn I turned cold after that night
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
I went on with my life college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the COs talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
At night in my cell Id close my eyes and Id see her
Hold her close in my dreams but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
In the summer came back intact and on track
But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
Even after my mother hugged me cryin at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin outta my zone
Fuckin lots of different women but I still felt alone
Relatively wellknown around the New York underground
But I kept thinkin of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically somehow it was still there
I had to do somethin because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed
When I asked about her daughter
Dont you know that time waits for no man
My fate its all planned
Im blessed just to know you
Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
Cant find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again Id never let you go
Hold tight to your love cause you never know
She told me that there was a note for me that was left behind
And she had left it there waitin for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin up in her eye and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinkin the worst
Reversed my position stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope
With my name on the floor Nobody loves you more than me cario is what the letter said
By the time you get to read this Ill probably be dead
But when you left in 97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me to see what true love really does
Cause even though we never made love
You were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought
You made me want to believe
And then I slipped up and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby dont you see
I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didnt exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin I wish I couldve given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that youll meet me in Paradise inevitably
No matter what Ill keep your love forever with me
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishin that I was dead instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel and now you know why Technique dont fuckin fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if theyre next to you
The one you love not the person thatll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
Cause you never really know what you got until its gone
