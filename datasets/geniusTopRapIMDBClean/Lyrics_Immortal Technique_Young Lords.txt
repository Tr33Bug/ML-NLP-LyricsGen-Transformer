New to the world
Fresh out the barrio
I was an outlaw rebel
Out of my mind young and wild
My existence defined in one word Survive
If it could be sold I can sell it if it cant thats cool
Ill fix it up make it look good enough to catch some fools
It started when I was young with my Genesis games
He traded me John Madden forI dont remember the name
But it was weak though
The streets though they play with perico
So Tito became my hijo he had cheap blow
And each O like three four times I flipped ones
But its evil the people I deal withll stick nuns
With big guns the diesel that diesel never change
The custies still nod like they agree with everything
The weed aint the same all the colors is new
It aint just green the haze is purple and them berries is blue
I dont care if it was pink as long as they still smokin
Ill have them bags packed until they damn near open
The hustles in my veins I could bleed in a pot
And make a soup thatd go for 10 dollars a pot
En la calle
On a collision course with incarceration
Consumed by the lies of the streets
They were an illusion
But I awoke caged like an animal
They got me locked in a cell
Where Im feelin like an experiment
My spirit sharper than lasers they used to build pyramids
Writin on the walls keep me sane
Knuckle pushups on the concrete til I bleed out the pain
Thoughts of my freedom lingerin in my brain
Im stronger and much quicker I appreciate the gain
Buildin with my aalike brown power reunite
Tattoos of my flag PR pride Jesus Christ
But I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy
So when Im free Ill teach and spread the speech
Of how they try to divide us  to make us weak 
Find us  and break a piece 
So I got it  to make a peace  honest  I play for keeps 
This is the life of your forefathers that fought hard
Four corners of backyards power in numbers
So they subtract us and add bars
If they want it we gonna take em to war
We not a gang or a clique we Young Lords


I came to my senses un esclavo no soy
That is now my past
I came to know me and my people
Red brown and black helped me paint the future
The world got a template to turn us into inmates
Caged in a state pen man fuck goin to Penn State
Bonded to slave ships to punch in your timecard
Walk my oasis spacin jungle behind bars
Got my epiphany like Malcolm X
Prison to the bricks but Im stuck in this global house arrest
Im a free man so I changed my mannerisms
This Greenspan system wanna dent my activism
Estilo machetero get my people out the ghetto
21st century Grito De Lares estate quieto  stay calm 
We vocal minorities no pookie man trail
Guess the local authorities to be the Ho Chi Minh trail
From robbin bodegas and boostin like lowlives
The medium figures totin the 45
Revolutionary gangsters in your presence
Tryin to dead us with cancer through chemical testin
Unidos por fin
We seize the time free at last
Learn to love live to fight
Not just for me but for others
Teach the new blood
And live for freedom
I survived the COINTELPRO assassinations
AIDSepidemic crack era fractured the nation
The interpretation of American democracy
Is best exemplified in its foreign policy dichotomy
I live a doublelife of political philosophy
But revolution follows me the struggle for equality
Against the morally bankrupt claimin to be born again
Its a civil war again like MS13s origin
Banned ethnic studies claimin our culture will swallow them
But you cant conquer people
And build a country on top of them
And then feel offended that they breathe the same oxygen
Your family values lack the wisdom of Solomon
But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap
Are Poli Sci 101 research for the New Jack
Its hard to reach Communist Utopia tomorrow
When your hands are in a fuckin glass jar like Che Guevara
Forget the distorted historical facts you were given
Slave trade was the capital for capitalism
Trapped in a prison mentally dyin existentially
Separated from people you cant see yourself to be
Then racially integrated into a burnin house
Colony of an empire economically burnin out
Cant win a debate so they sponsor every threat to me
I wonder if Agent 800 is standin next to me
In Puerto Rico the main problem we have es que somos colonia We are a colony we are fighting for freedom
Because we will not be a slave nation por favor
The struggle here is to make universities
The struggle here is in the community
Its against the police and violence
Its against discrimination
Its against the crime against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island This is Panama
Young lords revolutionary always from San Juan Puerto Rico
Que viva Puerto Rico libre
