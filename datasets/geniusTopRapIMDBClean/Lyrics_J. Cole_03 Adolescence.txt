In love with the baddest girl in the city I wish I knew her
I wish I wasnt so shy I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That Im the perfect nigga for her but then maybe thats a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and its clear Im not that guy
Ball player star player Im just watchin from the side
On the bench cause my lack of confidence wont let me fly
I aint grow up with my father I aint thinkin bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now Ill probably cry
When I realize what I missed but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause Im tryna stay alive in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I  La la la

Things change rearrange and so do I
It aint always for the better dawg I cant lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I dont fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin in the hallway
Burnt CDs and trees like this was Broadway

I got four brothers one mother that dont love us
If they aint want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes there aint no reason to cry
You made a genius and I aint gon take it for granted
