I grew up a fucking screw up tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer damn need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city I wish I knew her
I wish I wasnt so shy I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That Im the perfect nigga for her but then maybe thats a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and its clear Im not that guy
Ball player star player Im just watchin from the side
On the bench cause my lack of confidence wont let me fly
I aint grow up with my father I aint thinkin bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now Ill probably cry
When I realize what I missed but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause Im tryna stay alive in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I  La la la 
Ayy who am I  La la la la la yeah 
Things change rearrange and so do I
It aint always for the better dawg I cant lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I dont fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin in the hallway
Burnt CDs and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca

Dime for a dub them white boys aint know no better

Took her whip the appeal too ill to refrain

And talked about how we gon smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked What a nigga gotta do to get that
Put me on he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me Nigga you know how you sound right now

Listen you everything I wanna be thats why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree Ima be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what A hundred bucks or two a week
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me
I got four brothers one mother that dont love us
If they aint want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes there aint no reason to cry
You made a genius and I aint gon take it for granted
I aint gon settle for lesser I aint gon take what they handed
Nah Im gon take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing the illest nigga alive
