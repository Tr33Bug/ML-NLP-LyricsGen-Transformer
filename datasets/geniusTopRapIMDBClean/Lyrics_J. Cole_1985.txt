TranslationsTrkeEspaolEnglish1985 I arrived
33 years damn Im grateful I survived
We wasnt sposed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money pussy parties I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin like they know somethin these days
Niggas actin woke but they broke umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin these days
Man they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do who the fuck am I
I heard one of em dissed me Im surprised
I aint trippin listen good to my reply
Come here lil man let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice never quit tourin
Cause thats the way we eat here in this rap game
Im fuckin with your funky lil rap name
I hear your music and I know that raps changed
A bunch of folks would say that thats a bad thing
Cause everythings commercial and its pop now
Trap drums is the shit thats hot now
See Ive been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind that was just a segue
I must say by your songs Im unimpressed hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus you havin fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact
These white kids love that you dont give a fuck
Cause thats exactly whats expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down fuck it I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up you see them turnin up too
You hit the next city collect your money when its due
You gettin that paper swimmin in bitches I dont blame you
You aint thinkin bout the people thats lookin like me and you
True you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that aint true
One day them kids thats listening gon grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your shows lookin light cause they dont show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin and hopin to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped cause you was ridin trends
Now you old news and you goin through regrets
Cause you never bought that house but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends I aint judgin you
Im just tellin you whats probably gon happen when you rappin
Bout the type of shit you rappin bout
Its a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
Im hoping for your sake that you aint dumb as you look
But if its really true what people sayin
And you call yourself playin with my name
Then I really know you fucked trust
Ill be around forever cause my skills is tiptop
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon be on Love  HipHop nigga
