Killa its The OffSeason
Lets keep it tall yall aint fuckin with my man
And dont check your watch you know the time
Cole World Killa Cam niggas is fuckin finished  Yeah 
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga Cole been goin plat since back when CDs was around
What you sold I tripled that I cant believe these fuckin clowns
Look how everybody clappin when your thirtysong album do a measly hundred thou
If Im bettin on myself then I completely double down
If you hated on a nigga please dont greet me with a pound
I be stayin out the way but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories niggas start to squeeze we duckin down
So many shells left on the ground it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up dust my clothes off sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off the streets it dont come with a ref
I never sold soft just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they Os off you reach niggas uppin like Steph
To blow your nose off gesundheit and then resume flight
As if it never happened shit we witnessed full of so much sickness
Angels sheddin tears in Heaven word to Eric Clapton
Off this clever rappin bitch my pockets gon forever fatten
They gon forever fatten
See we tried to tell niggas
They act like they dont even fuckin speak English
Bitch my pen to the papers lethal
Im sendin em straight to meet the
The nigga that made them peep the reaper
Creepin on ya the scent of failure reekin on ya
Check your genitalia pussyniggas bleedin on yourself
Fuckin with Cole is bold but its impedin on your health
All yo niggas eatin off your wealth
All my niggas feedin all they selves and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12  Uh 
Cause they steady harassin
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty they blastin
Bullets be hummin like Cudi but one of yo hoodies SpaghettiO splashin
All over the driveway yall talkin all sideways
Shots poppin off yall laid down
Cops chalkin off yall legs now
Shit  God watchin Hey Yahweh
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin em yall way  Yall way 
We sendin em yall way  Yall way 
Thats what the fuck Im talkin bout
Yall see what the fuck goin on out here  Killa Harlem 
I95 shit Carolina 26 stand up nigga
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your hood up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Put your clique up
Represent your shit motherfucker
Represent your shit motherfucker
Represent your clique motherfucker
Represent your clique motherfucker
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
