Uh
Since a youngin always dreamed of gettin rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
Thats all I need my nigga
Throw some 20s on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body Im convinced
Anybody is a killer all you gotta do is push em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin with the pushers and the pimps
Im tryna write a story can I get a glimpse
Yeah can I get a glimpse
Last night I had a bad dream  Bad dream bad dream 
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing  Bad thing bad thing 
They robbin niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that aint never had things
Whats the value of a thing  Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Ugh nice watch run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters aint gold
I know the shit aint always good as it seems
But tell me til you get it how could you know
How could you know  How could you know How could you know How could you know How could you know How could you know 
How could you know  How could you know How could you know How could you know How could you know How could you know 
Listen up Im bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees my nigga
And some powder bag it up and make it flip
You gon see my nigga
One day we gon graduate and cop a brick
And thats the key my nigga
Listen up Im bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat a badder bitch
Tired of seein niggas flaunt I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up thats what they wont do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit
Even if you let em kill your dream
Itll haunt you nigga haunt you
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing
I look around like
Do you wanna be another nigga that aint never had things  Whats the value of a thing 
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
You know what the fuck it is nigga run that shit right now 
Uh nice watch run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command my command my command
But before you go Ive got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And youll get your piece but know peace wont be found
So why just take me man take me man take me man
Your wish is my command my command my command
