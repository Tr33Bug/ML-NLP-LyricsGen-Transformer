Lets get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine Im a king no leaning
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know bout my pain
If I quote it nigga I wrote it nigga
Six head shots Ill erode a nigga
Pop another clip and Im reloaded nigga
Aint no way around it Im the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty lifes a coal my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot whip cold Im bipolar nigga
But I dont like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Dont need a rollie on to know Im getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga
Fuck do you know bout my pain
Right there let me get that there
Talk about it 
Fuck do you know bout my dreams
Talk about it 
Nada
If you really believe it gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too 
Rollercoaster ride
Start to doubt it too 
How much do it cost
Start to doubt it 
If I take a ride fuck around get lost
Shoutout my nigga Ib 
Rollercoaster ride how much do it cost
El Presidente and shit 
He want me to talk my shit for yall 
If I take a ride fuck around get lost


Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I aint coming to talk about all that paper
Thats what they talk about when they aint got shit to say
Cant understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying same shit nigga different day
I never felt that no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows Im the shit thats it
Got suicidal doors I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit and bit the shit back twice Im that nice woo
Whats the plan
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun dont jam
On a scale from one to ten Im a hundred grand
Its Cole fuckin world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker Top Dawg in this motherfucker
When you and K Dot shit drop
Bitch never they cant handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop
