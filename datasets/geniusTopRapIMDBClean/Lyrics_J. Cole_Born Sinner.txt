Yeah
Hey
Spinning in circles live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga was it business was it personal
Should this be my last breath Im blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile wellrounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think wed grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent and hopeless I saw but never noticed
That a college point is right to Be all that you can be posters uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany I dont know if
This the realest shit I wrote but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day youll find it
And knew one day youd come back and rewind it singing
Im a born sinner
But Ill die better than that I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there  I was there 
I was born sinning
But I live better than that  better than that 
If you aint fucking with that I dont care
Ooh ooh ooh  Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming Dont let me slip
She see the tears in my eyes I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you You the only reason why I dont flip
And go insane my roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame dont lose me the more I change no
Just grow with me go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon smoke with me
Womans curse since birth man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here Ill tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows em
Dont you ever go expose em
This life is harder than youll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show more for you than for me
Dont you worry yourself I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but wheres the tutor for me
Pops came late Im already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Cant wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
Im a born sinner
But Ill die better than that I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there  I was there 
I was born sinning
But I live better than that  better than that 
If you aint fucking with that I dont care
Ooh ooh ooh  Yeah yeah yeah
Im a born sinner
But Ill die better than that I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there  I was there 
I was born sinning
But I live better than that  better than that 
If you aint fucking with that I dont care
Ooh ooh ooh  Yeah yeah yeah
This music shit is a gift
