My intuition is telling me therell be better days yeah
My intuition is telling me therell be better days
I like this tone
Yeah my intuition is telling me therell be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate my tears evaporate
My faith dont deviate ideas dont have a date
But see Im growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heavens doors with every step
As we speak Im at peace no longer scared to die
Most niggas dont believe in God and so they terrified
Its either that or they be fearing they gon go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness got em overwhelmed  Please God I want to go to Heaven 
As if Hes spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real Hed never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside  Come from inside 
But the only real change come from inside  Come from inside 
But the only real change come from
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside  Come from inside 
But the only real change come from inside  Come from inside 
But the only real change come from
Yeah my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin
Doin dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon be a bastard
Im living fast like Im in a drag race how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause Im supposed to have a halo
Right now my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a birds eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do
I just supply its economics
My business aint got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times niggas want whats mine
I cant oblige dog I work too hard
So reach for it get referred to God Im going hard nigga


I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from
Yeah prodigal son got a new gun
This one dont run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball become a star and remain my self
If I fall dust it off and regain my self
Fuck em all they dont know all the pain I felt
Im in awe after all the fame I felt I evolved
I no longer bury demons I be a vessel for the truth until Im barely breathing Im singing
Life is all about the evolution
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
You can dream but dont neglect the execution
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
Time is short thats what somebody told me
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up I give in I move back a little
I live up I look up now Im back for more
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What its like to finally be the motherfuckin man
Eyes wide thats from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespect and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison you call it real  pop pop pop pop 
Thats how you feel
Pistols be poppin and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that aint no lookin back cause Im running too
I made it home I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I cant explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain he was 22
Last night at around  He was 22
22 year old black male suspect reporting live 
I swear to God bruh 
Were gathered here today
I swear to God 
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
I swear to Godnigga Ima kill them niggas man 
A tragedy another tragedy in the black community
I promise you bro 
We got to do better people
22 years old this boy was too young
I promise you bro Ima kill them niggas yo 
Our condolences go to his family our prayers
Ima kill them niggas myself 
We know hes in a better place
We know hes in a better place
But this has got to end ladies and gentleman
Weve got to come together this isthis is beyond words
Now Id like to open this ceremony with a verse from
