Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I aint gon sit around and front like I aint thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but its funny how
My shit is crookedlook at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill just to show the kids its real
We aint picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows thick as hell
Love yourself girl or nobody will
Though you a woman I dont know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you killin yourself to find a man thatll kill for you
You wake up put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you cant face whats wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling Why you gotta take so long
What its like to have a crooked smile
Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down  This crooked smile 
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round  Yeah 
To all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling
You wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling
You keep falling victim cause youre insecure
And when I tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure
Cause he dont seem to want you back and its got you askin
So all you see is what you lackin not what you packin
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you a star dont let em tell you youre not
Now is it real Eyebrows fingernails hair
Is it real If its not girl you dont care
Cause whats real is somethin that the eyes cant see
That the hands cant touch that them broads cant be
And thats you never let em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up Ill be around
And we can ride with the windows down the music loud
I can tell you aint laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
We got the crooked smile we can style on em
Back round crooked smile we can style on em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
We dont look nothin like the people on the screen
You know the movie stars picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase em
Look at the nation
Thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale cause we in Hell already
I ask If my skin pale would I then sell like Eminem or Adele
But one more time for the Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit nigga lets make a mil
Hey officer man we dont want nobody gettin killed
Just open up that cell let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now and well now
If you askin will I tell nowayy hell nah
I aint snitchin cause man they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldnt need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile
Even though I
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down  That crooked smile 
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
We got the crooked smile we can style on em
Back round crooked smile we can style on em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
La la la la la la lalalala
La la la la la la lalalala
La la la la la la lalalala
La la la la la la lalalala
On my way on my way on my way down
On my way on my way on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I find my way back round
Round
