I got thoughts cant control
Got me down got me low
Rest my mind rest my soul
When I blow when I blow
Am I wrong let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Dont think twice this is me
This is how I should be
But Im aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
Im blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later I doubt it
My database of narcotics
Its growing long
But Im aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
Im blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later I doubt it
My database of narcotics
Its growing long
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas  I hope you listening
and  I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville I hope youre listening
Smoking medical grade but I aint got prescription
All the way in Cali where they aint got precipi
tation feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas cause they aint got ambition
Fuck did you expect you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they aint ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What Im tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame em all I would need like twenty CDs
Theres all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it dont matter how hard it be
Fast forward them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent cause I aint Jesus
This aint no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now Im older I love you cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no Im not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction dont blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
Id rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

Dont medicate medicate dont medicate medicate
Meditate meditate meditate meditate
Dont medicate medicate dont medicate medicate
I got thoughts cant control
Got me down got me low
Rest my mind rest my soul
When I blow when I blow
Am I wrong let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Dont think twice this is me
This is how I should be
