Yeah life is a balance
You lose your grip you can slip into an abyss
No doubt you see these niggas trippin
Ego in charge of every move hes a star
And we cant look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
Hes fallin apart but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
The women the dickriders you know the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
Damn wonder what happened
Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas
Based off the words they be rappin
But come to find out these niggas dont even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin up then they bite this shit
Damn thats what I get for lyin to myself
Well fuck it whats more important is hes cryin out for help
While the worlds eggin him on Im beggin him to stop it
Playin his old shit knowin he wont top it

I got a homie he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame the acclaim the respect thats been had
By all the legends so every time I see him he stressin
Talkin bout niggas dont fuck with him this shit is depressin
And I know he so bitter he cant see his own blessings
Goddamn nigga you too blind to see you got fans nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a niggas life but you too anxious livin life
Always worried bout the critics who aint ever fuckin did it
I write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me
Do I want these niggas to worship me

These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they aint even sure
Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess Im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
To impress some niggas that couldnt care if Im on
Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
I care nothin bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store take your diss make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
Im on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you not the music you coppin
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
