As fate passes you by half of you try
The other half of you fried too high to actually fly
One day yall have to decide who you gon be
A scary nigga or a nigga thats gon rule like me

Whos the king 
Came from the bottom nigga with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me I came from the dirt
Whos the king 
Money my motivator the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin from pawn to a king
Whos the king 
You tell me ya still love me if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn never know
Whos the king 
Look in my eyes and see the future
But dont sugar coat it
Listen
History repeats itself and thats just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year Ill prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
Im just playin but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on theyll hang you with
But not Jermaine my aim too sick
I bang nigga I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game I aint stupid
I recognize that life is a dream and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time and claim 26
And fuck it if the shoe fits whos the king
We all kings
We all kings nigga 
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
True 
While the people debate whos the king of this rap game
Here comes lil ol Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever yall think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof boom paow its like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
Its done
Aint gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
In reality hes a coward
Ultimately hes scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when Im in tune with the most high
I realize the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same are the same you and I
Different kind of skin different set of eyes
Two different minds but only one God
Its only one God nigga 
Its for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
