Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip  Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Lil sip took a lil sip
Took a lil sip ttook a lil took a lil took a lil sip
Ayo I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold techs like they mad at the ref
Thats why I keep a cross on my chest either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit watch for the Adams apple
Slick with words dont hate me son
What you eat dont make me shit and who you fuck dont make me cum
Put a price on my head wont make me run
Try to kill me but it cant be done
Cause my words gon live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip  Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go  You know that 
Money come and go  You know that 
Love come and go  Dont shit last 
Bitches come and go  You know that 
Money come and go  You know that 
Love come and go  Dont shit last 
Take a seat baby girl youve been all in my mind
I know I aint called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5 no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy aint shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And thats why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin like Harlem in the nineseven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making As at 11
Or 12 trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell only time gon tell
Fuck her while her mama home baby dont yell
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader fuck your magazine hater
When I say that Im the greatest I aint talking about later
Ima drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wany
And I dont mean no disrespect I praise legends
But this whats next the boy sick cant disinfect
Lifes a bitch and her pussys wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of death
Blaow


Me and my bitch took a little trip
Down to the garden took a little dip  Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go  You know that

Bitches come and go  You know that 
Money come and go  You know that 
Love come and go  Dont shit last
