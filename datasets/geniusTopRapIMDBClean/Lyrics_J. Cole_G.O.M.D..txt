Hollywood Cole go
Ayy Hollywood ayy Hollywood Cole go
My nigga done went Hollywood
You wanna know just where Im at Well let me tell you bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you bout it
They tryna say I cant come back ayy let me tell you bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back ayy let me tell you bout it
I wanna tell you bout it hands up everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like Man thats what everybody said
Go and pop the trunk and now everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter never bitter
Niggas is fake they anime
Me I never hate get cake like Anna Mae woah
Eat the cake bitch eat the damn cake uh
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Dominos and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape uh
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldnt keep the man safe
I said to the window to the wall  To the wall 
My nigga ride when I call  I call 
Got bitches all in my mind  My mind 
Fuck nigga blockin my shine  My shine 
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I aint you and you aint me
Get off my dick woah
Get the fuck off my dick 
Get off my dick woah
Get the fuck off my dick nigga 
Get off my dick bitch woah
Get the fuck off my dick 
Get off my dick woah
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I dont tell nobody
They gettin temporary dough and I dont tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed I wont tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine and I wont tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip
Young nigga never had love
You know foot massage back rub shit
Blowin bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin bout some kids still I
Tell them hoes come through the break up
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about em
Wont be long before you start to doubt em
Tell yourself you better off without em
Then in time you will find cant walk without em
Cant talk without em cant breathe without em
Came here together you cant leave without em
So you walk back in make a scene about em
On your Amerie its just 1 Thing about em
Its called love niggas dont sing about it no more
Dont nobody sing about it no more no more
Its called love niggas dont sing about it no more
Dont nobody sing about it no more
Nigga I dont sing about this shit no more 
But every nigga in the club singin
To the window to the wall  To the wall 
My nigga ride when I call  I call 
Got bitches all in my mind  My mind 
Fuck nigga blockin my shine  My shine 
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I aint you and you aint me
Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singin
Singin this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singin
Singin this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
This song yeah song yeah
Song yeah songsong yeah
The make up
This shit is retarded goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh thats a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Heres a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville give us a year well be on every show
Yeah fuck nigga Im very sure heh
Fuck the rest Im the best nigga out
When Im back home Im the best in the South
When Im in LA Im the best in the West
You contest You can test Ima stretch niggas out
Ooh Ima stretch niggas out
That go for all yall if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth ho
