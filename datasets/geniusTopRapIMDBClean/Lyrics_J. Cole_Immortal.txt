Awwwwwhaha
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin dollar and a dream with my closet lookin broke
And my niggas lookin clean gettin caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldnt know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor
Flashbacks to the pain wakin up cold sweats
Six oclock in the mornin gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain cause its hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin know its wrong but Im sellin
Eyes wellin up with tears
Thinkin bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
Real niggas dont die
Forward with the plot
OneSevenFortyFive
Form at the plot
Real niggas dont die
Form on the block
Real niggas dont lie
Form in the plot
My niggas dont die
Form on the block
Real niggas dont die
Form on the block
Real niggas dont die
Real niggas dont die
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin ribbon in the sky
Nope all I see is that CREAM nigga that green
Im a black king black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat too fat for a flat screen
Im the type of nigga make the whole fuckin trap lean
Kingpin nigga put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga they gon have to send a SWAT team
And Im goin out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend what that mean
Real niggas dont die
Forward with the plot
OneSevenFortyFive
Form at the plot
Real niggas dont die
Form on the block
Hood niggas dont lie
Form in the plot
My niggas dont die
Form on the block
Real niggas dont die
Form on the block
Real niggas dont die
Real niggas dont die
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
Cause you wanna change the world but while alive you never will
Cause they only feel you after you gone or Ive been told
And now Im caught between bein heard and gettin old
Damn death creepin in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch Make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in VirginiA
They tellin niggas sell dope rap or go to NBA
In that order its that sort of thinkin
That been keepin niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen ripe with pain listen
