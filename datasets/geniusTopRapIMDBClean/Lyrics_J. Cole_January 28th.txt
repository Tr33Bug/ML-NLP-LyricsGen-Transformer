Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune
Im tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah look
The real is back the ville is back
Flow bananas here peel this back
And what youll find is your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolinas finest you knew that already
In terms of the greatest I proved that already
And if you would like I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope hes okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well and thats the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger singing
Dont give em too much you  Dont give em too much you 
Dont let em take control  Dont let em take control 
Its one thing you do  Its one thing you do 
Dont let em taint your soul  Dont let em taint your soul 
If you believe in God  If you believe in God 
One things for sure  One things for sure 
If you aint aim too high  If you aint aim too high 
Then you aim too low  Then you aim too low 
Whats the price for a black man life
I check the toe tag not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide its just physics
Please lets put our egos aside you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights full of Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up to that Dusse
Gotta show respect one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin bout the slums
Im talkin bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said son
This is New Yorks finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New Yorks climate
Like show me New Yorks ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it youll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist control the game whenever he snap
Thats every track nigga


Dont give em too much you  Dont give em too much you 
Dont let em take control  Dont let em take control 
Its one thing you do  Its one thing you do 
Dont let em taint your soul  Dont let em taint your soul 
If you believe in God  If you believe in God 
One things for sure  One things for sure 
If you aint aim too high  If you aint aim too high 
Then you aim too low  Then you aim too low 
I aint serve no pies I aint slang no dope
I dont bring no lies niggas sang my quotes
I dont play no games boy I aint no joke
Like the great Rakim when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga you aint the god
Nah you aint the god
Nigga Cole the god  Cole the god Cole the god
