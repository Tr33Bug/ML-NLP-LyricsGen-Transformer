She my number one I dont need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and dont want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself Im strong enough to shake it and Im trying
But Im only human I know loving yous a crime
If I take this cookie now one day Ill do the time
Slip me a xanny at once  somebody 
I got the earth in a blunt  smoke 
I get the skirt when I want  skrrt 
I get to skrrt when I want  skrrt 
Due to the money aroma  somebody 
My girl she got a diploma  smoke 
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain sip lean smoke tree up
When Im in your town press pound hit me up
When Im in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good Ill be back for the reup
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like Im sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
Cause love wouldnt lie like I lie and its wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker dont bake like you
Even when the flavor dont taste like you
So Im back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes and only have eyes for you
Slip me a xanny at once  somebody 
I got the earth in a blunt  smoke 
I get the skirt when I want  skrrt 
I get the skirt when I want  skrrt 
Due to the money aroma  somebody 
My girl she got a diploma  smoke 
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
Im a fake nigga and its never been clearer
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
Im a fake nigga and its never been clearer
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
Cant see myself when I look in the mirror
She my number one I dont need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and dont want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself Im strong enough to shake it and Im trying
But Im only human I know loving yous a crime
If I take this cookie now one day Ill do the time
I love her I dont want to lose her
Im selfish I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin
At home I look happy as usual
On the road Im a mack Im a chooser
Im a addict Im maskin that
Kevins Heart
They tell me Whats done in the dark
Will find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
Whats done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
