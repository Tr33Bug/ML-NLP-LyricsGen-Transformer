This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
Thats when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla shit
Thats the least I owed her cause see I tried to hit
On the first night and nah I aint proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it huh
And I never called back how thoughtfulless
Now Im standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying Ill hit her back knowing Im never gon call she was hurtin
Now shes staring dead in my face she was smirking
Like Yeah I remember and nah you aint worth shit nigga
You aint worth shit nigga
Hm this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
