Freedom or jail clips inserted a babys bein born
Same time my man is murdered the beginning and end
As far as rap go its only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
Yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas raps and tape em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward whod a thought that I would meet him on tour
Im earnin stripes now a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand let em know that hes the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though cause I was in a jam
Hov askin wheres the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin out for months 9th inning feelin fear
Jeter under pressure made the biggest hit of my career
But at first that wasnt clear niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said You the one yo why you make that shit
I cant believe I let Nas down

I cant believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone fuck it
Long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible
Now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
I couldnt help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean you made You Owe Me
Dog I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin
Wheres the hits You aint got none
You know Jayll never put your album out without none
And dog you know how come
Labels are archaic formulaic with they outcome
They dont know they just study the charts
Me I studied the shows the fans study they hearts
I had a feelin I was killin and this music we were spillin out
Would change lives forever fuck the label put it out
Friday Night Lights blew that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin true
Still no release date from the label are they insane
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
Im ashamed I let Nas down
But this is Gods plan you can never understand fuck it
Long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce em to honesty show em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OGs for sacrificin my art
But Im here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
Im just a man of the people not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Dont cry Mama this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I dont lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that HipHop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it
Letting Nas down I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned dog I let Nas down
Yeah and on this flight
May I never lose sight fuck it
Long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heards a tale of glory and sin
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
