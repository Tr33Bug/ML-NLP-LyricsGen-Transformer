Baby girl I cant imagine what its like for you
I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin if this is gon make me think bout wifin you
Like if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you
Now I aint tryna pick a fight with you Im tryna talk
Now I aint tryna spend the night with you Im kinda lost
See Ive been givin it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we aint ready and this
Hold up now let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself
Handle biz by ourself A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon live Where am I gon get that money
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I aint got shit to give em and Im not with them niggas
Who be knockin girls up and skate out
So girl you gotta think about how the options weigh out
Whats the way out
Uh
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it
She said Nigga you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin about abortion
This my body nigga so dont think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act so typical
Said you love me oh but now you flippin like reciprocals
It figures though I shouldve known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw mothafucka
Now Im pregnant you dont wanna get involved mothafucka
Tryna take away a lifeis you God mothafucka
I dont think so This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if Im your wife this new life here Ima love it
I aint budgin I just do this by my mothafuckin self
See my mama raised me without no mothafuckin help
From a man but I still dont understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
Bout your father And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin about he a coward and you so glad that you aint that nigga
Cause he left your mama when she had you and he aint shit
And here you go doin the same shit You aint shit nigga
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes I cry sometimes about it
And boy this shit hurts and aint nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes I cry sometimes about it
And boy this shit hurts and aint nobody perfect
Still we can make it work but you doubt it
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
Shed put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she aint no wife though
Uhoh She tellin him she missed her period like typos
He panickin froze up like a mannequin a life grows
Inside her and now he askin Is it even mine
What if this bitch aint even pregnant Dog could she be lyin
And she be cryin cause he actin distant
Like Ever since I told you this nigga you actin different
And all his niggas sayin Man these hoes be trappin niggas
Playin with niggas emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral its like extortion
Man if that bitch really pregnant tell her to get a abortion  Uh 
But what about your seed nigga  Uhuh 
But what about your seed nigga
But what about your seed nigga
But what about your seed nigga
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime I cry sometimes about it
And I aint too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime I cry sometimes about it
