I guess the neighbors think Im sellin dope sellin dope
Okay the neighbors think Im sellin dope  sellin dope
Sellin dope sellin dope sellin dope
Yeah I dont want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin again
pologize if Im harpin again
I know these things happen often
But Im back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this the team down in Austin
I been buildin me a house
Back home in the South ma
Wont believe what its costin
And its fit for a king right
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen shouldve came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin
Thats why I moved away I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students thats recruited highly
Thinkin You do you and I do me
Crib has got a big ol back ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana laughin hard
Thankful that they friends a platinum star
In the driveway theres no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh this is pure
Well help you if youve felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait I think police is at the door
Okay the neighbors think Im sellin dope
Hm I guess the neighbors think Im sellin dope sellin dope
The neighbors think Imneighbors think Im
Dont follow me dont follow me 
I think the neighbors think Im sellin dope
Dont follow me dont follow me 
I guess the neighbors think Im sellin dope sellin dope
Sellin dope sellin dope sellin dope
Well motherfucker I am
Some things you cant escape
Death taxes and a ra
cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel damn its late
I cant sleep cause Im paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news in chains damn
Dont follow me
Dont follow me
Dont follow me
Dont follow me
Okay the neighbors think Im sellin dope
Hm I guess the neighbors think Im sellin dope sellin dope
The neighbors think Imneighbors think Im
Dont follow me dont follow me 
I think the neighbors think Im sellin dope
Dont follow me dont follow me 
I guess the neighbors think Im sellin dope sellin dope
Sellin dope sellin dope sellin dope
Well motherfucker I am
I am I am I am I am
Well motherfucker I am
I think the neighbors think Im sellin dope
I am I am I am
Well motherfucker I am
So much for integration
Dont know what I was thinkin

So much for integration
Dont know what I was thinkin
Im movin back to south side
