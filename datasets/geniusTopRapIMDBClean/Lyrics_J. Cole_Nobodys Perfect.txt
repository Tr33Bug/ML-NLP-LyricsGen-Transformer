Yeah this is for all the fans that waited the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated look Mama we made it
Your son out in Barbados cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin weed on the beach as my mind workin like Platos
Analyzin the world fantasizin bout girls
Im handin diamonds and pearls and vandalizin her curls
Sweatin her weave out moans as she breathes out
Fuck Im doin in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha death over dishonor
They killin niggas for Js thats death over designer
Hey Cole heatin up like that leftover lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dwana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas

And we always argue bout the same thing
And tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing same thing

Smoke a little weed but her shit together
