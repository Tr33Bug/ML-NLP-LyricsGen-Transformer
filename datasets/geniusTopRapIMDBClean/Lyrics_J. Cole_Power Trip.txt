Okay back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent money well spent
No heater but a nigga made heat may I vent
Had a thing for ya even wrote the song Dreams for ya
Cause I had dreams for ya thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov took a power trip
Back home Im grown now and the citys my throne now huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Krossd totally crossed out
Cause now Im in this bitch and Im totally bossed out
Old chicks crying cause they know that they lost out
But Im still on you Im still on you
My drink spill on me while I feel on you Im sayin
Would you believe me if I said Im in love
Baby I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said Im in love
Baby I want ya

Love is a drug like the strongest stuff ever and

She on a power trip she got me where she want a nigga
Wifeing in the club man my homies gon disown a nigga

Ass stupid how you get to college college

Went and found a man but Im hopin youre alone now
Cant help but feeling like I dropped the ball clich
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freezeframed yelling Please play
For Petes sake homie pull it together
