Ayo ayo ayo ah ayo ah
Ayo ayo ayo ah
Yeah
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I aint never had a lot damn it
Who you had to kill Who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top damn it
Or maybe thats daddy money escalator no ladder money
Escalade new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause Im bad with money
Crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I aint tripping
Nigga Jordan and I aint Pippen yeah
Up the steps I aint slipping
Tears blood sweat and I aint cripping
Heres a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you aint alone shit
When your momma aint at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit bout your steppops
How he was a dog now look at you
I aint bad as that nigga plus dawg Im a grown man now
I aint mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
Id be glad its that nigga nigga
Did Kay dirty now its back to broke
Refund checks used that to float
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Couldve drowned but I grabbed the rope
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing you got what I want I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
You got what I want I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I aint never had a lot damn it
Niggas cant front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie dont quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now know you felt the shit just now
Aint there more to you Dont it ever get boring to you
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this aint the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched lil Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
Its like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got and now a nigga dont paint the same damn
I guess he cant complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame my brain the same
Yeah nigga at least he aint insane
At least he aint insane
You aint crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change
Thats new maybe thats true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Mnages
Just one bitch dont feel the same no more
And Henny dont really kill the pain no more
Now Im Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I cant maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money cant save your soul
But there go you
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you and there go you and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing you got what I want I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
You got what I want I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
How much for your soul Anna
