Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly Ive never had much sympathy
Cause those bad things I always saw them coming for me

With a bad bitch in his ear sayin that she down for whatever

Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire

Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose
And she knows she knows

And deep down she knows she knows
And I know she knows and I know she knows
