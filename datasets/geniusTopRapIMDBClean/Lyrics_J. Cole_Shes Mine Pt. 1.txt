Shes Mine Pt 1 Lyrics
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive  I never felt so alive 
I never felt so alive  I never felt so alive 
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die  Dont wanna die no more 
Cause now youre here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
Ill dry your eyes
Ill dry your eyes
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11s
You read me like a book like Im the Bible you the Reverend
Yeah I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons Im this way
I would like to paint a picture but itll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall thats stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father and the passing of my peers
While Im too scared to expose myself
It turns out you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how bout that
She gets him  you get me 
She hugs him  you kiss me 
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you I believe you
She gets him  you get me 
She hugs him  you kiss me 
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you I believe you
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
