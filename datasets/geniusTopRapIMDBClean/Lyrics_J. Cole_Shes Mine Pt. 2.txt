Shes Mine Pt 2 Lyrics
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you
Catch me Ive fallen in love for the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit on this bus I sit
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin me wantin me givin me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin me
Handcuffs keep huggin the wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they cant afford
Even with the discount write a check that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit it dont matter the amount
We just swipin shit here we dont love we just likin shit here
Whats that smell Wheres your diaper shit here
Lay on your back dont pee right now
Or else Ill have to get you back
One day when you gon want to get your way
Yeah Ill have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I aint never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking


Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift  Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see  Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me  Someone more important than me 
Am I worthy of this gift  Am I worthy of this gift 
Am I strong enough to lift  Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see  Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me  Someone more important than me 
Ib gon ask me how I did this shit
Im gon do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
Shes mine  Catch me dont you
Shes mine  Catch me dont you
Shes mine  Catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die cause now youre here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin baby
I dry your eyes I dry your eyes
There is a God it is a God
Yeah it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive 
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive 
Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you
Catch me Ive fallen in love for the first time
