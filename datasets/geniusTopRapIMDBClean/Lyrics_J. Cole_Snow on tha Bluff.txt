Niggas be thinkin Im deep intelligent fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average theres a young lady out there she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times and I started to read
She mad at these crackers she mad at these capitalists mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas she mad at our ignorance she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities lowkey I be thinkin she talkin bout me
Now I aint no dummy to think Im above criticism
So when I see something thats valid I listen
But shit its something about the queen tone thats botherin me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts em
And the clearest understandin of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people dont see
Just cause you woke and Im not that shit aint no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon lead when you attackin the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin
Instead of conveyin you holier come help us get up to speed
Shit its a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees cant grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe
Im on some Fuck a retweet most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon reach
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say its more effective to treat people like children
Understandin the time and love and patience thats needed to grow
This change is inevitable but aint none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin just maybe in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like Im some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros thats next to the commas
But look here I promise Im not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like Wait
He was like Cole preciate what you been doin my nigga thats real
But damn why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff
Well maybe cause deep down I know I aint doin enough
The sun is shinin today
The sun is shinin today
The sun is shinin today
Can you walk with me
I hope well find the reason why we often sob go on cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child Ive gotten older
Still I know Im just a boy in Gods eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive help mine thrive
