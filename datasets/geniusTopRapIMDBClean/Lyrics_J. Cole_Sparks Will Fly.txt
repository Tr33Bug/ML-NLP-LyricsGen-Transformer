It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didnt have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down and so they clowned on me
Down for me my homie
You better believe I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money cant buy you happiness thats true as hell
But happiness cant buy yo ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin shit
Ride or die chick fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
I know my style aint perfect
I know my smile aint perfect
Nigga aint perfect its true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo true
Now what you crying for
She says you aint gon settle down what you lyin for
She want that old thing back
Things aint the same think we both seen that
Love is war end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you dont swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip only girl in my life is you
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too and we and we
And we fly too
Feels as though our worlds crashing down
We cant forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
Itll get better
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out were tired
We only need to stay close in time
Sparks will fly
