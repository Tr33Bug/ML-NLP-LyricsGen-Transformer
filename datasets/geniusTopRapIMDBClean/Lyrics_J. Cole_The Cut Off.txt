But I cant seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lords and its not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily Why you not with me

My heart is big I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and dont hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone you need a loan oh Im a crutch now

You never would split you was hood rich
I couldnt get a dollar from you I remember that
