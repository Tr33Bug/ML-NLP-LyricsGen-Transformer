Ima be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now thats hard for me
Im dreaming violent I cant tolerate disloyalty
So Ima see you when I see you know that day comin
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize bout murder cause Im still sane
But I cant seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lords and its not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily Why you not with me
I had to cut some people off cause they was using me
My heart is big I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and dont hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone you need a loan oh Im a crutch now
I had to learn I never had shit
You never would split you was hood rich
I couldnt get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now its coming back  coming back
