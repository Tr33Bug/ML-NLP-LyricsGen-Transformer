I said  Set it off on my left set it off on my right
I said  Liquor all on my breath bitches all in my sight
I said  Real niggas tryna fuck fuck niggas wanna fight
I said  Gun shots into the air but I aint scared for my life
I said 
Troubles of this troubles of this world
Troubles of this troubles of this world
Yeah god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo Picasso
Niggas say Live fast die young so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago my hat wasnt cocked yo
Kept it straight shit cause yall know
And if not youll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I aint fuck her but Im thinking bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it
The bitch want too much hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Aint worth the stress
First the text then the draws see first is sex
Then its calls cause the birds obsessed
Want flowers cards and the purses next
Nah bitch cant get a dollar
Cole on Twitter bitch cant get a follow
Can get a nut heard Cant Get Enough
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way Jose
Could write a book called The Things Hoes Say
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
Im in trouble
Troubles of this troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You dont want problems I promise man
Troubles of this troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You dont want problems I promise man
Set it off on my left set it off on my right
I said  Liquor all on my breath bitches all in my sight
I said  Real niggas tryna fuck fuck niggas wanna fight
I said  Gun shots into the air but I aint scared for my life
I said 
And Im going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and Im grabbing her ass
She like Dont you know this shit already
Nigga aint you rich already
Yeah but I got dumb as shit
Hanging round these rappers cause they dumb as shit
But Im back on track jump shot wasnt that good
Couldnt sell crack but I rap good
Thats one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas thatll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree I let em scoop ya
Im Koopa I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I aint fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans dont know they mans dont know fo sho
Had a nigga baby little mans dont know
Mama was a freak got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on he ask
Mama did you fuck J Cole
Whoa
Troubles of this troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You dont want problems I promise man
Troubles of this troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You dont want problems I promise man
Set it off on my left set it off on my right
I said  Liquor all on my breath bitches all in my sight
I said  Real niggas tryna fuck fuck niggas wanna fight
I said  Gun shots into the air but I aint scared for my life
