Im a born sinner
But I die better than that I swear
Its way darker this time
Laughs
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov now Im in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Cole time to get paid blow up like the World Trade
Sometimes I brag like Hov sometimes Im real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet Im real life hot homie
Get your weight up fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I dont mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot okay faggot
Uh dont be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass thats between you and whoever elses dick it is
Pause maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya Boy Meets World Im tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James wait a minute thats strange
Sip a bit of champagne say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Diggah Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later Id be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didnt want it it was fuck him again
One day he gon regret playing me
Little did I know in a year hed be fucking paying me what could you say to me I
Beat the odds like Vegas I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free pardon me
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back and I aint ever letting go
Im the prince of the city I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldnt blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi Israeli
And so Im wondering really what could you actually tell me
Im tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause hes sorry
Fucked up education would ask for reparations
But Im probably just gon go and buy Ferraris vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in em
Im in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil now Im pleading with him
Like give me my soul
My nigga I aint ever letting you go again
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I aint ever letting go
But the Devil dont play fair
Im bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
Im bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
Im bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
Im bout to go and join the Illuminati
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires Im sure that they can do without me
And I aint really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more As I wouldve been a summa cuma laude
Beyonc told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what Im worth I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
Im praying I dont see em at the Oscars Oscars
Hey J Cole this way hey
Oh hey whats up Whats goin on with you Okay
Big smile man big smile let me see that crooked smile
J Cole J Cole this way look this way
Oh friend hug friend hug just keep it friendly
We friends friends
Readjustin my target audience cause its obvious
Ive gone astray losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSexLoveSounds
Whats playing in my mind just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here Mask my tears but I
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
I aint ever letting go

Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov

Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
