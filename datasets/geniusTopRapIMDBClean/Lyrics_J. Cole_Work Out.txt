I want to see you work out for me work out for me
Ayy weve got a good thing
Dont know if Ima see you again
But is that a good thing
Cause girl I cant be your man no maam
I know whats on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like Is it the real thing
Or is it just a onenight stand
Well then
Let me see you get high then go low
Now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
Im here for one night how far will you go
I wanna see you  Work out for me work out for me 
High then go low
Now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
Im here for one night how far will you go
I wanna see you  Work out for me work out for me 
She like them boys with the big ol chains
Ridin around town in a big ol Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol jeans
Now the little nigga doin big ol thangs
Would you look at that I came back for her
Just to give it to ya like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her Baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I aint from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what yo nigga make in one year
Thats unfair but so is life take a chance roll the dice
Money cant buy you love cause its overpriced
Dont overthink just hope its right
Im only here for the night


Ayy weve got a good thing
Dont know if Ima see you again
But is that a good thing
Cause girl I cant be your man no maam
I know whats on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like Is it the real thing
Or is it just a onenight stand
Well then
Let me see you get high then go low
Now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
Im here for one night how far will you go
I wanna see you  Work out for me work out for me 
High then go low
Now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
Im here for one night how far will you go
I wanna see you  Work out for me work out for me
