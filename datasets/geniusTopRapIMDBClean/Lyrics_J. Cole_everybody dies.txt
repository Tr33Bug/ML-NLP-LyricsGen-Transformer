Yeah we back
Back in Mohammad crib nigga top floor
The back room with just the one little small window nigga
The light be comin through it in the morning
Oldass walls and shit
But its just like I remember just like I wanted it
Yeah Im workin
Yeah Im workin nigga
Look its the return of the Mr Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested just perfectly blessed with
A style that you cant F with protection recommended
Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper left him independent
Cryin in the corner
Cause I aint into sorta kinda dissin niggas
Im borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close if he dont duck then he ghost
Aint no need for discussion
If they werent talkin bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The wouldyoutakeabreakplease rappers
Bunch of words and aint sayin shit I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil whatever  just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin next to 64 rappers
The streets dont fuck with you you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man you hit store rappers
I reload the clip then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin on these pisspoor rappers Im back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue Im good at gettin cheddar
Reminisce on days I didnt eat
If its meant to be then itll be
If its not then fuck it Ima try
Aint no need to ask the Father why no
Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die my nigga my nigga
