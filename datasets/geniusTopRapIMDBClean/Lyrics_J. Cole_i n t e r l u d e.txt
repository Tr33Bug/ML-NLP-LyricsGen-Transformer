Im a livin little good thing
Its like you never lived for me yeah
Mama said you was a good thing uh
Good good good yeah
Yeah
We came a long way man we done came a long way
And we sittin on top of this shit
This shit can go one of two ways
This shit can go up it can go down
Either way nigga Im prepared
Feel me Yeah
I be comin in peace but fuck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week seen yo mama weep
Crying cause she dont wan bury your brother
The blood laks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby lik surrogate mothers
Woah thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized wouldnt trade it for nothin
Through hard times it was there I discovered
A hustle and makin the best out the struggle
I kept grindin til this day up a level
Respect mine gotta stay out of trouble
Cause TEC9s like to air out rebuttals
Cole World niggas knowin what it is
Just in case they dont I show em what it is
This summer I do real numbers
Couldnt dare touch it if they sold a double disc
Block hot niggas burnin up the street
Shots poppin and we heard it up the street
Its a war niggas runnin up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Was his niggas gettin murdered every week
Dead bodies smell the odor in the street
My homie homie got out on parole
He sold more CocaCola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin 60s
Christ went to Heaven age thirtythree
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey
I told you I told you
This shit can go up it can go down I dont give a fuck
Nigga I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And Ive seen the lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now Im at your neck nigga yeah
