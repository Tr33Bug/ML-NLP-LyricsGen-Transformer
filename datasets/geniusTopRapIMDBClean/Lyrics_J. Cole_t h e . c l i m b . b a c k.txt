Are you doin this work to facilitate growth or to become famous
Which is more important
Getting or letting go
You can do anything anything you can do  You can do anything 
You can do anything anything you can do  You can do anything 
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take fore you smile
This is that comebacktolife shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon  Bitch Im back out 
Yeah
To the left of that decimal I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And youll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point more two guards
Enough straps to fill four UHauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues Lord those images hauntin
I aint been asleep yet its ten in the mornin
Im sendin a warnin a problem with me is like the BET HipHop Awards
Im startin to see you niggas dont want it
Im sick of this flauntin from niggas I know for sure aint got mo dough than Cole
Trash rappers ass backwards tryna go toetotoe
We laugh at ya staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil tune called Foldin Clothes and a nigga still aint known to fold under pressure
Well you know what Cole do
Make a diamond they just rhymin me Im quotin gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the GOAT like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin threepiece sofa
Im known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen thats how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin coke and not the pros and cons
Well I aint with that sleepin underground like a gopher so I go for mines


Everything come back around full circle  Nigga gotta go for mines 
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful  Yeah 
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take fore you smile
This is that comebacktolife shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon  Yeah 
Survival at all costs every day niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin a funeral procession while holdin my breath in the car I thought
At times it be feelin the devil be winnin but do that mean God lost
Just got off the phone with my nigga he back in the kennel my dog lost
I brought him round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes wed meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low he feelin that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs but theyre in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin up all yo groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me I felt its potency
Said Most of these niggas gon hang themselves just give em the rope and see
Shit I heeded that and what got showed to me
Was screamin that some niggas you gotta leave em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin me uh
Meanwhile I see that yo diamonds is glistenin
Im glad that you shinin but need I remind you my niggas is dimin and nickelin
Scrapin up whatever coin they can find the pettiest crime they committin it
Just to get by for a limited time the steepest of mountains they tryin to climb
Im here tryna find the derivative you niggas dont feel me
You see the clout you dont see the real me
If I was sick you niggas wouldnt heal me
Therefore Im healin myself gettin in tune with my God
Slowly revealin myself buildin my wealth
A nigga touch mine Ima kill em myself trust me
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take fore you smile
This is that comebacktolife shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon  Yeah 
Bitch Im back outside nigga
Im back outside
Im back outside
Im back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man they even made a hotline
To call up when theres tension but I got a question
What about a fuckin homicide
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever theres a urge to get triggers involved
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever theres a urge to get triggers involved
