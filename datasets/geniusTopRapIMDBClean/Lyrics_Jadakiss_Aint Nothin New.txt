Seeing if a sevendigit check cleared
All in the connects ear
Driving cars that come out next year
Block lit all I did was come out for some fresh air
Big chain nice watch fresh gear heck yeah
Killers respect killers soft niggas respect fear
Crazy cause I love it but I hate it that I rep there
Sad part about it is that I made it when I left there
Sorry to whoever anticipated my death here
You die they hope dont sleep stay woke
The more money you get the more its your fault they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood thats how they do though
Cause aint nothin new yo what
This aint nothin new this aint nothin new
To nigga like me man this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this aint what I do
This aint nothin new it aint nothin new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
Cause round here man see see this an everyday thing
No it aint nothin new
Never turn down when its on Im front line
Always respected whats real I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin in life you so live
If you have some smut on your name you cant grind
Over reputation and pride we gon die
When the police asked for the truth I told lies
And when I finally got in this booth my soul cried
Once you off the stoop its through you no child
Aint make no excuse for your youth or no size
See me I graduated these streets in 05
Still live and die by these rules you know why
This aint nothin new this aint nothin new
To nigga like me man this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this aint what I do
This aint nothin new it aint nothin new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
Cause round here man see see this an everyday thing
No it aint nothin new


HAHAAAEEH
Nah the bars are still lethal
You aint the top til the stars are underneath you
God shuffles the deck but the cards come from the people
Speakin from a place where the odds are under equal  YO 
Yeah end of discussion
Aint nothin new I vocally destroy any production  woo 
Go get your crew put my prints on the semi Im bustin
Grateful I know the difference between plenty and nothin
Im on the block on the crate sippin Henny and puffin
And even though its all love keep your enemies lustin
Lick a shot off then let two go
Let me off the leash Im like Koojo
This aint nothin new yo what
This aint nothin new this aint nothin new
To nigga like me man this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this aint what I do
This aint nothin new it aint nothin new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
Cause round here man see see this an everyday thing
No it aint nothin new
