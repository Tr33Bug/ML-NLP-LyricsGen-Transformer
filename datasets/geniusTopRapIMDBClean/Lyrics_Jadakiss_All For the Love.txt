Whats the deally yo
I gotta squeeze the juice outta the headphones
Jadakiss 
Yeah  I like that 
Squeeze the juice outta the headphones
Yo yo yo
When you think of me you think of a problem
Who What When and how you gonna solve em
Automatic or revolving
The K I double S and Heres the lesson
Most beams is infared but mines is flourescent
No matter where you go Imma spot you
No matter how many people you put me in front of Imma rock you
And if you try to be the hard top Imma drop you
I got to treat you like the clutch and pop you
Creep threw in the 420 with your honey
Cuz you aint nuthin but a playboy that turned bunny
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money
In these bullshit games these chickens try to run me
Yall know yall cant touch us I flow luscious
Its so real I make her hop out and get the dutches
Im sittin on a thousand birds and I hide from the cameras  why 
Cuz a pictures worth a thousand words
Since yall herbs yall get what yall deserve
Yall do the catering while we just get served
And you got some nerve for PHing
Jason do you have any idea who you facing
Just something about my shit youll never figure out
Its too hot burning my mouth thats why I spit it out
It must be real hard for yall to listen
And its sad niggas is to broke to pay attention
Chilling sittin on about half a million
And all my niggas all my guns all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
Chilling sittin on about half a million
And all my niggas all my guns all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
Hey yo niggas know the line of work Bullet proof designer shirt
Rolling with a China Doll Shell be reminding yall
Don of the underworld every block monitored of course
Jadakiss and LOX boss
A pro cause I grow off the shit that I absorb
You just another so and so trying to flow going broke
You trying to buy property set it up for growing coke
Niggas making a movie so I came to edit
Wiping everybody out right before the credits
Im a hard guy to get along with get on a song with
When shit be going right I flip into the wrong shit
The prime artist expect me to rhyme hardest
Slash con artist gonna get mine regardless
I aint even big and I size niggas up
Cuz they eyes give em up look at em and see they butt
Im 22 with 10 ends so there that go
You hear that flow that drove the underground wacko
Every since 12 Ive been spittin like tabacco
Relax though Pop the tape CD and the wax though
They wonder how but the thing about ours
We open up 24 hours
Niggas dont sleep with eat so when they speak it mean power
So you should keep quiet you a coward
About to be layed out flat and pushing up flowers


Chilling sittin on about half a million
And all my niggas all my guns all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
Chilling sittin on about half a million
And all my niggas all my guns all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing
