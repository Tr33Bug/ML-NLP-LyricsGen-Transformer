Yeah ride out if I aint got no money
How Im losin weight  huh  HAHAAAEEH
Ride out  DBlock 
Gather round yall its goin down yall
Block work twentyeight for the pound yall
If he the king I put a round in his crown yall
He just talkin but he pussy in the town yall
I air em out then put em in the ground yall
Hit him in the church if he prayin on my downfall
Its either this or you wicked with a round ball
Its a burial whenever we sound off
Hands to the nohander right after the round off
Peanut butter guts chocolate brown Porsche
Word to Spanish Jos we was movin the most yay
Had my boys runnin and gunnin sound like Coach K
Listen duke you can shoot but you know that its both ways
My gun splash brothers I call em Curry and Klay
In a hurry to get buried ever fuckin with J
Ah Dave come on nigga I see you ridin the wave
Brave like the crackers that helped hide the slaves
Keep talkin I kill you then slide in your babe
You got a homie up top I have him die in a cage
And you triggerhappy cant wait to fire the gauge
Go out on your shield or you die in a blaze
Gunfire one liar gon put the truth in a maze
I got the truck off the sour got a coupe from the haze
In the telly down south I got me a few dames
We aint fuckin but we stuffin they pussy with cocaine
Whipped out fuck around and hop on the 2 train
Robbed the first and last car to show you some true pain
Wolf on the phone when I show you a few fangs
Its a different kind of hot my nigga its blue flames
Dudes is startin to get out of pocket loose change
Hard part tryin to stay still move things
Right before you about to murder someone your mood change
We came up like ninety bricks
We had the city under siege since 96
Go online still wont find these kicks
Like Frank White when he did the Chinese hit
Thats it its us then everybody else after
Our part of the good books a rough chapter
Everything dead serious enough laughter
Fronto leaves Raw papers and Dutch Masters yeah
You re more you see more
They tearin shit up on the streets in Bmore
Some people dont know what its like to be poor
The hood is a oneway aint no detour
You know the love course the hate come free yall
Those who protect and serve will knock your seed off
The energy is negative its not to feed off
Shitll cool down when we knock the heat off
Get it RIP Freddie Gray
Rest in peace homie that they shot in the back in South Carolina
Eric Garner Mike Brown Glennis rest in peace baby girl
And all yall rappers HAHAAAEEH Haha one
