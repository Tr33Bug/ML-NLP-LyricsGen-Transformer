One
The headphones is on fire this time around Styles
My blood pressure is building
Yo last time Ima tell these niggas man
Niggas cant fuck around man
Jada man whoever old nigga new nigga what
Yo yo yo
Who really the best rapper since BIG aint here
Yall know the answer to that when Kiss in here
When you see me dont ask me nothin about us
And dont definitely ask me nothin about
Fuck it you owe me one I owe you two
I woulda smacked you with the burner but I know youd sue
And I aint talkin to him Im talkin to you
Matter of fact talkin to yall life is like walkin a yard
Niggas will stab you with a fork in the heart
And The Source got motherfuckers thinkin they hot
Like my dope got fiends thinkin they shot
When you thinkin of the best nigga think of The Lox
Ill cut your fuckin hand off if your pinky rings hot
Then come through your block in a sticky green drop
Hop out let off fiftythree shots
Wouldnt care if I hit fiftythree cops
Giuliani might as well be murkin niggas
Cause the time that he givin out is hurtin niggas
And all these record labels jerkin niggas
And you never was a thug yous a workin nigga
And you heard that shit right there I started that
Dont make me put somethin up in your Starter hat
No matter who you are or where you from
Screw all of that Im not tryin to hear that son
Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
Dont you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip
Thats gon get the second half of the clip know what Im sayin
Or be the other nigga in the front of the the whip
Runnin his lips with a gun on his hip feel me dawg
Everybody walk the walk til they run into Kiss
Then they get stabbed or hung or stung with the fifth
How you think your man hard when son on my dick
Cause I can get his ass bodied plus front him a brick
Got a chick named Superhead she give superhead
Just moved in the buildin even gave the super head
I cop big guns that spit super lead
So play Superman end up super dead
Call me Kiss or the kid from The Lox
Thatll twist your moms out and do a bid with your pops
We was in jail you probably wont get no mail
And if you pumped on my block you wont get no sales
When your CEO know you cant fuck with I
I make a million by June Im sayin fuck July
And I beg you to try me while Im holdin the Tommy
Ima have your body all over the lobby
I already helped yall Im about to melt yall
Tell the truth dawg I aint never felt yall
This album we gon bubble like Seltzer
If it aint Double R who the hell else is hard


Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
Who the fuck yall want  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck yall need  Jadakiss 
And who the fuck gon bleed All yall haters
Cause none of yall niggas cant fuck with Jada
