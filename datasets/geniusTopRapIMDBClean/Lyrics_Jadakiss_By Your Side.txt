Ill be by your side Ill always find a way
General we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches you wanna go to war HAHAAAEEH
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
By your side 
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They cant stop me even if my brakes was on
Im still  by your side 
Im always here nobodys perfect life aint always fair
I used to not give a fuck I aint always care
When its too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right  by your side 
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I dont get you today then Ima get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib Ima be right  by your side 
Where Im supposed to be
Close to you with the toast close to me
And screw it if its the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team  by your side 
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
By your side by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
As long as you need me
Im down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy right  by your side 
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin and you thought they were scrappin witcha you
Now you cleanin your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right  by your side 
Puttin tubes in you
And you cant even eat right they puttin food in you
Your bodys getting colder Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her  by your side 
Nothin but realness
Thats why everybody in the world could feel this
Im on top and yall under me
So when its over if I aint in the front
At least Im gonna be  by your side 
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
By your side by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
Until they finish me off
If they dont get us both youll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor stick to our little plan
And fuck the money just keep my little man  by your side 
And show em theres hope
And he gon think he know how its going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store show him the loafs
Hood niggas Im just showing you growth
But Im still right  by your side 
You know Kiss
Dont gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be  by your side 
The answers plenty
Cause when you handling business you cant be friendly
And if you tryin to stack something cant be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep em  by your side 
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
By your side by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
Id find you
By your side
By your side
By your side
By your side
