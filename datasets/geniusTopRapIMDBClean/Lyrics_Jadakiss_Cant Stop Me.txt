Ummm hmmm yes I does that
Stays hot I aint gotta get my buzz back
What everybody tryin to be now I was that
They could never stop me thats why I love rap
Been livin the life crazy ice
Hit the baddest chicks in the world maybe twice
The swag the gear the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny cause I had the Vision since Coleco
Back then still aint reach my peak though
Louis loafers Polo peak coat
Call me whenever the bosses meet yo
Uh I drove papi crazy
So the industry never gon stop me baby
You cant stop me now you cant stop me
No you cant stop me now you cant stop me
You cant stop me now you cant stop me  You cant stop me baby 
You cant stop me now you cant stop me
No you cant stop me now you cant stop me
You cant stop me now you cant stop me  You cant stop me baby 
Yo Im a call it confidence cause I aint cocky
I just know one thing they cant stop me
Whether Im on 5th or LA at the swap meet
Its all good cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one niggas cant guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knock kneed
Got too hot for the grams who got weed
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six quick to blow three
Audio heroin so you dont OD
Shooters know you but you dont know me
The block is crazy cant stop me baby uh


You cant stop me now you cant stop me
No you cant stop me now you cant stop me
You cant stop me now you cant stop me  You cant stop me baby 
You cant stop me now you cant stop me
No you cant stop me now you cant stop me
You cant stop me now you cant stop me  You cant stop me baby 
Yo once I start I aint gon stop the squeezin
And the gauze aint gon be able to stop the bleedinN
And your girl aint gon be able to stop the wheezin  nah 
When she get that phone call from the doc we even
You could not stop me so stop believin
Ringtone rap this is not the season
Punch lines hard enough to stop your breathin
And the ladiesll still pay a lot to see him
Im a get rich long as I got my freedom
Usually when you get hit its for a reason
If you in the hood better dodge the Dsand
Watch your Qsand be on your Ps and
Thank yall all for comin out this evening
Havin a good time with your liquor and treason
Even if they knock me then continue to watch me
They still wouldnt be able to stop me

No you cant stop me now you cant stop me
You cant stop me now you cant stop me  You cant stop me baby 
You cant stop me now you cant stop me
