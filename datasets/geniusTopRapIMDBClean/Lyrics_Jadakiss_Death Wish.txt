They must got a death wish
Cause they was on the road to the riches
Back in the day but they got off on the exit
Real disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment its hard to digest it
These young niggas dont wanna get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on em and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they living in the 80s
And shorties that they knew since they were babies turned crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody lookin like they gettin a couple dollars
Could fuck suck and swallow
Aint nobody winning but everybody cant lose
The dirts still there funeral home aint move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Youd rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you cant escape it
Dust smoking niggas walking round in the matrix
Loyalty is thin the tension is thick
Look at a broke niggas face when you mention a brick
Stickup kids come around when they sense that you rich
Candles and lizzle get lit when you get hit with the fifth
Niggas that used to hoop dream is now selling the piff
And they still ratting but you cant tell if you stiff
Especially when the Tec spit
Fuck around get your head and your neck hit looking for a death wish
Talking out your mouth all reckless
To a nigga that you know thatll let it off thats a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help dont come in enough time thats a death wish
When you see the blood and realize that your chest is hit
And dont know where it came from thats a death wish
When you know a nigga whole styles on some next shit
And you violate em thats a death wish
Young Money
Ahh I be on that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch its WeezyF bitch Im the best bitch
Motherfuck your guest list I be like lets just
Kill him and get breakfast neck slit
Next shit expect this every time you check this
Im exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
And Im from the Mecca of the reckless with a recordbreaking death list
The reckless and neglecters think the election wont affect us
Im high above you above law above average
Niggas snitching put niggas in a can like a beverage
Damn I pop at your head fuck up your memories
I put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah if you dont remember shit you goin remember this
Im knocking niggas down this year Im on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit

Cold as December shit bang in any weather shit
And they could buy your bag with body parts sold separate
Yeah thats a bet bitch like Russian Roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in a bottle heres your death wish
