One thing about pain pain is universal
It dont matter how much money you got
It dont  matter how bad your financial situation is
Pain is the one thing that everybody in the world can relate to
You cant run from it you cant escape it
Its really a part of life
Its all about how you deal with it
Them decisions you make on how you deal with it will determine
Just how bad your next experience with pain will be
And thats a fact
Sometimes I ask the Lord Is this my calling
So many days  Ayy  the sky feel like its falling
Mama said Pray  Pray  you got the devil on you
Gotta clean your spirit cause your past is tryna haunt you
I was gettin so high I couldnt even function  Yeah 
If you dont want to die you gotta do somethin  Mmmm 
So many nights I cried early in the morning  Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah you gotta do somethin  Oh
