Ill tell you this much hiphop is not dead
Change gone come just like Barack said
Money power respect like The Lox said
Youll be the man of the house my pops said
Now can you picture me rolling like Pac said
Do it for the inmates and all of the hotheads
Heat the streets up right quick its all timing
Gucci everything Sierra Leone diamonds
Tell you this much 
This aint even a rap its a controlled substance
Yeah hold on 
You can curse You can curse 
Oh I can curse 
Headonhead collision Im a problem
And nobody can solve em Im long division
On the road of success but its more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
Know one of them is certain but the other one isnt
I made rare decisions rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied yall for years with listen
Like Im just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he aint care who did em
Didnt appreciate life and got aired for living
PCP by the liter good cheeba
Sergios tech sweat suits good Adidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days its different I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fifn it
Drug program two to four three to sixn it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You dont even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I dont think I can fit you in
Whats good for me aint good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
Yeah and you dont stop and you cant stop 
Yo a lot of niggas lost their pops to the drug game
Other niggas lost their blocks when the thugs came
They knew how to box aint know bout the slug game
As soon the money get right thats when the love change
Niggas know who to call when they want raw
Kiss is the cornerstone of the corner store
DBlock general he stay shining
In the back of the van 2K9ing
My dope so strong its giving fiends the hiccups
Coke so high it got niggas doing stickups
Found out another nigga dead light the piff up
Make sure one is in the head load the fifth up
Play my hand right baby I held aces
Nothing on the scene but blood and shellcases
Nike gloves on the team they cant trace us
Snitches in the witness protection getting facelifts
These niggas will never be able to fuck with me
Say my grace before I give em a buck fifty
The whole hood with me they hating we all spiffy
Everythings a short shot nothing iffy
Yeah Arpil 7th baby The Last Kiss you know what it is baby
