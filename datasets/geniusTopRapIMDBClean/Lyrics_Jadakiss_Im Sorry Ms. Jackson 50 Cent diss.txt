Im Sorry Ms Jackson  50 Cent diss  Lyrics
When its all said and done After they said Ive won
All Im going to say is
Im sorry Ms Jackson  Hey 
I am for real  Lets go 
Never meant to make your daughter cry  Uhuh 
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson  Sensitive ass nigga yeah 
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Tried to diss kiss to the world
And its your fault cause she said she saw you kissing a girl
The hood was behind her for her whole career
But now theyve slightly starting to disappeared
Something about that
Shes always angry
Might have been when them girls trying to push her scalp back
Needed some head room
So she went out and bought Tysons mansion with 18 bedrooms
Shes a domestic boss
That dont leave no marks though you got to digest those scars
In fact think you got to tell her to get back
Because every kiss rap is similar to a bitch slap
Too hard since way back in the school yard
Shes hollywood though all she needs is a boobjob
Girl in the bubble didnt mean to trouble her
Man but im a Calico im double her
Really think you should tell her to chill cause
My resume is longer than a doctor bill was
I did the song with ja rule bigging the city up
She did the magic stick remix with olivia
She got more money but I get busier
Think somebody going to end up killing her
When its all said and done
After they said Ive won
All Im going to say is


Im sorry Ms Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Hood had love for this bitch
Cause she came from south side queens with a thug ass click
Bitch got change and she changed
Now she dont fuck with the hood probably give a nigga brains
Bitch got boogie on a nigga
Went from the hood to hollywood got a movie on a nigga
Bitch talking greasy like new york sting
Sucking down south dick thats some new york thing
And the bitch used to be cool hood even liked the bitch
We used to listen to her gettin the weed
She had stories of many men times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see
Bitch aint shyt she was real good at bluffing it
Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with
Now thats a ho that you just cant trust
Hired cops thats a ho that you just cant touch
Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them Glocks
Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot
Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts
Want to front like shes gangsta but she got no heart
And she going to get hit by the mac and
All in the back and this time i bet the jaw will be cracking
Shes going to get broken to fractions d block is the faction
All i can say is im sorry ms jackson
Im sorry Ms Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
