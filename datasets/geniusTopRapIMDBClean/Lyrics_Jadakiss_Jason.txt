You got me feeling like I aint winning
Im starting from the beginning
Like I go Forrest go Forrest
I make so much fucking money yeah I go Forrest
These rims aint for sale bitch
This whip aint for sale bitch
And this Cuban aint for sale bitch
I been on the fucking boat like a sail bitch
500 feet on the fucking water
Ten fucking karats for my baby daughter
You come through boy place your order
I got some niggas thatll meet you at the fucking border
I got my hoodie and my mask on
I got my gun and my blast on
Dont shoot please cant breathe
Officer dont shoot cant breathe 
HAHAAAEEH Yo
Im just one of the five Im just one with the vibes
Even niggas is jealous so they just want you to die
They dont want you to rise they just want you demise
So I be crossing my Ts and I be dotting my Is
You on the opposite side shots gonna fly
Best part about it I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide
Keep a gun in the door thats all in the ride
Til my niggas come home free all of the guys
This shit is all a facade thought it was all a surprise
I heard of the stories seen all of the lies
Long as the work is official and the corner supplied
At the end of the day niggas we gonna survive what
Dont shoot please cant breathe
Officer dont shoot cant breathe 
I got my hoodie and my mask on
I got my gun and my blast on
Dont shoot please cant breathe
Officer dont shoot cant breathe 
Im just one of the five Im just one with the vibes
Cant figure it out or they dont wanna decide
In the gutter replying mic flooded with dimes
Since you asked Ima hit you with the butt of the nine
Bullets soaking in pine let em open your spine
Use your brain a little my nigga open your mind
If you aint in the circle for a square I get you line
I know niggas is telling I dont care about the time
Yeah I got weed on me I dont care about the fine
From a hood where niggas dont give a fuck by design  YO 
Yeah its real life its not a rhyme
And remember if you dont get caught its not a crime like
Dont shoot please cant breathe
Officer dont shoot cant breathe 
I got my hoodie and my mask on
I got my gun and my blast on
Dont shoot please cant breathe
Officer dont shoot cant breathe
