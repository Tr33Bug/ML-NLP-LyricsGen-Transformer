Kiss of Death  2004  Lyrics
Uh I learnt the game I know what I want and Im in it
The time is now and its gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks  Haha 
They act like its all love all they love is your money
So when its over nigga are you a thug or a dummy Im neither
But I been hot so long it feels like I got a lifetime fever  Ha 
And I dont gotta spit I could cough and still eat ya
But fuck rap I make mils off reefer Im a man first
Tired of punching niggas so Ima shoot niggas cause my hands hurt  Lets go 
And God is great guard ya space
One hand wash the other both wash the face
And I head crack so much its hard to ace
38 revolver flow its hard to trace what
Fuck that pop off til nothing in the clip left  Pop off 
Til nobody in his clique left  Nobody 
Hole in the head slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Hustle hard til none of them bricks left  Nothin left 
Stick it up til not a crumb on the strip left  Take that take that 
Make sure it aint a chain or a chip left  Uhuh 
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Tell em Kiss  The Kiss Of Death 
This is Loxville
And even white Americall let yall negroes know Jada got skills
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville  Haha 
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel  Damn 
And you aint worth my shells  Nah 
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires  Word 
Walking round town fronting like they got mils
For what its worth Im one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth  Yeah 
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels  What 
New Bentley coupe with the stock wheels  Haha 
Look how I get back to it I send my young niggas to do it in the black Buick  Woo 
I dont spit bars or distribute the crack fluid
All Im really waiting is for niggas to act stupid
Fuck that pop off til nothing in the clip left  Pop off 
Til nobody in his clique left  Nobody 
Hole in the head slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Hustle hard til none of them bricks left  Nothin left 
Stick it up til not a crumb on the strip left  Take that take that 
Make sure it aint a chain or a chip left  Uhuh 
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Tell em Kiss  The Kiss Of Death 
To all my real niggas sorry for keeping you waitin  Sorry 
Its ironic but the god was beefin with satan
I love yall though my niggas for even relatin  I love yall 
This aint Kiss talking neither Im speakin for Jason  Mwah 
When you a problem its harder to keep them from hatin  Uhuh 
Niggas jaws is like laws though easy to break em
If I wasnt on some shit Im gettin on it
Come to me with ya hand out Im spittin on it
I dont wanna hear what happened  Uhhuh 
Matter of fact I dont even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin
Cause my bones is old  Ah  gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin
Hate a nigga that aint never there to see shit but always hear what happened
The thing better than money is respect
No love this time nigga Kiss Of Death what
Fuck that pop off til nothing in the clip left  Pop off 
Til nobody in his clique left  Nobody 
Hole in the head slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Hustle hard til none of them bricks left  Nothin left 
Stick it up til not a crumb on the strip left  Take that take that 
Make sure it aint a chain or a chip left  Uhuh 
If they asked what happened  Tell em its the Kiss Of Death 
Tell em Kiss  The Kiss Of Death
