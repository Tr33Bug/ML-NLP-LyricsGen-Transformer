Letter to BIG Lyrics
Uh huh I aint even good with writing
I dont even write shit
I just felt I had to write this letter to BIG
Niggas is acting like Letter to BIG
Uh yo
Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah its your boy Kiss I just want to holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack a fresh pair of Wallies
You know Im still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybodys the king now
You aint gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing their best they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch uh yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I aint heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper rappers is more commercially successful now
But the hearts a lot weaker
You know me still got the flow thatll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
Its easy BIG all you need is a protool set
And I aint touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody thats somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that  Just a matter of time matter of time 
Im an impeccable lyricist
And with the right mechanics I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I aint on the label no more but Im tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know Im nice fuck it Im my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But they could never ever duplicate your swag  Never 
Meanwhile Im a keep it so on my lil plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil mans
Up there stepping with God
And down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
Tyanna so pretty CJ turned into a Lil Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments he keep me the flyest
Tonight Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head
And before I end it I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time wellspent it was splendid  thanks 
Miss you my nigga
One Love  So we tried to hard to understand 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
That was my letter to BIG nahmean 
You were everything  you were everything
I felt it was only right I really smoked with them niggas 
So well just keep our heads to the sky  Drink wit em 
Sat wit em talked wit em 
Cause we know were gonna see you in the next lifetime  Real shit 
But its never easy saying goodbye
See you when I get there Biggie 
Saying  goodbye  Love you 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
You were everything  Why you had to go away 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
You were everything  Oooohooooooohooooooohoooo
