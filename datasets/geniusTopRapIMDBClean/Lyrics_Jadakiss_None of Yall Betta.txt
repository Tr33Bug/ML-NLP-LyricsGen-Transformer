Its sorta like the Holy Trinity
Imma say
I say its like three different guns you fuckin faggots
Get shot three different ways
Matter fact make that six different ways
Gun in each hand bitch
None of yall betta
Jadakiss Aint none of yall betta
If it is name it
Well squash you ASAP feel it
All I know niggas give me all my dough
Like Boston George comin through with all my blow
Right now Im tryin to charter a jet
Fuck this hit the Panama Canal and get a harder connect
Step on your toes mess with your hoes shoot up your mans
Come through the block tryin to screw up your plans
Cuz I still rob niggas for coke
Understand Im the first one they call when they gettin the dope
Im the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
Im the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro cept they call me Paniro
Sad Styles still spin that arrow fuck it
Like the boss of New York you know how I feel
Kill a motherfucker cuz a corpse dont talk 
Sixteen in the joint wit one in the head
If the bullets had legs have them run in your head bitch
Jadakiss aint none of yall betta
Sheek what yall know about Styles P  put in my work
Sheek on the block
Jadakiss aint none of yall betta Styles P Let you know its all real
Tef and Billy Danze Is it real Yeah son
Jadakiss aint none of yall betta Sonja Blade what yall know about
Styles P put in my work Sheek on the block
Jadakiss aint none of yall betta Styles P bet you know its all real
Tef and Billy Danze Is it real Yeah son
Jadakiss aint none of yall betta
Lets get it poppin my nigga
Load the tech up and go shoppin my nigga
And I dont mean the mall or no Gucci store
You know what the fuck I want bricks of raw
And Im too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means wavin the hammer and leavin you there
If it means grabbin your kids out daycare
Somebody losin a seed pay or bleed
Its Sheek Louch I aint got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mall
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around like the God wont squeeze
If I dont see the badge Im clappin the Ds
LOX motherfucker the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldnt cop drops motherfucker
Like its something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker what
Ayo the dopes in the rice the cokes in the pyrex
Over the stove and Im bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
Aint no more fair ones now niggasll jump your moms
The god minus the 12 disciples
I pop up all you see is shells and rifles
If I dont like you Imma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon follow me now
Down 8th in a new Z mahogany brown
Faggots want you to kill em in a hurry
It fucks me up like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip Ill survive mkay motherfucker
In my block still doin twentyfive a day
Know you work out chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gaugell have your six pack on ice what
