Yknow you gotta roll with the punches  uhhuh 
Take some bumps give some bruises  exactly 
Its easy to just give it all up or just quit and say fuck it
Its hard to keep going
When it all seems hopeless real hard to focus
Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal easily insulted
Doing dumb shit and dont care what the results is
Aint scared to die but you thinking bout a coffin
And quitting aint an option but you think about it often
Saying to yourself how this aint fair
You got the strength but the energy just aint there
That same vision that you used to have just aint clear
The storm gets heavier the sun disappears
You just hoping that theres light at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel
Get a different mindframe once you been through the jungle
But you can stumble on a hit and get rich on a humble
Least now you know they love the style and flow
We almost there just one more mile to go
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky dont give up
We got one more mile to go  go go 
We got one more mile to go  go go HAHAAAEEH 
We got one more mile to go
First the depression kicks in then you get animallike
Hate can turn to motivation if you channel it right
Its like you at a seminar on the panel of life
If you dont reach the destination they dont hand you your stripes
And the work is just keeping my name alive more
All Im tryna do is finish the game with a highscore
I done laughed and cried and then laughed and cried more
And I know what I want so dont ask cause Im sure
From a cloth that no longer exists selfcut
Every time you look back you just throwin yourself up
At least now you know they love the style and flow
We almost there just one more mile to go
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky dont give up
We got one more mile to go  go go 
We got one more mile to go  go go 
We got one more mile to go
And even if I lost everything Ill keep going
And even if they try to break me down
Ill keep hoping for better times hey
Lemme hear you say ho
Lemme hear you say hey
Lemme hear you say yeah
When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky dont give up
We got one more mile to go  go go 
We got one more mile to go  go go 
We got one more mile to go  yeah 
We got one more mile to go  we aint gon never stop 
We got one more mile to go  ha ha ha I know they want us to 
We got one more mile to go  you know what it is
