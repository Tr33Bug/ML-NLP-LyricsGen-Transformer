Sippin on that gnac
Rollin off a bean
Shorty on her back
Im tryna get it in
New whip paper tags save checks spend the cash
A young black nigga on a fucking rap
But thats some bad luck years if you in the path of a jag
Got much to say hallelujah I do it
If pussy was music I would have Lollapalooza groupies
Montana nigga stay schemin
8Gs in my Ps killing Atrium
V12 paper tags
You know I like mine in the paper bags  racks 
Cop and go make it fast
Cut it with the Roxies make it last
Tread mill then Im in the sauna
When you getting money you get caught up in the moment
All that sucker shit real niggas dont condone it
You can get it depending on how bad you want it
Sippin on that gnac
Rollin off a bean
Shorty on her back
Im tryna get it in
Cocaine D block
Double MG we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sipping on that gnac rolling off a bean
Shawty on her back Im trying to get it in
New 9 paper tags Staples Center but you aint where the Lakers at
Waterproof Uzi when I take a bath
Mongoose nigga cut a motherfucking snake in half
Montega ton of it
Big ass guns stand in front of it
Its only real niggas I get blunted with
I only give a fuck about the niggas I get hunneds with


Triple beam paper tags
Give you the whole thing just pay for half
Think about it do the math
Wired it to my account screw the cash
Coke is corporate
Give them a good batch and they wont get off it
Shop closed but they still open of it
I aint satisfied till they close the coffin
Sippin on that gnac
Rollin off a bean
Shorty on her back
Im tryna get it in
Cocaine D block
Double MG we got the streets locked
We be high like a motherfucker
On some niggas that we ride like a motherfucker
Sipping on that gnac rolling off a bean
Shawty on her back Im trying to get it in
