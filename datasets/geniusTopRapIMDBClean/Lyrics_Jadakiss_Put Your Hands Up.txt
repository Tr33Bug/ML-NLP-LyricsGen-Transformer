Turn the fuckin beat on
Ha Yeah we back SD
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby
Cockandrun to stay in the business
Son of a bitch Double R look at me now motherf
Twothousandandone Kiss the Game Goodbye  lets get it on
Its the JADA I got beef with the feds and the DA
I got footage of the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me ma take it easy
And yall scared I can tell
That Imma get Bucks like Milwaukee cause like Sam I ca sell
Im that nigga yall know that
Bang you in tha yard then slide off on the early goback
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
I already told you Im lookin for enemies
Double R so of course its better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
Its a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or die together
Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah fuck that put ya hands down
Yall know I got the master flow fast or slow
Yall wanna know who the best is ask ya ho
The honies dont lie they love it
And they cop for real so trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody ever gon spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off titties is out
And you know when Im there hardest niggas in the city is out
Im in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low Imma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
You gotta slay two or more ma thats our motto
And yall might get down with the team if yall swallow


Muahh  Kiss the game goodbye the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
Im the nigga thatll pop the king and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New SType wagon future green
Gun heavy pants saggin Im used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash KI double
I move the perico quick and let the manteca bubble
Kiss been a boss yall just start workin
Now put ya hands up til yall arms start hurtin
And dont put em down til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headedll find out what the shells do
Now you can put em down if you want
But soon as the hook come back put em up
