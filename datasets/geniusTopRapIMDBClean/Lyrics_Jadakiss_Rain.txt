HAHAAAEEH
Thunderstorm in the forecast
More time to meditate on ya war path
To the face with a whole blunt
All my chains and a watch on thats a cold front
Yeah they wishing I come around more
But when I do they dont notice the heavy downpour
Haters praying on my death on my downfall
They got me looking for my shadow like the ground hog
Its get frightening all you see is the lightning
Niggas ungrateful bitches is just trifling
Cant be real with yourself youre not right then
Different from everybody else were not like them
Need the respect gotta have the power
If I squeeze this TEC thats a scattered shower
Guaranteed that its gonna touch you
Hoes wanna fuck niggas wanna hustle
No offense but yall better D up
Whenever it rains is the best time to reup
Niggas you wanna kill family members is ill
Shit that you think about as each drop hits the seal
Crib paid for the kids get a couple mill
You smoke a lil weed you might pop a couple pills
Sharp as a Ginsu everybodys against you
Things that you get yourself into is all mental
Its a lot of pain in my tears
Dark thoughts turn into criminal ideas
Shit like where do you see yourself in five years
Ive always been a superior to my peers
Yeah and my reign aint stop yet
Even though it was mostly the lames that got wet
Im all about a profit I pull it out and pop it
And no umbrella or raincoat cant stop it rain
They say lifes a bitch nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah well fuck it nigga Im miserable
They say when it rains it pours  rain 
They say when it rains it pours  rain rain rain 
Im the president of this veteran sport
Make it feel chill like you need ya Pelle back on
Im cosmic Im full storm from the projects
Yeah its in the air you aint gotta tell em who Nas is
Skies is red winds is 7 miles per hour light showers
Visibility clearly no one real as me cowards
Never speak to cops only speak to attorneys
Had to leave the block took the whole hood on my journey
Hear these niggas talking who they talking to
I ascended from heaven I can walk on the moon
Everybodys a killer guess everybodys a goon
Not every don is a don til a don walk in the room
Right State of emergency
Autumn leaves Mother Nature feel the urgency
The reign I rain hot spring
Nueva York they throw salt
Kama sutra in female thoughts Im stalked
So I pray like its Jumuah it rains


They say lifes a bitch nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah well fuck it nigga Im miserable
They say when it rains it pours  rain 
They say when it rains it pours  rain rain rain 
Yo when you on top of the world the game is yours
And ya dope is uncut ya caine is pure
The problems start coming it rains it pours
And ya money is not long enough to change the laws
Cause you figured everythingll be done in one night
All you want is the shine but the sun is on strike  damn 
The cash comes in then the love stops  over 
Ice in the bezel thats a flood watch
Heavy precipitation  uh 
Theres nothing you can do that could better the situation
They aint say it aint safe to drive in  nah 
Its on you how you go about surviving
In the rain nigga
They say lifes a bitch nigga
Real niggas love bitches though
Misery loves company
Yeah well fuck it nigga Im miserable
They say when it rains it pours  rain 
They say when it rains it pours  rain rain rain 
Rain rain rain rain
