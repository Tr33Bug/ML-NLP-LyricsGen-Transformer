If You dont have my money for me
Ill crack your fucking head wide open in front of everyone in the bank
In just about the time that Im coming out of jail
Youll be coming out ya coma
And guess what Ill split your fucking head open again
When I aint chilling Im killing
So theres no competition
A real nigga with money
Thats one hell of a composition
Only costing me five make it look like its twenty
They say I look like my mama I say I look like my money
You cant tell me I aint looking like a motherfucking million
Played my cards right now Im the motherfucker dealing
Got the LV on like a Runnin Rebel
Duke chain got cross full of blue devils
No college or ninetofive but Im a grinder
Not the kind of nigga who major in something minor
My shooters like recruiters theyll come and find ya
Heat every day I call them the summertimers
Truth be told you niggas never told the truth
Im guilty of getting money and I show the proof
Buy a car like fast food roll up to the booth
Then I order a new coupe and tell them hold the roof
I get mine by the seconds nigga
Shining on them out here 247 yeah
Dont trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and dont sleep
Like the city that Im repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section yeah
Aint no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon respect it
I had the crown for so long cant put it up in the closet
I get millions of dollars I make heavy deposits
Aint no if ands or maybes I probably let it go
The one who fathered your style the guardian of your flow
If your dope is a nine its hardly ever slow
Im in Versace again probably head to toe
I keep my hands to myself but I know how to touch you
They say I know how to rap I say I know how to hustle
Trying to get wavy on me but I know how to brush you
And now you think you the shit but I know how to flush you yeah
Shhh Quiet money off of loud packs
Watch out for Kentucky cause they some wild cats
Kingpins turn to wild rats
When you get that paperwork thats wild facts
I was raised on a hard block
Flipped it twice get the drop and the hard top
What


I get mine by the seconds nigga
Shining on them out here 247 yeah
Dont trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and dont sleep
Like the city that Im repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section yeah
Aint no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon respect it
Zone as my jewels hit
Dozen bottles when Im on my cool shit
Hundred thousand on me times two chick
Woke up in something I had to start with her buzzing
They never looked just about me now they react like they love him
I hate you suckers with a passion
Man of the ugly plug me in
I come to win kingpin win Im mashing
Screams while Im stepping through
Some kind of respect is due
Chief with the spear like the Seminoles FSU
Countin on my higher power I dont trust a soul
Put all my enemies together and crush em slow
First I need a statue then I need it dumped in gold
Flyer than all that new shit in something old
Fuck your statement if it aint about a payment
If you see me make mistakes Im glad to see youve seen me naked
Take a look at how Im living
Live my days like my last
Last time I was there
There were tables of cash
I get mine by the seconds nigga
Shining on them out here 247 yeah
Dont trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and dont sleep
Like the city that Im repping
All the bad bitches check him
Solo when I step in
Two girls when I step out
Them bottles in my section yeah
Aint no time to hear no stressing
Get it like I got mine
And they all gon respect it
