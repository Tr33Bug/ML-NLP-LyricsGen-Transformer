Never will it stop handguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club with a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower
Our beats is knockin hooks is rare
I earned my spot nobody aint put me here
Burnt my block I had a fiend cookin with beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgundy thing or the black on black
Matter fact go get your chrome cause Id rather be
Broke together than rich alone
Clappin em down backin em down  Uh 
Fuck what ever happened before Im whats happenin now
Now gangstas live gangstas die
Grab your guns soldiers ride  Show discipline nigga 
Kill your moms kill your pops
Kill your seed kill your girl  Its principle nigga 
Sell your crack sell your coke
Sell your E sell your smoke  You hustlin nigga 
Grab your nine grab your pound  Uh uh uh uh 
Grab your TEC grab your pump  Uh uh you bustin at niggas what Uh uh 
We Bravehearted
I had bitches try to poison me niggas who killed loyalty
Set me up vested up I move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and nightsticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killin over hoes guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals touch em they feel like they froze
Speech totally calm holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag plus its on the Quran
This on the Bible plus America cussin at every car thats drivin
Holdin a homeless sign and you focus you know this Nas and
Prince of the globe leave no prints of the toast
Played with Ouija boards burned frankincense with a ghost
I learned to do good plus erase the evil
And do what it takes to keep a smilin face on my people  Uhhuh 
I was raised by the apes in this dark creep show but yo


Gangstas live gangstas die
Grab your guns soldiers ride  Show discipline nigga 
Kill your moms kill your pops
Kill your seed kill your girl  Its principle nigga 
Sell your crack sell your coke

Grab your nine grab your pound  Yo yo

Think about when I splatter your mask  Yeah 
My niggas is happy your momma is sad
If your niggas is riders the dramall last
If your niggas is snitches the judge in my ass
And they said Im too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip Im changin the gun
The realer the beef the longer the clip
Murder your mans Im gone in the mist
Caught his girl after dark so we tore up the bitch
We aint care cause the whore wasnt shit dog
I aint takin a L or wastin a shell
I bring the heat like Im Satan hisself
Fuck if you hard fuck if you soft long as you lost
Dick in the dirt shit in your drawers
Ill make your grandmother get on the floor tie you up
Then beat you to a pulp say this is a war
Fifth and a four MAC and a pump act and I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jumped
Now gangstas live gangstas die
Grab your guns soldiers ride  Show discipline nigga 
Kill your moms kill your pops
Kill your seed kill your girl  Its principle nigga
