Youre the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know youll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
Uh huh uh huh with a smoking gun
Uh huh uh huh with a smoking gun
Uh huh uh huh I know youll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun
Yo shorty is courageous going through the stages
Of where her body is more mature than her age is
Far from the daddys little girl type
Cant even imagine what her worlds like
It all started off from a youngn
Stepfather used to touch her and she couldnt say nothing
The more she in held to the pain it kept coming
Eventually it scarred for life as a woman
And then he just kept touching her
Inside that was crushing her
I got something to discuss with her
Im coming with the tech with the air holes and the muffler
Yo now she really stressed bad baby by her step dad
Her and little man all alone up in Westhab
Tough road and without a car its a tough walk
Worst part about it is her mom think is her fault
Word get around yall you know how the town talk
Babygirl is innocent labeled her a town whore
Suicidal thoughts on her mind even now more
First the abuse now she gotta raise her child poor
And thats why I feel for you
Thats why Im ready to kill for you
Thats a black girl lost for you
Call me Ill come through and let it off for you  Blaow 
Yo it aint your fault boo Im always here for you to talk to
Hold your head high when you walk though
Sometimes the devils temptation will force you
But one thing about the lord hell never cross you
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you
And you still queen of the earth and youre beautiful
Everything happens for a reason
If you ever need me call me Im coming through squeezing  Blaow
