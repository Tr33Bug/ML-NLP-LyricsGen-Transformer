Uhhuh real life shit
Namean true story
Feel me matter of fact still feel me
Uh yeah
Ayo past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the God to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma no drama
Something that came and went real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting him its hurtin him
Guess I gotta be the man sit down and work with him
My little boy 7 he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal the love
Listen Im grown yall
When it comes to my family it aint never a problem its only a phone call
They tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new phone new number shit
They violated Stay again
Gus totaled the Beamer and broke Kay leg again
Shhh let us pray again
And I aint get enough of hanging in the local bars yet
Had to let the thing off cross town in the projects
All these rumors and shit I aint get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggas aint stop acting like broads yet
In arm reach off a gun and a mask
Somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool til a muhfucking tour bus flipped
Uh no charges brought up bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up then I put a court up
Now the road to the riches is taking me longer
It aint kill yet so it making me stronger
I dont know if its the hate frustration or hunger
That keep a nigga going rapping for a reason
Shit dont just dont happen shit happens for a reason
Im that dude like it or love it
I do my thing in the hood and get right with a budget
Aint afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16s give you a visual
I know you thinking he aint really selling how he live off residuals
But right now the game is pitiful
Niggas is lonely they need company cause they miserable
Yeah uhhuh shit it still real B
Thats why I want you to still feel me
Still feel me one Im out
