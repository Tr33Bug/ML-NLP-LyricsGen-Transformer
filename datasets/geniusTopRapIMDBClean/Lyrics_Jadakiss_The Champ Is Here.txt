He took it from crack to rap now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
And then chase the book wit the documentry
If you cant do nothing other than flow
Lifes a bitch like the mother from blow lets go
Dont make me put your heart on your lap
Fuck riding the beat nigga I parallel park on a track
Hop out looking crispy fresh and new
In a Six but its a BM and its Pepsiblue
And I dont know you but I know a man becomes a man
From all the shit that he go through
Yall aint fuckin wit Jason
After I cash in theres really no justification
Of how Im gon change the game
So dont get out of line cause this lil ninell change your frame

Yall never gon touch the kid  gangsta kiss 
No love this time nigga kiss of death
Yo I aint got time to be up here lyin to you
Just make sure yall niggas feel what we tryin to do
If I fuck up then its on me
Besides that it is what it is and thats what it just gon be
Blowin my purple wish you would go in my circle
If you know my record is clean you know Ima merk you
I live like a warrior do
Without screamin true story niggas know my story is true
The cribs the cars the jury the spots I got
The money that pass my hand and the rocks I chop
The ammo the artillery the knifes I bought
Waking up sore the next day from fights I fought
In the hood cuz I fuck wit the thugz
Tryin to figure out why the money never added up to the love
Gun in my waist dutch in my hand
And I dont do a lot of talkin I listen as much as I can
Chorus 
The champ is here  aha

The champ is here
Sheek   Jadakiss 
Fuckin wit the champion  you already know 
JADA kiss the game goodbye 
You fuckin wit the champion  you already know 
Yall never gon touch the kid  kiss of death 
They gon have to get me at the top
Yall never gon touch the kid  gangsta kiss 
No love this time nigga  tell em kiss 
The champ is here
The champ is here
The champ is here
