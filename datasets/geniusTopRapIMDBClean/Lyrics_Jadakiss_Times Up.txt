Aha uh yeah yo
Im the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery voice of God
And its hard just being the boss
Being I cant go to jail cause them yearsll cost me
Dont get me wrong lay a nigga down if he force me
Id rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think about how Ima put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how Ima get the caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or overtrust them uh
Yeah them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it dont jam the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause Im a nigga that hate to settle
And Im a man of the Lord but I still cant shake the devil
Moved away and still cant escape the ghetto what
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
I know how to get my peers off me
Make em cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
Its a symptom if you bobbing your head you know that hes sick
You know the flow is ridic now throw him a grip
When I get it you already know Im throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere daddy Im throwing them nicks
Thats right homie you cant move me
I aint going nowhere Im in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze a bootleg Uzi
Im just waiting on a Q like Suzie dont lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else thatll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is what up
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground


Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you cant do nothing other than flow
Lifes a bitch like the mother from Blow lets go
Dont make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat nigga I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy fresh and new
In the six but its a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I dont know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Yall aint fuckin with Jason
After I cash in theres really no justification
Of how Im gon change the game so dont get out of line
Cause this little nine will change your frame what up
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
