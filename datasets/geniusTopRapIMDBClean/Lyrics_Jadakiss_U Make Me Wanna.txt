A yo the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains you was there when I was on the bench hurtin
Now that I own my team its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I cant let her get lost now she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understand she fine understand she mine
She understand the grind cooks clean and irons
And whatever she wanna push Imma cosign
And if I aint got it already than Imma go find it
I guess Imma lucky don and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones and she know that Im in the hood
But she also knows that Im coming home

Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything even my rhymes
I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a womens point of view
And thats why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell shes real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know Im from the streets so its crazy ill

A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Those far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
