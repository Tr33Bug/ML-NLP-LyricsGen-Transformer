Fuck the frail shit uh cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped youd get the picture but you just cant photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know if its furnished Ima take it
My bathtub lift up my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon smoking and drinking
Nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing capital pun pass me a gun
And Ima give you time to run while I rapidly peel uh
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
I learned the game quickly and I dont like to rent
So when I fly now I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case whos the loser
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin niggas is back Jada and P
We got water X haze plus weight of the D
And Im tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted  Who cares 
Talking bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin back
Gun works official but niggas dont be wanting that
Why  Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul for Real in the hood we make Candy Rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you cant remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
JadaMWAH Ill kiss you you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood wont miss you you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean  he be aight though 
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we dont laugh at death and cry at birth
Never say you cant do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But its a message in everything trust me even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground cause my shells is expensive
Youll know exactly why when you yellin in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky cause I got guns that crack your back
But thats not what I prefer I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so yall go head and squeal
Im comfortable far from home
Eating right getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
Im the reason niggas got deals the past few years
Sound anything like Kiss Then sign right here
And yall just talking Im doing it well
Jadakiss motherfucker Ima see you in hell
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
We gon make it we gon make it
We gon make it
