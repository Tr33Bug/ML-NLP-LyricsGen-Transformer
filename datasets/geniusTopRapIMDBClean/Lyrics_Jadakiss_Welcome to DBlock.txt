Ruff Ryders  Lets go 
Welcome to DBlock city of broke down dreams
Where things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers killers pimps pushers
Panhandlers hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here in this part of town
But we all got a town thats similar to this too
They say every citys got a ghetto every ghettos got a hood
Take a good look around you cause theres a DBlock near you
Place where aint nobody that proud its a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Five minutes flat the whole town know
Lotta assuming a niggas salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a bodys technicality
Other than that catch em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We dont play with the lizards we make phrases up and say em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Welcome to DBlock the mighty mighty DBlock
The place in New York City where Diddy wont even walk
Its DBlock the part of Yonkers I wouldnt be caught
Without two pistols on me thatll be cocked in each pocket
DBlock dont even stop to talk you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you wont even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You wont even see that ride pulling up alongside you
Youll be shot fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
DBlock the place where OGs get knocked locked up
Get out come home for a week and get reknocked
You wont even see cops hiphop police dont even stop
On DBlock where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new GUnit Reeboks

And you rep where you from nigga you DBlock
And you trying to come up and your pockets is light as a cup

And every nigga where I be I put in work for free

Welcome to DBlock a place where little niggas is killas
And the mothers raising the sons to turn into gorillas
And the hallways is pissy as hell all we do is get bigger
More ignorant you send us to jail

Sell drugs from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon
Id die the way I stand with my man if I can when the shells come
