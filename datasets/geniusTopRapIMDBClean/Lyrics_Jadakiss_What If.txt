Yo take a second
What if we could rewind the hood
Better yet what if the LOX woulda signed with Suge
What if Puffy never signed us
What if Oprah made them comments like Imus
What if you designed this
Thought like I did said it like this
What if Peyton was fightin dogs instead of Mike Vick
What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie get Life
What if BIG missed the party
What if Pac missed the fight
What if you was caged in
What would you change then
What if there was no Rockefeller law for made men
What if the hate ran through me
And what if Portland woulda drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal
What if all of these rappers ice was really real
What if I hit you wit the razor from cheek to chin
What if Mike Jackson never woulda bleached his skin
What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
What if the pain went away
What if you changed in a day
What if you could eliminate all the games people played
What if Shyne beat the case
What if Diddy did a dime flat
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back
What if Malcolm was silent
What if Martin was violent
What if you could really sneak a Uzi on the Island
Yeah what if I made you kiss the nina
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina
What if a Black man was the one controllin FEMA
What if we aint never let emotions come between us
What if the last time we rode somebody seen us


What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
Yo I flow calm but dont push
What if Saddam hung Bush
What if One Mic was called one hook
What if the Bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon
What if I ran up in that sick chick with no protection
What if I never wore an Army jacket
Carhartt to match it unlaced Timbs
The hood on my first album cover under plastic
What if I was another corny rapper
What if I went instead of Notorious
Who would tell my story after
What if I love less and lust more
If Obama was on Rushmore
Would Ali give Tyson a bust jaw
What if I never glared out that project window
Would never be scared for the life of me and my kinfolk
What if that gun pin broke
I would never laid back in the Enzo all red
What if real niggas was all dead
What if Hilary and them was Reptilian
And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians
What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
What if you never knew things that you needed to know
What if you never been places you needed to go
What if you get there and learn them as you go
What if is the question can I ask them once more
