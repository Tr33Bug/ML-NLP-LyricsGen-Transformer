Who Shot Ya  Freestyle  Lyrics
Its that time motherfuckers dub dime motherfuckers
Thats me motherfuckers yeah the champ part 3 motherfuckers
All praises all burners all razors
Hands down nigga the game is all Jadas
Something hot drop I get em in all flavors
Hes a dick you pussy yall neighbors
Yeah two extra whores
Im in the new Aston with two extra doors
With a quick flip I dont try to stretch for more
One hundred percent powder extra raw
And I get it from Giuseppe either him or the eses
Ive been smacking these rappers around for a decade
Still tryin to get mami to sacame la leche
Know if I take her out I could pop her the next day
The Black Mamba of the vocals MJ of the Pro Tools anti social
Phil Jack on the track but I cant coach you
This is just audio of shit that I go through
Guns in the couch money in the mattress
And I would have got the Bentley but I had to pay taxes
Settle for a polo fit and some air maxes
Your flows a light sprain mines is a fracture
Uh but the Xrays negative
You a coward in jail you could never live
Nah You barely living out here
Im the reason you breathing its like im giving out air
I got stocks in the block and im giving out shares
To niggas that dont talk cause they giving out years
I dont know you you aint familiar
And I dont care who shot you cause they aint kill ya
As far as the word play Im a son of a bitch
These niggas is decent but aint none of em Kiss
MTV yall know Ill punish the list
Them niggas jewelry is fake and aint none of em rich
Notice they keep watching em theres no stoppin em
V neck crush linen suede louie moccasins
They wont dry up but you cant buy luck
Cashmere sweats with the gucci tie ups
Overlooking the city my nigga Im high up
And I could get your brains blown out for five bucks
Im always in the hood thats cause I rep that
My paperwork good niggas already checked that
Im probably just comfortable cause thats where I slept at
The desert is blue steel The forty is jet black
