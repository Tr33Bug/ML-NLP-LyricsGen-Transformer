Why  Remix  Lyrics
All that Im given
Its this pain that Im living  The remix the remix 
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Why is garbage music sellin a lot
Why is the music industry state of mind real far from Hip Hop
Why vote republican if you black
Why build more jails less schools cause we under attack
Why keep the four pound in the air
The revolution will not be televised if around here
Why keep my right fist in the sky
I let them know that We Gonna Make It dont plan our demise
Why you gotta teach your kids on your own
Cause when you get in the zone they bringing you in you both getting cloned
Why we still gotta pray to Allah
Its Hip Hop this the New World Order and they playin us hard
Why rappers getting protection
Why the country aint flipped when they jerked the votes the last election
Why die for all my beliefs
I gotta look at my kids I rather smile then cry when hes sleep
Thats why
Why Why they got me strugglin why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Why do they say I changed for a girl
Why you worried bout my clothes if my flow gonna change the world
Why you wait till you 30 then try to be hard
Why I gotta have religion if I believe in God
Why is Bush acting like he trying to get Osama
Why dont we impeach him and elect Obama
Why aint Rick James remembered for classic hits
Why do we remember it for smackin a bitch
Why did Ricky Williams retire they mad in Miami
Why did Justin sell Janet out and go to the Grammys
Why you kill on every song why you frown at the screen
So many thrones why we argue who is the King
Why its over for gangsta why its over for bling
Why they hype Britney up they know she cant sing
Why a whip and a chain the black american dream
Why I know it in my heart it remains unseen
Why
Why Why they got me strugglin why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Ey Kiss they wanna hide from the truth
Your comrade Nas right here with you Lets go
Registered voter not blood of a panther why is the question
What is the answer got a suggestion heres an example
Wont we build our own airline states and highways
Fly to Africa do some trades with Zimbabwe
Why did Malcolms mission die with the man
Why we aint pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan
Why the merger try to exclude LA Reid
He brought you Usher OutKast topselling CDs
Why do half America got AIDS
Why do schools care about your sons braids more than they care for his grades
Why they hate our white tshirts and hats turned backwards
And why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors
And why there aint a MC that can touch me nor budge me
And why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D
And why this record aint sell 5 mill yet
Jadas as real as it get put my money where my mouth is
Lets do something bout this
Why Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Uh yeah yo by thugs Im surrounded
Tell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded  I dont know 
Why my cases aint get thrown out
Why team USA keep gettin blown out
Why the Democratic party aint gettin with me
Why they still hangin black bodies in Mississippi
Yea why did governor McGreevey get caught with a lizard
Why they take away Shynes phone calls and visits
Why I been hot for 7 years
Why the new M5 come with 7 gears
Please tell me why yall keep makin that trash
Why they reinstating the draft why is it so much hatin you have
And why sell records and keep workin
Why we go on stage with the bread with the feet workin
Its real why when a love one die you miss them
Why it took for me to make Why for yall to listen
Why Why they got me strugglin why
Got a brothers bustin why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Why they got me strugglin why
Got a brothers bustin why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on why
Jobs are getting so hard why
All the brothers locked behind bars why they pinning me
Chained up in the system going crazy

Why Got me locked up in the pin
