From third grade to the stage
Getting arrested and thrown in the same cage
Im a little older but we still the same age
Really the only one to tolerate my strange ways
Yeah thats why I would die for you
Everybody gonna die
But who gonna die loyal
Sometimes I be wishing I could do that time for you
My spirits aint the same always got my mind on you
Thought I had the right plan
Up until the Feds amputated my right hand
The money started blowing away just like sand
And whatever was left all went to the white man
Then I just bear down
Cause I know hell be back but he aint here now
Damn
I aint wanna do one of these joints so I grabbed two
I aint have a good night sleep since they grabbed you
On the way to get your passport when they bagged you
Ima hold you down you my nigga Ill be glad to  got to 
And they dont be letting niggas go
But if you never wouldve had the ratchet theyd of had to
Shit that they been doing
Hate when a nigga come at you how K doing
Pshh staring at him like a weirdo
Tell him he doing better than niggas out here though
Are you being nosey
Or do you really care dough
That aint something I wanna share yo
Then I just bear down
Cause I know hell be back but he aint here now yeah
Then I just bear down
Cause I know hell be back but he aint here now yeah
Hold your head my niggas
Be home soon
You already know I got you
Everything happen for a reason
Everybody on lock down
From DFY to the motherfuckin Feds
Hold your head my niggas
Real nigga shit
