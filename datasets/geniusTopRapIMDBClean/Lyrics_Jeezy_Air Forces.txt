I went from old school Chevys to droptop Porsches
You couldnt walk a mile off in my Air Forces
And you aint seen what Ive seen
I can get a hundred thousand in these Sean John jeans
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches
You couldnt walk a mile off in my Air Forces
And you aint did what I did
If you from where Im from you gotta get how you live
Everybody already know Jeezy a real street nigga
Every time you see me out with real street niggas
I hope you got yours I keep mine
In the club blowing dro throwing gang signs
And you already know dog
745s back to back me and O Dog
These other niggas is jokers
What they rein up wit I spent it all at Strokers
In one night eight bitches ten bottles of Cris
Forty grand spent just to make you glance at my wrist
Keep bread so we carry dem toasters
But keep back though my earrings ferocious
Its not just my imagination
Im knowin Im the topic of your conversation
Jack boys say they gon rob
But on the real fuck niggas yall dont want these problems
Black tees black Ones and a fitted cap
The Mac11 make me walk wit a crazy dap
Yall say we country niggas yeehaw
The money comin back and forth like a seesaw
And yall aint never seen what we saw
Stacks of twenty dollar bills bricks of white raw
Where they got little faith they dont care bout shit
Ludicrous how they ride I20 wit dem bricks
Shit I spit it for yall
On the real my niggas shit I spit it for yall
Who gives a fuck about friends
If you mix the baking soda wit it you can get a Benz
While yall robbing and boosting
Im standing over the stove like the chef at Houstons
And its not about the flip mane
Want the real bread dawg its all about your whip game
