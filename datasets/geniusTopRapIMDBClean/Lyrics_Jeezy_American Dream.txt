Welcome to America baby  uh 
Home of the brave American Dream you know  yeah 
Uh yeah yeah

I just want a big ol bag of money when I see my jeweler

Scarface into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team the American Dream
First they said I wouldnt but I knew that I would make it  I knew it nigga 
Copped my first pie yeah I knew that I could bake it  whats up 
Scarface vision living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team the American Dream
You either good or you great you either real or you fake
Thats why I stay spittin the real because the real ones relate
Yall must was raised by some haters you niggas go ahead and hate
FFFour car garage for the Rari that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky glad I aint fall for the bait
So focused and Im determined can see that shit in my face
You niggas go head and face it lil bitch aint shit bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half I got the recipe
First my president was black now my president is wack
I aint never going broke whats American in that
I just want a big ol bag of money when I see my jeweler  yeah 
Get a hardon when Im counting up that mula  ha ha 
Scarface into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team the American Dream
First they said I wouldnt but I knew that I would make it  alright 
Copped my first pie yeah I knew that I could bake it  alright 
Scarface vision living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team the American Dream
Got money to make blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate Im running the game you running in place
Still a youngin at heart but mentally bitch Im a hunnidandeight
Like Pun in the late 90s my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state gun in the waist for safety
Im on a paper chase whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire silly cause how many really get there
I mean how many niggas is Jeezy
Yall make this shit sound so easy
Breezy turn on the TV see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile back home my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
Cause thats the American Dream
Now here go the thing listen
Hysterical screams coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods I dont got time to explain
Out of fear that I wont reach em and since preaching aint my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already


I just want a big ol bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hardon when Im counting up that mula  ha ha 
Scarface into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team the American Dream
First they said I wouldnt but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie yeah I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team the American Dream
