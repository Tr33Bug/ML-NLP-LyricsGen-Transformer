Hopped up out the bed I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said fuck it buy another car
Hopped out the Lamb

I bought the Phantom just to say its black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
Im getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete

So much bread on me I can buy a Jersey home

Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques

He bought a 500 needy need a halftime
If yo job aint ballin hard then you need to quit
You need a 18 hard then you need to split
Summers mine winter too

Bitch Im balling ballin like a motherfucker
12 gauge bitch I got a dozen of them
Niggas broke acting like they got it though
Im with a Spanish bitch if she aint fucking adios
So many cars Im like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colors in the diamonds Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house and get to poppin at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches dont sell well buy em back
Where the strippers tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas Im strapped like lingerie
