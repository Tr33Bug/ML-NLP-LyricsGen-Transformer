Time for the fallen soldiers
Cant have a war without casualties you know
For everybody goin through the struggle you know
Real shit everyday everyday shit is real
Every hood every ghetto every block every trench 
I know how you feel yeah look
I been out here grindin so long
But still I had to find my way on my own
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like
Im a true hustler all that I know
So I can make it anywhere that I go
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez likelike beez like
Straight from the hood got a get money fetish
Pocket full of green nigga like a head of lettuce
Put the work in a bag make a yayo sandwich
Then we go and spread it through the hood like Manwich
One thing about it we gon get this bread
When you knew shit was real When they found a rat dead
Right around the corner where us young niggas hustled at
Right by the stop sign thats where they was bussin at
When you come here with nothin gotta learn how to provide
Carlo had a Benz fore he was old enough to drive
Losin 1020 every night gamblin aint nothin
Nigga got killed takin up for his cousins
When you knew shit was real Drop outfit in the feds
Still 8 years and a nigga shot him dead
On the humbug left him slumped in his car
Everybody got a day dont matter who you are
I been out here grindin so long
But still I had to find my way on my own
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like
Im a true hustler all that I know
So I can make it anywhere that I go
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez likelike beez like
Stove water heat cold water
Knew Id touch a bird when I got my first quarter
Sell water to a well nigga
Cold nights cold hearts tough love
Thats what it be like in jail nigga
Mama crying at my visit cause she care for me
Daughter just had her period aint there for her
Know how to have a girl you know just gon hold ya back
But the pussy so good you keep goin back
Hurt when ya main man turned rat
Make the whole la familia turn hot like that
Any city any block any boulevard
I survive no lie Im a ghetto boy
I could tell ya bout the dos and donts
Could make it anywhere I go so lose I wont
I can tell ya bout the hard time when ya really need it
Been grindin so long still had to call Jeezy
I been out here grindin so long
But still I had to find my way on my own
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like
Im a true hustler all that I know
So I can make it anywhere that I go
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez likelike beez like
Straight from the bottom tryna make it to the top
What the govment dont give you gotta get it from the block
Feel like a bad boy cause this shit dont stop
Street so dirty need a muhfuckin mop uh oh
Lil homie stay focused handle ya business
Dont talk to them niggas around you might be a witness
Dont tell the dishwasher what you did wit ya dishes
Dont tell these snitchin niggas what you did wit ya riches
Niggas is hopin they see Christmas
But if we just happen to dont we hope you miss us
Santa raised all seven them kids didnt miss a meal
She work her fingers right to the bone didnt miss a bill
Nigga six for the nine lets make a deal
See one thing bout countin this money it make ya feel
See I used to get em right from the source got em direct
The same nigga that had a connect he in the set
I been out here grindin so long
But still I had to find my way on my own
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like
Im a true hustler all that I know
So I can make it anywhere that I go
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez likelike beez like
