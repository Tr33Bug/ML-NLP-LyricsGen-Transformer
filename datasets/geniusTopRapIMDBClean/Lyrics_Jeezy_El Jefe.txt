I cant tell you why
I just changed from one day to the next
I grew tired of everything
So I decided to express my frustrations
You know what the thing about revolutions is
You dont plan them I didnt at least
There just happened to be alot of people that agreed with me
I happen to be the voice that spoke
They called me El Jefe
Niggas wanna go  we can go nigga Im talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now Im fed up
Hatin on another grown man get your bread up
If your bread down nigga then keep your head up
See timing is everything
Right now  you and I watch
Streets been watching us since 04
And they still ours
Niggas wanna go  we can go nigga Im talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now Im fed up
Hatin on another grown man get your bread up
We can bread down nigga then keep your head up
Niggas tryin to take the spot yeah you know they gon try
You aint gotta say a word know them numbers dont lie
I aint spazzing  I aint hating I aint trippin Im just focused
Came back to claim whats mine I think everybody noticed
Ye I know yall feel is that nigga really real
Whats understood aint gotta be said you niggas know the deal
Got a whole one from my partner one time he charged me thirty
Got a nigga wanted 2 way I need another birdy
Im a genius when it comes to gettin money kinda nerdy
Started counting at 615 be done by 730
If your subject is some real shit you know Im goin ham
Keep your opinions and your comments niggas I cant give a damn
I wasnt surprised to find my enemies
I could see the el odio in their eyes
They wanted to stomp me for my accomplishments
I thank them though because without them I wouldnt have no one to stand above
Say thats the way it is
Thats the way its gonna be
Wont be happy till Im in the same place as Max B
For them niggas do your thing dog you know how cats be
Anything you wanna know about them things just ask me
See I might be from the ghetto but Im gonna be classy
You can hate it if you want but Im gonna be flashy
See I do it for the time that I was broke and ashy
Bitches say you want them clothes all week you nasty
See Pac said it best  real niggas dont die
How you niggas so opinionated you dont know the guy
If you think youre going forward then you dont know the guy
If you thinking theres a limit then you dont know the sky
You aint feeling me guess you aint fucking with the game
If you aint feeling me I guess you fucking with them lames
Gave you niggas hope how the fuck you gon doubt me
Let you niggas in how the fuck you gonna out me
I knew that nobody could stop me
I knew that I would make it through this point
Yo saba como jefe
El Jefe I represent everbodio
I say look at me because Im here right now
Yo estoy aqu
And I will be present and Ill be here permanently 
Se acab
Es El Mundo
