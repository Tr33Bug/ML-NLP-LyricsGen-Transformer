I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin
And now the whole world gon know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
Thats why I come through stuntin
When Im gone the whole world gon know my name
12 years old caught up in that street life
I was tryna shine harder than the street lights
Ran the streets tonguetied couldnt sleep nights
Cause when youre living wrong its hard to sleep right
But it is what it is gotta eat right
Cop them things they be whiter than your teeth right
Dreamed some big things on my grandmama couch
Hid some big things at my grandmama house
Cause when you play the game every strike counts
And why they call them 8 balls if they dont bounce
Bag full of breakdowns in the back yard
But you cant get em out til its backed off
I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin
And now the whole world gon know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
Thats why I come through stuntin
When Im gone the whole world gon know my name
What it do nigga 1 triple zero
Who you be nigga The neighborhood hero
Dope game no shame nigga more pain
Seen enough to drive a young nigga insane
From the windows of the trap see the prison bars
Flashing lights on top we call them prison cars
This for my niggas make a livin on they mobile phone
Grind hard til your earrings cost a mobile home
Aint nothin wrong with that get your mobile on
Get the bricks butt naked get your Strokers on
All the other bullshit I could have focused on
Said fuck that shit and kept my focus on
I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin
And now the whole world gon know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
Thats why I come through stuntin
When Im gone the whole world gon know my name
Yeah they try to stop a nigga but I wont let em
See the wheels How the fuck you aint gon sweat em
Bet you one thing bet you niggas wont bet em
G5 take off you know Im gon jet em
Road trips aint shit you know I go get em
Plus my man send his check you know we gon split em
Now its so many shoes that I cant wear
From that real nigga cloth thats why you cant tell
Always knew that Id make it out someday
Traffic jam I was going down the oneway
Twelve used to hit the block I had to run away
Now this nigga be flyer than the runway
I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin
And now the whole world gon know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
Thats why I come through stuntin
When Im gone the whole world gon know my name
