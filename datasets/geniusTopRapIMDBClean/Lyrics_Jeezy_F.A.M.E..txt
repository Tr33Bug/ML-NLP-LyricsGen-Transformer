FAME Lyrics
Fuck these haters Id kill them all if I could
Aint scared of none of yall so you know my aim good
Blowing bin Laden in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero on my way to kush heaven
Cant slow down too much evil in my rearview
Sometimes you wanna scream to God but he cant hear you
And even if you did thisll probably be his answer
Fuck you plaining about It aint like you got cancer
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love then the hate that just a trap niggas curse
I bet you feel like the whole world hating on you
But whats the hold up The whole world waiting on you
The fame 
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until its empty
Im already standing on the edge so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy
You mean to tell me from running my big mouth
That I could chill here in this big penthouse
All elevatored up black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it aint yours
Your conscience got you feeling like you done something wrong
But the flatscreen saying motherfucker we on
Pardon me nigga do you see this view
See Ruths Chris from here what the fucks wrong with you
Looking at my Rollie yeah its almost 7
Bill Gates state of mind with an automatic weapon
You might remember from putting on for the city
Or back when it was on 2 going for the 50
Opened up a few squares opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
Oh we dont fuck with Young no more Why not
The only thing I can figure because he on top
The fame 
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until its empty
Im already standing on the edge so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy


Lately I been often out of sight seldom out of mind
Ay getcha bidne right and stay the hell up out of mine
Im out my mind tryin to fix it fore Im out of time
Dont worry bout me God got me bruh Im doin fine
Another year in prison promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm should be makin history
No feelin sorry for me keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad take it like a man whatever meant for me
How I did it make em hate my spirit they wish they could kill it
And theyll take it however they can get it
Wanna see me fulla misery walkin wit my head down
Lets decapitate him then well see if he can wear his crown
The fame 
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until its empty
Im already standing on the edge so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy
