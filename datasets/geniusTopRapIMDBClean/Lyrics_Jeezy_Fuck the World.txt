When these streets is all you know  All you know baby 
Its hard to tell whose a friend or a foe  No question 
All I need is a beautiful girl  Yeah wassup 
So me and her can fuck the world
Middle finger with her legs in the air
Getting money so its hard to care  Its hard to care baby 
All I need is a beautiful girl
So me and her can fuck the world
She like Avion on ice a lil Belvee
And once we get together aint nothin you can tell me
One thing about my G she might just bring a friend
And when the night started sometimes it never end
I said she grown just the way I like that
And she open minded just the way I like that
I like the way she touch me she do it so mature
Bet I can make her lust me Im a hundred percent sure
And even from the start she seemed so hesitant
We here now long time coming that was evident
She want me I want her think thats an attraction
Yeah she bout that life though baby bout that action thats what I told her
I tell her that I need her she dont believe that
I miss her when she go like Where my G at
In a league of her own she a bad one
Never felt like this you never had one
She bad Im fly we high
And the shit we on nigga fo life til we die
Til we die came from the bottom just aim for the sky
If its motherfuck the world put your fingers up high yeah
When these streets is all you know  All you know baby

Getting money so its hard to care  Its hard to care baby
