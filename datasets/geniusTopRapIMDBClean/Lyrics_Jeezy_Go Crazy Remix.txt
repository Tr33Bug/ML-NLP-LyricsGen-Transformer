Go Crazy  Remix  Lyrics
Guess whos back
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme I was cooking them Os
Like horseshoes I was tossing them Os
Time to reup gotta recycle the flow
Im emotional I hug the block
Im so emotional I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me so whats realer
About the scrilla call me a Ghostface Killa
Its kinda hard to be drugfree
When Georgia Power wont give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killin em ever since
It pays to tell the truth dog it only makes sense
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimping doing my thang
More than a hustla Im the definition of it
Master chef lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend homey its Hova
More than a relief pitcher Im the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks the whole worlds about to hear me out
See Im a hustlers hope Im not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success Im what they might mean
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is JayZ Blue
Dont follow me youngun follow my moves Im not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo
I was at my video Cris on the speedboat
In My Lifetime nigga go through your research
St Thomas my nigga that was me first
Chromeshoed the GS I came feetfirst
In the game like a baby born to breach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like Nah Hov talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy JayZ
See Imma 80s baby master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks every day is college
You aint did nothin I aint did nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor I sprayed Lamis
Still the timell reveal you know Im bein honest
Ya aint put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright
Good night
Whattup Jeez
Crackslife whats the matter with your head
Crackslife all you niggas gon end up dead
Crackslife everybody servin rat til he ride
Everybody think they somebody til somebody end up shot
Listen Im in that GT chopper on the passenger side
No skeets skeets chopper on the passenger side
They said Trap or Die but said fuck it
Damn near half my life I been a suspect
Feds low in them Coupe Devilles
So I keep one eye open like Bushwick Bill
They said my minds playin tricks on me
So I let off a half a clip on em
Aint no witnesses tellin the story
Then my bitch spent all of the bail money
I done gave em my pimp cup for a gangsta hat
Traded my gangsta hat for some gangsta raps
Only to find out that no gangstas rap
Half of these niggas is pussy aint never served crack
Its like a damn nightmare
Just when you thought I was gone I reappear
On some chopped up screwed shit papi got his swagga back
Hot sick clue shit bought a brick of half of rap
In that cedes when its said and done
Yeah papi kinda crazy squeeze the pound for fun
Wont stop til my whole team in thug mansion
And I say I like Pac now thats a thugs passion
And this the realist shit I ever wrote
And all eyes on me like a microscope
Young Jeezy give em one more chance
Tried to shine like you and spent his whole advance
Like my main man Pulla talk real slick
Look Im ok but my watch sick
Yean gotta like a nigga just respect my mind
And this how Im eatin now so respect my grind
The way I put them words together
Minds me how I used to put them birds together
Buy 18 the hard way
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
A lot of holes a lot of blood dogthe shit aint fun
So I suggest you dont play with my chains
Ill send these hollows atchya let em play with ya brain
The streets is watching the name is warm
The products white a star is born  Yeah 
And Im so fly if I take this parachute off I might fall and die
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it out of town call it safe sex
