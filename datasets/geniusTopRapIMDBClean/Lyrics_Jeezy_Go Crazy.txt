Guess whos bizzack
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme I was cooking them Os  cooking them Os 
Like horseshoes I was tossing them Os
Time to reup gotta recycle the flow  recycle the flow 
Im emotional I hug the block  ay 
Im so emotional I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me so whats realer
About the scrilla call me a Ghostface Killa  yup 
Its kinda hard to be drugfree
When Georgia Power wont give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killin em ever since
It pays to tell the truth dog it only makes sense
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin doing my thang ay  ay 
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop the collar then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doing they thang ay  ay 
Buy 18 the hard way  lets get it 
And have a humble nigga thinkin bout gun play  chea 
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
A lot of holes a lot of blood dawg the shit aint fun  nope 
So I suggest you dont play with my chains
Ill send these hollows atchya let em play with ya brains  thats right 
The streets is watching the name is warm
The products white a star is born  yeeaah 
Pimpin Im so fly if I take this parachute off I might fall and die  damn 
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex  jeah 
Then we ship it out of town call it safe sex  ay 
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin doing my thang ay  ay 
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop the collar then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doing they thang ay  ay 
More than a hustler Im the definition of it
Master chef Lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend homie its Hova
More than a relief pitcher Im the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks the whole worlds bout to hear me out
See Im a hustlers hope Im not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success Im what they might mean
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is JayZ Blue
Dont follow me youngun follow my moves Im not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo
I was at my video Cris on the speedboat
In My Lifetime nigga go through your research
St Thomas my nigga that was me first
Chromeshoed the GS I came feetfirst
In the game like a baby born to breech birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start bugging cause I talk like this
Them corporate thugs is like Nah Hov talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy JayZ
See Ima 80s baby mastered Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks every days college
You aint did nothing I aint did nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor  I spray llamas still
The timell reveal you know Im being honest
Yall aint pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright
Goodnight
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin doing my thang ay  ay 
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy  jeah 
Now watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop the collar then you swing your chain
For all the gangstas in the street that be doing they thang ay
