Holy Ghost  Remix  Lyrics
Tell to myself still on fire
Im under attack but Im still on fire
I got some chatter but Im still on fire
I got some threat but Im still on fire
I got some liabilities but Im still on fire
If its not amazing that Im on fire
Ive been to hell and back but Im still on fire
Whats in the back of my mind sittin in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here thats what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin heavy weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out but you dont have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin for draws and now theres plaques on the walls
Think Im sellin my soul Then you can come get em all
Trade em all for my dawgs yea Im talkin to you
Where did we go wrong Because I dont have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But its real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life you didnt deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look its somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga half a mili automobile
Im talkin real luxury dont feel a bump in the road
We aint like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin it really had me disgusted
Nigga who am I kiddin It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnt ask for it back
And to be honest with you I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin large
Gangster pitted it kills gave you your first mill
And I aint tell you to blow it I aint tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure yea I know it can stress ya
But youre only a man homie I aint mad at ya
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear the Lord is my shepherd Im bout to go cop a Lexus
Im bout to go fuck Alexis  take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and em these my Usher confessions
Let it burn  TeeTee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two Ts and Top Dawg impress with
TVs that play their investment
KDOT go tee off and TGs and YGs gon press it
Its our turn  I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo curse you forever you better not touch it
The clutching Im used to 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga Vrrrrm
Check that homie out homie thats KDot 
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
Its hard to say when Im neutral Im tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
