Whats in the back of my mind sittin in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here thats what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin heavy weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out but you dont have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin for draws and now theres plaques on the walls
Think Im sellin my soul Then you can come get em all
Trade em all for my dawgs yea Im talkin to you
Where did we go wrong Because I dont have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But its real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life you didnt deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look its somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga half a mili automobile
Im talkin real luxury dont feel a bump in the road
We aint like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin it really had me disgusted
Nigga who am I kiddin It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnt ask for it back
And to be honest with you I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin large
Gangster pitted it kills gave you your first mill
And I aint tell you to blow it I aint tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure yea I know it can stress ya
But youre only a man homie I cant be mad at ya


Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin good in the back Im like fuck it Im bent
If it dont make dollars then it dont make any sense
They sayin I owe em dollars and that dont make any sense
Almost fell for the bait almost fell for the hate
And Im the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you dont put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didnt I put ya back on did I handle ya wrong
When niggas start actin weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real I aint keep it real with myself
Im gone be real with you niggas I gotta be real with myself
And Im gone be real with ya homie look you dont got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins I guess I need to repent
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
