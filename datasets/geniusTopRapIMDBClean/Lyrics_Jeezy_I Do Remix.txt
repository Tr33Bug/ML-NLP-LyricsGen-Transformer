I Do  Remix  Lyrics
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said now what it is what it do homegirl aint got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up flip it down weigh it up break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya whos ya daddy now
Aint even gotta open your eyes know what your looking at
And I aint even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight eye contact
Remember the night we first met I caught a contact
Now shes my ride or die its us against the world
You know we both hustlin so hustlin is our world
Said I mustve had too much to drink Im in my GMode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause its the GCode
Promise if I get locked youll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me youll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me its gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets youre gon be my lucky charm
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Man that boy so cold give him a blanket in here


I do I do I do oh oh
I Vito promise to treat this game ideal
Honor the code not bring drama to mamas peephole
Lifes a bitch but shes the only love that I know ow ow
So laadee after the I Dos lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot lets grab us a pot lets make a baby
Looking back I dont know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully cut that cake for me
I JayZ take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until Ive amassed a fortune too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never ever ever ever
Your secrets I treasure for better or worse
Youll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up my verse up
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
Unh Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know Im just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when shes 81
Please dont give it all away I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around there more jaded that they become
But this one special so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85 Im too legit
Im just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things shed only do when she get married
So lets do this shit
Tell the reverend all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows they clapped we take a bow
And shell be doing tricks for daddy when we take it to the house
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Nothings more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me  ughh 
Her would sense the heaven and him when Andre omen
Baby Im hell save me dont bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like like love
Friend rock star and So and sos a genius
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh mommas sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit aint gon fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby shell be nerdy make the whole club swoon
Shell love books and cook and look just like you
And when shes done being young shell dress like you
Well call her Love 22 shell tote a 22 the laser version
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
