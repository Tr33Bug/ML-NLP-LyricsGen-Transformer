Im sorry for cussing
Fuck you fuck you
Im back Mr Magic City
Blowin color purple I make it rain on your forehead
You woulda thought I had a fan the way I blow that money
You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money
The Feds outside and they checkin his tag
But still the boy move with a hell of a swag
Its like the soundtrack to my life
Everyday Im under investigation
But I will not stop so you can stop the hating
What more can I say Its like my gift and my curse
To fail or succeed I dont know whats worse
I dont know whats worse
Agents tryna find a glitch in my matrix
One slip and Im back to the basics
Red or blue pill what would you do
When the same niggas you love got hate in their blood
I know gods watching over me so is the Feds
When love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead
Lord have mercy Jesus Christ
All the bad Ive done will you still protect my life
Maybe maybe not
Until then I keep an extra clip for that Glock
You wanna see my bank statement
I got no problems with that
Three hundred thousand you know Im smarter than that
I been dodging the alphabet boys all my life
So you gonna need more than a child support lawyer
I got some child support for you
Get off your ass bitch and get you a job
Tell your other three baby daddys to sell dope or rob
My son got everything in the world that I never had
One thing you cant call me is a deadbeat dad
When youre the one that shoulda been exposed
Unfit mother still playin witcha nose
And I dont wanna tell my child
That his moms aint shit
And this aint about him
She just a money hungry bitch
I been here before
They boxed me in a corner and I came out fighting
They locked me in a cell and I came out writing
I said I came out writin
Lock my body you cant trap my mind
I only talk in the bedroom we whisper in the kitchen
Call me paranoid I think the walls is listening
But if them walls could talk
Id prolly never get to see the daylight
I gave it to em raw mixtape after mixtape
I had niggas waiting on the album
I shoulda got five mics in the Source
Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche
They say I aint lyrical
I wasnt tryna impress yall niggas
If hating was a crime theyd arrest ya niggas
Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life
The streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
I said the streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life
I said the streets cosigned the hood gave me my stripes
Yeah I know you aint done em
Im back better than before matter fact Im better than ever
They cant box me in that boy too clever
So CNN worried bout little ol me
Fuck the bitch ass reporter who wrote the story
You motherfuckers dont know shit about me
What I been through or where I came from
When shit got hard I stayed I aint run
So you can blame the government they made me this way
See the pain in my eyes you dont see me cry
Two tears in a bucket who got that work
Real talk Ill make us a way
Get rich or Imma go to jail tryin
Uncle Sam aint never gave me shit
But my partner out west yeah he front me them bricks
How the hell you expect me to be drug free
When George Bush aint never done shit for me
Follow me home and tap my phone
What happened to my freedom of speech
Love dont love nobody
Got me feelin like I shouldnt love myself
I practice what I preach I preach what I practice
A hundred thou under my mattress
Im only human just a man
God gave me a gift to do the best that I can
Critics say I cant make an album better than my first one
The way I feel thatll prolly be my worst one
Another one after that will be better than my last
So real talk yall can kiss my ass
This is the beginning of the beginning
I am the future
You niggas are a thing of the past
Im not ashamed of who I am or what Ive become
So all you ridicule lookin Im not the one
Its called self respect I bow down to no man
I say all that to say that you cant ban the snowman
