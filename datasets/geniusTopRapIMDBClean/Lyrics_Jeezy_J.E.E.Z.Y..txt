JEEZY Lyrics
Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Alls well that ends well
Outside watering their lawn and shit
Birds are chirping dogs are barking
Its beautiful
That may be your hood but this is my hood
Got the red dogs trippin and these niggas still snitchin
The old lady across the street still bitchin
Its 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep
The third time shes called the police this week
Lookin at my Franck Muller its about that time
The folks just left so Im on my grind
Said you wanna twofifty guess you need that nine
I want that bread but I dont need that time
Charger fresh out the shop with that suicide doors
Swear it died and came back alive
With 22 inches all under the frame
Keep a pocket full of bread yall niggas know the name
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Sold those squares yeah I cooked them os
Guilty as charged yeah I rock them shows
I cant even lie yeah I fucked them hoes
Trapped all day spent it all on clothes
Shop all day till the mall is closed
Come back to the trap to get my pockets swoll
Fruitopia smoke blueberry
Mix it with the purp we call it cranberry
The Bin Laden clips yeah they came with the choppers
Got a slick mouth I hope you came with a doctor
The boy stacks cheese like it came with the whopper
Stay fly like I came in a chopper


Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Aint shit shakin but the leaves in the trees
Between me and you I got a deal on the kis
Six in one run made a mil on the trees
Different broad every night keep a plug on the white
Mr 175 you niggas know the name
Why yall playin yall know it aint a game
This is me motherfucker why would I ever change
120 carats you niggas see the chain
Im a bathing ape fanatic
Red monkey junkie
Glass pots on the stove got the kitchen smellin funky
Sold a million records but I still flip them blocks
On the TV every day but Im still pop them Glocks
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine
