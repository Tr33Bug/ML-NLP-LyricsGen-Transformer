I got my mind on my money all I needs a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning get my smash on
I dont want much baby egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While Im out here focused getting this bread right
But if the head right Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and Im still here
Wake up in the morning and I aint gone
All I ask let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

But I gotta leave you alone

Let me be your mind reader let me read your mind
And when Im done with the front hit it from behind
Love and loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on you wont be watching mine
Put you up on a G show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if Im right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and its all gone
Best believe Ima get it right back
Thats the hustler in me I know you like that
You probably think Im with a different broad every night
When I think about it shit man youre probably right
The more I think about it shit youre probably wrong
Cause what you didnt think about is that Im probably grown
Yeah she said  she said 
You aint no good  no good  but you feel so good  hey 
She said  she said  I would if I could
But I gotta leave you alone
She said I  Gotta leave you alone

I know you bad  you bad  but I want you bad  hey 
She said  she said  Makes me so sad
That I gotta leave you alone
She said I  Gotta leave you alone oh
I I I I
She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just cant help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
Do what the hell I want nigga 
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she dont need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she dont
She never do though haha 
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
Shell remind me all the dumb shit
That Ive done over the years
But she dont be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear
Yeah she said  she said 
You aint no good  no good  but you feel so good  hey 
She said  she said  I would if I could
But I gotta leave you alone
