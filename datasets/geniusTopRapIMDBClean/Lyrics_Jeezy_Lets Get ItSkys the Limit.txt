Tryna get Boston George and Diego money  jeah 
And stack it all up like Lego money  ha ha 
Play with them blocks call it Tetris  jeah 
Real talk a hundred carats in my necklace
Look up in the sky tell me what you see  the clouds 
Naw nigga not me  yeeeeeah 
I see opportunity Im an opportunist
Nigga ya heard what I said Im an opportunist  jeah 
Soft to hard white to green  green 
All these free agents ya better build ya team  thats right 
I commentate the game like John Madden  jeah 
Cause I played in the game like John Madden  ay 
The world is yours and everything in it
Its out there get on your grind and get it  ay 
Hands in the air  Skys the limit nigga 
Hands in the air  jeah 
The world is yours and every bitch in it
Its out there get on your grind and get it  ay 
Hands in the air  Skys the limit nigga 
Hands in the air  jeah 
Anything you put ya mind to put ya grind to
Forgetful ass nigga must I remind you  jeah 
Men do what they want boys do what they can
And it aint no secret Im a grown ass man  jeah 
Put my hands on the Bible and I solemnly swear  swear 
Leave the mall with more shoes than I could possibly wear  daaaamn 
Niggas still hating but they can kiss my ass
Still get a hardon when I count that cash  jeah 
I give em the squares you give me the bags  ha ha 
I give em the squares you give me the cash  jeah 
And thats what the fuck I call a even exchange
And if theres anything extra you can keep the change  yeeeeeah 


Grind sun down till it comes up again
Stay down till we come back up again  jeah 
Its all in the game the ups the downs
Its all in the game the Os the pounds  ay 
The shit was all good just a week ago
Whole click was eating good just a week ago
Its all good nigga give us a month
Thinking of a master plan while I smoke this blunt  yeeeeeah 
Went to Houston and back now everybody got coupes  ha ha 
But the word in the street that supply the troops  jeah 
I just call em like I see em
Serve these niggas third person dog I aint trying to see em  ay
