Yeah be the realest shit I never wrote
I aint write this by the way nigga
Some real shit right here nigga
Thisll be the realest shit you ever quote
Lets go
My president is Black my Lambos blue
And Ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
My mama aint at home and Daddys still in jail
Tryna make a play anybody seen the scale
My president is Black my Lambos blue
And Ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
My moneys light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white now how much you tryna pay Lets go
Today was a good day hope I have me a great night
I dont know what you fishin for but catch you a great white
Me I see great white heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this who knew it came in bales
Who knew what came with jail Who knew what came with prison
Just cause you got opinions does that make you a politician
Bush robbed all of us would that make him a criminal
And then he cheated in Florida would that make him a Seminole
I say and I quote We need a miracle
And I say a miracle cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah

No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets had to flip some kis
So a nigga wont go broke
Then they put us in jail now a nigga cant go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin
She aint a politician honeys a poleitician
My president is Black Rose golden charms
Twentytwo inch rims like Hulk Hogans arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego weve got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity never lose your integrity
For years theres been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in Im the realest nigga on this label
Mr Black President yo Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill
My president is Black my Lambos blue
And Ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
My mama aint at home and Daddys still in jail
Tryna make a play anybody seen the scale
