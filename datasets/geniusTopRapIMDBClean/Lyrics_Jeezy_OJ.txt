What you know about champagne every night
Bad bitches everywhere Barry White
Fifty things I could bury white
Counting up a million dollars every night
Hit the mall blow a four way
Kinda hard when youre sleeping on Dolce
Wake up drinkin Rose

Million dollar round tripping I aint talking bout touring
