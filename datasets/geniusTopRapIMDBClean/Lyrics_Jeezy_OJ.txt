What you know about champagne every night
Bad bitches everywhere Barry White
Fifty things I could bury white
Counting up a million dollars every night
Hit the mall blow a four way
Kinda hard when youre sleeping on Dolce
Wake up drinkin Rose
Killing that white bitch OJ
Smoking that exotic riding that foreign
Million dollar round tripping I aint talking bout touring

Flat screens on the wall nigga Imax
Michael Turners on deck nigga half backs
Dirty white bitch yeah that Kat Stacks

Wesley Snipes motherfucka this the money train
Swear the work came faster than the money came
Sometimes the money be faster than the cars is

Double bags at the spot luggage in the place

Bad bitches everywhere Barry White
Fifty things I could bury white
