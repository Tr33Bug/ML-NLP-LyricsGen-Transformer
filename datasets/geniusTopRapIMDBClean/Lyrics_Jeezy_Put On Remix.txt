Put On  Remix  Lyrics
Rest in peace homie
Lil Mike lets go
I put on  ay Cliff 
I put on  yeah The Recession on the way 
I put on  ay Young 
The Recession on the way hey but on another note
A lot of sounding like Young tell em register to quote
See I rolled them backtoback like Im registered to smoke
Yeah I got it on me now but I aint registered to tote
I put on for my city and I bought a blue ghini
Goddamn you just missed me shouldve saw me shouldve seen me
Do me a favor see them haters tell em picture me rolling
Same time watch them Feds take a pic of me rolling
Got a phone call from Ye put my libs on his song
Sold 3 million records goddamn I put em on
I put on for my city yeah billboards everywhere
See me before your flight land see me before your bag claim
Reup in my city man you better check your bags man
Shouts out to the Eastside yeah they play them bag games
Southside boys will fly to your home yeah they play them tag games
Cant forget that Westside yeah they play them mask games
How you forget the Northside Dont know I stay high as hell
87 stickers too yall know I stay fly as hell
I put on for my city yeah way before the contracts
Trapstar step back might get you a contact
Rap star no strap might just get your chain snatched
Call Young brain stacks might just get your chains back
Call my name in the courtroom put me on blast
Still shining on they ass yeah its Mr Birthday Bash
I put on for my city onon for my city
I put on for my city onon for my city
Put on  Eastside  put on  Southside 
Put on  Westside  put on lets go
I put on for my city onon for my city
I put on for my city onon for my city
Put on  Eastside  put on  Southside 
Put on  Westside  put on lets go
Young Jeezy 
Ey Guru put a lil TPain on my shit too
Clear my throat know what I mean Uh
I put on  GMix
I dont need no TPain I got this one
Oh you bout to put on Hov  Yes
I put Marcy on the map I put Brooklyn on my back
I put Fab back on the charts I put Biggie in my raps
I put Nas with Def Jam I let Diddy do my tracks
I put on for my city thats a motherfucking fact
I put Mike Jack on stage at Summer Jam Billie Jean
I put Prodigy in his place on that Summer Jam screen
I put Preme in my truck told him leave them streets alone
I predicted jail would happen shit I tried to put him on
All these niggas taking credit for the work that I put in
If you really put me on put yourself on then
I put miles on that hooptie I put hours in that kitchen
Put that on my Dear Mama this is fact not fiction
Feds were trying to build a case I was headed for conviction
Til the greatest flow in the world put me on television
I put on for my city so when Im dead and gone
I got one last wish put my Yankee hat on
I put on for my city onon for my city
I put on for my city onon for my city
Put on  Eastside  put on  Southside 
Put on  Westside  put on lets go
I put on for my city onon for my city
I put on for my city onon for my city
Put on  Eastside  put on  Southside 
Put on  Westside  put on lets go
