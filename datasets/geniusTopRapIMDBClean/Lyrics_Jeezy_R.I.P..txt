RIP Lyrics
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
RIP RIP
RIP RIP
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im in a brand new drop top Rari with 3 bitches
Tired being in the middle of trial with 3 snitches
And I hit up every club in your city
Where niggas at
I be in every club in the hood
Where niggas at
Pull up jump out stuntin like I was Baby
On my cocaine cowboy shit like in the 80s
Who the nigga think he is
Slick Rick or Dana Dane
Think he Rakim or something look at his chain
YSL from head to toe Im Doug E Fresh
Looking like I came to play Mitchell and Ness
Any nigga with a watch like that
He need attention
Your man dont ball out like that
You need to bench him
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
RIP RIP
RIP RIP
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im gone dont know where Im going
Pockets on extra big theyre on Samoan
Got some bad bitches all in my section
Just let some more in
And every nigga came in with mell kick your door in
Roll up pass it around like we Jamaican
Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we some Haitians
She got good head good brains good education
Im drunker than a motherfucker heres the situation
145 am the knob broken
By the time a nigga get to the crib the mall open
Man the nerve of this highass bitch
She on the Molly
She said she she want me to call her Ms Berry
She think she Halle
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
RIP RIP
RIP RIP
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Got a pocket full of dead prez
Attached to your girl like a jpeg
Party scene turn to a murder scene
Keep shitting on niggas need potty train
Turn up collard green
Im on gasoline and
Im on that promethazine
Life aint nothing but a G thing
Switch lanes get brain hand down her gstring
Im the type of nigga thats built to last
You fuck with me Ill put my foot in your ass
I got a million in stash I stack my money so tall
That you might need a giraffe
When you was counting this cash nigga
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
Im so high I cant feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
RIP RIP
RIP RIP
RIP we just killed the club
Took Patrn to the head almost killed a thug
