JUSTICE League  Yeah
Therapy baby for my soul
Yeah just tryna heal you know
Yeah
Been listenin to my thoughts and lately Ive been concerned
Feel like my soul on fire let that motherfucker burn
Man nobody gave me shit I wait my motherfuckin turn  Turn 
Therapy for my soul
I had a few hits even had a few misses
Got clumsy in the kitchen even broke a few dishes
Street life scarred me my soul need therapy  Therapy 
Therapy for my soul
I aint never been the one to complain thats win or lose
Made moves and paid dues walk in my shoes
Its like a nigga came with directions I really made me
I was drownin then I threw me a float I really saved me
Put down everything that I love thats on my legacy
Never fucked over nobody to make a better me
If you ask me what happened with Kink we grew apart
Tried to sue he took me to court shit broke my heart
Same nigga you made a millionaire sue you for millions
Made man and he want it all none for my children
If 15 wasnt my dawg I wouldve touched them
When that shit went down with Gibbs I couldnt trust him
Invested my hard earned money tied up my bread
But he gon try to tell you Im flawed thats in his head
Its happening just the way that I said it good on your own
And if Im honest nothin gangsta about you leave this alone yeah
And everybody wonderin what happened with me and Coach
Same shit that happened between Tommy and Ghost
Cause yeah the checks comin in but the trust aint there
I would say its all him but that wouldnt be fair
I was fresh up out the streets tryna fight my own demons
Knew somethin wasnt right guess I had my own reasons
Mission impossible I aint underplan that
Shake took his own life I aint understand that
Had me feelin numb laid in bed for a week
Eyes didnt close one time thats a week with no sleep
Ima keep it solid he the reason me and Ross talk
Never ashamed to admit that I was wrong yeah thats boss talk
Since we talkin boss talk lets address the sucka shit
Grown man playin on Instagram real sucka shit
Why the fuck this clown nigga playin with my legacy
Solid in these streets thats some shit that you will never be
Talking bout power but weak niggas do the most
In real life nigga you really borrow money from Ghost
All that lil boy shit yeah it make it evident
Made millions in these streets what the fuck is 50 Cent
And its still free Meech love him if he right or wrong
But the streets wanna know do we really get along
If you askin me nigga thats one thousand percent
If I did somethin wrong then I gotta repent
Aint no hatred in my heart aint no hatred in my veins
If you felt me being distant think its time to explain
I was stickin to my plan while Raf Simons took the stand
He tried to GMoney me whats happenin with your man
Tried to throw me in your case guess he tryna save face
No exception know the rules I just handled it with grace
And I aint sayin that you told him to do it I know better
Still the same nigga nothin but love thats forever
See my ego and my pride yeah I put it all aside
Reminiscing bout all them late nights we used to vibe
When its all said and done were brothers your mother love us
The Feds did you dirty cant stand them motherfuckers
Speaking bout brothers welcome home Tee
A nigga might owe you money but that nigga aint me
I be lookin for the truth cause that shit be hard to find
All these lies and these rumors fuckin with my peace of mind


Been listenin to my thoughts and lately Ive been concerned
Feel like my soul on fire let that motherfucker burn
Man nobody gave me shit I wait my motherfuckin turn  Turn

I had a few hits even had a few misses
