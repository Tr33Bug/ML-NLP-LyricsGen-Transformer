What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
I just feel like you broke a promise to me
Only hurt cause I thought you were being honest with me
So Im gon try and do this honorably
Without the sponsoring fee whats most alarming to me
This so emotional for you robust such the calm in me
Easy to put off notes in thugs harmony
Speak to his insecurity acting so irresponsibly
And its further impacted by the fact that you respond to me
See some of us know you as Jimmy barely old
He had the baby belly fro nigga was frail up in his clothes
Barely got a hold and its seeming very outta control
Wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll oh
Yeah Aubrey thats the one we trusted
Not this new Aubrey with his stomach sculpted
Im disgusted youre such a fuckin incumbent
Cant govern trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet
Its bigger than rap battles a word for the digital cash castle Dont let a glitch in the Mac crash you
Unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled
Now clash paths with dad the original bad apple
I know where you at shit I was there too
When shit was happening fast word I got scared too
Impossible feats impossible to sleep
Making promises impossible to keep like
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
Listen alert the niggas that handle you
You fill up tour seats but you raw meat to the animals
Doggy to cannibal morning coffee and sandal shoes
Cant get this energy off me it isnt tangible
This shit is greater than me Pitchfork and Fader agree
Complex Im waiting to see this between us A and B
You on the cusp Rated G film I aint paying to see
Im patiently waiting with please
Thought you would take it in breathe
Blatantly seein his whole channel real AE
Hard to sound empty inside and fill a vacancy
Get some advice come over kick it and vibe
Im here with hotels strippers Odell all that shit that you like
Well light some candles and some hookah
Hookers flickin the lights
Well play Aaliyahs greatest hits youll get all tickled inside
My nigga Its no wonder youre losing all your friends
Poster child now for all that you had a wall against
And tell your mans Ill be seeing him soon
He marched you right into this madness I got reason to assume
I creep in his room sweeper consumed
Now his region of doom aint the legion of boom its just me with a broom
Afterward Im thinking we can resume a lesson in speaking too soon
How is it too late if Im reading ya tomb
Its not boys inordinate ploys and ornaments
Show up at party next door with a noise ordinance
So off the hook of me maybe yall should be shook of me
Should know Id kill him at even the slightest push of me
And when his team press up shirts Ill help em push a tee Should it read he pressed buttons but wouldnt push a tee
Gotta be buggin maybe he dunno where Pusha be
Or when Pusha push the agenda he isnt pushed to see
If pushed to the streets I see wood in your physique
Thinking you misunderstood my hood this isnt Meek nigga
This aint a standard that you couldnt meet
Just from your views you prolly couldnt see
Thats cool that kind of success you could never plan for it
Heard the question nigga Ima help you answer it
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I afraid of
What am I
