Parks on the board
Real niggas in the booth lets go
I got Kdot on the keys
It go  it go 
Check this listen
I got strangers in my face
Beggin me to take a picture
Still selfcentered they can give a fuck bout how a nigga feel
Bitches hang around to hang around even when shit get real
But I aint left nothin maybe I should write a different will
They usin me Im usin them they dont see the angle
Therapeutic I dont even fuck em unless its painful
Why do all these bitches seem to think they can change Joe
Judge me all you want I never claim to be an angel
Patriotic psychotic obsessivecompulsive convulsive neurotic
On narcotics searchin for you if you got it
Seein young blacks gettin killed weekly thats a moot fact
If these coppers shoot at me trust me Imma shoot back
Maybe yall ll pray for me
But I dont mean once or even twice I mean every day for me
So Im on my knees theres gotta be a better way for me
Open these windows and these doors but demons stay with me
And baby thats okay with me
I gave you my all what made you wanna leave
Fuck with my heart and now its killin me
This be enough to make a nigga cry
I wish em well until this runnin dry
They wont ever take me alive
All I ever do is survive
And I know cause they already tried
Its too late cause Ive already died
At least inside theyll never take me alive
Lemme get far as fuck away from these niggas
Fuck away from these hoes
Where Im at now its fuck music I dont wanna rap
I dont wanna perform or host
And my fathers sayin get it together and nothin matters but my health
Hope heaven reserved a section for an addict like myself
Watchin myself on TV see my knees shaking on that show
Plus the way shortys life is now I bet shes rethinking that no
She thought she was only sayin no to marriage
But that no is to so much more now I cant wait to see what her path is
I guess being a wife aint sound as fun as bein a bad bitch
Couldnt deal with my habits wasnt me though youd been catfish
Were speakin a different language
Showin you the signs in morse code
Last time a nigga loved two bitches I lost em both
So she scared try not to get emotionally invested
I know God will find a way for those emotions to get tested
Which is cool maybe not for me
Front all you want in your heart somewhere
I know theres a spot for me
The sad part is when its vacant Ill be gone
How I love you but I hate you
And all youre doing is being the person that I made you
From hateful to graceful
From rageful to grateful
Then God came and snatched that space for you
I tried to save it boo
Everything I caught myself building  to that point was made for two
Writing out the script wish youd a told me the page was full
But fuck it He knows better than I
Regretll subside lets sever the ties
After all its just one less goodbye


Lemme get far as fuck away from these bitches
Fuck away from these hoes
Lemme get far as fuck away from my niggas
Lemme get real close to my foes
They tellin me that I gotta act famous now etcetera
I been regular so I feel like an anus now
See all of this time Ive just been treatin yall accordingly
On an even plane like no one is any less or more than me
But the Lord agrees he said keep playin with fire if youre Joseph youll get burned
I hate second guessing Ill wait til the motives get confirmed
Call from the shorty we off that bitch option time
Models sport some
All these cities I got to tour one
All these bottles I got to pour one
All these hoes i got to call one
Our situation is a tall one what you gonna do pour or run
So Im spending forty thousand dollars on a timepiece
Help my self esteem and get this shit up off my mind please
Anybody lookin for me yall know where to find me
I be right up Steinway nigga I aint playing hide and seek
Let that liquor induce ya then watch how fast it go from a couple niggas on the hookah
To some triggers to them shooters everything thats going on is kinda sicker than Im used to
Im just wrestling with them snakes you ever kick it with Medusa
Let me get the fuck away from these pills
The fuck away from this drinkin
Let me get the fuck away outta my way
Let me get far as fuck away from my thinkin
Till its better its whatever shit Im unapologetic
Since all i got is my word nigga tell em that i said it
Its Joe
Uhh uhh uhh
It go
