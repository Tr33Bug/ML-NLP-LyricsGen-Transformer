Quarter on the loose
Loose Quarter
Few questions I ask myself
Maybe it started with Slaughterhouse or was it tour life
Maybe it wouldnt had started at all if I had your life
Maybe it was needed or was I thinkin immorally
If I wasnt myself could I say I gave the fans all of me
Cant decide if Im more ashamed of what they saw of me
Than I am of ignorin all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldnt dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so assbackwards
How could a dude with no regrets at all willin to bet it all
Not realize that quicker demise How could I neglect it all
Im so seasonal some of yall knew Id spring back
With a heart this cold howd yall think Id be receptive to fall
Im plenty comfortable when dangers around
And even more so when strangers around
And the bigger picture is sicker
Dont know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Dont know a nigga
Dont know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes
Life or death I tried to lynch myself
Thought I could keep it all a secret I convinced myself
But really the folk that loved me they could tell I was locin
I couldnt see em cry me a river cause it fell in the ocean
Numb to my words now maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose do I need help with devotion
Thats just some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior
And when He calls for me will He have done us all a favor
How did I make it here
Who are yall
I feel so lost
Now Im not seein it clear
Is it my fault
Its all in my head
Im lookin around like this cant be happenin
Round of applause for the angry rappers
Lord my girl cried me a flood then me a river
Thats love dependin on me when Im independent on liquor
Im up in the shoe store she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fuckin behind your bitch back
Like Fuck I was fuckin you for
Im an artist so Im intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searching
But its hangin up in my closet with your skeleton
Its gotta be a Gods work
Even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarters on the loose
And I aint been out here gettin my dollars worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sippin Patrn
And fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru Nate Dogg go ahead blink a eye
The doctor told me You close go head drink and die
Buried under the stone where the Patrn fifth sits by
That reads Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy


How did I make it here
Who are yall
I feel so lost
Now Im not seein it clear
Is it my fault
Its all in my head
They say knowledge is power  great cause every day I learn
As of late been havin revelations bout this hate term
Hate the way they judged me til I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast til I became its tapeworm
When I said Id stop gettin high tried to say it stern
Now Im the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off  I say How can it be
If Im out my mind how can I be insanity
The people used to say that I was scared of progress
They dont know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I dont know whos more to blame
Is it them for really not knowin me
Or is it me for never really givin them a chance
Get too close be too big of a threat
Now its been little to no time thinkin why I aint get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity gotta see Im grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet just so Id never be alone
Since I got trust issues I wont discuss with you
Besides God tell me who the fucks supposed to save you
Pop wont have a mantoman was gone half my life
So somewhere in his head probably feel it aint his place to
Plus more people will see me soon
I mean Ill be on national TV soon
So when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me
Thats four million more that might be able to answer for me
How did I make it here
Who are yall
I feel so lost
Now Im not seein it clear
Is it my fault
Its all in my head
