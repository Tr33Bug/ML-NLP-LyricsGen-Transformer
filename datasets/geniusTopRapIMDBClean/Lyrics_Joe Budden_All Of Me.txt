I give you my all but it seems like thats not enough
Now you can get all of me
A lot of things have changed from what I see
Is this the way its supossed to be
Are you in that mood yet one mo gain
ARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET
Look they say tomorrows not promised but if it was I wouldnt get open
Wouldnt get souped them shits was made to be broken
Member comin up dudes talkin bout hoes boastin
I was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion
I dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
Once I got it shit wasnt even cool to me
I dreamt of condos and video vixens
Until I learned most girls in videos is pigeons
I just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it
Wanted a deal I got it and couldnt deal with it
I want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket
Let the beat play I wish I could see a day wit no he say she say just wanna see Trey
Wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
Middle child wish me and my brother was closer
I wanna scream at her catch myself before I start to
And then remember it takes two people to argue
All she do is provoke me all I do is diss her
All I did was shake her she say that I hit her
She just takin everythin I say out of context
Im tryin not to black Im like a nigga with a complex
Was mad as a fuck didnt even show it
Yesterday was better off didnt even know it
Complete role reversal so its useless these days
TV got real music went fake please help her for Gods sake
When I proposed to the game I figured life was merry
Five years later Im feelin like Tyler Perry
Maybe Im exhausted maybe I just lost it
Maybe I should pick up a pen and try n force it
Same old story guts and no glory
They tryna low ball me do him like Joe Torre
I reintroduced myself to the world Im Jerz
Im an artist I paint pictures I dont rhyme words
More than a rapper I pay attention to detail
But how I do in retail tells me if I prevail
Leonardo aint seen these trials and tribulations
Foul situations with some mild stipulations
I feel like being an addict is a curse
Its somethin bout dude that makes bad shit worse
Theres three types of niggas in this world you know
So you either gon make shit happen  or 
Watch shit happen or  or  not know what happened
So I couldnt just sit there like fuck rappin
Its dudes with problems I couldnt imagine havin
If I had to have em I couldnt fathom me lastin like
I used to bump into Tammy in the club
Few of them she even helped a nigga get in
See a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit em
Care for em be more than hi and bye with em
Its been a while I cant front like I aint phased
She was my reality check cause we the same age
I mean she put on a show that you cant stage
She made the shit sound effortless
I was damn near in tears checkin my messages
I got goosebumps all over my skin
She said Mouse I highly doubt that Ill ever see you again
Hope everything is well kid
You see Im just findin out I have a brain tumor but I never felt it
The doctors giving me three weeks to live
Not three weeks til I die thats three weeks to give
I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care
I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career
And then she broke into tears
I pressed seven took the phone from my ears
Sometimes the simplest of things people need it
But I aint call back in fear of being speechless
What was I to put her at ease with
I picked a real bad time to be strategic
I think my lifes bad picking up the pieces
Some folk already got they appointment to see Jesus
In this world full of diseases
Ive learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures
Depression tells me I suck
So I reply I aint here cause I fell down Im here cause I got up
And then Im goin back and forth with Ransom
Shit came outta nowhere was real random
According to him Im responsible for Jerz too
I never helped niggas how the fuck you think they heard you
Motherfuckas got a lot of nerve dude
I was the nigga believed in you spittin
Had to con the industry just so they would listen
But go head you just gon rep yourself
How was you protecting me you cant protect yourself
Keep the lies to a minimal just read your interview
I cant help but ask whats gotten into dude
Media trainin but he dont know how that go
Itd help you come across not soundin like an asshole
In my past though been to jail I aint enjoy it
So why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it
I aint ignant just because I exercise spiritually
They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically
I thought I had a great job
Back when niggas loved the culture wasnt in it for the money like a ARod
Even when Im spitting bout current events
Its a sublime sayin whos more current than him
So Im wonderin if a higher power tryna underman
When you shoot for the stars sometimes your gunll jam
I aint been to Summer Jam
I learned from Lupe when you dumb it down its just harder to understand
2008 foes is still near me
So you can think Im tight as FUCK Im still weary
The Geto Boys say its all in the mind
Certain wounds only heal over time
No shame in my game no pain no gain
And since I aint see a prophet I figured God would stop it
Waitin on a alley niggas just wont lob it
Still a risk taker let me put it in words
Cant steal second base and keep your foot on first
Been about ten years since I was high off the angel
Now Im walkin side by side with an angel
In front of my eyes that prize keep gettin dangled
But cant grab at it my pride is being strangled
Workin shortys nerves like a personal trainer
But its me its personal it aint her
Friends keep tellin me leave her I wont
Cause she sees somethin in me that I dont
And I see somethin in her that yall wont
If you never been in love dont tell me Im wrong
See I preach gratitude she keeps an attitude
Argue long enough and that shit becomes laughable
My norm now since for her its so natural
Wish I could tell her that all them niggas after you
So not compatible that we compatible
Its nothin else in this world that we would rather do
Anybody out there relate to my pain
Turn the music up let me know that Im sane
We broke up bitches was starin at my chain
Dude was fuckin you but starin at my name
But we aint gotta entertain all that
Back like we never left we overcame all that
Fuck who made better tacos or whos ass fatter
Lets live for now right now none of that matters
Keep bringin it up its goin backlash us
Why am I meeting so many backstabbers
Why when Im about to crash I go faster Past is a disaster
When your house is see through learn to close your eyes
In case the Glass shatters
Just sayin its always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
Thinkin Im on the last chapter
No tit for tat I aint equipped for that
Back in New York chit chat with a Midget Mack
As I get olderI keep gettin sick of rap
Wanna call it quits but a nigga cant picture that
