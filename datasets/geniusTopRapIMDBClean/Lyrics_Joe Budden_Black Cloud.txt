Nothing stays the same forever
Not even me
Uh uh
Check this check It
Something mustve changed me niggas might defame me
But things that used to taint me no longer seem to restrain me
Strangely Im no longer sad mad or angry
Shameably it pains me feeling like it just aint me
Mainly what do I tell all the people that thank me
Namely those who ordain me aside from can you blame me
Motivation the Game was supplying me its no longer providing me
Jason Williams something killed whatever was driving me
Worrying less about the past more about the now
Less about what Im going through more about the how
Its for certain spent 30 years being fit for hurdling
Now Im a different person with nothin to overcome and I miss the burden
For certain got 6 figures in my sock drawer
And honestly this year I expect to make a lot more
Its hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
In a house thats so peaceful that Im trying to disrupt it
Scream fuck it not because I have to but because I love it
Which makes me as fake as the puppets that I speak of disgusted
Without a paddle up shits creek
Dig deep and see it aint life its just me
So be warned as Im putting on like Im reformed
Only so yall can accept it as being my norm
Maybe I quit working on me maybe I given up
Maybe I been lying to myself maybe I give a fuck
Its enough to make you black out pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while Im running from the black cloud
Every day we playing catandmouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
Its enough to make you spazz out pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while Im running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out tired of running from the black cloud
I say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
Trying to make my girl get it she dont know that its very scary
But shes a nympho she can be barely near me
She still want the God in her think she Mary Mary
The prettiest bitches just want to service me
While niggas prettiest bitches wouldnt get a word from me
Some of you havent heard from me some of you wouldnt mind murking me
Find that news funny likes its straight from Ron Burgundy
These niggas aint never seen dough
They can dream though I bump into em in between shows
People say Im Emo what that really mean though
Is though the song cant breathe I actually make it seem so
I lost loved ones because they couldnt deal with me
Cherish whoever still with me though the merits been killed in me
Normally its just me and my lonely mind
Everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
Fans recognize my misery uplifted me
Shifted me to my epitome guess the curse is a gift to me
Maybe its serendipity maybe its weighing on me physically
Maybe I should man up and tell God not to solicit me
Been medicated meditated sedated hated
Character assassinated all theses years I masqueraded
Hard headed if it was on my mind I had to say it
Tongue on the devils pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
Rap is fabricated rappers are so exaggerated
Wouldnt be scared of the truth if they werent castrated
Grab a mag spray it surrounded by people that shoot it before me
Thatll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
Now lemme speak to who I cater to
Would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
Promised to maintain being unique but relateable
All while suffering from a disease that can do away with you
Poetry on the beat spokenword for the masses
Therapy over ProTools every word is on acid
Consonants on Kush every vowel is blunted
Highly wanted this whole organization privately funded
This is bigger than the Eiffle this is alert the public
Had coppers bar our tunnels and our bridges with the rifles
Sentences meant to stifle this is a man aching
This is the dam breaking contraband in the making
This is panic unveiling got potential but I never met it
He be trying to come over it seem like God wont let it
Either he never got my invite or he just dismissed it
But if all Im hearing are the sounds of blackness why am I pessimistic
Youll never progress if youll never try
All I ask let every word I birth never die
My wings spread but when I met the sky
Weather didnt change like I thought and had me petrified
Its enough to make you black out pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while Im running from the black cloud
Every day we playing catandmouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
Its enough to make you spazz out pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while Im running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out tired of running from the black cloud
