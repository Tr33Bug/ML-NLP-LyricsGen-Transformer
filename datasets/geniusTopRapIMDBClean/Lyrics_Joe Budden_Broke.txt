Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Its been a while we aint talk
We aint seen each other
I guess thats how its supposed to be
Maybe this is fake maybe well never know
I mean we started with love the beginning was magical
Then it ended abrupt hows it us that this happened to
Was it all just a lie How was none of it factual
Even in our demise it seems Im always attached to you
They said If you let it go if its real it comes back to you
She just called me a thief I took it never gave back to you
After all that Ive done figured youd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off we cant even be casual
Guess we both had times we were being irrational
We both out of our minds how are we not compatible
Say I pushed you out the door and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wasnt impacted too
Should be a movie star ma you so good at acting new
You like us as strangers me I think its impractical
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasnt as strong as I thought
Well never know come on
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh


I mean we started with love then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business clearly nothing was sacred
I know you down to your core unless for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad all them bitches is basic
And even if they aint it aint hard to mistake it
I think you running from love with me you gotta face it
Are you guarding your heart
From a nigga that always breaks it
Now you live in the club maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me every birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who Im with Did anybody come after
But still talk like you the one you say that none of them matter
I guess it is what it is what about what it could be
Do we try this again just to confirm what it should be
But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasnt as strong as I thought
Well never know come on
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
Im the one you hide
The one you cant forget
And youre the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
Til there was nothing left
Under my skin gave what I had to give
We hit the end
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Our hearts so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide nothing left to show
Were broke like skeletons loving to the bone
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
