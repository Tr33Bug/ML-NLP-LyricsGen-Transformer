My castle started shrinking somethings gotta give
Ended up being the smallest place that I had ever lived
One of the reasons I would do away with fame to say the least
Dont know who these people are their names aint on the lease
Its a different type of monster entertainment is a beast
Was supposed to eat together then I became the main feast
If you preying on my kindness taking advantage of Joes cool
Id have to ask whats your definition of soul food
I bust my ass for my whole life and I worked hard for my profit
And envy I know cuts like a knife so you probably work hard to stop it
If you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic
You know I cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket
A pretty good judge of character maybe I mistaked a few
Cut some people off but had no choice its what they made me do
Why would you take advantage when its something Id have gave to you
And in the long run it doesnt take from me it takes from you
Youll probably tell me Im a fucked up nigga
You got it wrong I just wont be fucked up with you
Which forces me get distant and I never want to act a way with you
But passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
No longer enable you thats no longer favorable
But pride is on your sleeve so youll just act like nothing phases you
Which can never equal good in fact
So love cant be lost I know exactly where I put it at
Word Got no problem with nobody though
So have no problem with me Figured
No beef no malice I got no vendetta with yall
So I only want better for myself
Might even want better for yall
My castle started shrinking I tried my best to fight it
Dont know how it happened dont know how they got invited
Was good with cabin fever and maybe that helped create the space
Fuck your good intentions more concerned with whats taking place
But everyone feels entitled made up their mind they got a right to
My peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals
Yall can have the cars yall can have the clothes take all that shit that I dont love
Im learning fast that recognition is its own drug
And whats worse than some of your actions being feminine
Is I got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine
You there when its bright better be there when its dark
You wasnt there for the ride dont be there when I park
Figure I love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me
And Ill stay trapped in this room to keep yall away from me
Whats supposed to happen when Im not hot anymore
Your job rely on me being crazy but what if Im not anymore
The funny shit them mollys were cool when we all were doing em
But nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruining
I learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
So no love lost but not much is there
Deja vu this happened rapidly before
Every days a constant struggle and youre a casualty of war
Which could only equal good in fact
So love isnt lost I know exactly where I put it at
