Look at me King
Look at me King
Soul
Kaylin on the couch sleepin
She wake up she gonna be like damnnnn
Come and spar with a titan
If you aint knew its true Im Zeus and I marvel at lightning
What a marvelous sight know the thought is enticin
Flow stupid like 50 Tyson dont trip with 50 Cent
I beat em all like Tyson thats no coincidence
AbSoul dont forget the hyphen I might throw a fit
You think I lived in the Salvation Army but all it is
Is that we got a new 2Pacalypse Now
When  Before the apocalypse
Wow how do you come up with this
If you behind Ab then maybe you can stomach this
Who could fuck with it
I know you got a dick but use your head bruh
They sleepin on me by a colony of bed bugs
Cut from a different cloth and no one knows my thread count
My mind is like a sword youd swore Id have a hair cut
Soul and Budden no discussion
Joe you know its nothin
Wrote the score and then I scored metaphor and 1
I dont know about you hey I dont know about them
I just do what I do they just do what they can
They be hatin on the man with a knife in their hand
Cut from a different cloth cut from a different cloth
All these niggas on my dick all these bitches on my balls
Cut from a different cloth cut from a different cloth
Middle fingers to the fakers middle fingers to em all
Yall can hold the applause
I just did what these other niggas was scared to do
Tell me life is hard Ill ask What the fuck do you compare it to
Quarter on the loose Im blessed enough that I can spare a few
Told me Id be dead the fact Im breathin is a miracle
Yall got Gollum listenin to all these dudes that yall call lyrical
Excludin under conclusion that you young and you dumb
If thats how they appear to you
Id be lyin if I said your words aint bother me
Be lyin if I aint think it was trickery or reverse psychology
I came in on Rakim watched yall take the bar yall lowered it
Wont stay in line like a battered wife
Aint too many spots yall can go with it
How long yall gonna febreeze manure
And think the fans wont notice it
Nah I aint get angrier but the chip on my shoulder did
Not to gloat if I aint one of the GOATS
Yall probably missed my track record
Either that or yall just aint been keepin track of records
Ive just been waitin till that sentiment passed
Yall aint even gotta be drunk to feel this genuine draft
Im lettin Benjamins stack
Shouldnt be hard to tell if the boy is potent
Im the only time youll see a madman be void of emotion
Cause they fear me in any cypher the hear me in
Only rappin with Soul for the outer body experience
So hats off yall fit for this but yall the type we laugh at
Im way ahead and when I aim for yours
Somethin tells me he wont snap back
All I ever been was a outcast
This time in the moment I moved past that
But the burner name is Jackson and your alias is Baghdad
BLAT Its not a game try to execute
2KD my old bitch know I keep a ex to shoot
If anyone tried to do the math theyd probably be mad as fuck
Said Id never amount to shit now they tryin to add it up


I dont know about you hey I dont know about them
I just do what I do they just do what they can
They be hatin on the man with a knife in their hand
Cut from a different cloth cut from a different cloth
All these niggas on my dick all these bitches on my balls
Cut from a different cloth cut from a different cloth
Middle fingers to the fakers middle fingers to em all
