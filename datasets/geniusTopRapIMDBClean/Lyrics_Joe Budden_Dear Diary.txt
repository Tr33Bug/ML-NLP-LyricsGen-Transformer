Its five oclock Im just getting home
Roaming on my own
What can I tell her
That she might understand
The soundtrack to my life is like CNN first shit
Images like CNN but worse shit
I would down the whole Pinot Gris
But Id see the group home without the Primo beats
And it hurts my soul
Im a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga Dirk gon choke
Some people confide in the person that they sleep with
Ive learned theres no such thing as a secret  oh 
I cant describe the feeling I get
You was riding shotgun I was wheeling the whip
Shit I even let you rock out being Bill Belichick
Tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit
But dawg you was like a mini me mocked me envied me
Turns out you was blowin hot air Kenny G
But you was cool accepted you instantly
Not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
And though we share a few memories
Couple wrong turnsll turn a friend to an enemy
See phony people like phony people
Even you could be mistaken if you phone these people look
When you invite the nerds to the cool table
Shit is bound to break up like a pool table
So wack dudesll start feeling like the shit
And you thinkin its you its really where you sit
Or maybe you was neglected
Cause when you take the front down and strip a nigga naked hes dying to be accepted  oh 
I did that just the way you was
Now you a stranger nothing like the way you was
But uh you not real you not Rachel
You not Worm you not Dill shit you not chill
I thought you had some couth
Fuck the fake shit Im really feel that you tryna screw me
And you a little smarter than the average dude
So it took a nigga just a little longer to see
They tried to warn me fought with my girl erry night about you
Shit only hurts cause she was right about you
She run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
I keep telling her chill I dont care none
I got another side I never showed to you
The side where everybody is disposable
See relationships are never a threat
Cause Ill erase the history and act like we never met
Become done giving a fuck and done calling
I got your email I was done way before then  oh 
Dear Diary I dont wanna keep shit inside of me
Id rather just speak to you privately
Maybe its my mood as far as I can see
Theres really no point in having this guy with me
Change from the days of us getting in your truck
Its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck
Its bigger than me bigger than buck
Bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us
I always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way  when 
When Im really the fool for tryna teach em
When the blinds leading the blind you cant reach em
If niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed em
Niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead em
Having big problems with your dogs why breed em
Ill keep my part up keep my guard up
Was like Thundercats but changed faster than Cheetara

This a small part of a larger issue
Sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
But we all equal no one lower or above me
I love my team just as much as they love me
If not more
If I turn the knob we all going through the door I aint coming back for yall
The whole crew feel the same as me
How could you ignore something so plain to see
Im being ignant that get on my nerves every minute
Whats plain to some is really Burberry printed
Being so real sometimes is a slow kill
We was one squad you broke out like Mike Schofield
I want fillet mignon you want oatmeal
Add up our differences equals up to no meal
No mills yup no deal why you gotta chase sht
To know its no thrills for real
A nigga still beefin with his baby momma  BUT 
Only thing my baby aint a baby no more
Hit her on MySpace maybe she aint shady no more
Sent old girl a message no reply but she read it
Some things are so embedded and our heads is
Looking for Os but get Xs dealing wit ya exes
I was one long line away from the Tetris
She sent me the L that sent me to hell
To the point where Im denied my son
I dont see him dont talk to him I dont greet him dont walk wit him
But I pay for him like hes an object
No matter how right I am in court I cant object
Dear Diary how could she deny me
How she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche
Is she wrong using him so I can come back  or 
Am I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back
Looking for sun all I see is the hail
How Im gon trust All I see is betrayal
Its like they keep trying more and more to subdue me
And only you understand signed by yours truly
