It go off with my sabbatical
Took a few years cause Slaughters what I had to do  What up 
Which only brings me to now and I oughta be erratical
I say that cause my autobiographical is more so just a graph of you
I aint mad you did more than what I asked of you
As for me I did less than what I couldve
So though we were a hit had to cancel that show
And now my standards so low I be amped when she not a hoe
But what you doing right now is real commendable takes strength to do
Cause between us theres some deep roots there
I gave you the best dick you ever got in your life
And stupid me thought it would be enough to keep you there
I thought you loved football I was running through the hole with the stiff arm
But got disarmed guess it was just harm
I aint need to fuck I was looking for a peer
They say once you stop looking what you looking for appears
You were stronger than I pictured you much stronger than me
And almost just as strong as John
And John oh thats just a friend of my moms
With tubes coming out his nose but shit I never knew why
But he was born with his heart on the right side of his chest
No for real his hearts in the right side of his chest  Word 
Doctors confused aint much that they can do
But impute and say it aint on the right side of his chest
Scared he might die in his sleep deep
Every time he cough wonders if its a cough or its a symptom
Us well get better later
He gon live his whole life waking up every morning to a respirator
So I dont never say what I cant do
If he can be happy with life than nigga I can too  Fuck it I can too 
While Jos wanna die
Aint tell nobody but eyeing his eyes feel I should probably identify
Said everyday he lives with pain and wanna end it
Somethings wired wrong in your brain you gotta mend it
Had a bad breakup and let it expose dude
But if she was getting you high then she would get you low too
So whos there to wait on me
Yall just get it off yallve put the weight on me
Nigga look me in my eyes it was amazing to me
And said you dont understand you not as crazy as me
You got gall nigga Im the most mentally flawed nigga
You not even built to withstand all Ive endured nigga
You know shit about the thoughts in my head
Or the strength I need daily just to get out of bed
Just to open my eyes nigga open your eyes
The words spoken of wise you just know in disguise
We can end this right here I got nuttin more to say to ya
You aint never met another fucking nigga crazier
Blank stare couldnt believe em
Cant chastised me cause I got help when you need some
I could give less than a fuck and not a damn
I never be apologetic over who I am
Im the same me nothing changes when the riches do
But niggas wanna suck you dry just like the bitches do
They enter your mentions sucks to be the center of attention
When you cant even center your attention
Yeah so Im fucking out of frustration
They love every second and accuse me of persuasion
Jam was a cancer to me I had to rid it
Red got in her feelings fast but wont admit it
Dawn I was bored then never really smithen
V got threatened by the thought of competition
Malo wanna fuck all day dont know how
She why I got a Viagra in my wallet right now
Steph kept it simple loved me for my mental
B got a nigga but she used me as her rental
And you you just give me resistance
Say you need a comfort zone for you its distance
I tell em all Im not available emotionally
They start giving me advice like they coaching me
I dont even ask it its something bout
Bipolar sociopath shit they just find it attractive
Antisocial but I mingle now
But Ive been arguing much more since Ive been single how
Tell me is this a relationship or just a fuckship
Whatever situation it is its all fuck shit
Ill admit I might love a lil differently
As for them theyd all love to see a different me
Some cried to me some are begging for it
Some wanna see that change but not be present for it
You just act so frightened
Ignoring all logic now she wont buy in
Even in your absence my feelings are heightened
Though I know some loves lost its not on my end
Its not mine its not mine at all
