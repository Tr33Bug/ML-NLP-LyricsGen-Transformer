Yall dont know me
Honestly I cant say that I blame yall
I dont even really know myself
But yall probably shouldnt know me
Last thing Im tryna be is the good guy now
I aint never gave a fuck why should I now
Like the worlds interrupting my song with an interlude
Cant yall see Im busy trying to balance out my chemical
Finishing up what yall aint even begin to do
When your backs against the ropes its either him or you
Yall aint so important that my words are meant for you
When did eybody become so sensual
Caught up in the hesay shesay blog sites
Him and her broke up WorldStar Nahright
Dumb fans they believe everything that yall write
Found out friends fake couldnt even facade right
Pressures on wont fail nigga got too much to prove
Wouldve been lost it but I got too much to lose
Say what you want about Joe but I stood my ground
Bitch I get it up myself you just put it down
They say I put my whole life on display to my dismay
Stop it youre carrying on without logic
Let me tell you this about Joe
I only say what I want you to hear
Youll only see what I want to show
Crushing up the Percocet chasing the high Talli
I couldnt make this shit up if I tried
The forecast shows a downpour
Yall just made God cry praying for my Downfall
This shit Im talking bout right here
Let me tell you niggas something
You can be anything in this world that you want
Except for my downfall
Im a victim of society circumstance or just feelings
Was a nigga victimized Or just willing
No blinds no bags just dealing
No foundation or floor plan just building
Check it nights bright but the days dark
Covered in tattoos but hate art
These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp
Staring at the finish line looking for a way to start
Ive been called everything an extremist
Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
Anything a nigga do a nigga mean it
And I wont let a person place or thing come between it
An opportunist is how they paint me
But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me
Still I feel like my problems are great
Shit if I dont never solve em Im straight
On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate
So he had to figure I wouldnt be bothered by the weight
Im trying to change the pattern but its on loop
Even an outcast in my own group
Whats it mean when eybody standing next to you expects of you
Everything that comes wit a spectacle
If everywhere I go I just leave behind residue
Tell me trust me I wont think nothing less of you


Im sorry I aint around more
Come up with me or stay on the ground floor
I dont need shelter from the downpour
Yall can be whatever you want just not my downfall
They tryna make me slow tryna take me no
Cant be my downfall
They tryna knock my grind I wont stop Im fine
Cant be my downfall
No moment of clarity
The next fight showing is a rarity
Severity in me against my growin popularity
Rappers wont rap Im forced to believe they scared of me
But can no longer use the scape goat They not aware of me
So yall can go and throw your little pot shots
Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
Im getting my head right recollecting
Yall looking for some website resurrection
Being that I got too much to lose
Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that Im accused
No longer amused affected my loved ones
Now they startin to bruise
And I dont want no parts of that abuse
Wouldnt wish upon my worst foe a day in my shoes
Thatll just eliminate any excuse
And why entertain em
Old me woulda lost my senses yall just helping the new me regain em
Been punched in the face
It was either feed my family or hunt wit the 38
I aint want brunch to wait
Ive out grown HipHop it turned into a DayCare
So next time some shit is on my mind itll stay there
Im staring at the man in the mirror
But it aint helping see the man any clearer
So I get MIA from around yall
Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall
Tell me what am I to do
If I aint have a soul a nigga always had you pardon due
But I gotta speak candidly
How the FUCK could you abandon me
Wit 5 years of blood sweat and tears
But it was obviously a disconnect
We turned that into a disrespect
Said she been holding it inside for years shes unhappy
So the girl I wan marry was afraid to come and tap me
So I went away on tour and you went on one of your own
But while you was on the horn all day wit ol boy
Did you ever think about what it would do to your home
Whats his name Wheres he live
What is it he offers Whats he got to give
And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs
I hit you like a man you wore it in your ribs
I was heated
But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see whats underneath it
Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
Mistreated and kept it a big secret
Or are you just loose
And Im so naive Im tryna give you an excuse
Now that I refuse to believe we life partners
Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
Cant use anything I ever gave you to bury me
You supposed to be the one to bury me
You wan leave Then goodbye
Think the grass look greener on the other side but its dye
