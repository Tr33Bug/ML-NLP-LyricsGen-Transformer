What if the hunger was missin What if the passion was gone
If were truthfully speakin never saw it lastin this long
If the words didnt rhyme what would I do for a livin
But Ive been dead for so long I figure Im due for some livin
They only see the effects never pay no mind to the cause
My thinking is so complex simplicity can get lost
What if everybody was real and I wasnt surrounded by frauds
The moral in that is so priceless just cause I know what it costs
Lookin back damn near every problem I had it
Never got em retracted
I combat it problematic every problem of an addict
But thats just the way the cards fell
Heartfelt but can you be cheated if God dealt
Fuck this shit only regret that I have is ever bein regretful
I mean they all tried to kill me none of them were successful
A few I knew for some years some never met me and tried
But you cant kill nothin thats ready to die
They say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way no way let em all try
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
And now Im feelin like Steven when he was up in that hospital
Nigga shot him nine times they got him thinkin illogical
Crippled feelin immortal he cheated death he unstoppable
He just want that revenge nigga feel like dyings impossible
They want me to regress like I aint been through the worst
Instead of me bein blessed they want me pinned in that dirt
If you knew me in the past you would think my winnings deserved
They never noticed my path and all the sins I did first
Both my parents did drugs see they put them syringes to work
And I carry that same exact gene but I never mention Im cursed
Those prescriptions were murder I blame it all on that nurse
She started my relapse way back I developed a thing for them percs
Fuck this shit only regret that I have is ever bein regretful
Them fuckin pills tried to kill me none of them were successful
I close my hands on my knees send these words to the sky
You cant kill nothin thats ready to die fuck this shit


Say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way no way let em all try
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
See Im so self destructive hurt anyone that come near
Done it my whole career was always one of her fears
Hurt her so much in the past Im supposed to be healin her
But she love me so much she say that its only killin her
Now she say she cant watch it pill poppin its toxic
Promised her I would stop it just go hide when I pop it
Its a shame we can never be the same wasnt prideful
How can I tell you Im nowhere near finished bein suicidal
Baby that wasnt me just some nigga that smelled like me
Fuck like you stuck by some nigga that felt like me
You watched me lose weight you just waited there helplessly
You just offerin help to me I just dissed at you selfishly
When you left I condemned you really I should commend you
Not for havin that in you but for havin the strength to
I make amends to you now you shouldnt have seen me that high
I killed you when you wasnt ready to die
Say I live my own way own way and thats fine
Im just livin my own way own way like I cant die
They cant remove my heart my soul might take its toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way no way let em all try
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
Thats how it feels to be immortal
