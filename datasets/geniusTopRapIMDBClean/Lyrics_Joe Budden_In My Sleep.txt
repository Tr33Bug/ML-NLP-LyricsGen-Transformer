Baby girl told me in my sleep I was talkin
So its only natural I asked her what I said  said 
She said she woke up when she heard
But she was so damn tired she couldnt make out a word  out a word 
She said she was tryin to see if eventually I would scream the name of a bird  bird 
I told her thats absurd  surd  and then gave her the face like word  word 
And then she replied yeah said it was quite weird said she was type scared
I said thats a side effect that you get
When you trade bad dreams for some great nightmares  mares 
When I close my eyes  eyes  I escaped the Poltergeist
My escape from reality just what I needed
Brings me to a place where shorty never cheated  hey 
And even if she tried and succeeded
In this other world I wouldnt even get heated
Fuck  fuck  the details I dont care about why
Im chillin with my grandmother she aint die
I was browsing online and seen Mike on a banner
That said you can be like me and beat cancer
Anything I touched Id feel  feel 
Know its fiction but it seemed so real
Was leavin out the casino with a nympho
Yes Rae it can be so simple  oh 
Heres how I avoid a problem with my kinfolk
Learnt how to build me a house with no windows
And thats when I think I saw a ribbon in the sky but it wasnt from an intro
Cause where Im at is no rumors or gossip but still got love for Ms Info
She said in my sleep Id be laughin but shit be funny to me  oh 
Look my ice cream was two hundred degrees
If it dripped Id get a hole in my dungarees
See my anonymity is my protection  what else 
And me and hiphop have no connection  what else 
Which got me to reflectin is that why the mirror wont show my reflection
When I close my eyes theres no dollars
So we can scratch that one as an excuse  or 
Or why folks do the things they do  or 
Or why people act so brand new  lets go 
I had wings on flyin out a prison with a ratchet
Was only there cause someone snitched
Look  look here  no ones poor but no ones rich
Just my way of creepin if lifes a bitch
Took a walk on the ceiling just to get my mind right
That was yesterday  so  so in hindsight
Since I was able to haul off
I took it as God tellin me Ill never fall off  off 
Got rid of name brands in the jewelry  why 
Most people just use it as medicine
Like it take em somewhere they aint never been  but 
But here you better off not better than  oh 
Stuck in the room with a elephant
Opened the closet and dapped up my skeleton
Had a convo with a man with no ears
And all of a sudden everything became so clear  clear 
Have no fear I just bought a first class trip to nowhere  everybody goes there
But they dont stay the whole year me I got three hundred and sixtyfive shows there
My girl said in my sleep Id be walkin  walkin  so I ask baby where I go
Uh she said I be walkin slow
But she dont ever want to get out of bed so she dont know
I went to see a man walkin on water  and 
Asked if hed ever get things back in order  and 
Ive been there two years over a quarter
But everytime I open my eyes its like torture  torture 
He said please I gave you a whole nother world for you to go do with as you please
Just so you appeased mixed with a couple of signs about real life while you make believe
So I  so I  teleported out of there with a grin
Met a bum with a mansion invited me in
Then  then  we politiced about politics
Said somethin about Def Jam I aint acknowledge it
I went to see a virgin with AIDS yeah I thought about smashin that  why 
Yeah her ass was fat
So appealin tattoo on her inner thigh said
she doin better than she was feelin  feelin 
I think I seen shorty before  like  maybe in a club or somethin
Or maybe in VIP but wasnt nobody there but me
And the club was all red  red 
Then she started playin with my head  my head 
And then I came
Then I asked shorty whats her name
And it was weird cause she fucked around disappeared  uh peared 
Like what a cruel joke  look 
Cig lit but from it was no smoke
Flicked in the ash tray and seen Stacks face
Flash through a school hallway on a half day
Was gettin chased couldnt tell by who  or 
Then a hallway turned into a cliff  what else 
Screamin piff before I was dead
Somehow I jump my ass up out that bad
Then baby girl told me in my sleep I was screamin  screamin 
So I said thats a lie  thats a lie 
She put her right hand in the sky and said you was but I dont know
Why got to go goodbye  goodbye goodbye
