Intro  All Love Lost Lyrics
Just when I thought I cant dig any deeper
Said my last shit was trash and they dig when its deeper
They aint see what I see I guess my vision was weaker
Or they buy me to hear me so we can skip all the features Im like
Woke me up with the pinch
So its in English now since they aint wanna hear French
Aint wanna hear Wiz aint want me with Kirko
They aint wanna hear me happy now they lookin for hurt yo
Theyll hate it before they hear it if they think its commercial
And so theyre patiently waitin for my fortunes reversal
Check it its like ever since Bundles passed
Took the high road and watched everybody underpass
Truth be told God been lookin out so much
That I feel guilty when I ask him for more
Then I do it like the shit aint ever happen before
This is all the while layin on my bathroom floor
Hold up Im just askin him give me strength to grow up
By now Im sick and tired of layin in my own throw up
Its a given then self pity hits me
And I start to feel like I dont deserve to be forgiven
Like when you cant think talkin when you dont drink
But sneakin round your own kitchen cause you gotta get a swig in
I got issues weed and vodka will settle some
Well aint that the pot callin the Kettle One
I know niggas so broke that they embezzle funds
Too busy waitin for a chance that aint never come
But this is bigger than havin a debt
I mean I cant stop my brain from imaginin death
Then out the clear blue sky I cry random tears
Used to it me and depression been a tandem for years
I suffer from self doubt put a cramp in my fears
If theres a God this would be the perfect span to appear
Im not a street nigga never claimed that sport
And some of that train of thoughts insane had to abort
So people say I changed I believe I should
Even so the goals always been to leave the hood
None of this should be a shock to yall
Logic says if youre still there thats a knock to yall
Since you want a nigga furthest from his dreams
Loves gone DOA once we left the murder scene
Joe
When the love goes the trust goes
Its like you hit my heart with a snub nose
I dont give a fuck though
Where did the love go
Guess its all love lost
Been a hustle a struggle
Say the truth hurts and then cuts slow
I dont give a fuck though
Where did the love go
Guess its all love lost
Now this might be the realest shit I ever said
Ever thought realest I ever fought
Ignorance is bliss you niggas were never taught
So when a challenge is sought you niggas never retort
Me Im too savvy too witty
Its just too much moxy
No percs just a few crushed oxys
But gettin off was imminent
When my dick became numb I was impotent
Shit got real different then
Was out in Cali with a model little waist
And double Ds a pretty face and long hair names Vivian
Not the norm for me askin whats wrong with me
Tried everything we could nothin worked couldnt get me in
We went on so many tours high
That chemistry we once had did it all die
Somethings changed I just cant put my finger on
And Id be wrong to sing a song but let it linger on
Just know Id die for my brothers
Take on the whole world at least try for my brothers
Just wanna know that thats reciprocated
And if that aint the case nigga say it
These just words from the heart
My life coach say I never finish what I start
Work school and relationships become one
But if I took all I could howd I leave it undone
Im givin all the love but not receivin any
But then they mad Im all for self and I dont bleed for many
Shit I done made a couple of you bitches
Just by tellin folk I was a couple with you bitches
Befuddled and so now I dont want trouble with you bitches
Had I used my better judgement Id have muzzled all you bitches
I gave out careers fixed your fashion
Did this shit so much you would think I got it patented
So many loved and mentioned me
Judged but cant sentence me
Real nigga never cared
Worth a couple mil and started from an idea
Keep it candid in the booth never panic Im the truth
God starin down on me through a panoramic roof
I copped to the murder red handed aint no proof
Loves dead but you never understand it til its you
True colors never hide for long
When tables turn aint gon matter what side youre on
And for me thats a reoccurring theme
Loves dead Im just walkin yall through a murder scene


When the love goes the trust goes
Its like you hit my heart with a snub nose
I dont give a fuck though
Where did the love go
Guess its all love lost
Been a hustle a struggle
Say the truth hurts and then cuts slow
I dont give a fuck though
Where did the love go
Guess its all love lost
