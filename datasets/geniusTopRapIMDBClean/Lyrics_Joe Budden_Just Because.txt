You wonder why I stop and stare
I gotta admit it man
Every time you are near
I have a confession to make
Just because
I love you man
Just because
Sometimes love hurts
Just because
Its gonna hurt me more than its gonna hurt you though
I love you
Look listen fuck is up with us How we aint agreeing
Sensitive thugs need hugs just the game we in
But if we aint a team I know what anger bring
Angled in any language you want it mons aint a ting
Is this a cry for help show us the pain you in
Whats in your cranium fuck it lets put the flame to aim
Then theyll ask why I made him his most famous meme
I just tell em love makes you do the strangest things
They play at stadiums I play at Stadium
Shame shame in em really whats there to gain for em
I see it weird though fuck it we here though
Order my Bane mask all glass to let the beard show
Aint been dark in a while pardon my style
I mean I think I hear my part in your style
I can attach different acts to different parts of your style
Yeah we let you act as if you had parts in your style nah
Thats retarded it couldnt be any farther out
But really aint shit about it thats hard to doubt
Aint bothered bout it you fathered your fathers style
Which makes you a grandfather a clock I highly doubt
You a hybrid credited with the art of it now
Evolved with a style and redressed it in garments from now
So listen that aint my argument now
Just looking back through the years begging me not to involve it til now
So this a pep talk shouldnt be no awkwardness now
Sweet as the birds and bees from a father to a child
Look I know sometimes you gotta father your child
Like hit the yard for a while
But be back before its dark or powpow
Rage ritual with startling growl
Manufacturer of Coke here go bars with a smile
The shots coming though crew been at this bar for a while
The gun tucked the snipes out you see us cardigan down
Advance for the singing nigga and the margin is wild
Floetry the same as Marsh and them now
Too bad the martian is out
What song savin him when we in bargin in wild
Singers lose better go and check Debarge and em now
We heating up you know the fire marshall in doubt
Iron and irony I aint spoke to Marshall in a while
He said Budden get your stuff together
You busy ruffling feathers
Bound to happen when you target an owl
Now we not enemies he just gotta bar up now
Im still on energy lets see if he charged up now
And Ill be sure hes in the secret garden I found
With lions tigers bears Tahiry dolphins wow
