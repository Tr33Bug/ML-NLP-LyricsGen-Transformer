Lost Control  Freestyle  Lyrics
Some of yall already know what time it is though
What up
What up Its for hiphop
House Gang what up
I love this shit man
Black Hippy what up  Joey 
It go
Soul of a 70s number man I can throw a curve underhand
This for the streets not Summer Jam
This aint for the fans that wanna hear pop and snap
Drunk off Ciroc and the Yak all yall can watch from the back
This aint for self proclaimed legends that nobody wanna hear from
Scared Get a gun come to peers I got none
This aint for bandwagon fans sit yall asses in the same spot
Yall the same niggas made Trinidad Jame hot
This aint to Kendrick Lamar the nigga Kendrick got bars
I heard his shit and wasnt offended at all
And as it played I heard him say I wasnt mentioned with yall
Joell started it only right I finish the job
So all that shit is revocable from an overview
Only thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables
I state facts not to say its wack but check the playback
Outrhyming AAP aint showing me where your weight at
Im on my shit today you the king of New York
You might as well had spit on Biggies grave couldnt let that slip away
Im in the court of public opinion ready to click and spray
Light Jay Elec ass up thats my Exhibit A
Bitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into
Drown em all in a swimming pool full of phlegm and drool
You renting jewels whats with all the fascination
So when I ask you bout it thats my cross examination
This a scrimmage to me all these blemished MCs
Infamously its about image I see
But if its bars not about bread to hell with the wealth
Put you inside of the bullet just to see a shell of yourself
I mean uh since rap has been accessible
They actions been regrettable this is what the netll do  Uh 
Chick sending message to tricks aint get to see em
They aint even artists and they get paid per diem
We talking bars then this whole conversation changed
Fuck all the subliminals now nigga saying names
Some of these OGs I laugh at yall dont know me to half ass
To me its just one Joey thats bad ass
King of New York my nigga stop it 5
Keep it funky Drake washed you twice
Tell me Tyler that fire with saliva I reply dont bring a lie around
Run up on Meek with the silencer nigga quiet down
Then ride off with his intro playin
Cause I get hype to that shit dog I ride to that shit
With nightmares I wanna be at the root of em with the mag off
Know he love Philly so Im leavin him with Black Thoughts
We talkin bars Niggas better get help
They put they guts all on the track still they never get felt
Lot of lower tier rappers tryna rep for they belt
Nigga theres levels to this shit dog you said it yourself
But check it when it comes to control I might have lost a bit
Law abiding citizen style Im coming for all of it
Running in your studio engineer that recorded it
Yes men that supported it any blog that reported it
Any artist he tourin wit snuff whoever bought the shit
Whoever thought of it his mentor whoever taught him it
Interrupt with a sneeze hiccup fart even cough or lick
If I got it twisted you coming to contort the shit
But the irony yall all inspire me
Yall in a spot a lot of us aspire to be
We just striving my G tip my hat so yall know its real
Fuck whoever mad you said how we all suppose to feel
I know the game somell try to get amped
You push the envelope some of us provided the stamp
The predecessors wrote the letter others sealed it shut
Some was nice without the percs before Amil got touched
Its hiphop should blame on the mic these niggas hands on
Shades that they wear in the club couches they stand on
You mixed credibility with dead ability
Raise the bar like you on par with this level of agility
Old UNLV Runnin Rebel artillery with Augmon at the 2
What sparring yall wanna do
Get to arguing with a Spartan play it cool
I heard them alien voices Ill knock the martian up outta dude
Separate the beast from the timid its hip hop
Fuck if your car is lease or rented at least you in it
Foaming at the lips looking like the yeast in women
Dont be facetious most of yall been a feast from the beginning
This is for BIG Suicidal Thoughts Coogi printed
This for Nas army jacket with the uzi in it
Not no Shiny Suit shit this that 92 Knicks
This for Hovs missing 92 bricks
For State Prop and Beans to when the LOX first burst on the scene
For Queens Pac and even EDI Mean
This for the Mobb and the purple tape word to Inspectah Deck
This aint for the labels nah Wu said protect ya neck
This aint a diss I dont want it to get spun wrong
And this for Big L the block that Joe found Pun on
This shit is for Stack I aint talking a G
Nigga Im talking a G My nigga talking on me
This is for every living rapper ever walked in these streets
And any outsider that happen to think that a portion is sweet
Niggas been killed for less and got a coffin for free
If you ever been in the hood I think we all should agree
This for every nigga that took what you said in stride
I couldnt abide some of us still take pride check it
Limbsll get crushed hip hops adrenaline rush
Menll get touched so if you feminine hush
Project benches I trust came from syringes and dust
So who you named shouldnt be mentioned with us
But wait at least half of em other half rapped around
Dual clips that wrap around gather every rapper round
See what happen when niggas try to go toe to toe
This what happen when you let a blood bath overflow
Used to do lines how could they wanna go blow for blow
I could overdose and still drag you niggas comatose
This is lightweight put the bucks up
Cause if we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up
This is lightweight put the bucks up
If we talking bars lot of yall should shut the fuck up
