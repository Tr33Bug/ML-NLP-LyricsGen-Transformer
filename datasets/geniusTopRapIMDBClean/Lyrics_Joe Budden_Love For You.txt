Just gotta get these thoughts off real quick
See Im a thinker its like thinking shit
Its when you got
You sittin there reflectin thinkin shit
I peep it though
Look you liked me better before you knew my history
Before you knew who I was
Thats when reachin our potential felt likely
Nobody like me
Besides see if I stop bein who I am
Im straight to it who I might be
But you gotta look inside each song
Thats where I proved it was really in sight all along
Bear it all so the privacy gone
Grab the pen sit down and write these wrongs
Just how I right these wrongs but look
You liked me better when I spoke usin censorship
Before you knew I was really insensitive
That was back when it was you and me
Then curiosity killed you you had to Google me
Now I wont call the headlines a liar
Some are true and some are false thats for yall to decipher
But look on rare occasions some of what they sayll bother me
I liked it better when the Net was still a novelty
Cause now people who aint found themselves
Get an outlet yet dont know how they sound themselves
They like me better when Im silent and dont have an opinion
Pretendin to blend in like Im a minion
Say if Joe keep talkin that shit hell get him shot
But if rappers cant tie my shoes how can I not
Thought I had my citys support I couldnt believe
Jersey City liked me better when I couldnt leave
I take it back that aint set in stone
They more so had weapons drawn cause I left alone
I liked it better when I had nothin to lose
The days when I felt like I had somethin to prove
Shit even for me thats unusual
If you dont give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to
Just the world that I was born in
You gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind
They like me better when I fuck and never call again
Without it they dont know what type of box I belong up in
They like me better without reality television
Guess they didnt need to witness the hell I was livin
In my shoes you too would seal a fate
Poppin 20 pills a day somebody gon feel a way
Look uh and so these hoes just to pass time
After the past time they dont even pass my mind
You liked me better way before you got lied to
But that dont really matter when you want me inside you
Your friends sayin leave they dont know that you tried to
You cant speak to them Im the nigga you cry to
I liked it better when nobody ever heard of me
Fore pop had to get that knee surgery
Guess that affected his bladder
So when Jackie called me nothin else really mattered
Was scared sounded frantic I aint want no parts of that
Said the ambulance came might be a heart attack
Was leavin work nearly cryin on the phone
Im in rush hour traffic just seen you dyin alone
Look I just pictured all the places that we never went
All the texts that were never sent
All the words we never spoke
Time we never shared rewind so we can repair
Such an inspiration all the holes that you dug through
Then you got released God was watchin above you
Im thinkin you healin I dont wanna disrupt you
So Im right back to never tellin you that I love you
And I dont wanna act that way
If I take somethin for granted I dont wanna give it back that way
Forreal thats how shit get lost let me chill
I like it better when Im not talkin over my thoughts now listen
Ive done been down been down its all for you
How you feelin out there
And I dont wanna get in your way
How everybody doin alright
Get you somethin to drink
And I dont wanna get in your way
Get you somethin to smoke get you somethin to light up
Whatever your vice is we here though
Said this love is all for you
That shit dont be for everybody man
Said this love is all for you
Now the singers wanna rap the rappers wanna sing
Personally I liked it better back when rappin was a thing
Cause now if you wanna get the high notes
When that hook come you gotta hit the high notes
The label wanna sell singles
Im sellin a story and thatll just taint the message
Bad marriage we aint got the same objective
Still Im here cause real niggas in the game respect it
Look they like it better when I let em live rent free
I never knew that once it stopped wed be enemies
And though I come off as heartless nigga
In spite of yourself got love for you regardless nigga
Now listen I liked you better when you wasnt in the spotlight
Was too addicted to it said some shit was not right
So when you work so much I couldnt complain
Til I learnt she was gateway escapin from the pain
The strippers talk to me like Im their therapist
That scares the good girls away dont know the hell I get
Whatever thoughts you contrive I cant help you with
But youve been tossin it for a year and I derail the shit
Im self made I dont do what Im told
The type that needs free reign to be out of control
Forreal cause when thats gone Im lost let me chill
I like it better when Im not talkin over my thoughts word


Ive done been down been down its all for you
Yall dont understand me
I dont think they get it though
And I dont wanna get in your way
Dont know why you dont apply like our experiences and shit
And I dont wanna get in your way
To like my experiences with other people
Said this love is all for you this love is all for you ooh
Said this love is all for you
