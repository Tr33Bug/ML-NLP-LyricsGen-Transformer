To my dear dearly departed
Shits becomin all that I feared heres where it started
Seems that nothings as it appears swear its retarded
No wonder I get speared by my peers yeah Im a target
It used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be
AmeriKKKas Most gave America hope
Back when the music had a message in it
We was rebels against it
The best was intended to lessen the gimmicks
But now yall made a mess of it
And somebody gotta address this shit
Rakim would never wear a dress and shit
I aint a pessimist to say I aint impressed with it
Your hearings bad you think its alive now thats the death in it
When it was all about bars wanted to weddin it
Surround yourself with bullshit youll be liable to step in it
Came here with one objective gettin it further
Now Im watchin my first love die witnessin murder
When Common stopped lovin ol girl what was he tellin me
Cold world now she wont dig you without a melody
Love nerds used to be into niggas with felonies
We need a new president where the fuck is Eric B
Or did my wordplay confuse her
Now I see her with Young Thug and Future
Like what did you niggas do to her
Now my generalization is this generation
The imminent state of this gentrification desensitization
I call her shes in Marvins room everything is awkward now
She moved more to south deserted her New Yorker crowd
Met her with a cane she changed prefer to walk it out
Stopped eatin meat when she heard I worked in a slaughterhouse
Now shes a new dame glued to the fame
She used to hate accessorizin now shes wearin two chains
Relationship too strained I dont know who to blame
When I tell her You changed she say Who would be the same
She right cause this aint the way we knew each other
Or do I face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other
It took a while but thats finally understood
She wouldnt change if she could
I swear if this is love Im good
Everything has changed I can see it clear in fact
Starin at these four walls angry that theyre starin back
Took a while now its finally understood
Would we change it if we could
I swear if this is love Im good
Look I cant get with you at all our issue is tall
You tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball
Did I miss a red flag You wasnt fickle before
I cant even ridicule yall thatd be a bitter resolve
Wanna talk about our history
I feel like everything you say is contradictory
Whenever you come visit me
I look at you and see remembrance remnants
Plenty resentments its not you but theres resemblance
We diss each other all out of fun shit amuses me
You threaten every girl Im with that just confuses me
Say you want kids real soon now thats abuse to me
And I just write about it in song youre like a muse to me
I wanna ask where you see yourself in five years
How you goin about that like whats the verdict
I wanna ask if you ever replay the past over
And if you do when you finished is it worth it
I wanna ask if we love each other so much
How do we cause each other so much pain
Still in all in each others lives
Weve remained without a claim
I know somell call that clinically insane
How do we remedy the games
Was once enemies and then that energy refrained
Wasnt meant to be the synergy had us mentally drained
Minimally sprained so relentlessly he aims
Despite when you said you never could depend on me again
Still were here as none of this had ever taken place
Are we checkin to see if someones takin our place
As we front like were takin up space
I think currently the current we is makin our case
But for what Would that just seal it again
Did it all hurt so much Do we wanna feel it again I doubt it
Took a while still nothings understood
Would we change it if we could
I swear if this is love Im good


Everything has changed I can see it clear in fact
Starin at these four walls angry that theyre starin back
Took a while now its finally understood
Would we change it if we could
I swear if this is love Im good
Look I can see the pain in your eyes I wanna fix it
But all your words are fuelin my pride so Im dismissive
You think I wanna sit in this courtroom
Talkin supervised scrutinized by suit and ties You a lie
You could cry the conditions of you and I cant escape it
Every lie she told you over the years Im face to face with
And now they manifested
Youre overwhelmed and congested
But feelin neglected I gotta respect it
I cant explain to your so young brain
Since our first exchange youve been kept from me
Used against as weaponry
And as much as I hate her
Id never downplay your mother like that
For you to judge her like that
Just a lesson later on that youll discover like that
We not alone in this process no its others like that
But you spew these sly remarks like Why are we here
Like why are you near Like why do you care how is this fair
I gotta eat that see you got a grudge lil nigga
We flesh and blood lil nigga no ifs ands or buts lil nigga
You can think your dad is nuts lil nigga
Im talkin to you cause you came out of my nuts lil nigga
Thats my stance on the matter I wont budge lil nigga
And Ill tell that to your mother and the judge lil nigga
At our next court date you gon see that its true
Funny my condescendin ways I kinda see em in you
Mannerisms when Im annoyed yep Im seein that too
Im smilin admirin genes I kinda think that its cute
I was you 20 years ago when pop popped up
But nothin like you sad how lifell recycle a cycle
You missin intel only a dad can give
Cant expect you to understand this doesnt matter to a kid
And since our situations not understood
I would fix it if I could
I swear if this is love Im good
Everything has changed I can see it clear in fact
Starin at these four walls angry that theyre starin back
Took a while now its finally understood
Would we change it if we could
I swear if this is love Im good
