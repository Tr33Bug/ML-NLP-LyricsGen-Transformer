Im right here per your request now you stuck in them shoes
No alliances with Meek its still fuck him too
Before we start to the fans Im uncomfortable too
Stuck in the booth feelin like yall cause I got love for the dude
But now my phone blowin up theyre like what Im gonna do
Show the world you shouldnt poke a man with nothin to lose
All of this just because I wasnt in love with his Views
Whatever happened I just know they got me fuckin confused hey
Mic check mic check
One two one two
Wait a minute
Drake Im happy Im honored Im Im Im honored to be around you man
Joe Budden Yo cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon
Drake Okay so I cant be honest on your network here I cant be honest to your fans and say Im honored to be around you
Joe Budden It aint an honor to be around me
Drake We all used to listen to you so I dont even you need to learn how to take compliments Dont say that in vain hes one of the best You know that right
Other Person What up What up
Drake I said dont say it in vain you know hes one of the best
Other Person Nah its all love
New Joe Budden
Look enough of the sentimental crap
Cool if you into that
Fuck all of these subs who they intended at
I wont believe its me without forensic facts
They dont normally mention Black when pennin their raps
But then I listen back I heard a pinch of sass
Tender ass Teddy come around he gon get pinned to grass
I come around with every inch of the mag
Im a wordsmith forreal you thought Quentin was bad
You made me proud lad but it seems my child mad
With all the clout that he grabbed its still doubts from his dad
Look this aint promotional you just emotional
No doubt you got Starbucks with all that Joe in you
I part his reign lightnin fast just what Joseph do
A black cloud all over the 6 check the overview
Youre so indirect shit wasnt real clear
Either Jimmy actin or he really miss a wheelchair
What he dont know is we the most kindred of souls
I shouldve did this two Kendricks ago
He wanna sing Well lets get into the show commence my role
For Jodeci Boyz II Men we at the end of the road
I figure hes that close to his death to know the reaper
In fitted sweats with old sneakers the flow ether
Gassed cause he KOd Omeeka no Joes deeper
Quick to put extension on singer thats Moesha
Nothin bout Rick slick but show of the Caesar
My crust from the same old pizza as Mona Lisa
So how you callin out the lyrical god
Your face light up when you see me talkin Miracle Watts
Cause your words aint sayin a thing
I kilogram without weighin a thing
Nigga you baitin a king
Tell you the way that Golden State say to its team
Aubrey you gotta make a shot you wanna play on the wing
Dem a call me a murderer
I never duck just spray
Ima never miss mi aim
Dem a call me a murder
Theres some truth in that saying
Dem a call me a murder
Nobody seen nothing nobody seen nothing
What I see ayy
Look here I just spit the facts raging aristocrat
Shooters heard them words wanna get rid of that
When they roll up bet dude wont wanna live his raps
Hell see the 6 upside down and wanna switch it back
Wrath of a god sinner
Im too real I bet your stars tender
I bet a mil Ill bet a star tender
But since the OGs Hov heres what I wanna know
If aint no real niggas allowed the fuck would I wanna go
Thats thinkin back to Jay now lets get back to Drake
Both too big to respond to all I have to say
Still with all their success and all their accolades
The universe makes it so they come right back to me
Heres a reminder that we go way back
I mean um you know for me the kid is practice Hova
I make these words flip as if they practice yoga
Okay practice over back to Blacklist Hova
Nothin personal this Red Reddington
Shawn I dont work for you still Im doin the work for you
Payback wire his jaw reimbursin you
Metal all behind his face Sprite commercial you
Might have made a mistake out of this one
Cant Bell Biv Devoe your way out of this one nah
So warn your damn campaign that hammers rang
I just bought a New Edition you cant stand the rain
Yall say this soft nigga hard and that I cant explain
Yall think hes soul for real I see candy rain
So Aubrey when you sub real MCs you get murdered
And since you signed to five guys makes you a burger
Dem a call me a murderer
I never duck just spray
Ima never miss mi aim
Dem a call me a murder
Nobody seen nothing nobody seen nothing
What I see ayy
Real quick I dont wanna talk too long I think you misconstrued the boundaries of this relationship and this friendship Which in return has caused me to do the exact same thing I dont understand how you niggas and how you in particular how you can fuck shorty and I dap you and say you a real nigga and I critique your album and all of a sudden we sensitive I dont understand how you new niggas work Maybe Im out of touch with the rules of todays society Im clearing all that Now let me paint who I am before I allow another nigga to do it for me
Im from the school of pussy dont get me punch drunk
Maybe its different in the city you come from look
Im from the school of these hoes belong to everybody
No celeb exempt goes for everybody
So when I seen you fucked shorty not a bitter bone in me
I aint think of how to handle the plan
Said Im aware have fun understand that its fam
Told that to you and not her thats just the man that I am
My nigga kids got no respect
Odd cause you called me for the ho check on every ho you checked
That makes sense bad bitches thats what Joe do best
And Is the man round these parts when they aint know you yet
Which kinda makes me your OG in Toronto
And I aint charge once thats for free in Toronto
Im unsure how that came to be in Toronto
Nigga I dont even be in Toronto
When it rains it pours
All that means dog get please get a poncho
Subs fell short like a free throw from Rondo
So rude he gay so mean with all the Budden threats
As soon as we shoot at King DeMarcus Cousins next
This shit is truly a movie
You started a trend bein a groupie for groupies
Shit I had Bria in the coupe and out her way
Before you ever wrote an interlude about her
So who you playin with clown
Im first shift at the bars so only means I already made them rounds
They say that he the best MC and best flower
He cook better than me but you love my leftovers
Fire the kill shot the fire still hot
Word to your Versace velours that Kyra still got
You playin chess with the chrome of the pump
Let it blast checkered past shoulda known from the jump
Its whatever you wanna roll executives got your soul
Sedatives Im repetitive with those records show for
Regular Joe sellin records was never the goal
I never sold records I kept records of what was sold
Might have made a mistake out of this one
Days long cant Trey Songz your way out of this one
So dont worry yourself and before I go
Fuck a record label I appear courtesy of myself Joe
