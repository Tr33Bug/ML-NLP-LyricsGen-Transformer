Here we are all alone
Who gives a fuck about what they say
Im sure Ive heard much worse
People need to worry about them first
People need to learn to mind their business instead of mine
Here we are all alone
Who gives a fuck about their dismay
But still Im facetoface
With the one person I cant replace
One person I cant just tell Im doin fine
What up Ma
Been a while
Lot of catchin up to do
Know you got a ear full
Im listenin
Momma said she loves me said she cares
Said if I need her shell always be there
But even her sayin that struck me as weird
Why did she feel those words I needed to hear
Said she understands me that was rare
Cause no one understands me not even my peers
And these just thoughts I never bother to share
So as I write my eyes start to tear
I aint tell her Im tired but still troopin
Alone but I find myself regroupin
Aint say my brain now feel like a prison
Figured Id shut the fuck up and listen
She continued that was honorable
She said I get more and more irresponsible
For normal folks she said thats a challenge
Luckily I mask mine behind talent
She said You are no longer yourself
I dont know what to expect of you
Said Im puttin up with things I normally wouldnt
She dont know why its acceptable
She said People livin in your house
Dont pay shit not respectable
I told her theyre folk I think highly of
She said Well they must think less of you
Must feel entitled all you doing
I said Ill fix it she said No you wont
Then I got defensive but still replied
I told her I need them she said No you dont
Then she said Whens the last time you spoke to your father
I said hes selfcentered why bother
Cause he only really call about his needs
And I aint got enough time to deal with his greed
Cause my days are darker
Cut from a long shank but the blade is sharper
Im makin my notsovague departure
Tell pop Im his son not his Spades partner
Last time that we spoke
He wanted to use the crib throw a party here
Which wasnt partly fair
My home need to feel like home even if I throw a party here
Then he catch an attitude
And I catch one right back at you
We adore each other but ignore each other
Think this is how the fuck I wanna act with you
Things just aint the same
But he sure will call about a Yankee game
Like Call CC and get back to me
Whats ill is he say it so casually
I love him so much he can have all the perks
Hurts so much I take all the Percs
Hurts so much but fuck it it works
Hurts so much that I cant sleep
Mom say I need to sleep more
Then again she aint on this stress level
So many people rely on me
Im tryin to get us all to the next level
Wait told her I took baby girl to the doctor
It was only for a checkup though
And she gave me the face like Now would be time
If theres anything I feel I need to let her know
But thats just Mom again just bein a mom again
Looked down at the tat on my arm again
God please give me the strength keep calm again
She asked me if Kaylin was pregnant
I looked at her like she was crazy
Cause thats my baby whats wrong with a baby
She said Nothin at all when youre not datin a baby
Beautiful girl I like everything about her thus far
I just dont wanna see you fall
Just a tad bit young so she got some growin up to do
And I replied Dont we all
Momma said Why cant you ever be alone
I said What do you mean
Went to correct her she did it herself
She said At least thats how it seems
Pop aint called hes still mad
Still pissed hes still angry
Im still goin no plan of slowin
No way Ill ever let his immaturity taint me
Momma said that Tahiry called
That aint shock me they speak a lot
Shes helpful and knowin my ex
