I give you my all
But it seems like thats not enough
Lettin you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin
The one thing remainin
Is I keep lettin you get more of me
My story my pain cant ail it
My tears overflowed you cant pale it
My talent too immense cant jail it
Niggas tried to cross the God but they aint nail it
My path my walkway you cant trail it
My ladder my mountain cant scale it
Its my life my struggles cant help it
Im just grateful that He kept me alive for me to tell it
Check it see the music industry changed me
It was everything that Id have never guessed it was
So my discography is all full of handmedowns
I couldnt figure out another way to dress it up
So every verse spiked with the truth
Nah no one know me better than this mic and this booth
Its no better way I owe my today to my yesterdays
You live with regrets probably die with em too
So I trust God more than myself Im tryna tell ya
Was drunk in the basement now Im in the wine cellar
I learned to never let the fear settle in
And now Im more prepared than Ive ever been
Not one ounce of hate in my glans
Just one of the things OG taught me way in advance
Said its two types of folk in this world
Got the ones thats out doin it and those busy sayin they cant
I give you my all
But it seems like thats not enough
Lettin you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin
The one thing remainin
Is I keep lettin you get more of me
You know some niggas never learn
Some learn and never apply
But wait some apply but never teach
My only right to preach I spent time being each
Grab that magnifying glass I need yall to look closer
At the only dude to do every drug and get lower
If niggas knew a third of all the weight that he shouldered
Theyd know it an insult to think Im only bipolar
I got a unique talent dont know how I obtained it
How do I sustain it Cant even explain it
I get more info from words that arent spoken
More fixated on people or things when they are broken
I used to think everybody was pure
Now Im busy tryin to come up with everybodys cure
And that mindset led to close alarms
It be the people you help most normally do the most harm
Baited my whole life most times I aint bite
So no need to stick to a script that I aint write
Preconceived notions nothin less than a failure
Base yous off of the cover and miss the bestseller
While Im at it let me tell you bout this angel I met
She was fly from every angle was fresh
And the way that she was jammin to the song called Im Not Perfect made me wanna know what her imperfections were
Now listen and they werent hard to find yall
Both parents were addicts like mine are
Minor but her story wasnt new to me
Most her life shorty was homeless like I used to be
Could tell she never felt appreciated
Looked too much like her dad was her moms least favorite
Picture a bond supposed to be sacred
Lookin up at your moms eyes and seein hatred
Pop left when she was young
Well she still young and he still gone keep it a hundred
While Im just amazed that a woman so beautiful
Could go through such ugliness and not become it
World keeps spinnin learned sinners keep sinnin
And I cant even tell her some fights aint fight worthy
Cause my pops got 20 years clean
But her pops got 20 years dirty
She moved to Jersey where he happens to reside
Thinkin theyll be closer but its only fiction
Cause she so young all it does is cause friction
God picked the right nigga though to teach about addiction
Years ago she shoulda been on homi watch
So check the time out just not on Mommy watch
Cause someone beat her ass for years someone calmly watched
Nah stepdaddy beat her ass Mommy watched
I keep her closer than ever she always next to me
Bisexual comfortable sexually
Im talkin more comfortable than she should ever be
Especially considered the fact she was molested three
Times some things a picture doesnt tell
Cant be worth a thousand words or her pictures might yell
Yall see a pretty face on Instagram
I see a girl that should be scarred never lent a hand
There go Gods work again howd he know I need that
How the fuck did he pick her to walk me through a relapse
Believe me shorty Ill kill for you if need be
And I need you much more than you would ever think you need me
What I do for you is tangible shit that you can gain
You for me not understandable its shit I cant explain
Some folk dont see the effect in that
Some say Im usin you theyd be correct in that
But what for theyll never know
Its deeper than nude pics its somethin I would never show


I figured like this
You came to me at a pool party
And I was two steps away from smokin on that wet
My logic say to me you came to me as a stranger and I hold you dearer than most people I ever met in my entire life b
Gods work not mine
You came younger and wiser Id have never known it
You dont look your age
Younger and wiser when I was older and dumber
You came to me as nothin Id have ever wanted
But everything Id have ever needed
I swear to you its Gods work not mine
So youll never be alone again
Whats mine is yours you wont be without a home again
And I know you from Miami so you hate the cold
But you been through much colder than me and Im much older
You just ride shotgun let a nigga chauffeur
Ill cut the grass you just look out for the cobras
Well be just fine God set these on our shoulders
Ill show you a man you showed me I could stay sober
Let the world talk about every picture we post up
And well sleep well every night cause they dont know us
I give you my all  Gods work 
But it seems like thats not enough  Talk to em 
Lettin you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin
The one thing remainin
Sometimes you gotta stick around for the miracle 
Is I keep lettin you get more of me
Gotta wait for the miracle to happen
Gods work not mine 
I said Gods work not
Word I love you
Im gone
Life is beautiful aint it
