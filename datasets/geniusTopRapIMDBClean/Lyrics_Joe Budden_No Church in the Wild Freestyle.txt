No Church in the Wild  Freestyle  LyricsUgh ugh ugh
Uhoh
That NJ bullshit Im on it
Joey
Can I talk my shit again
Just wanna know
Just wanna know if I can talk my shit again
Ayy couldnt blame me
I had to
Yall can threaten me with ya thoughts just never speak it
One gun accompanied by prayers I never need it
Burning flesh skin peeling slow inferno
Take away what we love wed all be Joe Paterno  Talk to em 
Reporting live from the city where they gun tote  Tote 
Sober in the sauna full of blunt smoke  Talk to em 
Yall concerned with Drake and Common
Me  Im concerned with niggas havin fake in common
Though Im leading I dont really know the path
But the future cant be worse if you really know my past
Begged to be understood anytime I showed the wrath
But how could I expect third parties to know the half  Ayy 
Like when the temp rises but you the candle wick
Sorta like Kyle Williams out in Candlestick
Erybody shouldnt grab the hammer by the grip shit
Billy Cundiff couldnt handle the kick shit
They say I changed since stardom
Cant share the same success we aint share the same problems
So got big just to show em what the gym does
Never mind shootin they aint show me where the gym was  Ayy 
Thats why I do a lot on spite
So if you look up to me you got em at the wrong height
I mean Im not a role model  Nah  Im a piece of shit  Nah 
A product of never being given a piece of shit
Breaking day got the grind of a trucker
And my logic aint designed to intertwine with you suckers
Loaded nine is a buffer but no time for you fuckers
Therell be bodies in the sewers when my minds in the gutter  Owww 
Last night I had an epiphany
Then wrote it in my rhyme book in calligraphy  Ayy 
I see so many people looking for validity
Thats the wrong search if whats lost is dignity
I certainly have grown since Mouse
Chrome under the couch  But I 
But Ill stomp his face to make it known what Im about
If he on what he spout
Put my Nikes on his cheeks now he foaming at the mouth  Get it 
Ugh reminded when I vent
Nigga God designed it its in the print
Two memos for the spineless ones repent
Second jewel even my kindness is a strength nigga
No beef no malice not at all  Not at all 
I got no vendetta for yall  I promise 
I mean I only want better for myself
Sometimes I even want better for yall I swear
Theres no love in hiphop
Irony not even on Love and HipHop  Nope 
Spacious closets Persian rugs
Make sure Im dressed at my best for the jerks that judge
Had a talk with my ex and knew for certain I was bugged
So I let the door slam feelin worse then I was
She said all I ever made her feel was hurt and disgust
Which in turn hurt cause that was my version of love I cared
Clear yeah that you need better resolution
It seems the chances we agree are forever ruined  Ugh 
You talking bout how Im talkin about execution
You talking bout now Im talkin about evolution
Ugh but better days gotta come
Im a good amount of bad right amount of so wrong
And Heidi Klum left Seal which only prove my point
Shit can only be ugly for so long
Slaughterhouse founder cant derail the captain
Aint enough niggas praying I fail for it to happen
Cause on both sides of the coin youll get fed shells  Bow 
In unison hollow heads from redtails
I dont wanna see your weapon
To keep me from what Im destined
Somell see that as a blessin  Ugh 
And my dudes swear theyll keep me happily from harm  So 
So I do the leg work they carry the arms  Brrrat 
Check it shorty I had over Saturday
Never act away and squirt til she oversaturate
She go hard in the dark no chains
But see Im gettin it even when the car is in park nigga
The hood is on some bullshit
So it aint weird to see em aiming at the pulpit
Fates are empty collection plate spirit in ruins
We used to a different type of communion
When guns take the place of the choir tie up the pastor
If he scared cant believe what he say bout the life after  Oh 
The stained glass is bulletproof
Sometimes a liars mouth can be full of truth
I done heard gospel from a sinner
Told me to season my pride if thats dinner
Said theres no human that walks without sin
So we should probably call the gates make sure we allowed in  Joey
