No Love Lost  Outro  Lyrics
Mic check mic check 12 12
Made a lot of mishaps lot of mistakes lot of missteps
Grown shit though is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that and real recognize that
Talk to em
Last word check it unbeatable force insurmountable object
Bull shouldve known better than counting me out Im from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed indeed something is wrong
Prepare for the future remember I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone fiendd out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on had to bring my own power so
Im having a private party that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul itll give itself a cleanse
They telling me all the pain I ever felt was selfinfringed
But I had help from friends one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path Id like to think its designed the best
Defied the odds I never aged while giving time a test
No niggas on house arrest Im on a minor rest
You trying to call me or text me dont even bother
Im trying to give mind a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured but made me miserable
My affairs together here forever yeah Im back to work
Learned in order to lose love probably gotta have it first
My lifes a crap shoot my dice are loaded aint no stopping me
Most interesting man a hard place is between a rock and me
Im torn within and my eyes are heavy
Im born again just means I died already
Means I survived already so fuck they want with me
World been against me so long misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love you gotta notice it
Gotta recognize it gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it dont hide it gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom gotta feel it worse
Or my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it you gotta at least be hated
Mama I made it if anyone know my way was hard
They prayed for my Downfall on deaf ears I was praying to God
So God I loved love till it resented me
And if its still a stranger then I love who it pretends to be
No Love Lost
No love found
They found a little bit though
I dont know where they found it out but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story
Is as you mature so will it
Just gotta find it
One
