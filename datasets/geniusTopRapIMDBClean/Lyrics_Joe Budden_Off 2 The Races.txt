And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Let her know Im here if she ever need me to be with her
As long as she know I can never be with her
She asks you why I just need you to keep it G with her
Tell her I found a happiness that I could never see with her
Three years after that break up shouldve had closure by now
Wed be best friends youda let this end wed be closer by now
But you want us upset hostile angry evil jealous bitter shit
Fuck makin your bed and lyin in it
You bought the house live with it
I came to you for a second chance you gave me your ass to kiss
Found another salad to toss how the fuck is you mad at this
Oh I forgot you not in love anymore
And Id believe it but see Im not on drugs anymore
Thats based on action words I stopped believin still I hear it though
Would you save them if you knew they became meaningless to me years ago
But if happiness is the finish line I beat you there
So Karma must be real cause since we broke up he aint treat you fair
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Remember our bad breakup I rapped about it on Downfall
But you know I dont stay down for long
Remember you met that other dude
Whos smarter and more mature with more bread
That you thought would be around for long
Remember you pulled the rug from under me left me to be alone
I threatened suicide begged was crazy about you
But that stalker dude was deranged
To the point you wished death on his name
And when we speak now you still say Im crazy without you
My my how the tables have turned
Or are they bendin just a little You resent it just a little
Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours
Its the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours
Check it in perspective I cant even call it hatin
You mad at the situation really it aint even Kaylin
We both sympathized that pain is felt and shared
To watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere
Watch a man you spent years with grew with
Come across as someone that you want nothin to do with
To sleep in a bed with what ifs instead of somethin special
How can you get over us The public wont even let you
I know to wake up with that fear is gross
Love me from far cause you scared to get close
But what are you fearin the most
If happiness is the finish line I beat you there
I always thought that when youd put the baggage down Id meet you there
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Uh lets bring it up to speed a lil bit
Now a nigga ballin you still tell me to grow some
Entertainin threesomes you dont think that its wholesome
Say that you cant trust me think Im out here trashin you
Got a lot of answers to questions I dont be askin you
I tried to be friends so I dont see a problem passin through
You welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin you
You must be misconstruin my love and its gassin you
Causin you to wear our shit out and think its fashionable
Im thinkin you should put our history in back of you
That would call for you steppin outside of yourself and bein rational
Come to friendship you question me in that capacity
How would you ever know
Its not somethin you ever asked of me
And VH1 just gave us another episode
So maybe its smart that you cant let this go
Cause love changes a thug changes
And soulmates become strangers word up
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
