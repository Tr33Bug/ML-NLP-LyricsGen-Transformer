Uhh
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to em  talk to em 
I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
Im holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay a change of scenery
But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
She told me theres a higher power and a lower power
And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower
Then I replied well arent we all
She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human


Tryin to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
Its been beside me all along not the song
I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse
Cant be depression couldnt have it this long
So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga
Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text
Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next
She said youre going through a lot
Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead
Cause not too many people know your brains a mess
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all
I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all
I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note
Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped
Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her
Couldnt explain the why to her
Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy
He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray
And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back
Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap
Joe
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Guess Im insanitys definition
Trying to step over in sanitys repetition
But I cant it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing thought it was funny
Giselles the homie Alexas twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldnt dick her at all
Im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
In your head guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
Yall Instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused
And I dont understand was this all part of a plan
I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house
Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine this is a big waste of time
Lets get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
So even though its from afar now
I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender
Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
