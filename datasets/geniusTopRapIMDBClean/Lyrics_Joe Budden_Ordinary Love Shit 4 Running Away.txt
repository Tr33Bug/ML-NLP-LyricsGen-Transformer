Ordinary Love Shit 4  Running Away  Lyrics
Tell me how long are we suppose to act like this
We wont never get on track like this
How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this
You call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this
Its funny
Got your track shoes on but what you running from
Shit I know where you going and where you coming from
Thats immaturity showing its just the baby in you
One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you
Tired of hearing how youll never trust me again
How you love me then you hate me then you love me again
One minute Im your soulmate then its fuck me again
Until you get horny enough and wan fuck me again but check it
I just wan treat you good and do better
You think Im running round tryna be the hoods Hugh Heffner
Say Im all about hoes when Im all about you
Even when Im with my hoes I tell them all about you
Say thats just one reason I keep losing you
I dont understand it that shit is confusing too
You left me Im doing me you doing you
So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu
How dare you tell me its tougher for you
Like I dont hear about them niggas you fucking with too
Id never knew you thought like that  dammit 
Who knew you was into sports like that
More prayers because they all players
You out there having a ball player ball player after ball player
I mean you with the ball players more than ball players
Hope they aint fucking you and making you they ballplayer
Come to me I just get a hard time
Why they give one to you is this what you wan do
With me you get an attitude you get all stuck up
Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up
Yeah but the part I dont respect is
You so cool with every other one of your exes
Its history between us all aint right either
Back and forth domestic all aint flights either
Be wanting you close to me supposedly
You say you over me that just comes across as a joke to me
Cause you aint got the kind of love that expires
Worst case youll get tired tell your friends Im a liar
Tried therapy when we felt it going sour
Thats fourhundred dollars every hour
For him to come and mediate referee be our interpreter
Tell me I need to lower my voice dont curse at her
Says shes only frustrated cause I keep hurtin her
Tell me despite all that he can tell that I worship her
Soon as you let your guard down I get it up again
Fixing it is too much work so I give up again
But I wan spend the rest of my life with you
Make a wife with you make it alright with you
But how are you ever suppose to think that Im right for you
When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable
Disgraceful and you want me to chase you
But its easier for me to replace you cause I see it like
If you cant deal with what we go through
I got bitches lined up I got a ego too
And to them Im everything funny Im great and Im charming
But to you Im alarming all I do is bring harm in
To you Im the cause of all your misery
Of course I disagree you going off our history
All that arguing just aint my style
Cause that anger now got us like strangers now
You tell me I should get help and Im sick in the head
You found makeup on the sheets I had a bitch in our bed
But wait I aint love her though I aint fuck her though
I could dead that bitch right now man fuck that hoe
You just think Ill get another and another hoe
Way you talk to me its like I got a whole club of hoes
But I could switch gears make em all disappear
You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there
We discussing chicks after they through
They dont matter to me but for some reason they matter to you
We keep having the same threesome
But not the kind that come as a blessing nah
You keep bringing up my last girl like she aint my past girl
Like you aint the reason she present check it
You aint gotta worry about me and her
If I wanted to be with her I would be with her
Yeah we hung together strip clubs had fun together
But thats done dont sweat her uh
You the only one I wanna do a bid with
Live with share my last name have kids with
Cant be understated anytime we ever dated
You compare me in your head to some nigga you created
Im a long way from perfect I got shit with me
Still I want you to love me unconditionally
Nineyears in I dont deserve what you giving me
Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me
Want me to see how it feels I get the trickery
Lesson learned though you my missing piece
Give another chance to your ex
You dont pick up the phone you dont answer my texts
Bitch we aint give it all that we got
Still aint empty the clip lets give it one more shot
Or we can go ahead on our own
I need you I cant do this alone
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
