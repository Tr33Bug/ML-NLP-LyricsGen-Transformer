New Joe Budden
One and two was for yall
This ones for me
Check this  talk to em 
I finally found a passion I lacked before
Cant believe I didnt catch ya under the act before
I mean I voiced my complaints that went ignored
A few things you felt that you was too attractive for
Cause eerything out your mouth said that you aint wanna hurt
Love the lifestyle we lived but you aint wanna work
So Id sit you down and say its getting outta hand
While you shoot down eery idea busy worried about a brand
When ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife
How you was married requesting dick pics from Lyfe
Though it all seemed shady maybe I was crazy
I ignored my gut feelin nah not my baby
Accusing me but pretending yourself
I couldnt catch it too busy defending myself
Or was I wrong not seeing a life without you
Or taking eerything that you said at face value
You packed up and left dude I was so glad
Shouldve questioned how you easily became a nomad
If I could do it all again it wouldntve happened so fast
And it burns with every line jotted in this notepad
Cause at first you resembled my twin
Fast forward you gave me identical twins
But then you lost it honestly that murked my soul
Cause though we wadnt tryna have one we got off the birth control
And we was right back at it fucking like addicts
While you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage
You never got embarrassed interrogating me but that was just Yaris
Yeah we beef and I dragged you off the bed
I swear to this day I reenact it in my head
So I hemmed you up wasnt what I aimed to do
I aint attack you bitch I was restraining you
But you was wifey though I understand that its not a game
Can you imagine my surprise when the cops came
Handcuffed me you pressed charges
But I made bail its just heartless
You cant smash my laptop on the wall
And then think I wasnt gonna react scratch that
I mean you cant call my mom like can I crash at your spot whattup
When Im her son and you just locked me up
But wait this is when it really gets deep
Judge says she get control of the house for a week
Filed a restraining order so she couldnt come near me
The fuck else I do but go right back to Tahiry
Im sleeping on her couch not discussing shit
Staring at the fattest ass not fuckin it
I guess despite everything that she showed me
It felt good to be around a broad that really knows me
I missed all our arguin and yappin
Percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin
Cant believe that it happened  why 
I lost my unborn daughter when we fought
Im thinking I killed Aspen
And thats when I thought that wed be dead awhile
But we decided to reconcile
So hungover from love and what not
How could you not expect us to take another shot
But during all this time we dont live together
Stupid me thought youd go get your shit together
You know get a job or if actings your career
Seems youve pursued the shit for a year from right here
And it appears along with all the yelling and the screaming
We both at the table but my side is leaning
But rather than end it we tried to mend it
Fuck bein a couple lets work on a friendship
But then it got weird I was stunned from that
You took it to a place where there was no coming back
Off my last break up I was able to stomach that
Two weeks removed and you fuckin with a running back
Life is in shambles disguised as a damsel
Lies are a handful
Bouncing off of different guys lookin scrambled
Despised how it was handled
But when you aint got a dime why not decide to gamble
Said youd be in LA doing business
Im thinking thats great I cant fault her
Said youd be with Jennifer the whole time
But you probly didnt think that I would call her
She said she aint seen you since you landed
And for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker
And all I could do is laugh at myself
As I thought why is old girl sucking off Derrick Ward for
Said we was makin it right but you couldnt
Was on the phone I said Skype but you wouldnt
The puzzle starts coming together and its brutal
Wont Skype Gmail chat wont Oovoo
The whole time Im noticing you actin unusual
And I cant figure out who the fuck you being true to  nah 
Said the WiFi was down in the tele
But you aint say you was at hotel his house
Lookin like a groupie
Or maybe I misunderstood when you said yall two was makin a movie
Looking at the shit pile I stepped in again
And to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again Not again
I been through the world so I suck it up
Its less about the lie more about the coverup
So you busted but you addin to the friction
Cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction
So you talkin to me real disparaging
So what attitude coming off arrogant
If I wanted a trophy wife then you could be
But all it look like is that you renting out pussy
Less about you nah you aint the one
You grown you got choices Im worried bout your son
Thats what got me up being an insomniac
Little nigga cant control how his mommy act
As for me Im tryin flush you out my system
So I counter by filming all my sexual encounters
Mentally not there while Im screwing
And I only keep going cause thats what your doing
Im tryna see hows it done hows it possible
Enough to put a weak nigga in a hospital
Starin at one ex talking about another
But this one would kill if it meant I wouldnt suffer
But she taking little shots Im getting ridiculed
Cause all she complained about I went and did with you
Said she knew it wouldnt last when I lived with you
Shes not your type she aint got the right hips for you
So you try and take somein for pain it dont work
You still feel it all the Novocaine dont work
Nope so we good I dont let it get me down
Not a pussy that good nor a titty that round
For anything to work yall trust is a must
And I learned gotta let a mutt be with a mutt
So I dead that bitch and though the shits been over
Some situations dont end without closure
