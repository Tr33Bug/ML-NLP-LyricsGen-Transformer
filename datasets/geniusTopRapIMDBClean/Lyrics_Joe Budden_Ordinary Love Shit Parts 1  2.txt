Ordinary Love Shit  Parts 1  2  Lyrics
My path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle
Born to be a leader but a tough act to follow
Bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash
So if I cant afford the Waldorf I can afford to fall off
Stories over greatness no stopping my zone
Im bumping Romans Revenge but Im plotting my own
Like a prophecy in case niggas havent learned not to bother me
Fore you send your shots just check my return policy
Could do without the leeches shoes without the creases
Miami Heat hater but I do the South Beaches
For any drama I be calling up monsters
I aint Gilbert I never met a Wall I cant conquer
Ruger aimed if Im who you try and belittle
I learned its hard to get justice when you try and be civil
Whatever the future holds I can live with the day
Some niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away
And thats the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized
Simplified check what I exemplify
Bitch nigga heres something for you to generalize
Estate out by Tenafly pool houses winterized
Play in that water you bound to get your feet wet
Only rapper with nuttin to hide me and GDep
My shorty might disagree with that sentiment
If I keep something from you I promise its all innocent
Bitches gon get you with that fake out beat
I wont let them Media Takeout me a made nigga
Gotta know when dealing with me you gon put up with a lot of hate
Before you say you love me how much of it can you tolerate
You cant talk about marriage and giving birth
If you hit the dirt anytime you think I lift a skirt
It grows tiresome every time you get berserk
Plus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt  what 
Without a care I just chuck deuces
My skinll turn numb and youll be stuck with what your truth is
Then youll feel a way thinking I should have resisted
Then youll start to see a side of me you never knew existed
Cause you never seen me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts
But wait its to the point I gotta ask myself
Why the fuck is it so easy to detach myself
Maybe it aint you just something I lack myself
But if these wounds are self inflicted I can patch myself
Now listen I could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you
If your ass was that perfect they would be with you
I dont care if you dimed out
Youll say youre the best Ill ever have and Ill say Im willing to find out
Wait Im thinking bout our bond and what happened to it
If you aint lifting the burden you probably adding to it
She say my logics wild and its sick to her
She say Im all for self and dont consider her
She feel like she dont have a voice in this relationship
Im thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it
Certain shit I wouldnt stand for
Im giving her my all but she demands more
I wish she would understand more
Certain shit you couldnt plan for
Im guessing if I love you and youre worth it
I should take some time out and figure if you deserve this
But you just think that Im full of it
We both come from backgrounds of bullshit
Im fortunate that aint what you see in me
Ill stop lying to you once you start believing me
But Im always who you wanna bring the questions to
Its less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you
Its totally different the way our minds are made up
To me flirtings natural to her its cause for break up
To me its human nature she disagree with the logic
Confusing being monogamous with being robotic
I talk to other girls I interact with em
You shouldnt take that as tryna get in the sack with em
Just know how I act with you is how I act alone
I signed up for a girl not a chaperon
Besides that planll backfire and Ill dishonor her
She dont take my word and now I feel Im being monitored
And I want you to be the one that I endured the longest
Accept me at my weakest support me at my strongest
Bring something to the table though earn ya keep
Then Ill triple it and all I ask in return is peace
Aint with the arguing shit all the time
You see Im honest to a fault but is it yours or mine
I put you through some things where you could have bolted
You want honesty or rather shit be sugar coated
Ill put you on a list of people screaming fuck me too
Do you want a pretty lie or the ugly truth
Truth is you got some things that you gotta learn too
When everything that concerns me dont concern you
Truth is you gotta a couple tainted views
And you bring up my ex as if I couldnt do the same with you
Truth is you want me the dude that kept it realer
Truth is youre too emotional and need a better filter
No third party will ruin our plan
Id hate for you to be the girl whos too consumed with her man
So I want you to have your own plans
You to have you own ends you to have your own life
You to have your own friends and Ill be right beside you
I can tell that you pride full
Cause you dont bring up problems that you got with me till I do
You say that Im out a lot and that I aint here enough
You take care of me and Ill take care of us
Id love to put a child in you and live lavish
But my baby momma scarred me let me tell you bout my baggage
We could have a son and break up and be done
And now Ill never see him again
As you take him and run
You gon tell him that hes fatherless
Tell him that Im cowardly
Youll have some resentment so youll start acting childishly
Youll rape me in court cause of course youll have it out for me
To you it may sound absurd but for me its a reality
Still at times where it seems like youre not proud of me
Though Im showing you the best man I know how to be
But you keep saying show me more
Youd appreciate me better had you known me before
Youve never been cheated on
Had another chick in your house in your bed
You you aint seen the worst time
Hit you with that old move
Take you to a flick that Ive already seen with another broad
But pretend like its my first time
And nah you dont know how that sound
On the phone with you while she quiet in the background
Bunch of shit that I aint in a hurry to do
So before you beef know that he got buried for you
I dont tell you that for points nah you can keep the brownies
I tell you so that you know I was mature when you found me
Tell you so you know that little boy shit that I get annoyed with
You should keep it coy with cause all that is is stress for me
Im not ya ex baby girl you not a catch for me
I mean respectfully certain shit Im not a glutton for
For every bad bitch theres a nigga tired of fucking her
But you could be my wife forever
Lets grow old live life together
Vacay catch flights take pictures
Everything that my last broad always wanted but got a beef with me when she asked for it
