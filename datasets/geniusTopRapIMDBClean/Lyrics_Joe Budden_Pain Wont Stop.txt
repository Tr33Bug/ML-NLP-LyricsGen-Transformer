Oh the pain wont stop  the pain dont stop 
Almost like its got a hold on me  on me 
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain wont stop
Like my demons got control of me
Wont take me alive
I guess someones gonna see the grave
And it wont be me and it cant be me
And it wont be me I wont let it be me
And it wont be me and it cant be me
And it wont be me I wont let it be me
Im starin at the pain in the mirror  or is it a facsimile
Question hurts more than the fact that it resembles me
Thought I left em all in the past I mean essentially
So when we side by side I just act like its all a memory
And then I got a whole market of fans
With no clue what I speak of but some of yall understand
If you knew about my woes you wouldnt target the man
And if you did itd be about more than a marketing plan
I got a heart thats ice cold Ive been tryin to melt
Its talent honest to yall all while lyin to myself
Seem like I do the most damage all when tryin to help
And no one asked for it I decided myself
You think the road a nigga traveled
Has been long enough for yall to see the winner in him
Dont know if Im fightin my demons or goin to dinner with em
I sit across from that table just lookin brave and tough
But its only right they get the check figured that I paid enough
Oh the pain wont stop  the pain dont stop 
Almost like its got a hold on me  on me 
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain wont stop
Like my demons got control of me
Wont take me alive
I guess someones gonna see the grave
Fans say they waitin on a break up dont want me at the altar
But how would their lives alter I figure how could they fault ya
Followed me in this business
You witnessed me go through torture
With my exes so a death wish I wouldnt want anymore
Begs the question what do niggas really want in me
Couldnt be as simple as misery lovin company
Cant be as clich as bein a gift and a curse
But how could you ever claim
To love someone then wish him the worst
It appears my happiness has some people resentin me
Should I appreciate love that come with contingencies
Yall get mad whenever someone else mentions me
Ironic got a ex thats showin similar tendencies
Spite stems from hate I try to never be near it
Do you only want the best for Joe when we could share it
That can become obsessive like you wouldnt believe
Dont take my word just look at what happened to Steve
It got Raqi lookin rocky had em by me
And I watched em both deteriorate was ugly
If you trust me then you wouldnt want to share their fate
And so it seems the people Id jump in the casket for
Their minds playin tricks I wish they knew they mattered more
Would they ask for more or would that will subside
Poured my heart out all these years Im shocked Im still alive
Tell him like I told Stack it gets no realer
You love somethin too much guarantee itll kill ya for real
Oh the pain wont stop  the pain dont stop 
Almost like its got a hold on me  on me 
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain wont stop
Like my demons got control of me
Wont take me alive
I guess someones gonna see the grave
I crashed a million times still Im without a dent
They come to me to air it out but Im without a vent
I have nightmares about the shit I thought I said
Cried enough that Posturepedic is a waterbed
Look at you like a nobody it aint much I could ask of you
And Id give you a hand but what the fuck would you attach it to
Finish one chore God will throw you some more shit
Its not enough Im fightin mine still I battle your shit
Oh the pain wont stop  the pain dont stop 
Almost like its got a hold on me  on me 
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain wont stop
Like my demons got control of me
Wont take me alive
I guess someones gonna see the grave
And it wont be me and it cant be me
And it wont be me I wont let it be me
And it wont be me and it cant be me
And it wont be me I wont let it be me
