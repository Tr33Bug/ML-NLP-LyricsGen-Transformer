Mic mic mic
Yeah we good now
Turn the vocals down a little bit just a little bit
I want it loud
Heres my moment of clarity
Ive been misleadin you all givin you half of me
Ive been blazin a trail and leavin casualties
Ive diagnosed myself I think its apathy
So lettin go became easy grabbin ahold thats the hardest
I know our expiration date soon as we start it
You come around and you feel safe while youre a target
You feelin like I let you inside while Im guarded
Its genius when arrogance seems like its modest
Look past the insanity glance at the logic
Appears optional all of it is stipulated
Watch and learn how emotions get manipulated
Now you in dire need of help
You the victim made to think you did it to yourself
Speakin of rest in peace Sandra Bland
Me Im believin everything that wasnt on that cam
But back to you beauty let me address our lil movement
You in therapy but I dont see the improvement
Oh whatevers been made now days is ruined
So every few months I ponder what the fuck are we doin
Let me watch my words again
You easily got one of the best pussies that Ive ever been inserted in
You real kind real sweet real nurturin
Yet every time we link back up you just get hurt again
You put all men in a box I aint one of em
Funny how you got all the answers and none of em
You only dated three men so Im scared of you
Cause with no point of reference what the fuck are you comparin to
You good one minute psycho the next
No longer lettin it ride too much Jekyll and Hyde
Then you subtweet for weeks busy settin your pride
Im grown dont really need that sort of mess in my life
But wait you of age you old too
I control my emotions yours control you
You bright enough to know when you get impulsive
For me thats repulsive how do you not know this
And then we go our separate ways
Just to link back on better days
Though I know its short term and you never stay
You always a sucker for that text that say
Yo what up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
Then you wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
Youre watchin how I perform and its breakin your heart
You home alone backtrackin replayin the start
You realize this whole script youve been playin a mark
That aint stop you from takin a part
I guess were both just playin our parts
Yeah and so the pussy aint enough now
They keep thinkin it should be enough how
Fuck sex baby later for that
This mind game Im playin is a greater climax
Not a franchise player I cant pay you the max
I cant say it to you so I just say it in raps
I got a rep that I made all by myself
One I hate all by myself
That comes from decisions created all by myself
I cant shake it all by myself
See I grew up in the spotlight
Where your every move is eyed
The truth becomes lies when youre that scrutinized
No mentorship I was unsupervised
Had to learn on my own every rule to survive
Still I manned up in caught those wrongs
Go ahead and judge Joe I got my court clothes on
Yall see the front behind the scenes more goes on
Check my back catalog its in all those songs forreal
So I can be at peace forever
I left the puzzle right there nigga piece it together
But back to you beauty small waist fat booty
Its cool for the moment but dont permanently move me
They come through tossin me ass like its their duty
But who I was aint who I am I say it truly
Here I am shootin em down without the Uzi
Unlike them niggas you know dont try and group me
Watched myself on TV was unruly
How the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie
They say you are what you attract
Here I am screamin fuck all that
Then Im forced to believe I attract and adore
Bunch of unstable broads with character flaws
With plenty luggage I greet em with their bags at the door
If thats true then its some shit Id rather ignore
Cause check it whatever helps you get by
So when they hit me I always reply


They always be like whats up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
Then you wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
Youre watchin how I perform and its breakin your heart
You home alone backtrackin replayin the start
Realize this whole script youve been playin a mark
But that aint stop you from takin a part
I guess were both just playin our parts
Just where Im at lately
Look at the monster this industry done made me
Shit I loved the most I let it jade me
Cryin out for help somebody save me
But I cant let em know all that
They take it as weakness when you show all that
So I just live in my mind til this hoe call back
Every time Im knocked down you see Joe crawl back forreal
Nowadays they all the same
Enhanced body parts smaller brains
They dont get a hi in fact
Mums the word baby girl its now quiet for that forreal
If you got nothin to offer
Sorry Mrs Jackson gotta off ya
But as soon as you leave em alone
Its when they send that same text to the phone
They always be like whats up Are you good
Hit me up whenever you in the hood
Then we fuck and its fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
Im waitin for you to talk but you wont
You wait for me to react but I dont
Then you go and I watch
We know how this movie go but we watch
Cause we just playin our parts
I guess were both just playin our parts
I play mine well
Better than you
And it go baby baby
