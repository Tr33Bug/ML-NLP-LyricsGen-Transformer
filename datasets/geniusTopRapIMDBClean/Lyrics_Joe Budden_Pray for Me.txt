Look I woke up without a heart beat
But I remember we was just in the car deep
Was at a light and got approached by a car thief
He pulled out but didnt ask for no car keys
A loud noise without a voice but Im tryna scream out shit is not fair
I cant tell you where Im at or how I got here
Surrounded by all white maybe its just cloudy
Escorted by two men who knew everything about me
Both of them so strong kept saying hold on
Feel like my souls gone naked no clothes on
I know this cant be my fate
I scream Wait as they drop me in front of a gate
They left no trace I can see my every breath
Like a cold day stood before a man with no face
He said to me  Please dont make this any harder 
Who the fuck is you  My child Im your father 
I only got one dad  Is that a fact to you
He left you when you was young I brought him back to you
Youre real close to heaven few get to step in
Now tell me what youve done to deserve to be let in 
Look Im far from a Christian not big on religion
But aint done too much wrong my entire time living
Never killed never tried too though I been lied to
Was once suicidal never read the Bible
I always been a care taker tried to nurse people
At times it back fired hurt people hurt people
Plus I never use your name in vain
But you should know everything Im being asked to explain
I know you stole from your mothers purse  You cant count that
That was way back when  Its still a sin  But I was ten
You robbed people stole  Yeah and you made me see jail
But I also seen you lay your hands on a female
Sold drugs to parents none of that was needed
Abandoned your child on every girl you cheated
Done wrong to people that only want the best for you
Any time you thought you were alone I was next to you 
When it came to baby moms God you gave me the worse one
But that was your second child Joe you shouldnt have killed the first one 
I aint have a job aint have a pot to piss in
Look I gave you a gift and you made the wrong decision
Held onto resentments even in doing business
I lead by example I teach forgiveness
Your entry can not be guaranteed
Not when you live with anger envy greed
Pride sloth lust even gluttony
Everything you shouldnt if you woulda joined my covenant 
Look Im only human I aint perfect
That I understand when I take you out a jam
You dont even think to worship
And when you do you never talk about what you can do for me
Its what I can do for you
I blessed you with health family and wealth
With all the blessings you received you still always want help 
Yeah theres been times in my life I needed help to make money
But why everything I love you manage to take from me
Yet you stand there an question a nigga that tries hard
And finds a way when you keep dealing them fucked up cards
You make mistakes like me far as I can see
I think its a mockery whenever rich niggas win the lottery
Gave us Bush twice God I hate to be rude
But you let skinny niggas starve give obese niggas food
The nerve of you telling me I dont deserve to stay here
When you gave us drugs and guns you put AIDS here
Take a look at you your actions are cold hearted
The harsh shit is you bring babies in the world retarded
I know most my actions put me in a cell
But how you mad at me when you put me into hell
See my child you need gratitude maybe just a sample
I never give a person anything they cant handle
Dont tell me about everything you had to go through
Theres reasons for my actions even if I never showed you
Kept trying with you all you did was hurt me
Still gave you chances to prove that you was worthy
And so I sat with you on a train
I asked you for change you kept calling me names
Prolly didnt notice I was the store clerk
You put the gun to me get money for more work
My child I know you have it in you to indeed stop
This is not your final calling just a brief stop
Hope you heed my words and understandSo when I send you back you should be a better man
Look at life different the next time we see each other
Therell be no need for talk whenever we meet each other
