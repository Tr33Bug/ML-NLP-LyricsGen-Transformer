Pump It Up  Remix  Lyrics
Gimme that beat fool its a full time jack move
Dont worry skano ill give it back soon
Just having a little fun was sup my nigga
S dot collection
Black album coming soon
Just gonna vent a little bit
Have a little fun with it
Yes
Aint nobody dumpin on Hov
You aint in sanitation or sanitarium
What are you crazy JayZll bury em
Ill get you drug out the club they have to carry em
Go head bug out Ill raid niggas scurry
Worry Im not the Mike Jordan of the mic recording
Its Hovi baby you Kobe maybe Tracy McGrady
Matter fact you a Harold Miner JR Rider
Washed up on marijuana
Even worse you a Pervis Ellis
You worthless fella
You aint no athlete you Shawn Bradley
And I aint talkin to nobody in particular
My flows just vehicular homicide when Im kickin up DUST
Anybody in my path Is a car crash waiting to happen nigga what
I got my foot on the throat
On the pulse of this rap game and I aint letting up YUP
Yeah whos the nicest life or lifeless on these mic devices
And I dont write this I just mic this
I will it to happen
One take Hov Im real at this rapping
My new name is just the facts
While the rest of yall just adjust the facts
Put words together just to match
I say what I feel yall adjust to that
I do the opposite of yall so I just attract
The realer audience usually unjustly black
Know my flow and the shit they go through just match
Like the sound of my voice and a choice Just track
I just tackle the subject the flack of the public
Nothing I know real niggas happen to love it
If you dont like it then look in the mirror
Most likely you aint live it so you dont get it
You aint did it so you cant vision it
The picture Im painting aint vivid
The language Im spitting is so foreign to ya
See what starvingll do to ya
Growin up hard in a little apartmentll do to ya
Im just talkin to ya
Gimme that beat fool
Its a full time jack move
Sorry Jay Webb said take it back dude
Ha
Nitti too he played a part in that
Listen Im just having some fun
No
Part in the future
Sing the track now
Its been a good week Hova
You can give it back now
All these rappers is cooking crack and
Took the realness out the game its time to put it back in
The fans finally got it understood they just yappin
While Joeys in the hood like Madden
Whoa
Success is wrapped up
Checks just rack up
Everybodys a killer but the deaths dont add up
Everybodys a hustler but the money aint coming in
Yall is it just my math sucks Nah
In time Ima supersucceed their wealth
Like everybodys so scared to just be they self
Add the bass in your voice get found like the cool
So we could sound like loon or pound like boom
Dont end up a dead man for the cheddar
Only way to play Joeys Def Jam Vendetta for real
On your Pro Tools lose and dont be shocked
Open the booth door we be like old school move it
I aint Kobe or Tracy JayZ JB merk
Joey the future Im more like Dirk
Anybody buyin respect me
Try and wet me
Yall dudes will never make it
Yall a Tyus Edney
Im a standout like Yao Ming Im whats sparking now
Like fall back Shaq Im starting now
Boys poppin it toys poppin spit
Im not from round these parts Im Stojakovic
Never hear your man say Im the Jordan of rappin
Hes gettin fatigued early and his scoring is lackin
Legacy is gettin ruined and you dont want that
So pretty much learn from him dont come back
And rap is gettin wack time for Gs to step in
Cause you are not that hot dont believe the yes men
Aint about whos better than uh its so evident
They hard to be real with no evidence
And I aint comin at Jay cause hes the greatest breathing
But he already paved the way Im just layin my cement
Not the same way I was dude Im done drivin now
Im in your 745 plus 2
Dont have your label call mine for no extracurricular
Rappers is all girls extra particular
Seen many men with the jake
Next time yall listen to Many Men Ill make sure you relate
Only Jay coulda came Just Blazed it like me
Everybody else chills Just Blaze can agree
Packin a MAC in the back of the Acura no
Clappin the gat you be wrapped in the caddy but naw
What you want punk double clip pump
Ride by slump forth cocked playa on top
Hater warm rock with his teeth toes wrapped
With the brand new savior of east coast rap
Dont worry yall  Ill bring the east coast back
Nah par this aint a movie but meet Joe Black
Try to relate to it I just speak those facts
If you was in the front now your seat goes back
What the deallin
Like New York been soft since Bin Laden came thru and crushed the buildings
Trying to restore the feeling just speaking to ya
Im just speaking through ya
