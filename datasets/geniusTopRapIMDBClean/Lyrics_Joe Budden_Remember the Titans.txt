Uh
Uh
Yeah
J Cardim 
Yeah
Yeah
These niggas losing their minds you find that theres no reward
They say they already home its really clear they abroad
They sound like they boxed in its not just where they record
Theres a cost to be a boss they cant clearly afford
Swear to the Lord theres guns like a audience
You put on a show my 40 clearly applauds
Sitting fifth row I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye but screaming Wheres my award
Balling out of control never won an ESPY
Bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit SP
Flow outta this world Im coming for my Moon Man
You niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
No glitter glean handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you Street Fam Twitter team
Like you could fuck with me oh did it seem
Dr King and Def Jam aint the only ones with a dream
Im a grownass man this kid a teen
Youre a spoof of me like if hip hop did a Scream
Audi coupe looking good so I went and copped it
Got that TT popping like a trending topic
My rides matte black my pride is that jacked
It might get ya dog shot even a cat smacked
Anyway though styles dont apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldnt be more fly than me
Shorty say Right after the suck fuck poof
You hit it on the head girl duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break em off and leave it you seen my fucked up tooth
Its fuck a bitch its more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no like when niggas ask you to marry them
Theres no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral Fab Im just here to bury them
Reporting live from the Beacon booth tired from the beating
Had foreplay all day prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
With my vocal bicoastal speeding til the rides totaled
Mr WiFi out a franchise go to magic standby locals
Watch the track bust once I show my dick size to the ProTools
I teach you how to have models screaming Get behind me
Epills and Maybachs aint gon matter if your tip is tiny
Never mind me we could get kneedeep in the beef
Seek me with the heat but youll need more to keep me on a leash
Heres a CC for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet
Give a few hammers a few semis and a few snubs
To a few Crips couple vampires and true Bloods
Gambling in casinos have a honey handing me my cnotes
To her Im a modernday Gambino Im careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
Thatd be the last mistake you ever made
Me I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when Im shooting at fags
Make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
But everybodys run stops ask Brandon Jacobs
What yall call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blat at me thatd equal more casualties
Abort the strategy or get attacked with that Duracell
They put in your back now thats assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
Theres beams on every burner these lasers a petition wouldnt help
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss
Where Im from better be careful where you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
In my town Ben Affleck wouldnt try that shit
And if he did hed get turned around burnt down
Tell the new jacks itll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown
Acid out the baggie this is more than dope flawless flow
Fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
Strapping up the corner cold critical
Unquestioned my opponents know
I shoot like Kapono watch me own the show
Comatose toasted getting money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats mansion homes and hoes
I deserve em both overdose
Time to earn my votes watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a meter this electric chair danger
Yeah I see ya now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah
Models by the pair swear bottles private Lear steer
Style thats outta here rare thousands by the chair square
Sleep with me you came here war with me is scary
Get beat silly trying to lamp here better bring your fury heat
I got a drop damp here niggas try me barely
No one breathes I need an ants ear pressures necessary
Got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
Bury em in abundance and starve their families stomachs
Paper come in my thumbage brand new fifties and hundreds
On point just like the drum is Im warning them baby mothers
Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while Im rolling up then smoke after
Catch you at your show snatch ya empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene magnum Mo splasher four packer
Southside nigga spitting coke at ya
Nickel This is for the fronters and the naysayers
Im about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say Im out of my league on this one so when I get done
I want you to cut your fuckin ears off and Twitpic em
Lord I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon be around here bout long as Justin Biebers virginity
This is Jesus identity mixed with weed Hennessy Kennedy King
Mixed with a kill or be killed killer regime illest you seen switch
Yall write all that hard shit then you fall right off its horrible
My oracle is all I offer so before I borrow your
Wont be here tomorrow flow sorry I will probly
Adis my body wit somebody toast this shit just practice
Sickest rapping Baptist kill your pastor
Steal your Chapstick after that make you kiss a cactus
Then take your ho make the ho give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone that wasnt the whole entourage on HBO
Then after that I tell her I cant do much with you shawty
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire Buffie the Body
Dont call us if the bitches aint flawless
If they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin braless
The drunk me can box like a sober you
The sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth
We beef like being deep and dumping Ks
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist
Yall get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My feng shui is a pump in the desert
Youll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
Niggas snitching its a shame we call em male tattlers
Fiends touching they noses more than URL battlers
Its hard to spit saliva when you spit fire so Ill just
Pour sugar in your gas tank put a banana in your tailpipe
Ah ha so the car can fit the driver
