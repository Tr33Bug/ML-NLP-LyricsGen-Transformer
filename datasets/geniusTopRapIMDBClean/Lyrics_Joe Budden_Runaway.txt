I said all that Ill say so I stand with no apologies
Ive popped all that I popped wasnt too recently that it got to me
Those of yall that love Joe gotta admit the shit was a lot to see
Today I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty
I lost weight lost faith I got caught up in that vacuum
My stomach turned and my eyes burned and I became best friends with the bathroom
Today it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush
Face pokered over the toilet all you hear is a royal flush
Was under the control though they warned me about addiction
Mine manifested again in the form of a prescription
And its funny what the effects of that little pillll do
Funny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you
But its my life guess Im stuck in it
Sometimes I wanna just be normal like them other kids
The demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
But Ill runaway from it all if God deems that Ive had enough of it
They say dont get lost follow the leader
And dont do that be a believer
When the sun goes down you better hide
Its a dangerous world better stay inside and
Run along run along
Its a long long way home from here
Run along run along
Its a long long way home from here yeah
Uh it go look
How come they can roll God tell me how come they can smoke they can drink
They get to do whatever they want and it dont interrupt the way they think
They all get to be regular why is it only me this odd
Me who cant even stand up straight me who cant even keep a job
Maybe Im asking for too much a tiny piece of normalcy
Or an answer to any one of my fucking prayers thats asking whats wrong with me
Maybe Im tired of being unique tired of being that outcast
Im tired of me being the only one so tired of you all not knowing about that
Im tired of it all want me to fall a spectacle for the crowd to see
Or being the only one with faith Im tired of everybody doubting me
Im tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly
Aches wish I could take my parents genes the fuck up out of me
Tired of wanting to run somewhere tired of having to bare it all
Tired of you fucks constantly taking from me and Im willing to share it all
Tired of being objective Im tired of having to hear it all
But being alone is the only way I know to never be near it all
They say dont get lost follow the leader
And dont do that be a believer
When the sun goes down you better hide
Its a dangerous world better stay inside and
Run along run along
Its a long long way home from here
Run along run along
Its a long long way home from here yeah
