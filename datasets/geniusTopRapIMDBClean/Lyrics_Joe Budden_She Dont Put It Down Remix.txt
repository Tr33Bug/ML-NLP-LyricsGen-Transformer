She Dont Put It Down  Remix  Lyrics
Ugh shorty old news though
Yesterdays paper
Check this
Baby like it raw I dont even waste a Magnum on her
Clean up amazing I appreciate the fashion on her
Badder than a motherfuck aint too many passin on her
Only right I pick her up the way she got a wagon on her
When Im on that road dont forget the bops when Im in town
Not unless its for the threesome if its poppin shell be down
Know these other jokers be starin but it stop when Im around
Just to get inside them jeans she be hoppin up and down
Let the world know that she ride
They think that eventually well break up
And I love it when we argue cause eventually we make up
I mean we fight and fuck we fuck and fight
We fuck some more every fuckin night
Shape great taste great body softer than Cashmere
Anytime her cheques drop she knows she can crash here
Them other broads is other broads all of them is last year
Cant get mad Im just stating facts here word
She dont put it downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fuckin with ya
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Never trippin off the past I would rather never mind em
Cause only fools trip over somethin that be behind em
And yesterday is history tomorrows a mystery
She here at the present time it feel like a gift when she
Put it down down all the way down
You could get down but can you stay down
Shout out to the ladies with your down asses
That keep a tight circle and them round asses  Nice 
At the crib its just us nigga
Fuck me so good make me not trust niggas
Thats my shit Im overprotected
You want that good shit You know where your connect live
Told my ex Dont be bitter be better
I replace her before I regret her
Texts now and then that question how I been
The hook sound like a message I would send
She dont put it downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fuckin with ya
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
A down girl I remember when
I used to bag up in the basement with her
With the attraction of a Michael Jackson swag
But in this case a thriller
And she was a wolf not in sheeps clothing
But a gray chinchilla
Even though I found another assassin
It can never be your replacement killer
When I got up in the goods kinda good to me
But I know that she dont put it down like you
Cut from the bottom when you up
When you pop on top cause nobody around like you
Pulling back to me and Im all up in it fully
When Im holding a palm full of hair
Finna lay you on your back missionary position
And give it to you good with your Louboutins in the air
Got a bad new bitch but she dont be trippin
Dont cross with them flaws
But she dont be doing the way you be doing it
When you be working them walls
Im bumpin some Tank and Im plankin
Im fuckin her good but then you go frontin
Steady cuttin with bitches all on me
Cause Im with Joe Budden but what ho wasnt
Ill put you in the category of somebody
That give it to me good but will work a nigga nerves
Individual and Im never particular
But Ill never be with her so I kick her to the curb
I got a new woman though
I be building her up to be better than you
She fine but dont know how to throw it back
So she can never be you
I done put another in your space
Damn after you its been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sittin on the case
She gon hate but she know
She dont put it downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fuckin with ya
She dont put it down like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
