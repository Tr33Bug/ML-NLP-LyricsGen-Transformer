She aint got a leg to stand on
Dont even trip
I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldnt even get a cab ride
She dont do the blogs but if she did shed be on mad sites
Ass so mean that Im always on her bad side
Uh now she dont ever stress me bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers since mines hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me why Im always tryna wear her out
She dont ride like you no she dont taste like that
Not with a waist like that do I let her go to waste like that
She a mix between Kama Sutra yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh and Im telling yall straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not madeup
She kill em in Levis see why It aint even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare They cant
I done put another in your space
Damn after you its been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon hate but she know
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fucking with ya
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch I miss you like a deadline
And the girl Im with is just the girl Im with
I mean its working out so were staying fit
But you know love is nothing ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss Or our last kiss
I used to go dummy in that pussy crash test
You be fuckin that nigga like you was fucking me
Ha fuck that nigga He cant fuck with me
Im Tunechi bitch and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night Id still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut I used to shred her Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know you still for me
Thats why we still fuckin
Cause she dont put it down like you


I done put another in your space
Damn after you its been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon hate but she know
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fucking with ya
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Love being around mine no downtime
Still nothing else even matters
Cant even walk slow through that mall
Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like Im sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat yet that ass keep getting fatter
How Im sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one Id rather cum on
I done put another in your space
Damn after you its been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon hate but she know
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Aint nobody fucking with ya
She dont put it down like you downdown like you
Downdown like you downdown like you
She dont put it down like you
