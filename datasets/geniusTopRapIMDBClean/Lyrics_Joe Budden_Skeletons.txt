I got some skeletons locked in the closet  Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it  Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
I look over my shoulder not knowing where its comin from
But knowing that its coming I was bugging as a youngin
Now Im runnin from something thatll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven I hope not
Cause most of mine were hunger driven nothing in my mothers kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin
So the wellscrewed kid ended up with more than a couple missin
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin
I love kids but now Im selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and I dont give a fuck is my plan
Youll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I aint find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause aint no way in hell this aint Joell thats brave enough to tell you everything
I got some skeletons locked in the closet  Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet  Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it  Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
Fuck all that rappin Ima let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka Ima take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yo thanks a lot Im a bottledrinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Aint nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
Thats when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked Is youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real bro


I got some skeletons locked in the closet  Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet  Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it  Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
I thought I had it all locked away til forever
But no memories fade away they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me
Uh
See the problem is I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really theres no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed Im much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 247 dog thats my department
Inter city blues cruise and Im blasting that Marvin
Skeletons aint in my closet thats my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
Its all bleak to me tell my Pop I aint bothered
When he dont speak to me I love you but its weak to me
On one hand life is short and theres no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog Im kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam judge but you dont understand
Me against the world I plan on winning know Im undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here just take care of half the rent
I got some skeletons locked in the closet  Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet  Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it  Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
