Yeah yeah
Look it was around 99 baby comin while I was at rock bottom
Ironic shit I was listenin to Rock Bottom
Pockets rabbit ears no paper lot of cotton
Had some charges stemmin from me and my squad robbin
Had to leave the hood shit stayin not an option
I bumped your shit forever felt we had a lot in common
A rapper expressin wit who spoke in depressive stints
All that introspectiveness I couldnt measure what it did
Listen Im writin to you now cause we dont get to talk much
Cept for in the stu when we be passin through the halls and such
I wonder if you catch me stare at you in awe much
And we be busy workin so I never share my thoughts much
Remember signin four niggas with an attitude
Well maybe well get your star power and his magnitude
All I thought was it was bout to be on
But I never guessed that I was bout to be wrong
We encountered some things maybe we shouldve figured out all along
Who the fuck was I to be too vocal in my doubt for some songs
Even I cant be that dumb to step over the threshold
And be the guy who says no to so many records sold
Whole career I never bit my tongue I let it go
Too many times bein the rebel aint end in whats best for Joe
That second album came and added truth to the slander
But we learned whats good for the goose aint good for the gander
Guess Im askin for advice right now
Experience and leadership to help suffice right now
I guess Im askin How would you do it
Before I do somethin too stupid
Before my group lose it just to get our views lucid
Every other day these niggas want a new exclusive
Should I be in the mix more Maybe Im too secluded
Do you think youd be as famous now
If you had to put out My Name Is now
The way the game is now awful lyrics shit is shameless now
Just tell me how youd maneuver if you came in now
Its just thoughts everything is crisscrossed
Gotta be cool with Complex and Pitchfork if I wanna get my shit off
These simpleminded niggas wont think you fuck with us
If they dont see you poppin bottles in the club with us
Its about fashion now which I hate
Because I dress like shit Im just the best when I spit
But different times I was feelin like the odd man out
Like I should leave theyd be better with the odd man out
Like when I wasnt on that intro I felt a little weird
But that was for the team so I didnt really care for real
For the team how I happen to be
When Bad met Evil nigga who was happier than me
Think back the way that I was on that shit
You woulda thought it was my album and I was on that shit
Like fuck rap happy to see a friendship get mended
Cemented and any frivolous tension get ended
Joell you my G Weapon Waist you my OG cuz
Nickel you know I look at you like its blood
Heres the flowers before this end is covered in mud
We can disband right now and its gonna always be love
For a brief period I tried to rhyme like yall
I was high maybe tryin to prove that Im like yall
But Im not I suck at all that syllable shit
Id rather make the pen bleed to see the feelin you get
Im bein honest we might never sell a million and shit
To me its more value in keepin it trill with my nigs
And to Em one of the illest ever on the mic
Were less different than we are alike
This aint about star power I aint on the hype
Never mind skin color I see beyond the white
My whole life I fought trauma like you
Had ups and downs with my baby mama like you
I had my fair share of transgressions like you
Had a bad temper once and fought aggression like you
Did drugs popped pills fought depression like you
These are things youd never pick up from our sessions in the stu
I beefed with Hov 50 Game and Wu
Got in my own way a lot Im sure the same as you
The whole label think Im crazy I been peeped it
Im only mad I couldnt keep a better secret
Still when I hear your voice my head goes wrong
Takes me back to that little boy with my headphones on
And the way you saved my life back then is how Im savin them
Plaques and charted tracks wont take me away from them
So I hope you understand
Fuck this record deal you inspired me as a man
Ill cut it short before I start feelin like a Stan
HouseGang for life word to the pig on Royces hand
Successll never disable me
No record label will ever label me
My morals aint for sale cant underthetable me
Ill ride it out even when everything aint savory
My brothers love me they wont enable me
And they wont kill me they wont Cain and Abel me
Its how I feel at the moment
