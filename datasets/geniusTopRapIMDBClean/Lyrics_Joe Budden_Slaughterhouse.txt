Joey what you said 24 right
Aight cool I got you
I define gutter  every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch hiphop got my spine smothered
But Ill be fine brother  my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing thats word to my mother
You throw a shot at me Im throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint mines whistling by your top hat
Yeah Im cool but you violate and Ill cock back
Open the macs mouth and black out like I do not rap
Im sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Yall be making up stories the little kids is buyin
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I aint gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong  pause
Veterans cosign me the upandcomers scared
The pretty girls go papi heres my underwear
Never in a hundred years I thought Id be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew Id be a factor
Im PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
Youre Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gaps so crazy
Im Gucci Louis V youre Gap Old Navy
I get coochie in the V you attract no ladies
Youre suburb Im gutter where the gats go crazy
Fuck a lecture aint tryna be Puns successor
That terms done fucker what up whatever
You birds is food Im about to pluck some feathers
Im young and clever plus clutch under pressure yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest thatll open your chest like a sunken treasure
Im somethin like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever Im rhyming on or whoever
I tear em apart swear on my pops
No fear in my heart shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks snapped fins with my jaws
Im all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back dumb birds I ignore the hype
Clickclack Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg cross me twice cant afford the price
Itll cost you Ill off your life
You soft I told you Im raw white when Im on this mic
Still mourn at night dont wanna see mornin light
And I feel like Im forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome right
I got em in awe my auras Jordan like
Whats really poppin who diddyboppin
You wasnt really now you all Common and really conscious
I aint with that silly nonsense I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggies optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave theyre carvin Fucked with the wrong nigga
I dont write I kill a pen leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin my age
Forever vow to never smile when Im at peace
Only when Im eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemys internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led em in the belly of the beast
Youll be missin until fishermen see your corpse
Ill be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
Im a gorilla behind these bars on some zoo shit
Shoot you while youre talking on some news camera crew shit
Sicker than flyin in past tense on some flu shit
Dayold asshole flow I drop new shit
Exclusive you dont want it in fact
Ill have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you leavin your body he dont wanna go back
Thats when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
Its Crooked I the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat
Nickel yeah
I hope niggas know Ill show up to your show
Ill show up where you go show up to your do foes will explode
Shells fore they hit the floor I know niggas know
I got a open window flow I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why sheeeeeeeeeeeeit
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like OShea
Ridin shotgun with Chris Martin  my DJ
Not the White boy but Im down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up clap niggas up scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it aint no mo aint no dough
Get into his ass cause I aint opposed Im a livin anal probe
Im a lameophobe matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin  why the fuck not 
When I was a teen I used to pack a threeeighty
Now Im spittin sittin between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she aint shave
I leave the booth smellin like somebody aint sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I aint crazy
Im like Marty McFly goin back in time
And dissin his momma nigga you cant fade me
They say he a bastard for real then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin whys he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks I RIP it
So even to the producer its hard to ID it
Bars tremendous its in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless move more than two inches
My bloodll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me maana
Or see the speed of a llama underground prima donna
That aint hard to find pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E Honda he a monster
I love war its like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin hard I see vagina  pause
Nah rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine manoamano
When it rains it pours grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin with Mouse the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle and an eagle eye
Closed casket now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head dudes callin you Crotchface
So yall could bump Swag Like Us
But the next time raps discussed add this as a plus
Dont nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fags might bust
And since poppin tags is a must  what 
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin their drawers now your crew is in awe
How you ball your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon need another processor to process it
Ill set it I said it
So keep running around hotheaded til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it niggas is piethetic
Rap what you cant afford yall must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I Royce Bless and Joell
With Joe spell NO L
