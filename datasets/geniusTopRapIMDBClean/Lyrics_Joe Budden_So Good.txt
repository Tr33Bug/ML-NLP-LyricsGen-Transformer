Niggas be like
Niggas be like
They like Why you cuffin so hard
And I be like Why you not
Grown man shit though
Its a cold winter niggas they gon keep you warm at night
Make you breakfast in the morning
And I aint in love love is in me you hear
Ive been thinkin bout you every day
These other bitches they cant change us
And I dont need em in the way
Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is your touch is
My spot get
No one ever fucked me so good
Look lets talk a different type of lavish now
Not sure actually a different type of baggage now
Your home girls quick to paint me as a savage now
You quick to know them bitter hoes wish they had this now
Back to you this song of mine no its unsung
Not a trophy thatd imply I only won once
Im off the pass miss if every guy before me once practiced
Then I dont need no real game to know
We should be more than just so on and done
And my baby like girls too
So every night we get in bed with another bitch
She start screamin gettin head from another bitch
And no its just a porno in our heads its another bitch
Yeah but its more than just the sex to me
Panic when I wake up and she aint next to me
So I go out of my way to give her the best of me
Love me so much shorty even want the rest of me
Ive been thinkin bout you every day
These other bitches they cant change us
And I dont need em in the way
Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is your touch is
My spot get
No one ever fucked me so good


We hit the strip club I respect a different taste
Thats how stacks and ones end up in a disarray
These other broads used to transform my livin space
Into solitary confinement prison space
They think we actin though I tell em were not frontin
Give her somethin of everything cause she used to a lot of nothin
We take our clothes off get the spot jump in it
She come multiple times like she forgot somethin
Yeah unlike any other guy she dated
She my world and Im cool with bein isolated
I swear to God all I need is you
If love hurts all I bleed is you
Tell me if you wanna see that through
We could coop it when Im with you
Get back all I put in to recuperate an issue
Let me sum it up for those of yall that ask why
I cherish the ground she walk on but she that fly
Ive been thinkin bout you every day
These other bitches they cant change us
And I dont need em in the way
Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is your touch is
My spot get
No one ever fucked me so good
Its really as simple as this
The woman that they would fuck I wouldnt
The woman I wouldnt fuck they would
What that means is the niggas yall think is fly dont
So I move in my own pace
So goodÂ so good 
Fortunately for me I done been all around the world and met
Met so many different types of women
I picked mine I got the one I like
Even better than that I got the one I love
Yall get these other hoes
Been there done that wasnt that fun
So good so good 
So good so good 
You gotta be on some
You gotta be on some grown shit
To understand this shit that Im talkin bout though
You gotta be on some grown shit
To have the type of sex that Im talkin bout
So good so good 
So good so good 
Yall bedsex niggas Im rooftop
Five star suite and I dont mean considerate and kind
