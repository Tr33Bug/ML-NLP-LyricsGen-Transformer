Tell him something
Say whatever you think hed wanna hear girl
If it dont come between me you and this mirror girl
I dont care girl
Just tell him something
Tell him something
Tell him something
Let him know a real nigga is fuckin you
But thatll probably make you feel uncomfortable
Whatchu gonna do
Tell him something
Tell him something
Its crazy its crazy
How he got your brain
But his body dont do a damn thing for you
Now oh baby oh baby
Been trying to get away
Cause you know I do the things he wont do
You can tell him that we best of friends or we just met
Tell him that you hate my guts that was just sex
Can say we never kissed those were just pecks
Tell him put your phone down that was just a text
Or tell him you cherish our bond on the weekly
Or how you jump in my arms when you see me
Tell him I threw on the charm it was easy
Its to the point now where your mom wanna meet me
Tell him I think youre beautiful
Tell him all the wild shit that I do to you
Would he approve of that Or would his world be shattered
And if you didnt care would it really matter
Wait could say it aint the ride or the whips
But tell him the size of the ship
Or just tell him you were tired of his shit
And I reminded you of how live it gets
Tell him you dont feel appreciated
Tell him with me its alleviated
Incomparable
How I do things that he wouldnt dare to do
Or act like I aint affraid to take it there with you
Wait as a matter a fact
Tell him he could be mad at the fact
You finally met a nigga that aint mad at your past
Or tell him he can be mad at the past
You get his call and he asks what you doing just say With your friends
And while you on that phone waiting for him to hang up girl Ill be here
Ready to take over
Your bodys yearning for what he cant give
And I know just how yalls story gon end
Once I give it to you babe
Tell him you mourn him tell him youre on it tell him you cant see your life without me
Tell him hes deaded now all because Im alive
Tell him its wetter now and you love it when Im inside
Tell him you like your hair pulled tell him you like my tongue there
Tell him in detail make sure you not unclear cause he gotta know cause he gotta know
