Turn me up in the headphone something
New Joe Budden  Look  Uh 
First off let me shout out the fam yall so gracious
Been chillin in the room for growth its so spacious
Gettin to the money countin these old faces
Like I found the smokin gun in cold cases nah
Them dark thoughts never got to him still
Unlike the legendary Robin Will  Rest in peace 
Even though I understand I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope but I dont hang like that
We had a couple breakups gotta respect Cuzz and
Ill hit the reset button you try to reset Budden its real
My accomplishments already show em
How I deal with the consequence and you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like What up with the guy
Which is weird its been a year since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldnt fuck up twice
We reminiscin thinkin hella back you had to watch me
With her but to hell with that cause I think that
Me carryin that thought kind of washed me with her
And even thats cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this how could I explain
Though my mouth was quiet my mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when Im in private
Were we victims to the game Tryna do it over
Heres the gift for an exchange this time not for the public
These niggas wont know a thing so we keep each other blocked
On Twitter its not a game like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models couple Swishers and a stank yeah
Every time I walk away you need me
But your words dont mean a thing when youre not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way  It go 
The way that you care  It go uh 
She said she wanna set boundaries
Cant continue to have you surroundin me
Cause thatll lead to you on this couch poundin me
Thatll bring them feelings back thats just out of bounds to me
Its been years last bitch aint come around to me
Said my tone of voice sound like you speakin down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I cant ask to not be judged then judge you
She said all of this time Ive been screamin Fuck you
Which implies I cant move on Im stuck too
Blood flowin theres an adrenaline rush too
Every time I try to leave I swear you in a rush too she said
Lookin back I can see how you was gamin me
Which is fine I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there
I know the answer to that you still fallin
You aint never felt so strong it feels foreign
Probly got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night its still callin
Ery time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin
You aint gotta respond to that if you did
It would look like its a con to that Im so far beyond and that
Chillin with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that dont act like hoes I dont say that
Cause Im vain or some strangers can know Im the man
We not fuckin  Nah  sometimes its better knowin you cant
She come runnin back every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand its art
Baby I already proved that I ride out
You cant bear to be hurt again so you hideout
You aint gotta say that I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the prides out
Gotta give it one more go we aint tried out
Nah that love wouldntve been real if it died out
Joey
Every time I walk away you need me
But your words dont mean a thing when youre not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care
