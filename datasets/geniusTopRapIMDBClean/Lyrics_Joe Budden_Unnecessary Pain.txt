I still picture your affection
I still hear you like were talkin on the phone
I still feel it
Like youre right there holdin on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin up again
More unnecessary pain
I would ask how we ended up here but I drove
And you allowed me
Or maybe its only me that remembers it
Cause youre so easily told about me
But not once while we were on that road did you doubt me
Played your position writin out our books
I noticed a page missin blame it on the age difference
I see you in the club now days youre resistant
You used to get excited just to never pay admission
Lookin for the old you wishin shit was normal
Tried to mold you and you ended up with it on you
Live around the corner yeah we aint even formal
So Im askin God why you alive and I gotta mourn you
Word I see you got a little crew now
A bunch of ugly broke bitches I know better than
And I aint tryna say them hoes usin you
Well actually who would I be kiddin Yes I am
I see your life from far and somethings off with it
Its my fault and shit I shoulda never altered it
I sold a dream when you couldnt have known the cost of it
Knew my love came with a pain and I still offered it
Seein your weight loss knowin Im the cause of it
If that aint my signature then shit somebody forgin it
But you think I aint hurt like it aint no guilt in me
Like it aint killin me Im out here on a killin spree
A sickness I aint found a way to nurse it yet
Like I aint a nervous wreck like its no reverse effect
Internal bleedin and the cuts run deep
Every time I leave one love a loved one leaves
I wish I could take the pain away but only yours
Ill be fine if I remain this way
See I deserve whatever punishment I get
You could sentence me to years
Of hearin my vics voice even when nothin is there


I still picture your affection
I still hear you like were talkin on the phone
Still feel it
Like youre right there holdin on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin up again
More unnecessary pain
I done gone so long not givin a fuck
That its no longer erratic now its a normal habit
Even when I go my way I gotta have it
Bury me with my sweats on and bitches in the casket
All the waiters and words I let em loom on
Every verse real enough to write it on my tombstone
And so you know how real that paranoia be
Even make me think my demise is avoidin me
The sick part is I withstand that abuse
Long as the fans are amused am I a man or a muse
Never sugarcoat it when I hand it to the youth
Fell from all over the world and always landed in the booth
I hold music in such a high regard that
To this day I still feel like its destiny
And to these fans that I once gave my life for
I gotta tell you that its not much left in me
Yeah and not that its growin old
But years of bearin my soul is takin its toll
Took a father from his son but is it best that way
Im so fucked up inside I cant regret that Trey
Hold my head up high at the gates after my times up
They say you saved somebodys life by givin mine up
Wouldnt be the first time that I went without
Chased my true love so much that I resent it now
You can put this in the scriptures like its sacred
To live with it but hate it is to giveth then to take it
Goin through the motions itll strip a nigga naked
I guess its for a cause if all the kids are gonna play it
Trust me I aint been the same yet
Youll stop and stare any time you see a trainwreck
And Ill take whatever punishment they give
You can sentence me to years
Of hearin that fans voice even when nothin is there
I still picture your affection
I still hear you like were talkin on the phone
Still feel it
Like youre right there holdin on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin up again
More unnecessary pain
Still learnin to live with
People coming in and out my life
The ones who matter show it over time
Thats why they always stay on my mind
So I live in reality
Nobody else matters to me but you you you
Why try to hide the truth
I still picture your affection
I still hear you like were talkin on the phone
Still feel it
Like youre right there holdin on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin up again
More unnecessary pain
Im tired of feeling this
I gotta live with this
