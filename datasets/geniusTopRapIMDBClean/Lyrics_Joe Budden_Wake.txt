New Joe Budden
Good afternoon everyone Im Kenny Powers If youre here and youre someone Shane cared about or someone Shane loved Or maybe youre just somebody who has no business being here at all whos just here because you think its gonna make you more popular You know Shane and I used to fuck around big time We fuckin partied hard Wed ride our vehicles around Slay ass
My condolences my condolences
Whole family in mourning send my condolences
My condolences crazy I just spoke to him
Courtney dropping drinks all in Hooters
She losin focus shit
Dont send a text I dont care yall mad
Shit I waited 5 days nigga where yall at
For real Im calling Stunna
Cause all Summer 16 aint heard a hot 16 bout all Summer
Awareness is high say attention Im seeking
Since Im reaching its offensive theyre convinced Im a demon
Such a thin disagreement son my kin for a reason
Killing you is expected of me I dont win an achievement
Somebody pinch me Im dreaming take this mental reprievement
Since I know the nigga I know this aint the man that Im seein
I heard it straight from the Bamas mouth he wont pull a hammer out
Wasnt you at Hovs show scared to pull the camera out
Im seeing habits switch magic tricks
You froggy behind that Apple fix
The passiveness in your manner I might react to it
Automatic shit
Ratchet kids at your crib that cant even spell Calabasas bitch
So I take all the guns load half the clips
I just notice you run we mention half the Clipse
Ill save that for another time Ill get back to it
Im kinda shocked to look at what weve advanced to
Knew itd get you dismantled knew the issues I ran through
Sick of the scandal or maybe I just misunderstand you
I kept it a buck thought that that was shit you could handle
You said that you wondered if anything you doin was brand new right
I got him no one help father punch below the belt
Introspection means dig deep lets look below the wealth
I wanna know myself
How you tell bitches know they self
When you dont even know yourself
You wouldnt know yourself
Say he Canadian maybe Asian Croatian
Be sounding like his Jamaican friends depend on what state he in
I think you rap good but you a movie star
So that owls appropriate we dont know who you are
Where did the boys brain change Was it the club scene
Now you sound like you use people and love things
But later for how you use people and love things
The entendres that upswing when I call you drug king
That record contract leaves a lot to exam
Never dealt drugs in his life but sold a lotta gram
Thats too much baking soda good thing my break is over
They thinking cause my paper lower this for Rage to blow up
Or maybe they just woke up
You leverage your celeb taking waves over
Thats territorial takeover
Maybe he thinks nobody notices
Gucci wasnt home two seconds before you rode his dick
Bodied Versace flows copy that he stole
Ay dios mio sorry Migos adios amigo
Was that your plot all along
Why you aint do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song
No really we want a Party album
But you keep stealing all of Partys album
To go and put it on your party album
Its plenty reason to slay you
Kept going up Tuesdays and now The Weeknd just hates you
Are you lifeless Sound like a zombie on the track
Remember Started From the Bottom it was Zombie on the Track
Know who else started from the bottom Zombie on the Track
How come after that joint I dont see Zombie on a track
Im from Jersey so Zombie I got your back
Be alarmed the real is finally back
Get your guard up now hope your heart up now
Battery in him lets see if he get charged up now
Im wake
Im wake
We at the wake
Whos Goose and whos Tom Cruise
Well now that Shane is dead I guess we know who is Goose Shane is Goose Cause in that motion picture Goose dies so Shane is dead so he would be Goose
