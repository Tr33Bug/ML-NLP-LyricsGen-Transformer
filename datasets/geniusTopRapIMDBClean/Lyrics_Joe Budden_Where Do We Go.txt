Good evening
Hows everybody feeling out there
Yall good
I talk my shit again
I really dont know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I dont want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like like we should just let it go
Where do we go
You aint gotta adore me or keep it friendly
And even if you aint for me dont be against me
Your people tell you ignore me and say it simply
But you get lonely and call me that always tempts me
We get caught in the moment and then we fall back
Then I get horny and you take that as a crawl back
Now theres an irony hidden if you can call it that
I walk all over you yet you be on my doormat
And unbeknownst to you that whole plan of attack
She sayin only with me does her sanity lack
Her truth come out when she drunk but I amnesty that
I talk logic and she screamin profanity back
Now when I think long term you cant hand me that
But for now she need a crutch
There I am to take advantage of the handicap
Just me givin you truth I dont demand it back
Guess Im just a fan of facts hope you understandin that
I really dont know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I dont want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like like we should just let it go
Where do we go
Check it Im like royalty around yall
Down to fall with niggas I feel as loyal as me
Which is prolly why loyalty is my downfall
Got few friends that be coyin me to count more
But steel sharpens steel let me sound off
Still gotta question your will and what youre down for
Its real I question your wheels wish they was round more
The ilk of your found cloth are you built for the downpour
All I try to do is lead by example
Seems some are content with niggas feedin them a sample
Tried to create a path know the streets can be a handful
Me I made it out without degrees on the mantle
Though my money good Im overseas gettin ample
Itll never mean the snakes and all the leeches I can handle
The bond is broke now I believe its gettin trampled
Gotta pick up your pants wear your creases like a man do
I really dont know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I dont want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like like we should just let it go
Where do we go
Its been weeks now maybe we both feel so weak now
Times past should be cool for us to speak now
And you got so much pride was no surprise
I had to reach out shit you used to creep through my house
Outside of bein fine I always said you was cool
You would leave in time to get your son ready for school
And Ill admit that was admirable
Suckin me off every night without you ever losin sight of what you had to do
Fucked for seven months straight shit was magical
You broke it off over shit that wasnt factual
How could I fuck with you
With you actin so gullible and all Im reluctant to move forward
You fell in love with me quick was down to wait for me
But that held us down was like a weight for me
You wanted answers
Said we cant keep fuckin without a title you wont sit back idle
And to me it was intangibles
Reasons I couldnt be the man for you
Part of why a nigga ran from you
Part of why I was passive and dismissive
Why we had that awkward goodbye and I aint fix it
Why I let your Bimmer pull off and I aint miss it
I lied cause the truth was really none of your business
I felt like the hostings was a hoe thing
Late nights strip clubs really the whole thing
But thats my own baggage in fact
Plus you slept with other rappers at that
Just some shit that tamed my own brain this is after the fact
Its my bad not yours I know the past is the past
Im hopin alls forgiven you not stuck in that time
Maybe we can fuck one last time Im playin with you
Heres to bein grown and communicatin issues
We was never together but a nigga stayin with you
I really dont know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I dont want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like we should just let it go
Where do we go
Where do we go from here
What are we doin
Where do we come from
Where do we go from here
Can I talk my shit again
Joey
Where do we go from here
Parks let me get one more
I remember it like it just happened
Scratch that cant dismember it it just happened
Funny how one deathll let these mishaps in
Thats exactly whats about to occur
I defer heres the stinger
Im right where I grew up and lost my finger
How we let it all linger
Whole family in black where you used to reside
All here to say our final goodbyes
Them to you me to them
My thought with every tear that I cried
Whole mornin I was mournin family that had survived
Now that you are gone you took with you all of the magic that you performed
And so our issues of a much deeper root is born
The weight fell dont know who its on
And since our glue is gone this is how we movin on
Truth in song all quiet like the mute is on
Speak to me from Heaven above if Im doin this wrong
Say somethin
Just let a nigga know you hear me
Where do we go from here
Rest in peace
What up
Where do we go
Where do we go from here
Understand me
Do anybody hear me
Joey
I love you
Where do we go from here
