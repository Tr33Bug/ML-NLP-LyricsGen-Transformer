Can anybody pinpoint the day it went wrong
I mean I used to blame Reggaeton I cant front
I thought all that was corny was it Jas fault
Lil Mo said she aint get paid for Put It On Me
Look you bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit
Was it TPain with that funny voice shit
Or was it Lil Wayne with that funny voice shit
The whole game dick rode that funny voice shit
I cant tell when it happened
Was it when Lil Jon showed dudes you could sell without rapping
Was it Laffy Taffy I thought they was kiddin
Shawty Lo said Dey Know I really didnt
Dancin became cool again then came Walk It Out
But I aint know what the fuck niggas was talkin bout
Unit kicked Game out they aint give a fuck
Then we see the same shit happen to Buck
It was a few years ago but I remember the summer
50 made fans start looking at the numbers
ARs wont take risks they wont sign niggas
The word swag came out and started to blind niggas
Rap dudes want reality shows
And my dumbass was thinking that reality sold
Did it start with the iPod
Or when rappers had to pay DJs for them to do their job
Now all the content is the same it dont differ
Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers
The more you think about you gonna just get sicker
I mean why the fuck would Nas wanna call his shit Nigga NIGGA
Was it when the Wu broke up
Pac BIG Pun went to sleep never woke up
Lupe was doing a tribute and choked up
Some of these stupid ass fans was like So what
Some them they aint educated
Fuck blaming the south we aint segregated
I mean it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit
Took a left turn around the Kiss and Green shit
Maybe it all started when RocAFella parted
Ways its natural to shift toward fame
I watched every last one of dudes shit on Dame
Kind of got that in common I can dig that pain
When they gave Jay a desk and suit
They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute
But somethin told me the suits at the tables was hurtin
They Fired everybody labels started merging
Far as sales The decline is strong
As the experts theyll say that the climates wrong
I mean some niggas prime is gone
I peeped it when niggas started puttin fake diamonds on
You can tell a dude I spit better than you
But then hell say Im richer for whatever I do
I seen all this coming I knew what we was in for
Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window
Was it when Mae retired He couldnt hack it
Tip could he just needed some more ratchets
DJs Producers the ones who get us the farthest
Said Fuck rappers and they became the artists
I gotta talk candid
Did we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did
Or was it when Chingy thought he aint need Ludacris
His Next album found out that that was ludicrous
Papoose and Clipse both survived
Inking with Jive then getting jived
Your man Jae Hood repped that DBlock gang
Then I seen dude dragging his DBlock chain
Or did onehit wonders change it all along
They made labels only want to sign a dudes song
And you really dont know shit
If you think the fans pick the videos on 106
Im just stating the truth
Did it start when Fox stayed in the news
More than she did the booth
Or was it when Lil Kim stopped exploiting sex
The fuck is up with DMX
I hope dudes straight
Have an opinion and they gonna say you hate
I cant front Im missing the old Clue tapes
Next thing the underground sunk further
The feds was on Irv so The Inc dropped Murder
I never blame Fab Jeezy Rick Ross
Did shit get lost when Shyne went up north
Ill never understand the hiphop police
When hiphop is what hiphop needs to police
These blatantass radio attempts sound so bland
Twista kept trying to recreate Slow Jamz
Then we send the wrong message with our slang
Broke niggas blowing they rent to make it rain
So you walk in and give a bitch a few 20s
Shell smerk her face up looking at you funny
This chick told me she only take new money
Man I snatched my shit back sooo fast
Or did it start when rappers said Fuck it
Sacrificed music and started raping they budget
Nothing wrong with dudes being candy or pop
Something was wrong when Joc did the Candy Shop
We buying our own records maybe no ones to blame
Are we a business that we cant afford to maintain
Second week show that boy numbers aint high
I hate to break it to you numbers always lie
Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath
And Now hes feeling the aftermath
Was it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps
Not too many of them gettin signed after that
I mean some cant stay afloat
A million Busta albums hes still not mentioned with the GOATs
Fuck looking for answers time will tell
Was it when Def Jam didnt want to resign L
A 15year old told me Cass was ass
Rather than spazz all dude could do was laugh
Or was it when the whole East Coast fell off
Or got comfortable maybe dudes was too well off
The more niggas said they didnt write down lyrics
The more it started to sound like they didnt
But do whatever you can to keep the lights on
But Dumbin down just became the new DYLAN
Honestly I aint know what to think
A few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink
I cant blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing
When We trained them to be this way
I mean showed em whatever to sell with no limits
Since the early 90s sold em a false image
So when some shit comes that dont fit the mold
Its like mole and nigga you wont even do Gold
They watch the videos
See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood
They turn on the TV
See these video bitches and they think niggas girls really look that good
I mean They get so many free verses when the album drops the shits more like a bonus
Why pay for it Why take onus
With one click of the mouse they could own it
I mean some of them are fooled so easily
By whatever we say or we show em on TV
But that was all part of the plan
Or was it when Eminem made Stan
I swear some of these fans they put they whole life on the line
Its like they cant like more than one rapper at a time
Less about the product more about the digits
Its a business we got less fans and more critics
Maybe we at a cross
Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost
And I aint believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me
That KRSOne had a rap beef with Nelly
If rap was alive wed be trying to be the best rappers ever
Not the best rapper alive
But you wont get accepted at all if you aint street tough
Onyx was the hardest til Sticky got beat up
Now Im A Thug is how I gotta behave
If I wanna be paid if I wanna see praise
You know somethings wrong when niggas are getting shot
And you gotta sit and wonder if the whole things staged
It aint REAL no more
Or did we just expand on our audience maybe we appeal to more
Or do we think yall are just getting dumber
We tried to make gettin older getting younger
Did we lose our hunger Somethings gotta give
Did we outgrow ourselves Is hiphop for kids
If it is they turn on MTV Cribs
And think Thats where these motherfuckers really live
Or was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic
So did the Fugees til Wyclef tapped it
Songs dont do it no more the shits shocking
Seen it when Lean Back had the whole world rocking
Now its Fuck your bars if your hook is fly
So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye
Dope ass rappers aint seeing no dough
If everythings commercial where the fuck is the show
But anybody making a dime see ima wish well
Still we took a big L losing Big L
Or was it when YouTube came in the game
Now nobodys from their living room can make a name
Or when Indies like Koch came and blew up
Niggas at the majors they literally threw up
To some it aint fun no more
You know its fucked up when DMC dont talk to Run no more
To many egos like we aint one no more
Shits predictable niggas aint stunned no more
We startin to see shit we never seen before
At one point we even had the magazines at war
OR was it street DVDs like Smack
Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act
This shit get lifeless
When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest
Changed the whole steelo
I mean the averaged fan never heard of Goodie Mob or a Cee Lo
But they heard of Gnarls Barkley
And Dr Carter still say we got a heartbeat
I aint gonna lie I was scared to death straight up
I started to hear rumors of an Outkast breakup
I was like That aint true it sounds desperate
Then started to see Big Boi and 3K separate
We had periods where it was drier than a desert
Are we all killin this shit Is it a group effort
Are we alive and well or barely surviving
Is it RBs fault Them niggas is thriving
Then a lot of people go and blame LimeWire
I dont think its downloadin dog the lines tired
Did the fans just get tired of the outcome
One dope single and a bullshit album
So they share albums with each other
Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers
Or when we started appearing in the news
Timberland said they didnt want black niggas wearing they boots
I mean I know it got foggy at least blurry
When the label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray
Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names
Had the kids trying to buy shit they cant name
And some think the evidence is ample
Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample
Is it all watered down with no fire
If you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter
Or the Diamond District with Jacob the Jeweler
Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler
Fucking with them trends
Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that aint even in
Look is the game now as bad as its ever been
Its not ringtones just the songs that they represent
I heard all of em
The sad part I wouldnt recognize most these niggas if I saw em
I cant explain it I dont know what to tell ya
Now goin Gold is look at as a failure
Maybe old heads in charge just werent able
DJs is spinning now with no turntable
Maybe the fans are just bored of us
Or maybe there aint enough room for all of us
Its like even a friendship will stop at a point
Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thugs joint
But theres so many ways to get fuckin rich
Supahead caked off by just suckin dick
Did we sell out just to get in demand more
Did we go against everything we used to stand for
Both are likely
Theres two sides to a coin who you rollin with Souljah Boy or IceT
Some niggas wanna sit around and complain about
I rather analyze seek how it came about
If we could rewind the world
We wouldnt have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl
Look today its all about marketing and promo
I remember VH1 was just for old folks
But no maam
If I aint know better I would think that mix show is now programmed
We let the power of the dollar annihilate us
Now the size of our chain gonna validate us
Its too simple they cant think were really deep
I just heard Chris Brown on the A Millie beat
Seen a video its called Lookin Ass Niggas
Grabbed the remote tired of lookin at niggas
But that let a nigga know if we aint dead
Then we just half alive maybe brain dead
Did it start when Capone left Nore
Nah he went to jail thats a whole different story

Or maybe somethings really wrong with our ears
Obie Trice got dropped so much for Cheers
Female emcees they dont ever hit the target
Somebody said they saw Amil working in a Target
The sad part is we already lost Remy
Or did we go wrong when Eve got skinny
Whats up with JackiO Rah Digga that I cant figure
And Trina aint been the same since Nan Nigga
I know it had to do something to his heart beat
When Lady of Rage started doing Steve Harvey
I know we caught a lil trama
Somewhere between Yo Yo Boss and Lil Mama
Lot of females found another way to extort
Most of our video models have turned escort
Do anything to see dough
So theyll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role
Or should we get back to basics
Wheres the Rakims or the Master Aces
The Big Daddy Kanes or did we never recover
From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover
Or when rap dude started signin their friends
Instead of going out and tryin to find niggas with skill
Seen it happen when D12 put out Purple Pills
And while the whole hood laughed them niggas sold a Mil
Some of us aint prepared for something so lucrative
I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit
Like we almost caught one in the torso
When each Bone Thugs member took they own crossroads
Some disagree some gotta see the same
Or maybe Hip Hop died on Aailyahs plane
If it relocated where did it move to
I still Love HER the way Common used to
Or did Bill O Reily come fuck up the spirit
With negative remarks about everybodys lyrics
Spend all this time dissin us
Nigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldnt be a listener
Lost Jam Master who was tougher then leather
Or did it start when Treach started fuckin Pepa
As our jeans got tighter and our tees got longer
Im trying to figure which age group we belong to
Or did we all go astray the second Dr Dre left NWA
I mean in my opinion we was on easy street
When he was beefin with EazyE
Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat
Signin unknown niggas to start making their beats
If you sell your own shit it gotta go for cheap
Put my name on it and the price increase
Or is it cause everybodys so selfcentered
Is that the reason Hip Hop itself aint centered
Or have we already seen this shit with our own eyes
Rico Suave Hammer and Vanilla Ice
Everybody want in the game so in return
You got label executives fuckin their interns
And anybody lookin at that new Vibe bracket
Should see that they dont know a thing about this rap shit
Or maybe we shoulda stopped being proud
When there was no more Rawkus and no more Loud
Tried to get conscious around Vote or Die
So they made it look like all our votes was lies
As the years go on its like we keep gettin more voids
We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys
I knew we was impersonating a fraud
When KaySlay smacked my man at the awards
Regardless its our fault as artists
Runnin with entourages who act like they aint never left the projects
Who do we wanna target
Will they put an Uncle Murda cd in a WalMart or a Target
We got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass
But fuck with VIC Get Silly and that trash
I felt ashamed
When JKwon told me he aint like Raekwon cause he stole his name
Was back when everybody in the club got tipsy
Now every contract gotta be 360
So fuck eatin better scrape the plate
Now every beat gotta at least have an 808
Did the lights get dim when we first heard Mims
And said Another New York rapper on the South tip
Is it overcrowded
They keep sayin If its so fucked up then do something about it
I doubt it theres just one thing they dont understand
That job is way bigger then just one man
Or maybe all of these pleas that its deceased
Is false and its right where it needs to be
Maybe we built on something thatll last forever
See Face and Geto Boys just got back together
Maybe no one can stop us even other genres now jock us
We even doing songs with the rockers
How is that the feelin
Kanyes amazin Wayne just sold a Million
We closer to a ceilin
How are we in a coma
When we the only business you can excel without a diploma
Technology changed made everything simple
Myspace is now a dudes bio slash demo
Aside from this rap we generatin more money
We took it global and penetrated other countries
So lets celebrate sip some Cris
Some more shit we embrace just to end up dissed
Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent
Lets go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent
Or heres another bright idea to entertain
Lets go and put our face on the bottom of a chain
Are some of us just nigga rich with nigga money
While Jews keep laughin Look at these nigga dummies
Should Hip Hop be a steppin stool
Till we find another role we can step into
Some of us doin movies as a matter of fact
And some never stopped to plan life after rap
I mean as a whole did we stop movin further
Around the time Snoop Dogg went on trial for murder
Or was it Scarface creatin these clonies
30 years later everybodys still Tony
Maybe anybody complaining is deranged
Can you expect something to grow and not change
Were socially accepted deviated our old route
To simplify the term we all sold out
I think I figured out whos to blame
Started out Obama ended up McCain
So we Kurt Cobaind ourself and were defeated
So next time they ask who killed it tell em WE DID
