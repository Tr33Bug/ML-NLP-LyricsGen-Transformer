Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasnt suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Aint gotta say a word I already know it
Even if you scared to death its ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you dont wanna blow it
And I wouldnt be surprised if I did thats typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me her body is a work of art
Theres a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together well never have to see em again
I love you
You and I you and I seem crazy
I would die if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn bout us
Where we go I dont know the future
I just know I dont wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love on love
Ive been with every woman in this world except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
Were both broken pieces both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage its a carryon
So in life without I couldnt conceive
I tried to dump her one time but she wouldnt leave
And I aint want her to so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldnt breathe
Been trough the run around took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passions unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down we had to gel
I love you
You and I you and I seem crazy
I would die if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn bout us
Where we go I dont know the future
I just know I dont wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love on love
Ive been with every type of woman some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens but I aint mad at them
You make bittersweet today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldnt last when that crash begun
Some played it cool but wasnt half as fun
Some aint over me they just blame away
Some I ruined myself others came that way
Some were modelesque left started gaining weight
Other waited to gain but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love dont know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you so its ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If Imma take a chance on love I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you
You and I you and I seem crazy
I would die if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn bout us
Where we go I dont know the future
I just know I dont wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love on love
