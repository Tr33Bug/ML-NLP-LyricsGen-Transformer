Saying that you from here
You dont never come here
Saying that you from here
You dont never come here
Saying that you from here
You dont never come here
Well goddamn
There must be 2 sides 
Too many niggas running round here lying
Claiming my city and they aint from mine
Atown niggas so real so raw
My bloodline is down by law
My pedigree is so Zone Three
So Zone One so Zone Four
In other words fuckboy I aint no ho
Nigga Im known at the AAMCO
Where the dope gets sold and the hammers blow
Still at the store where you grandma go
You know the same store where you cant go
Cause you aint go stop lying ho
Niggas see dumb niggas eyein yo
Piece and chain bout to blow your brain
You wanna G up but you cant
Real niggas do what a fuckboy cant
Come through hood in wetass paint
Leave the car running with a filled up tank
Let a motherfucker try and touch my Chevy
Guarantee that Ima put four in his belly
Two in his chest and a few in his neck
Then I dip back out to the flat
Westside OG that be me
Martin Luther King on my ID
Shawty LO and TIP
Both know me from the goddamn streets
Now ask your favorite rapper bout me
No ask your favorite dboy about me
Ask Lil Lean ask Fat Steez
Ask Sleepy and Young Pill
All they gonna tell you is I keep it real
I put that shit on Adamsville
You say you from the westside
Well goddamn There must be 2 sides 
You say you from the eastSide
Well goddamn There must be 2 sides 
You say you from the southside
Well goddamn There must be 2 sides 
You say you from the northside
Well goddam There must be 2 sides 
Westside bound but Im eastside found
Ask them Glenwood boys Im round
Who is these eastside niggas you round
Aint never ever seen none of em clowns
I dont never see em on Candler Road
In Eastwyck or Old Flat Shoals
Nigga steady saying he from Decatur
Pussy yous a fucking faker
Ima ask them niggas on Marve Road
Ima ask them niggas on Memorial
Ima ask them niggas on Panola Road
If the niggas dont know Ima ask some hoes
Why Cause you pussy nigga
I aint no pussy nigga
Think I am then push me nigga
Wet me up and douche me nigga
Up shopping in south DeKalb
South DeKalb with a fine young stallion
Or Candler Road Red Lobster cracking
With my eastside mobster faction
Might see me with on a Kirkwood block
With a eastside Chevy rider named Big Block
Or Moreland Ave with my top on drop
Radio on Pac just gripping my cock
Gripping my Glock and gripping my grain
On Covington Highway getting some brain
Rainbow Drive I made my name
Slinging that pure Bolivian cane
Making some change two years before
The Olympics came two years after
Met Gucci Mane through DJ Funk and Daryl James
Im real with it mayne
Saying that you from here
You dont never come here
