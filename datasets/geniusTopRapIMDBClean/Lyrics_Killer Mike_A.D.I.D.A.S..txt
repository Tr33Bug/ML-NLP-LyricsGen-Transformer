ADIDAS Lyrics
Pussy nigga what you doing
No thats what it is I had to go to the pad
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
Its the way you move your sexy groove  Sex 
Ive got my mind all over you
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire  Sex 
Im tired of jacking off cause you aint there
65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Oozing down the street like toothpaste cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the inseam on the inside of the ship
Got a honey dip to hunt on testes more blue than a Crip
Or the Blue Man Group caught that on the Vegas Strip
Tell them a good game JuJu pimping cane like my nigga Don Magic
Boss lips legs arms necks
Hips head more to test
Its a camel toe and thats for sure my brain is on one track
Like Marion Barry calls for crack or like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genitalia where its at
Im a man and I demand a woman for that act
Personal preference plus I use the law of nature as a reference
No I dont ever recall seein a man turn up pregnant
But thats just me feminine female fantasies frolic freely in my cock pit
Every thirty something seconds I cant stop it
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
Its the way you move your sexy groove  Sex 
Ive got my mind all over you
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire  Sex 
Im tired of jacking off cause you aint there


Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heifers call me BlackNDecker I dont screw them hoes I drill
Ive been cuttin Cuban coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreaming bout them thick medium or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white I like mine dark as cola
Its the first thing on my mind in the morning when I roll over
All men young or old in the end its what we after
Even my grandpappys happy he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy grandaddy
Whats up Whats up Its me
Ayy let me get bout three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you back tomorrow
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
Its the way you move your sexy groove  Sex 
Ive got my mind all over you
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire  Sex 
Im tired of jacking off cause you aint there
When I drill I dont spill even if shes on the pill
Keep my weapon covered concealed and in a shield
Cause I dont need that AIDSÂ 
A D and an A missin out my Adidas
Plus we dont need no DNA mixin between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hushhush
On the down low like R Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby Im no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but theres no jumping brooms
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom boom
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
Its the way you move your sexy groove  Sex 
Ive got my mind all over you
All day I dream about all day I dream about sex
You said you were so savoir faire  Sex 
Im tired of jacking off cause you aint there
