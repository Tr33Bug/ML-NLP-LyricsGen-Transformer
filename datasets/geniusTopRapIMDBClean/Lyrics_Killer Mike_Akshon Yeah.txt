Akshon  Yeah  Lyrics
Yeah Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell  Boo 
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
KILL
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
My mind dont slack
Im totally focused on beating up tracks
Monsterous music to beat in your Lac
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat
Im hittin all kittens meowing like that
I like the front but Im loving the back
I like to bite and Im hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping Im holding the lane
Mamas a scholar she blowing my brain
Aint that the life
Snapping  Trappin and Rappin  Frappin all night
Lil mamas a plumber she handling pipe
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Yall better run one one
Thump thump thump thump  yeah 
All in your trunk  yeah 
Grinding and hustling and getting at mine
Swerving and token and grippin on pine
Bump bump bump bump
All in your trunk
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk
How we gon stop  whooa 
How we gone quit  shitttt 
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
I came through swerving like this  errrrr 
Good wit the game gutter fo show
Ducking you lames and obstacles
Dont get that ass in a hospital
Wrapped in a cast from head to toe
This boy he real
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Get it Like Moss she catches the ball
Perfectly tuned my engine dont stall
And Im equipped with nitros yall
Ready to rip burn roar
Ready to tear through your city and tour
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch
Later for now Im hustling hits
Flipping my words like bricks trick


New new That newnew
Newnew for youyou
Newnew for youyou
That newnew That newnew
Newnew for youyou
Newnew for youyou
