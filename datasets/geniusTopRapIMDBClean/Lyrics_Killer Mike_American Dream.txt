Radio Announcer  The American dream had a price tag  and only one man in a million was hungry enough to pay
Hey man you can save that morality for your minister
And you can save that speech for the sisters of the church
This is America jack
This is all about corporate takeovers and money makeovers
Wealth matters and poverty doesnt
We all say we love Martin Luther King but we all wanna live like Don King dont we
God bless America God bless America
Home of the Rockefellers home of the Carnegies
Home of the end justifies the means legitimized through larceny
Fuck the king Fuck your taxes is what they told their masters
Before they became our masters
So rebelling against power is natural
And being an outlaw is actually 
My American dreams my American schemes
Fueled by American greed
My American dreams my American schemes
Fueled by American dreams
Its American me its American me
By any means necessary
American me my American dreams
Fueled by American schemes
Its American me
In America the crooks get the castles
Never see a Rothschild or Rockefeller shackled
While Rockefeller Drug Laws keep us in a shackle
Eventually this weedll be as legal as tobacco
By then every CEO I hope will be a black though
Message to the felon keep sellin my brethren
The end of an era soon coming I tell em
Bumpy Johnson showed us the way dont fail him
Big Meech united all the streets they jailed him
Pablo fought the government so they killed him
Probably took his bricks and brought em to us to deal em
My critics say I celebrate the dope dealer  probably
Cause Im pro whatever prevents me from feeling poverty
For the same reason Prescott Bush worked with Nazis
The same reason Kennedys dad ran the rum
By any means necessary I will overcome


You become a sociopath flipping birds
The same mindstate it takes to build a Bilderberg
Or an Enron or any other big con
That could fleece a million people out of billions
Im trying to get a cheaper price you know a bigger bag
Mexican work  how American is that
As American as steering in a German car
Fucking a Russian chick snorting coke from Colombia
