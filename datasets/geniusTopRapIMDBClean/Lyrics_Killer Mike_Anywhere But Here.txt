I gotta get out of here this citys gonna kill me
Could be anywhere
Anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman movin through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move
Through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as Im passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him  Queens 
Forty one times he committed no crime
But I guess life aint Times Square
But in the city thats gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayors a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it and Brooklyn keep on taking it
Cause life just aint that fair
For the kids in the park watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin to flip them a pack stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here  New York 
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me  Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me  Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me out to me
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though its black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward these young black boys
Seem to selfsabotage theyselves
Or maybe theyre just smart and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston well it kills itself  Atlanta 


Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me  Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out  I can hear them calling out 
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me  Out to me out to me 
I can hear them calling out  I can hear them calling out 
Anywhere but here
Anywhere anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
I can hear them calling out
