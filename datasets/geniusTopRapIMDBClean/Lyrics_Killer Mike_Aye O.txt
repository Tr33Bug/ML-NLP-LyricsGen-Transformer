Youre gettin to your money holla
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
You aint broke pop a bottle go
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
When Killer hit the stage they say
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
And after the show they goin
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
Another Sunday
Another show in the country
Girl pussy poppin shake that monkey
Fire up the  put the dro in the air
Niggas throw up your set put your hood in the air
Half the club on the pill the other half on drank
The parking lot full of old schools with wet candy paint
Shit just last week a young nigga got shot
Playing Superman racing bullets in the parking lot
Everybody know left him leaking in the street
But well hand it our self
We aint talkin to police
You already know the next day the hood put in work
And came back to the club in RIP Tshirts
Youre gettin to your money holla
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
You aint broke pop a bottle go
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
If youre riding candy paint say
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
If youre burning good dank go
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
If I gotta pull the K they sayin
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
And if I let it go they like
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
When Killer hit the stage they say
Aye Aye Aye Aye 
And after the show they goin
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
Im looking for the girl with Mike rolls in her hair
Take a picture with me mama put your ass in the air
One  in her mouth and her outfit tight
She aint lookin for a man she just wanna fuck tonight
She got titties like  Aye Aye 
And ass like  Ooh Ooh 
Im firing up the dro while she pop a pill and roll
I love a girl from the hood fuck a video hoe
But yall niggas know Ill fuck a video hoe
Killer been around the world did sold out shows
And came back to the hood and bought a Vert on vogues
You can call me Santa Clause cause I keep three hoes
And even in the summer Im knee deep in snow
Jeah
Deep in the south what do DJs play
Scarface Eightball UGK
And Gs dont dance we bounce and step
Throw bows to the right and stomp to the left
Whats up to all the young Gs with a head full of locks
Getting money on the block with a pocket full of rocks
We headed to the club swerving and reckless
Creased jeans white tees Bob Marley necklace
You know about the south
You know what we about
Girl with short shorts and they asses hanging out
Dope boys on the grind with a grill in his mouth
We getting money down here what the fuck is yall about
Put your Gs in the air for Grind Time Official Purple Ribbon in the sky David Banner Killer Mike History Jejejejeah
