Yeah motherfucker Im back from the dead
Driving like a bat out of hell in a red
Caprice classic I spit acid
I dont rap ringtones I flow classics
I am dirty south hiphop whats happening
True shit talking you aint into battling
You know I let the gun go like a gatling
Favorite fucking rappers I am embarrassing
God in the building nigga aint no comparison
I dont need swagger Im just arrogant
Martin Luther King Drive made me this way
And Ive been real G before Atlanta went gay
Im down by law what more can I say
Got a new AK a new Chevorlet
Now which fuck boy on the block wanna play
Im the best fucking rapper you will find in the A
Grind Time Rap Gang theyre those guys
The truth and the whole truth they dont lie
They just do  do  do  do  they dont try
And if anybody had a problem they gonna ride
Like bang bang bang bang bang bang
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
Sidekicks hate they dont wanna see me conquer
Fired my boss I dont need no sponsor
Truck jewelry got me looking tough like Tonka
Robber try to touch lose his arm like in Rwanda
In the concrete jungle you prey or a hunter
When you kill a nigga they say his soul haunts ya
Id rather sleep with a ghost than sleep with the fish
Be judged by twelve than carried by six
Rapper walk like a man and ride a nigga dick
Fortyfive got the king size jeans on sag
Dont make me put another skull  cross on the flag
Grind Time Rap Gang rep that flag
Bang bang bang the mack on your ass
Charging with the hemi going vroom vroom fast
Head full of smoke every packet got cash
No love for the haters you can kiss my ass


Leader of the Grind Time get money Rap Gang
Dopeass flows lyrically Im cocaine
Dope dick for the bitches dope lyrics for the dope mang
King Kong is the beast man no cage no chain
Top of the world white girl in my left hand
Some monkeyass niggas better hear me clearly
Any mother fucker aint rappin payin dearly
Im talking weekly monthly yearly
Until you punk motherfuckers learn to fear me
Im on some G shit Ive got a G card
I hit a nigga head leave his ass a retard
I have his momma saying No take me lord
Preacher in the pulpit the choir sings
And on the first row a momma cries and leans
The young fella had to die its a goddamn shame
But its Grind Time Rap Gang bang bang bang
