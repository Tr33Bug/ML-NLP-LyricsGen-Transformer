Hardcore G shit homie I dont play around
Aint shit sweet bout the peach  this Atlanta clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry motherfucker
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all that nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow motherfucker pow Come up off the chain  ay ay 
Pow motherfucker pow One off in the brain  ay ay 
We some moneyhungry wolves and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard aint shit we strip him like a stripper bitch
These realass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta they aint never speak a pun
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
Once upon a time in the projects
An OG saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch said This where little dogs sit
Pointed at the yard  yard  said Thats where big dogs shit  shit 
He said Dont leave til your ass get growed
And dont come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave  ave 
Make sure they wanna see ya  wanna see ya 
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan  Jordan  but settle for a Pippen
Player I aint even tripping but I dont really care
Cause my pistols in your face so put your hands in the air


And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
96 Im riding with a pistol grip banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville Im repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up lets see can they handle this
A hundred round at em that aint no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkkas nightmare trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq Cuba Tel Aviv
Shoot a nigga let him bleed fuck him shorty
Sucka nigga Ill never be dont give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it he deserve it he allow it
Whats a coward to a kamikaze He aint robbed a man
Aint predator or prey the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K aint no illusion no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you snoozing
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
Whadadang whadadadadadang
Listen to my Kimber 45 go bang
Bang bang Grindtime rap gang
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators we eyeballing all of yall lames
Let me fall off Im taking all of yall chains
All of yall watches and all of yall cars
Well who he talking to All of yall stars
All of yall rappers and producers and such
No homo promo homie you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa 83 you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners then you rolling with us
I know some dumb country niggas but them niggas aint me
Know they dress and look the part but them niggas aint G
I dont make dance music this is RAP
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on TV
And you know just how it go
We aint playing round with that bullshit
Nigga we aint let that shit go
When you come here you better come correct
This real G shit you gotta show respect
