I make big money buy big cars everybody know me  everybody know me 
I make big money buy big cars everybody know me  everybody know me 
I make big money buy big cars everybody know me  everybody know me 
I make big money buy big cars everybody know me  like Im a movie star 
Talking money getting Mike in new pair of Nikes
They said life was a bitch so I made her my wife
Im talking holy matrimony til some other fucking money
Them other boys is talking but I swear to God they phony
Fuckboys crazy nothing but 
Thats why my motto to this day is still Fuck you pay me
Any rap nigga acting like he want it with me
I swear to God Ill put his rappingass next to Biggie
I swear to God Ill put his rappingass next to Pac
Martin Luther King nigga certified by the block
Gold 54 riding all chrome big block
And the paint so wet Im in need of a mop
Black and yellow Chevy and its looking like a bumblebee
My partner came through in his Gellardo trying to humble me
I left came back Murcilago straight stunting G
When he seen me bending left nigga must have shit hisself
Gucci shirt Gucci jeans Gucci this Gucci that
Before I walk out the house everything gotta match
I ride through this bitch with a pocket full of money
I bet no nigga wont say nothing in front me
I went and bought a Benz and went and got a bike
Went and stopped by the paint shop then sprayed em cold white
Them 24inches man you know what it is
A nigga put em on so my shitll look big
Im a certified goon I be putting in work
I ride with the cannon cause I be doing hella dirt
Im the all black fitted with them allblack swatches
Pushing through the ghetto running from the paparazzi
All the hood niggas love me
The price on the coke nigga it look so lovely
Im a thug til I die
The club aint poppin if these bitches aint high
You know me
Trina Lil Kim Mariah
Rihanna even Ma
Got reps like singing cheques
A whip for each desire
They told me never to burn a bridge but I still keep a lighter
Aint met a former friend that proved he can compete with fire
And the paint so wet I gotta park my cars inside a dam
So fly my clothing line should be called the Mileage Plan
Metal inside my hand promise it aint no trying fam
That Marvel comic baby
What you mean 
That Iron Man
That Maserati body parked right there outside the lobby
POP to your body if you ever trying to try me
And the paint soaked cccandy ladies wanna lick my like a lolli
POP so my hobby is to sit behind a Jolly
Rancher look at my swagger my name is more than known
My garage the square footage of the Georgia Dome
Got imported stones always order chrome
Every other week my ride is gonna be exactly what I want it on
