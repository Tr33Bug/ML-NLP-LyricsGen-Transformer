When the Glock go blam blam  boom boom 
You die you dont get jiggy done youre done done

You die you dont get jiggy done youre done done
No theres no where to hide nowhere to run run
Grindtime motherfuckers here we come come
Rude boys if you feel me bust your gun
Usually the two would be
Beside me when I cruise the street
Blue your feet blue your seat
He who moves usually
Cool it be slow your roll
These niggas here dey cool with me
Rock the same shoes as me
Went to the same school as me
News would be
That these niggs I am tryin bring up on ya I just called to let ya know
You need to keep the K up on ya
Chop up all these credit cards
Career is all that laid up on ya
Skeet skeet
Move fast dont let them bitches lay up on ya
You know you really wanna be rollin instead
Hey there some niggas out here tryin to put a hole in yo head
Hey and sold ya for bread
Findin the life that we chose
Fast cars and this money
And these trifling hoes
Keep it real
Who wanna testa the goon or the pride
I keep it on my hips they call me onsly
Go and let a few fly
That made a few die
Some fell straight down others handglide
But none of them survive the rising of the tide
Drown in they own blood
Like pigs in the mud
Insert a few buds
Make sure he dont budge
Or toss or throw away
I dont hold a grudge

Cancer sniff hands just split
Scoop me in the jag and dip
Nag a bitch and flag a ship
Over there like a bag of chips
Whodini and genie out of a bikini thats a magic trick
Abra Kadabra I caught it all on camera
While I Amazing stamina
Far from the amateurs
Smokin lavender
Its slightly lighter than purple with a murk
My family matters but aint no Urkels in my circle of trust
Amongst eachother we trust each brother
Theres another mad situation
Sad situation
That every nigga I know is in a bad situation  Situation 
Im tired of waiting
Tired of being patient
Tired of waking up wondering if we gonna make it  gonna make it 
My hands are full
Im a Grindtime disciple
Right hand the Bible
Left hand the rifle  a rifle 
We freed us boys
And we both got degrees
I got mine from the schools
He got his from the street
Told me little nigga dont be like me like me  yes I didnt listen no disrespecting he
now back to me Its kind of sad
That thats all I want to be
A member of the game
Rappin and using slang
And even at career day
I said the same thang
Teacher shook her head
What a god damn shame
But really motherfucker
Who really should you blame
I am  a product of my environment
I am Workin towards retirement
Just another motherfucker
Trying to come up
Hand above the water
And Get head from your daughter
But who gives a fuck
Go on and sign me up
Big Slim in the building nigga throw ya Gz up
