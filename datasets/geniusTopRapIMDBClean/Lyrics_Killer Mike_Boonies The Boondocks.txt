Boonies  The Boondocks  Lyrics
Im waking up new shoes new socks
Two Glocks TV locked on Boondocks
I bought a brand new trey 8
With my old AK Today Was A Good Day
Okay okay front door outdoor drive slow headed to the liquor store
Mama say we need bread need butter
What Im seeing outside make me shudder  its the gutter 
It looks like I gotta move in with granddad
Schemin like Freeman grandad got a big pad
In Decatur home of the players
Where the rich niggas went when shit got crazy
Granddad say my generation lazy
I know we love the nigga so it dont faze me
Granddad got goddamn brother
And he act like Uncle Ruckus cause his attitude is fuck it
Yall niggas aint shit and never will be
Cornrows afros baggy clothes guilty
Thats how I vote for your ass in the trial
Even if you was innocent and didnt turn to smile
And as he dipped and he smashed on gas
Called me and gramps niggers said he hated our ass
Lost my whole last summer to a warrant
Got caught in a fishnet in Gwinnet County
60 days to the county no bounty
That cracker judge wipe a nigga like Bounty
Thats what I get for getting caught in the suburbs
like cuss words
Cop touch me Imma do something to him
You got a revolutionary mind Huey
You know a nigga straight wilding like Riley
I got a young wild nigga inside me
County jail county gates incite me
Cause everyday I said fuck you to the white man
Yall crackers never get another summer
Miss my car miss the crib miss the kids miss my mama
