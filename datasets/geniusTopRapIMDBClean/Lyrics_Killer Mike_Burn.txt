Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you and your folks love me and my folks like
Me and my folks love you and your folks
If there ever was folks
That ever ever was poor
It seems a nigga cant get a job but I can get arrested
Thought shit was changing with this Black president shit
My bitch got me fucked up goin to get tested
Cause while I was locked up she was livin reckless
Just another ordeal a real nigga gotta deal with
If you on the bottom right you gotta feel this
I know that youre frustrated and you want to kill shit
Stock pile your weapons cause that day just might come real quick
Burn this motherfucker down  yeah yeah yeah 
I will burn this motherfucker down  yeah yeah yeah 
You and your folks love me and my folks
Like me and my folks love you and your folks
Never was folks
They say the cop wrote a letter apologizing to Oscar
Guess they say Im wrong because I still say drop em
Police in the ghetto they is killin niggas daily
But when we get to bustin back they say that we crazy
Prisons overcrowded and schools is too
Cause they undereducate ya and got a place for you
Niggas go to prison the new age slavery
Now you know why they undereducate your baby
They say get a job you can Think  Grow Rich
But what are you to do when a dollar aint worth shit
And the jobs aint hirin and unemployment is gone
They gonna repo your car and foreclose your home
Me I suggest you get yourself a shotgun
So when they come to evict you can make em run
The banks got bailed out but we still suffering
So I got a gun cuz I done had enough ofem
They say love Jesus and listen to your pastor
But Jesus told the truth and the pastors a lying bastard
All he talk about is economic elevation
And all Jesus talked about was soul salvation
Jesus sat with the sick and He walked with the poor
And if he gave blood for our sins why we givin more
I got some gangster disciples at church with me tonight
With that 5 worth of gas and a match book of lights
