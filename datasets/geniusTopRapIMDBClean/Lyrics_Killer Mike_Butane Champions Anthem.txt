Butane  Champions Anthem  Lyrics
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Looking for the truth yeah its me
Everything Polo to the floor though even at the grocery store though
Picture perfect take a photo and take the pic you biting bitch
And sew and stitch a logo  Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Hit you with the quatro but my girl Mercedes
With the Audi say that Quatro was a two door so a typo
You can put on Killer Kill Fat Boy or just Michael
Call me what you will but still never call me rival
They will call you dead and I will call you gone
The Lord sweet Jesus will be weeping calling your ass home
If underground rap royalty is what Im meant to be
Then I will be the shit and you aint shit to me
We the ones we the winners we the champions
Champagne at the end of our campaign
Spit fire naked truth like the blue flame
Like the blue flame  Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Let me see your hands up if you do the same
Caught the plug and we bolt like Usain
More money more power more butane
Burn the motherfucker down down
Lifes a bitch so I mack on her immaculate
I dont wear no monkey watches Rolex is too accurate
My rhymes are actually accurate meaning I dont fiction in my diction
To the masses this perfection is performed through many practices
Like prostitutes to mattresses this shit just come naturally
Easy as Osamas bombers takin many casualties
Like Columbine Im down for mine Im here to kill the faculty
Killin them or killin me this is my soliloquy
Iller than the illest beat I will spit the illest shit
From right here to infinity Till I reach the dirt
I will search the earth endlessly looking for the illest see
Aint nobody lyrically as ill as me less EazyE
Come back from AIDS yes
Get a beat from ELP ghostwritten from my partner TIP
Cube and me and we time travel back to 95
Jumping in a 63 Impala playing Cuban Linx


Yo Mike they fucked up putting us together man
Yo Im a Grinch with a grin I will shit on your kids
Get a life get a grip get a hold on my dick bitch make a wish
Im a knife Im nothingthatsnicerthangettingslicedup
The switch the machete to feti Yeti to shyster
Icer gettingclosertoChrist ya might just
Find that the design of your life is an angel hair short of divine love
I stink I just stuck up a truck that said Brinks
Im a Sphinx snorted so much that my nose just broke off think
Im alone again clutching a loaded Glock soaked in chromium
Hoping that the thought police just dont bust in my home again
Life is tough youll get snuffed in the buff so dystopian
Ruff ruff hear the call of the copper mutts on the hunt
What the fuck this is not what my mother said Ill become
Starspangler wranglers got my hopes on the run
Getting closer now maybe our societys supposed to drown
Middle fingers up on the Titanic as its going down
