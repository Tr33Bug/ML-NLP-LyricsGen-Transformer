How comewith the thousands of black cops in Americayou aint never picked up the paper turned on the TV or the newsand seen white folk cryingbecause this black copshot my loved one in the back of the headcause he thought the cellphone was a gun How come you dont see thatYou think black cops ismore spiritual You think better qualified NahThey got enough sense to know that white folks aint going to tolerate itAnd the only reason they do to us what they do cause you tolerate it Ok Im not telling you dont chastise these young men But I aint see you chastise the police
Hahahaha Real bad guy shit
Hahaha Living like a villain
Never chilling heavy influence on your chillun
Yeah
I woke up this morning to a cop with a gun
Who told me that he looking for a nigga on the run
I thought for a second and I screwed my face
And asked them dirty pigs Why the fuck you in my place
He said Chill or we kill this is a warning
Then I told him Fuck you where is the warrant
Then they got to punching and kicking and macing
Then the whole situation went Larry Davis
Thinking bout my lady and thinking bout my baby
Thinking Is these motherfucking pigs going crazy
They wanna kill a nigga cause a nigga on his rap shit
Wanna leave me dead on a mattress Hampton
Im a Public Enemy because Im Cold Lampin
And I dont give a fuck about a party in the Hamptons
And I dont give a fuck about a motherfuckin Forbes list
Far as Im concerned thats a motherfuckin whores list
Motherfucker my dad was a cop
You dont think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one
Shake down take down disrespectingthebadgeassbitch
Back to the scene going wild in the bedroom
Grab the cops gun left him leaking with a head wound
Second cop shot but the bullet hit his partner
Shot him in the leg and he hit a main artery
Now the dirty cops looking at me
Talking bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee
Shit Im about to lose it so he gon have to prove it
All because the government hate rap music
Ive been labeled outlaw renegade villain
So was Martin King so the system had to kill him
A nigga with an attitude the world gotta feel him
Educated villain Intent on living
If I gotta kill a copper just to make it out the building
That motherfucker gettin left dead no feelings
Yelling Fuck him as I buck A 45 at his fillings
Trying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling
Hey bruh hey bruh Im in some trouble OK
I gotta be gon for a minute
Just call my old man
Its real deep shit man its fucked up I shot a cop


When I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling
And see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling
Im bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur
Before the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure
Like Jeriko One in the movie Strange Days
They want a nigga dead cause the things that I say
Might make the youth go and pick up an AK
Tell the government Fuck you no way
Like John Connor mama I be running everyday
Cause if I get caught its my life they terminate
Or stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay
All because a nigga wont submit and obey
Ill be an outlaw before I ever behave
And die a free man before I live like a slave
Nothing changes if they catch me today
Fuck the police is still all I gotta say
