The world fears a person with a dream
Because to have a dream gives you the ambition to wanna fulfill wanna that dream
And if you live your life fulling that dream youre gonna glow man Because theres a magnificence and a moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you cant achieve being a part of someone elses
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love  God I need you right now
You got famous fell off came back up damn thats insane
The same as you must be to be in this game
In this game you suffer hit strangers
Like Usain you bolt towards your dream
But haters speak disdain
Know my name and your name
But one things for sure man
Success is a sickness and there aint no cure man
Cure all is work hard and dont take no tours off
And even on off days you cant act like youre off
The payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros
Pitfalls of vanity pride and your ego
Just let go and live up to your full potential
What they say is hearsay its inconsequential
But naysayers say no but they are so simple
That they judge appearance and cant touch the mental
They are sheep they follow shepherds and man
Im Malcolm Im Martin I follow my plan
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love  God I need you right now
Do it for family but they dont believe
That dreams that you have can even be achieved
Get ready young sailor heres rough on these seas
Cant let no doubt or selfpity drown me
Its design when you sign and the vultures appear
And if you should succeed then its worse by the year
But the worse curse is failure it kills by the day
Watch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away
See my curse is Ill verse in these verses I verse
Will still be overlooked like a body in hearse
But this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth
This is no pen no paper just my dream on verse
The boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed
Told her if you cant tell I returned to Earth
Returned to the dirt returned to the essence
Cause no weapon formed that gives me a succession
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love  God I need you right now
I hope youve learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there
I hope youre chasing your dreams till youre exhausted till your feet hurt till your bones ache and till you get it youre hoping that you wont let it go
I want this to be more than good music to you I hope its inspiration for you
Chad Butler told me a few years back fight for your dream Michael like a drowning man fightin for air
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love  God I need you right now
