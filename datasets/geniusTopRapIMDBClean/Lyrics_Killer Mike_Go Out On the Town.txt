Niggas think Tera White back on deck
So respect my mind respect my grind
Walk right past dont respect dont mind
20 young broads like a cheer leading squad
All they wanna do is hang out with the stars
All they wanna do is get high like the moon
Take a nigga back to the hotel room
Sex drugs rap roll yeah we on it

Half of them them bitches aint got no tops
Half of them bitches park brand new drops
All them bitches got brand new wheels

Five stack for the song nigga Sug got a raise
How you know a nig got all that work

Why a nigga name so hot in the city
Cause he got threefour spots in the city

Smoke on the south side yall know the rest

No income no stone then it aint no watch
Is it in the front then it aint no Coupe
Didnt come from LA then it aint no Snoop
GA baby wanna smoke that brown
Your name aint Young then this aint your town
Nothing said pussy like 3 Rosay

Nothing said chip like Frito Lay
Keep playing that YoungMike go DJ
