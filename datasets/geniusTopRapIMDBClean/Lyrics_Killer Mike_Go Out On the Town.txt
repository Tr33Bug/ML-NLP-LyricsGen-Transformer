Black Tee black tee bottles in the air
Niggas think JBo and Meech back here
Niggas think Charles Black back on set
Niggas think Tera White back on deck
So respect my mind respect my grind
Walk right past dont respect dont mind
20 young broads like a cheer leading squad
All they wanna do is hang out with the stars
All they wanna do is get high like the moon
Take a nigga back to the hotel room
Sex drugs rap roll yeah we on it
LA tonight Miami in the morning
Know a nigga had to hit the King Of Diamonds
Know a nigga had to do the same shit again
Know my next show in the city of sin
Tip back home and we at it again

On a spaceship in another galaxy

Thirty car deep me need the whole valet
From everything new to the old Chevrolet
Half of them them bitches aint got no tops
Half of them bitches park brand new drops
All them bitches got brand new wheels

None of my niggas aint got no job
All of my niggas got 2 or 3 cars

Like telling OG she aint go no ass
Dont look now nigga Sugar on the stage
Five stack for the song nigga Sug got a raise
How you know a nig got all that work
Cause he got threefour XL shirts
Why a nigga name so hot in the city
Cause he got threefour spots in the city
Its soft on the east hard on the west
Smoke on the south side yall know the rest

No income no stone then it aint no watch
Is it in the front then it aint no Coupe
Didnt come from LA then it aint no Snoop
GA baby wanna smoke that brown
Your name aint Young then this aint your town
Nothing said pussy like 3 Rosay

Nothing said chip like Frito Lay
Keep playing that YoungMike go DJ
