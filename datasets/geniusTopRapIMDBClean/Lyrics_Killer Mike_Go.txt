Yeah still Killa Kill from the ville
With a flow so cold itll froze your nose
Something like the blow did back in the 90s
When I sold to the geeked out hoes
Must be the reason my flow so dope
Not dope meaning coke but dope meaning dope
Whats that Killa Yall niggas dont know So
Schools in session lets go
Dope shit get you 75 a brick that bullshit
Coke just gets you 24
Like my nigga told yall niggas back in 96
The difference between a 40 and a 46
And youre on my dick pause
Get up off the polo draws yall
Aint seen a rapper this cold
187 since above the law Ok
Nigga with an attitude like Eazy
Ren Dre and young OShea Ok

And he got a gun and hes dressed in black
Terrorist flow and Im ready to attack
Bombs over Baghdad yes Iraq and Iran and I am
The motherfucking man with the motherfucking plan
Sitting with the strap on my motherfucking lap

Homicide maniac brainiac
Sipping on a pint of yac
In a Cadillac

These many shows in these many days
Had these many bricks got these many paid
Thats 112 in these many ways
Indeed I say the opposite of living in need
I say is greed they say
I say no way fuck get money
Stack your hundreds alright ok Go
