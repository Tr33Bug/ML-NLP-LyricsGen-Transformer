God is still with me  Hes still with me  
Its hot like Haiti down in Hades
The false prophet say the Lord has forsaken us black babies
To make it off a island in Mercedes
We going sell it white as Michelangelos Christ
Babies need rice the baby need beans
To feed our babies beans we might have to flip a bean
I have sold my people dope yet provided them with hope
Sinner and saint yeah I did em both
Yea I sold a brick on a basketball court
And bought the uniforms for the basketball coach
Cant wash a way the blood so I put rings on my fingers
25 carats symbolize my redeemer
And my redeemers blood is capable of taking Chris Dudus
Making him a savior of others
My God will take a Saul fashion him a Paul
So only God can judge me and to hell with all yall
I lift my eyes upon the hills
From whence cometh my health
Only God can judge me
And nobody else
I beat these streets to make the Devil a lie
Marching at hell to the gangsters eye
I can feel the fire still everywhere
If heaven got a ghetto Im a make it there
The critics ask why Michael never blowed
Well truthfully I met the Devil at the crossroad
He offered me success in exchange for my soul
He stripped me of my riches broke me down like Job
First he took my car and then he took my house
But he couldnt take the Lords name out a nigga mouth
So then he took my friends and then he took my fame
And then he had my former friends dirty up my name
And while he was lyinglion I was Daniel in the den
Walking with an angel a testament to men
I can walk on water I defy the odds
The Devil give you fame but he cant defy my God
My God is amazing I dont need the Masons
I just need the junkies and the liars and the theives
I need the pimps prostitues and pushers out the streets
Thats where Im seeking God cuz thats where he found me
Thats where Im seeking God cuz thats where he found me
Amen
They tried to tell me Dont make these kind of records
Youre never going to be who youre suppossed to be
The record that people are most connected to is God in the Building 1
So I give you God in the Building 2
Im a keep doing what I am doing
Im a keep building my testament
My empire my legacy my way
Because I know God moves through me
God is in me at all given times
So some of you all can shortcut take whatever road you like to
I prefer the high road  high road
