Its hot like Hell in the south
It feel like we in the devil mouth in the south
So white boys tripping cause we iced out
Cool as a cucumber hopping out
A 73 Impala with the brains blowed out
Let the robbers follow
Swear to God fuck nigga get your brain blowed out
Your baby momma followed or your man shot down
Im from Martin Luther King respect it its holy ground
Whod have thought a nigga out a shotgun house
Would ever drive a car with a angel that bow
Im the shit cause I come from the bowels
The guts of the city aint a nigga fucking with me
Young player from the South tell stories like Biggie
Take the Kings English paint pictures so vivid
That the listener will swear to God they lived it
If that aint God in motion nigga tell me what is it
The church ladies weep when they hear your man speak
They say they see God in me but Im in the streets
They ask me why Im rapping tell me Im called to preach
I smile I kiss em on they honey brown cheeks
I tell em God bless em and they concern for me
But you can never walk on water if you still fear the sea
If Jesus came back Mother where you think hed be
Probably in these streets with me
Peace
Came out the valley of the shadow of death
Judas still got the knife in my back
Devils trying to give a G life for crack
Haters mad cause I baptized my laugh
Keep a Jesus piece to protect myself
If heaven got a ghetto you can bet Ill be there
God is with me
God is in me
God is in me
To get to Heaven I will raise Hell
But before I be a servant in white heaven I will rule in a black hell
See the leader jumping out a black SL
On the block like Yes yeah the truth here
Living reckless for a necklace and big chain
The wages of sin is death not the chain gang
Touch my chain I bang bang bang
Leader of the Grind Time Rap Gang mang
We a squadron of Gods marksmen
Greek heroes we the new Titans
Young Achilles nigga I will kill these niggas
No homo I just dont feel these niggas
Laid back seeing panoramic views
Its a angelic view the sky so blue
Similar to my diamonds and they hue
I pray my success is a torment to you
God MC boy ex dboy
Only thing real in a room full of decoys
Angel wings got a nigga flying higher
I hope my success burn you like hellfire
I hope seeing me whip cars dressed fresh
Torments your ass like a man possessed
Be blessed
Amen
