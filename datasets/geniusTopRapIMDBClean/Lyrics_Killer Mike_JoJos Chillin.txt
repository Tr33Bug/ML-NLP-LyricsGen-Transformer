My man JoJo got caught on fed photo
So he gotta get out of Atlanta hit SoHo
Baby mama say he being selfish he like So ho
Then he picked up the cell phone called his old ho
She took him to the airport hit him with some bread
Parked in the deck then hit him with some head
Hit the counter with the fake ID and the ticket
The old man little suspicious but he hit him with a fifty
Hit him with a hundred hit him with the Shhh
The old man stamped the ticket and he went like Shhh
Then he hit him with the smile and he hit him with the wink
And JoJo hit the bathroom JoJo hit the sink
Cold water had to splash on the face
His iPod pumping Snoop Murder was the Case
Oh shit looked to his left Ghostface
Peace God peace God wheres Shallah Rae
Think he had show down in MIA today
Ghost told him Nice Wallies then went out on his way
Now its back to reality reality say
Still gotta make it to that side of the gate
He moves out the bathroom quickly with haste
And its a long line its a while before the gates
And its an old lady giving Jo the evil eye
Mad cause she see him cutting spaces in line
JoJos chillin
Back in line JoJo spot Ivy
Girl from the hood that he knew from NYC
TSA agent so she cleared him on the ID
Before he go to Xray he taking off his shades
Taking off his jacket arm out the sleeve
Reached in his pocket oh shit got weed
He done made it this far whats Jo to do
So he stuffed it in his pocket and he walked right through
He walked right through  He walked right through
Then the TSA agent say She pointing at you
The old lady that had seen Jo cut line
Went to a officer and tried to drop dime
But Ivy wasnt having that stepped to the copper
Told him that the old ladys ID wasnt proper
Now the old lady getting treated like a terrorist
Cop got his hand where her grey pubic hair it is
After this though she gonna have to see a therapist
JoJo found the situation hilarious
Threw the old lady deuces heading to the train
Concourse A headed to his plane
Arrived on time they called the first class
Upgrade ticket took a little more cash
Jos relieved hes almost free
Cant wait to land in the NYC


JoJos chillin
Seat belts on seat back up
Triple shot of Seagrams in JoJos cup
A little too much he felt the stewardess up
She said Stop sir he looks like What
Gave a big tip then he headed to the bathroom
When he got there told her Hey it has room
Turned the bathroom into a smashroom
She was hitting lines he was hitting from behind
Look up in the mirror saw Ghost another time
Peace God pardon God I aint see ya Wis
Lean toward the mirror cause I gotta talk biz
Ghostface told him Only twenty to LaGuardia
When you get there a car take you to Astoria
You dont want the alphabet boys on call
So tell the stewardess to make a wheelchair call
Wheelchair came deboard plane
JoJo couple old folks and they canes
Exiting the door he seen a dog walking slow
Couldnt dump the weed nowhere to go
Turns out the dog sniffed out that blow
Good thing the stewardess a cokehead ho
Cause they bumrushed the bitch
And threw her ass to the flo
Jo told the wheelchair boy Lets go
And Jo got away thats how the story go
JoJos chillin
