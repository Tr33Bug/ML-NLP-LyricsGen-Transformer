Im an ungodly figure
When in the company of heart    niggas    on the water
I smoke a river
Apocalyptic creature
Stay    stay    stay   
Murder fanatic killer fantastic
with a half of    and an automatic
as a smelly
Just in case I meet with static
When I deliver    tragic
Your mothers screaming at limousine
Followed by some    traffic
Heres the reason for my murder tactics
killer and a fuckin rapper
line missing 
Im a strong    robbery and kidnapper
Im a car jacker
Im a   
Im a slumdog for life not a fuckin actor
line missing 
Im the monster Im your sick and twisted monster x4
Im the hate in the dark   of heartless men depraved of love   
Im unwanted children
Doped up on Ritalin by age ten and sixteen a fiend
and a bottle of gin
Im the solo women thats been betrayed by men
That    nigga looking to deceive her again
Earn her trust again then I lost again
Im diggin   
I spit it for Bloods Crips and Mexicans
I spit for disciples and   
This sick soundtrack to robbing and looting
Neighborhood shootings murder and booze  dance 
with your fury and rage
For my lost generation and  
line missing 
Im the monster Im your sick and twisted monster x8
You better watch out for me
