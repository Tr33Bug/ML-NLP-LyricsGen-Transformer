A fat fly boy know Im streamed aero
I just squoze up out the Camero
Im looking fly how fly Im a sparrow
Its real G ho to the bone marrow
I get you back today and see your ass tomarrow
I put the bullet through your tendons and your marrow
I heard your mama saying naw take me Lord
You rap good Put a bullet through your vocal chords
Its right nigga get it on Im a real G
You sweet Kool Aid straight HiC
When Im high I swear I could see the GOD
Heaven in the mirror Im just seeing me
Its God in the buiding niggas better know that
A righteous rapper yeah hey I know crack
I sat right in front  trapped in front of your house
I had scholarships still went to Moorehouse
I know pyrex I know the good cook
An educated villain I can  a good book
A good book a good magazine clipped on
I hit your house have your girl get her strip on
I get your Benz homie then I get the strip on
Im on the Martin Luther King you know strip homes
You say you wanna find me Im at Thai Land
Tonight Im with the Gs catch me in the blue flame
