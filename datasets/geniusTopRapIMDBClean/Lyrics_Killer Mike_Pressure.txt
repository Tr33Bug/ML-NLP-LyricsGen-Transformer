Who are you
You dont know
Dont tell me Negro
Thats nothing
What were you before the white man named you a Negro
What was your name
It couldnt have been Smith or Jones or Bush or Powell
That wasnt your name
They dont have those kind of names where you and I came from
No what was your name
And why dont you now know what your name was then
Where was your history
How did a man wipe out your history
How did the man what did the man do to make you as dumb as you are right now
Motherfuckas I just bought some new chuckas
The old ones bloodied up from stomping out mo suckas
Big bad Killa
Big black gorilla
King Kong on you monkey ass niggas
Step and fetch funky ass flunky ass niggas
Dick in the booty for your Massa ass niggas
I dont fear no man
Not Bush not Clinton not Osama
Ask your Uncle Thomas how he choose Massa over Obama
You could have a million dollars and a white collar
Liberation costs more then a damn dollar
It costs what Christ gave
King gave
X gave
A billion dollars dont make you an exslave
Nigga With an Attitude since fifth grade
I never behave
Rather be a dead man than a live slave
We can say what we like
Put the pressure on em
Ice Cube and Killer Mike
Put the pressure on em
I can do what I want
Put the pressure on em
But god dammit Im gonna
Put the pressure on em
Put the pressure on em
Homie put the pressure on em
Put the pressure on em
Homie put the pressure on em
Put the pressure on em
Homie put the pressure on em
Cause pressure bust pipes
Pressure bust pipes
Im here to deprogram you
Dont forget what they made your great grandmama do
What they made your great granddaddy do
Without a dollar or a penny or a thank you
The same motherfuckers wanna gank you
Cause they hate you and the pussy that you came through
Can anybody tell me that it aint true
That these motherfuckers aint out to hurt you
Theyll lock you up beat you up and work you
Put your life on a thirty year curfew
Little cell little window for you to look through
Even gotta a little chair where he can cook you
Nigga please Imma be in the breeze
Beat em up with my plan like the Japanese
Now Im overseas
And Im trapping these
Thank God I didnt have to cock and squeeze
Black politicians stop bullshitting
And you funky black preachers with your pulpit
Our kings had dreams and a big vision
All you give us is government and religion
Is you a freedom fighter or a stool pigeon
Is you down for your people in the big mission
Or you a dirty nigga working for a fucking Clinton
Or you dirty nigga working for a fucking Bush
Another message for the politicians
Better get the police off our ass quickly
If another old lady die in this city
Swear to god we will burn down the fucking city
Big schemes
Big dreams
Yeah Im with it folk
But twenty years of selling dope just a fucking joke
And so what you the man with that white man
Probation got your answering to a white man
God dammit the Red Dogs and Ramparts running rampant
These pigs going ham sammich
In New York killed a young brother
In Atlanta killed a grandmother
And politicians say save the planet
Fuck that save us dammit
From the black pigs helped em kill Sean Bell
I hope its five degrees hotter for your ass in hell
Race traitin bastard you less than trash
I hope when Jesus come back he murder your ass
So you burn in hell til you turn white ash
To the one that say sorry tell em kiss our ass
We dont need em motherfucker you can keep it for yourself
I wish you nothing but pain and bad health
I hope luck run away from you and wealth
No honor in life no honor in death
You a Judas to us nigga kill yourself
No Negro leaders have fought for civil rights
They have begged for civil rights
They have begged the white man for civil rights
They have begged the white man for freedom
And anytime you beg another man to set you free
You will never be free
Freedom is something you have to do for yourselves
And until the American Negro lets the white man know
That we are really really ready and willing to pay the price that is necessary for freedom
Our people will always be walking around and second class citizens or what you call twentieth century slaves
What price are you talking about sir 
The price of freedom is death
