RAP Music Lyrics
Ive never really had a religious experience in a religious place Closest Ive ever come to seeing or feeling God is listening to rap music Rap music is my religion Amen
What I say might save a life what I speak might save the street
I aint got no instruments but I got my hands and feet
Hands gonna clap and feet gonna tap ElP beats to make that snap
And I ride em with my raps and they all tight as my naps
And my naps is all I got and this beautiful ebony skin
And the music in my heart and the words put in the wind
And the words put in the wind comin back like a boomerang
When I take this microphone point it at the crowd they start to sing
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
Its that Robert Johnson that Muddy Waters
That James Brown Augusta Georgia
That Ray Charles that Stevie Wonder
That Mayfield that Superfly
That Willie Hutch and that Mack
Its that blues man that soul man
That OutKast that Southernplayalisticadillac
Its that Jimi Hendrix that George Clinton
I feel it in my bones
Aretha Franklin that Shirley Caesar
Miss Nina Simone
That Sade that Love is King
That Coltrane that Love Supreme
That Miles Davis Bitches Brew
That beeeyotch said by Playboy Too
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
I got things to do before I meet that glory in the sky
And my baby girl bday six months away she gonna be five
So I pray to the Lord he spare me and I make it by and by
And I help souls stay out of Hell with what I testify
And maybe when I grab that microphone and never lie
Thatll merit that he spare me I wont have to feel that fire
So Killa Kill gonna spit that real on each and every song
And each and every poem until the good lord call me home gone
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
This is jazz this is funk this is soul this is gospel
This is sanctified sick this is player Pentecostal
This is church front pew amen pulpit
What my people needin The opposite of bullshit
