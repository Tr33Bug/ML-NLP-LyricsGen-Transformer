Big is dead Pac is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched Im Killer Mike Im Killer Mike Im Killer Mike Im Killer Mike
Rap is dead rock is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
Fuck rap raps near death bloated and sick
Too many niggas still ride Big and Pacs dick
Fuck that next year they more deader
And I write more rhymes more deadly and more better
Then the last sick and disturbed verse I wrote
And sell it to tough teenage boys to quote
Some music to madness let the anger kill the pain and the sadness
Fuck the fag shit keep it Killer with the rap shit
Hard rock when you rock shit back to the block freestyle pop lock shit
Back to the basics with the fuck a cop shit
Rock pussies rap on some pop shit sing like they rap
Soft and frail these spirits didnt have the heart to smell
This is no pain and its high octane
A bad brain on Kobain
Lennon is dead Kurt is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched Killer Mike whos the man Killer Mike whos the man
Rap is dead rock is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched Killer Mike whos the man Killer Mike whos the man
God damnit rappers chitter chattar on any subject matter
But really does the subject really matter
Pass the guns and blood splatter does anything fuckin matter
Pass Cristal pissed off fuckin right Im pissed off
And you a pistol yo why the fuck do critics get off
Now wait a second dont like what Im saying
Make a record and Ill be glad when
My music gets mad again new school Ice Cube
Fuck you Killer Mike Yeah fuck you too
No this aint yo mamas music
Its a drug if you like it please abuse it
Musical methamphetamine for teens
Nightmares comin crushing ya fuckin dreams ultrashock
Rap rock bringin the bars back to rock and hiphop
Spit it venom nonstop
Big is dead Pac is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched HipHop is Killer Mike HipHop is Killer Mike
Rap is dead rock is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched HipHop is Killer Mike HipHop is Killer Mike
Knew it was a bad day when I woke up
NWAs gone and Rage broke up
Dead Prez aint move the units that they shouldve
Rappers on top dont spit like they couldve
I pledge allegiance to the hard core
How I give it to you hard raw
Ay a beautiful site to be seen
Theres a mosh pit packed with wild teens
Hangin onto every word that we spit
Ready to rip rock and tear shit
Selfpitys fuckin up my music man
Whine like a bitch or stand and be a man
Theres Black Sabbath Im smoking in a Zeppelin
Pumpin Metallica hand on my weapon
Fuck you and the bed yo bitch slept in
KillerKill keeps it real hardcore is what Im reppin
Big is dead Pac is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched I run shit Killer Mike I run shit Killer Mike
Lennon is dead Kurt is dead
My musics dead and yall just scared
scratched I run shit Killer Mike I run shit Killer Mike
Rap is dead Killer Mike
