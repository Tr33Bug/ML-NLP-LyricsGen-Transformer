Raps poetic  In justice LyricsIn December the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in Elonis v US the latest  and highest level  in a disturbingly long line of cases in which rap lyrics have been used as evidence in criminal trials
Elonis dates to 2010 when 27yearold Anthony Elonis began posting violent messages to Facebook often in rap lyric form that were directed at his estranged wife and a female law enforcement officer Although he included caveats like Art is about pushing limits he nevertheless was charged with multiple counts of communicating threats
At trial Elonis insisted that he merely was writing fictitious lyrics that were consistent with the conventions of rap music at one point singling out rapper Eminem  himself wellknown for hurling lyrical threats at his exwifeas one of his influences The jury didnt buy it Elonis was found guilty and sentenced to 44 months in prison
The Supreme Court took his case to settle a fairly narrow legal question involving true threats jurisprudence But in choosing Elonis the justices have stumbled into a national debate about the expanding prosecution of rap music which raises major concerns about the role of art and free speech in the justice system as well as the commonlyheld view that hiphop culture is a threat to society
Within the legal system this view is becoming increasingly apparent As recent research has revealed rap lyrics have been introduced as evidence of a defendants criminal behavior in hundreds of cases nationwide frequently leading to convictions that are based on prosecutors blatant mischaracterizations of the genre Ignoring many of the elements that signal rap as form of artistic expression such as rappers use of stage names or their frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole prosecutors will present rap as literal autobiography In effect they ask jurors to suspend the distinction between author and narrator reality and fiction to secure guilty verdicts
Earlier this year for instance the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Vonte Skinner who in 2008 was found guilty of attempted murder based largely on prosecutors use of his violent rap lyrics as evidence In their opinion the justices wrote that Skinners highly prejudicial lyrics should have been excluded because they risked poisoning the jury
In most other cases however  including one heard by the Nevada Supreme Court in 2013  the outcome is very different Lyrics generally are permitted as evidence regardless of their prejudicial impact
No other fictional form  musical literary or cinematic  is used this way in the courts a concerning double standard that research suggests is rooted at least in part in stereotypes about the people of color primarily associated with rap music as well as the misconception that hiphop and the artists behind it are dangerous
In fact the history of hiphop tells a very different story In its formative years for example it was explicitly conceived by many as an alternative to the violent gang culture that consumed cities like New York Since then it has offered countless young men and women opportunities to escape the poverty and violence in Americas urban centers As rapper Ice T once put it If I hadnt had a chance to rap Id either be dead or in jail
It is true that hiphop has been scarred by violence Tupac Shakur and the Notorious BIG for example two of raps most important and influential artists were killed in the prime of their careers But for each instance of violence there are countless examples of lives saved or made stronger Trust us on this The kids spending hours per day writing rap songs arent a threat to society they are often trying to escape the threats from society
That story of hiphop has been frustratingly difficult to tell especially when the murder of Jordan Davis can be framed in the media as the loud rap music case or Michael Browns association with rap music becomes part of a tragic story line that has far more to do with inequality police brutality and racial discrimination
These problems are the true threats facing America today not hiphop Lets hope the justices on the Supreme Court understand that too
