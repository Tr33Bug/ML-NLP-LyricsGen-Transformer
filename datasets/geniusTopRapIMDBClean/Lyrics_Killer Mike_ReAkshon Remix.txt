ReAkshon  Remix  Lyrics
Aye aye Bun who did this man
So you mean you got TIP Killer Mike Lil Jon and Bun B
So thats the King of the South the Underground King
The King of Crunk and King Kong all on the same song
Haha aye Jon they aint ready
We taking it on back to the trap my nigga
I got them bows on my lac  swervin on these niggas
I got the ho up in the back  bumpin niggas figgaz
I got the weed in my sack  smokin on that killa
In the hood where Im at  trappin with my niggas
I got the NEW NEW  Killa KKKKilla Killa 
NEW NEW  KKKKilla Killa 
NEW NEW  KKKKilla Killa 
NEW NEW  Niggas dont wanna touch the Killa 
Man we been throwin raps for too long
Aye whatchu wanna do homes
Im finna pull this heat and have you fetal like a newborn
TIP Mike and Bun B  scared whatchu better be
We was just the kings now we heads of a legacy
Leaders of the new south fake niggas move out
He talkin loud and proud but he scared with a tool out
Im the nigga they be askin what we gon do bout
Mike told me fuck them niggas bring that New New out
Tank the Chevy buy the Caddie bring the 22s out
Put the city back on top just seperate the fools now
We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now
Cant keep playin both sides of the fence you got to choose now
The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake
If ya got it on ya chest shawty say it to my face
When ya hold ya nuts in hatred ya only rushin til ya wait
And we gon show them people what it really is in the A
Straight from Atlanta the hog handler
Grown folk trap scrambler
Knee deep means to get them Gs to my manager
My mack10 made for action bodybaggin and throat braggin
Ill drag em threw the river like a bad yellow nigga
Im mashin with pops fashion bustin first no questions askin
You gon off that waterboat and thinkin you can hold me
Im King Kong on every track no capsule can hold me
Ill THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP when I BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP
Its woofers tweeters speakers geekers ALL IN YO TRUNK
My dad aint raise no fag my mom aint had no punk
We dont hesitate or negotiate we pop Chevy trunks
From the home of CocaCola Im not referrin to soda
Imma grind til I shine or die going for mine
SIG Sauer by my side swervin and blowin pine
Dont be a victim to a Killer be a father to ya son
This ReAkshon Killa Kill TIP and Bun
Bitch Im coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk
Cuz Id rather die like a man than survive like a punk
Im no coward Im dropowered you gettin TwinTowered
Devoured  its a shitstorm and you bout to get showered
From Broward county to Harris Pasadena to Paris
I embarrass niggas on chrome wheels as big as the ferris
Cuz there is now way now how  I stay lowkey lowbrow
In that black on black on black in the lac cuz Im so wild
I get drunk off that Ill be high off this
I might pop one of those it dont matter my nigga  I dont miss
They put me hot on list where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners when they say and get roasted
And the prayer get toasted cuz I keep the flame on
The face for the game on  leave a stain on anything I puts my name on
Disrespect and the techll peck a player like Woody
Cuz caint nuttin keep a trill nigga down ask Khujo Goodie
All I gotta say is sucker emcees better run
The debate is now whos the greatest emcee
TIP Killer Mike or Bun
We are not doing this for fun  this is a bloodsport
Emcees are dying mothers are crying
And wackass niggas will go out trying
It is officially a new day I am officially the new mouth
AND THESE ARE THE EMCEES OF THE NEW SOUTH
