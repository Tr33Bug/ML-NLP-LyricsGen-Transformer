Hut one Hut two two

Holla killer kill for the villa Big Mike Big Mike
Get low get low or get right right
Holla killer kill for the villa Big Mike Big Mike
I know these streets bout tired of this weak shit
Your style been ran through like a freak bitch
The pussy club got you angered with your frequent
Ed Hardy ass nigga and ya sequins
Might as well shop at Victorias Secret
Have em gift wrap you some I love Pink shit
Rent due and yall niggas delinquent
You better find another nigga to link with
Cause the nigga you link with is a lie fool
I used to bully that monkey nigga in high school
Sit at the lunch table steal and eat his damn food
The pretty girls they say Michael a damn fool
I get my work on and get my flirt on
I say fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em
I say fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em
Nigga how its gonna bet bigger
With that nigga the BIG and the microphone killer
Jack The Ripper all thriller no filler
Less Im filling your broad up with nigga
I drill her while you finger prick her
That means she barely feel a thang when you hit her
Boy drop this thangs like a sabretooth tigger or tiger
The prehistoric rap writer
And Im a keep my foot on the neck on all these nonrhyming sack biters
The golden arm Johnny Unitas rap titan
Boy your life is like Sterling silver it needs a little shining
Steadily styling on you suckas like a hairdo
Beauty parlor rappingass niggas we say how dare you
I cant stand you
You making the game soft like a bed do
Im blowing this bitch down like Im Hurricane Andrew
Its Dungeon Family and my mans too
Grind TimeGrand Hustle fucker we will drag you
Im the product of the age of narcotta
Which means Im dope like the pills you swallow
Down by law I lead dont follow
Grind time grand hustle live for the gualla
I remain in the game to break lames off
Some of them sensitive and some too soft
The hood been forced to fuck with yall by default
But now the truth here the bullshit cuts off
This is real homie no fake no filler
One hundred percent grade A killer
Something like the bitch that I keep in Villa Rica
But Ima be quiet cause they might Mike Vick ya
Might catch Mike with a light Mike Vicka
Some purple kush thatll get me high like a missile
Smoking one deep homie cause I dont fuck with you
Sincerely from the hustle and grind time official
Lets go lets go
Grand hustle
Money on our mind
And we aint going down sucker
And Grind time Hut two and Grand Hustle
Send them here got them looking like the king bankhead sucker
