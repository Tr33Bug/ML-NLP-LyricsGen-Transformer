I know these streets bout tired of this weak shit
Your style been ran through like a freak bitch
The pussy club got you angered with your frequent
Ed Hardy ass nigga and ya sequins
Might as well shop at Victoria Secret
Have em gift wrap you some I love Pink shit
Rap due and yall niggas delinquent
You better find another nigga to link with
Cause the nigga you link with is a lie fool
I used to bully that monkey nigga in high school
Sit at the lunch table steal and eat his damn food
The pretty girls they say Michael a damn fool
I get my work on and get my flirt on
I say fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em
I say fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em
Im the product of the age of narcotics
That means Im dope like the pills you swallow
Down by law I lead dont follow
Grind time grand hustling for gualla
I remain in the game to break lames off
Some of them sensitive and some too soft
The hood been forced to fuck with yall by default
But now the truth here the bullshit cuts off
This is real homie no fake no filler
One hundred percent grade A killer
Something like the bitch that I keep in Villa Rica
But Ima be quiet cause they might Mike Vick ya
Might catch Mike with a light Mike Vicka
Some purple kush thatll get me high like a missile
Smoking one deep homie cause I dont fuck with you
Sincerely from the hustle and grind time official


Lets go lets go
Grand hustle
Money on our mind
And we aint going down sucker
And Grind time Hut two and Grand Hustle
Send them here got them looking like the king bankhead sucker
