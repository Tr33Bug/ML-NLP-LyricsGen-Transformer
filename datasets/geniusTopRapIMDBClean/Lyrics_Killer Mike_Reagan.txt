Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands That noconcessions policy remains in force in spite of the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments we did not repeat did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages nor will we
The ballot or the bullet some freedom or some bullshit
Will we ever do it big or just keep settlin for lil shit
We brag on having bread but none of us are bakers
We all talk having greens but none of us own acres
If none of us own acres and none of us grow wheat
Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat
So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding
Cause all we seem to give them is some ballin and some dancin
And some talkin about our car and imaginary mansions
We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting
Handin children death and pretendin its excitin
We are advertisements for agony and pain
We exploit the youth we tell them to join a gang
We tell them dope stories introduce them to the game
Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine
In the 80s when them bricks came on military planes
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages My heart and my best intentions still tell me thats true but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not
The end of the Reagan Era Im like leven twelve or
Old enough to understand that shitd changed forever
They declared a war on drugs like a war on terror
But what it really did was let the police terrorize whoever
But mostly black boys but they would call us niggers
And lay us on our belly while they fingers on they triggers
They boots was on our head they dogs was on our crotches
And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches
And they would take our drugs and moneys as they pick our pockets
I guess that thats the privilege of policin for some profits
But thanks to Reaganomics prison turned to profits
Cause free labors the cornerstone of US economics
Cause slavery was abolished unless you are in prison
You think I am bullshittin then read the 13th Amendment
Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits
Thats why they givin drug offenders time in double digits
Ronald Reagan was a actor not at all a factor
Just an employee of the countrys real masters
Just like the Bushes Clinton and Obama
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
If you dont believe the theory then argue with this logic
Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi
We invaded sovereign soil going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Same as in Iraq and Afghanistan
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
They only love the rich and how they loathe the poor
If I say any more they might be at my door
Shh  Who the fuck is that staring in my window
Doing that surveillance on Mr Michael Render
Im dropping off the grid before they pump the lead
I leave you with four words Im glad Reagan dead
Ronald Wilson Reagan
Ronald Wilson Reagan
Ronald  6  Wilson  6  Reagan  6 
Ronald  6  Wilson  6  Reagan  666
