Im going on tour and Im gonna show anybody out there that thinks for one second that maybe Im second guessing myself that I am the greatest of all time forever and ever One surprise one surprise  shhhh Wooo Im back
To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
You better have a Christopher word game witty
You better have a dance game similar to Diddy
Or play bball above the rim like Smitty
Josh Chris Bosh Pau Gasol
Or any other nigga that ball and tall
I used to sell it white as Paul Wall
Gave my young boi three of them in the mall
And he gon bring me 75K back tomorrow
You know what Bigga bout you know what Bigga do
Ice water in my veins heart pumpin igloo
Im familiar wit the money so  who the fuck is you
What the fuck you do Where the fuck you from Who you knowing
Somebody get this nigga I dont know him
And Im bout to jet off on his ass like a Boeing
Going going going gone  song
You dont like the prestige that I have in life You dont like the notoriety You detest the fact that I got more cars than most of you have friends I got a big house on the big side of town  I got life pretty much the way I want it
To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
Your mindstate gotta be as wicked as Fiddy
Cant love life suckling on mamas titty
Cause life is a bitch and a bitch aint with it
You gotta have faith livin life on Biggie
Im ready to die for the money who is with me
Life after death hey this must be hell
I asked for six figures God gave back seven
Im on my way to heaven in a Porsche 911
Buried in my car Im surrounded by a harem
Surrounded by my brethren my funeral is legend
Buried like a pharaoh with my jewelery in the desert
The government will hate me like Jesus but fuck em
I did it for the grind I did it for the hustle
I did it for the people on the bottom in the struggle
I did it for my comrades did it cause I love em
Custom made brother  Wooo And I mean custom made From the alligators to the Oleg Cassini right here Ric Flair Theres only one And I dont care if its Tokyo Japan Greensboro Richmond Charlotte North Carolina Asheville Atlanta Georgia Charlotte LA  Im the man thats makin it possible
To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
You gotta politic your situations like Clinton
If you chase power you aint gotta chase women
So take some advice take cash over ass
When you get money you aint gotta take shit
So long as you broke she aint gotta take dick
Capiche
Now you know what motivate your beetch

Pay the mortgage or the pussy up for lease
Capiche
Church ladies goin gaga for the Gucci  Yah
