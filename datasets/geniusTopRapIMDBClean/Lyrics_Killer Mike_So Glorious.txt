Man my story is so glorious
You know I started off so notorious
I will die a legend like Notorious
My story is so glorious
Grind grind grind grind grind shine
My story is so glorious
Fat fly boy young Notorious
Notorious for move makin
I got a pistol for a pig cook bacon
Im a young G
Im a EV educated villain
Who fuckin with me
Im a book reader
Im a gang leader
Triple bang and salute when the gang see him
Im in position that these other rappers envy
They major broke and I get rich indie
Yeah I said I GetRichIND
Trill definition of that GRIND
God looked out because my life changed
It werent for rap Id have a job of sell cocaine
They say I celebrate the pusher thats profane
I say to feed my babies yall Ill do anything
Ill sell H Ill sell C
Because Malik Aniyah Pony Mike have gotta eat
And I refuse cause I promised I would not lose
Until Im gone Imma give these sucka niggas blues
Here come the blues nigga
Young Muddy Waters
In the club sweating hot with your Slutty daughters
Young 8Ball on my way to legendary
Even Pun will have to point and say That niggas very heavy
To son me you gon have to get a Bun B
Because the Pimp C in me wont let you pump me
Aye watch your mouth nigga
Im from the South nigga
And you might smell my cologne at your house nigga
Money money money
Seems thats all that Im about nigga
I got a bad queen
She want a lot of things
And she gon have it all
Tear down the mall
Good riddance to my exbitches I holla yall

I see you and your new nigga at my show
He love Pledge 2 he love song 4
I love the West side I love Zone 4
Dixie Hills Simpson Road thats what I do it for
Martin Luther King Bankhead and Ashby
But now its Lowery
Thats where the loud be
And everywhere I be thats where the crowd be
But Im a street nigga partner dont crowd me
And dont push me and dont shush me
Cause Im the opposite of whatever is pussy
Ass nigga you aint talking cash nigga
Then its lost in translation
Get up out my face and
Go to the room where the sucka niggas sit
Sit around and talk some of that sucka nigga shit
The way yall cackling    is like yall sucking niggas dick
No homo promo but yall suckas acting like a bitch
I fell off and came up again I am 50 Cent
I know you dont love me
Im black and Im ugly
But I got money so these fly bitches fuck me
And I got hits now so you haters cant duck me
My life has turned to magic this is David Copperfield
The pretty women hug me and beg for me to cop a feel
Them crackas call a nigga they want me to cop a deal
But I dont talk 360 unless we talking bout a mil
If they talking major money we can talk and thats what up
If they aint talking bout that then I remain indie as fuck
They say Im underrated and they sorry for my loss
And I reply Im sorry that yall broke and got a boss
On Pledge 1 I told the world what Im about to do
The blind couldnt see it so I showed em Pledge 2
God In the Building had to help em gain focus
Pledge 3 is here I give you the magnum opus
