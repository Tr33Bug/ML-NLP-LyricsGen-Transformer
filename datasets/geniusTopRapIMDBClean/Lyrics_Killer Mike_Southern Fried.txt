Moet Rolex Big Benz no flex
Wedding ring on finger I married a Trina
Pretty as a singer Fine as a stripper
When we in the strip club strippers try to tip her
I dont want no dance ho get up off my zipper
You aint try to rip me if you aint try to rip her
We like Bun and Pimp bitch see we is a duo
This that Ball and G shit we dont need no new ho
See Ive got a suave mouth which purchases my suave house
This that 2Live Crew Shit I rap a lot about new shit
This that country rap tune southern fried funky shit
I am the antithesis or opposite of monkey shit
And thats some education for yall thinking we unlearned
Cause I often play that Gucci crew and walk around with perms
And we bought them 95 Impalas paint them bitches orange
We gangstars like Preem and Guru cause respect was hard to earn
