I just need someone to help me stay awake
Because evidently Killer Mike has gone to sleep
DJ Paul 
TWhy you did it you heard 
Niggas talk to me about that wokeass shit
Same niggas walkin on some brokeass shit
You see your words aint worth no money I aint spoke back bitch
All of you niggas hang together on some Brokeback shit
Really yall niggas some hoes on some hoass shit
Look at me and take a picture on some Kodak shit
What you see is a G and you envy that shit
I can see it in your eyes like an envious bitch
Im in rooms with politicians talking business and shit
Hear you come with your opinion aint solicit that shit
Lola hit up DJ Paul went to Memphis and shit
Pause rest in peace to Lord Infamous bitch
Im so underground I move like Pimp C in this bitch
I bob and weave and bust on beats like Bun B in this bitch
Im feeling like Im Tony Draper Ball and G in this bitch
On fire like Hot Boy Juvi four hundred degrees in this bitch
All that chatter that you chatter bout my matter just dont matter
I dont I dont forth and backer I clackclackaratatata
Could be blacker could be cracker
Its whatever thats whenever
Sprinkle salt I spray pepper
You play bad I go evil
I know folk I know people
Im the shit I go fecal
You a leech Im a leader
Humble down we aint equal
Kill your master slap your sifu
Im rich rollin true blue regal
I keep a stick dont take shit and that 223 is lethal
Black Boul hate me
Im too cool AC
I dont give a fuck if weed gettin legal if none of my niggas aint free
Ayy I dont give a fuck who the president is if the president aint for me
You aint never met a nigga like me
Im a bad nigga Im Stagger Lee
Im a Morehouse man Spike Lee
Dope man with a plan Fat Steve
I kill em Im Hosea Williams
Unbought unbossed Im chillin
Tryna get it out the mud off the muscle
Tryna get it like the late Herman Russell
Im yearning like Alonzo Herndon
Im the new QBall Im earning
First rule you better understand
You dealing with a real Black man
If I said it I meant it I meant it like I said it cause I said what I said understand
So stay in your place lil man
Commentin on the TV channel
I guarantee you never seen a nigga like me cause they only make these in Atlanta
