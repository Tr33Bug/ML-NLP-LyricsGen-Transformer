Ms Oprah Mr Cosby I am right back at your ass
With all honor Mr Obama please dont walk out so fast
I got a question got a question got a question for you all
Why when Oscar Grant got murdered we didnt hear a peep from yall
We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates
But what about your people slaving in these fields everyday
We know that House got air conditioning and the sweetest lemonade
But dont forget your color brother we still motherfucking slaves
And that even go for Puffy who so motherfucking paid
That hes richer than these White folks or at least thats what he say
Thats what he say thats what he say and them petty niggas love it
Think about it whats a rapper standing next to Warren Buffett
Ha ha ha now you niggas are properly enlightened
You can disregard that sellout shit that Jason Whitlock writing
You can disregard that racist shit that Glenn Beck is reciting
Im the leader of the gang tell them to get a mike
I was born and I was raised in the USA
And I done been around the world and back what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay so bitch you better pray
I was born and I was raised in the USA
And I done been around the world and back what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay so bitch thats life
What Im touching on next you might want to leave the kitchen
Cuz Im touching on that touchy subject that they call religion
Kind of touchy like that religion thats touching on your children
But nobody want to talk about that touching and feeling
On topics that they touching or talking about Jesus said
They liars like they father and sixes is in their head
Bishop Long what is up with that monkey shit on your head
Last I checked vanity was a sin the Lord said
On my life I believe you put boys off in your bed
Though some New Birthers and Catholics aint going to like what I just said
But before you fix your mouth and try to come with a retort
Please be advised that Jesus never took a plea in court
And he never had a plane and he never had a car
And he never had a church that was visited by stars
But he did have love for the poor and the theives
And he was in the street kind of similar to me nigga
Mr Beck Mr OReilly Mr Limbaugh Mr Hannity
How could you sell white America your insanity
You tell them that theyre different and manipulate their vanity
When truthfully financially their life is a calamity
Otherwise they would be listening to Dave Ramsey
So theyre about as broke as the people that they dont want to be
Convincing them that rich Republicans is what they going to be
So they act like Ronald Reagan and like him theyre awful actors
Who look up to the rich like dumb kids look up to rappers
And thats about as dumb as a donkey pulling a tractor
Yes thats a Democrat diss Im a detractor
So whether you vote right or vote left is not a factor
When you aint got no care for your health Hey this America
They going to put your ass in debt something terrible
So you can disrespect presidents and call them socialists
But Palin and Pelosi both going to have you broke as shit
