Hey my names Malik and Killer Mikes my dad
If you dont like what hes sayin so what
Thats life
Told you last tape Im a killer man
Im a rapper what the fuck do I know
Well Im also a nigga that came off Martin Luther King man
Son of a dope lady
And I went to fuckin Morehouse nigga
I accomplished something I became something nigga
Thats who I am to criticize any nigga
Oprah Bill Clinton Cosby anybody
The fat bitch singing show over end opera
Leader of the crack Rat Pack I Sinatra
They say I dissed Oprah
Im like so what
I never get to jump up and down on a sofa  thats life 
Now watch me as I Cruise like Tom through the slums
Where the educations poor and the children growing dumb
In the section of the city where sadittys dont come
Where Mr Cosby and Ms Winfrey wont come
Unless its a hurricane then FEMA dont come
Coming live from the city where the Dreamer came from
Standing on the same corners that he stood upon
I got violence in my waistband death in my palm
Ask em am I a bad guy ya goddamn right
I done seen how ya do a nigga when he doin right
The Dream died on a balcony standin at a hotel
Now niggas whippin coke gel and a O tale
We desegregated  put black with the white
No longer marching for rights they sparking a pipe  thats life 
Pipe dreams crack fiends
Cars look like ice cream
Kids see the blingbling and they want them nice things
All cause of tennis shoes our kids drop out of schools
They said be like Mike so ball nigga  thats life 
Now help me understand something
If you a leader and you really mean something to your people
Aint you supposed to be in the community with your people
Aint you supposed to be there
Like the only people I see in the communities
Are rappers and ball players
Where the fuck all yall doctors
Where yall bourgeoisie niggas at
All the kids got is us Grind Time rap game
Read an old magazine check out a new dress
I be havin conversations with Cornel West
Killer Mike dont give a damn if its me ya aint likin
The last great debate I had was with Michael Eric Dyson
Call me a dumb rapper
Girl stop pardon me
You be hard pressed to find another rapper smart as me
Maybe JayZ 2Pac CUBE
But Oprahd rather put Superhead on TV
Now whatcha white audience gon think about we
The same white audience that watch Bill O Reilly
I saw the smirk on they face when you came at Luda
The same nice ladies that forgave Martha Stewart
So I can be a crook
Take money off the books
Just as long as Im liked by a rich mans wife
OK hold up I cant rap about doing crime
But if I actually do crime and do time
I can come back out
And have a TV show
With an all white audience
If I rob shareholders of millions
But if I rap about getting some money on the block
Its a problem
Are you fuckin retarded
Im not even gonna tell you how stupid you are right now
Cause you should already know Grind Time Rap Game  thats life 
Niecey had a man not a mouse or a mole
When the pressure come knockin I aint runnin in a hole
George Bush dont like blacks
No shit Sherlock
And his daddy CIA had flooded the hood with rock
And his momma said the women oughta feel at home
Gettin raped in the bathroom in the Superdome
The comment Kanye made was damn near right
But Bush hate poor people
Be em black or white  thats life 
Hell yeah I said it cause Oprah wont say it
And Bill wont say it and they still wont say it
If you really bout intelligence you really know Im right
If you lookin for some leadership look for Killer Mike  thats life 
Lookin for a movement its Grind Time Rap Game
Kids see us in the street and go bang bang bang
They see me on the street and on the corners they hang
Myspace Grind Time Online join the gang
Aye man all you adults out there all you supposed grown people
Would you please stop lying to young people
Could we please have a moment of fuckin honesty
You know honesty
The shit you ask young people to be with you when you ask are they havin sex or doin drugs
Could we please stop fuckin lying
Like you preachers out there who spread the myth
That young boys who sag their pants picked that shit up in prison to let niggas know they homosexuals
You in your faggot twisted mind know that aint true
You sick fuck for even sayin that shit
We wear our fuckin pants big
Because our mothers were too poor to buy our size
So they had to buy two or three sizes up
Call it what it is nigga poverty
Its fuckin poverty
You know poverty the opposite of the big fuckin cars and planes you drive
Mutherfucka
To all you rich bourgeoisie niggas out there
Stop ignoring your cousins in the ghetto
Because theyre there
Stop looking down on em
Stop using crack addicts and Mexicans
As cheap labor to build your fuckin houses
And then shitting on poor black people and Latins
You pieces of shit
Thats for you rich motherfuckas black and white
In the mean time us rappers
Us lowly bboys and us motherfuckin athletesll be here in the ghetto
Servicing the motherfuckin children
We are the new Robin Hoods
We are the Pied Pipers
We will lead the kids into a better life than the motherfuckin lies you doing
Kids grow up be doctors be lawyers
Just dont be liars and connivers like the ones we got now
Young men grow up
Be clergymen be a preacher
Just dont be a motherfuckin greedy hog like most of the ones we got now
Grind Time Rap Game
Bang bang bang
If you dont like what Im sayinthats life
