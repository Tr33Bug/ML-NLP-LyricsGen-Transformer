Whoa baby whoa baby whoa baby
La la la la la la yeah
I would never leave you girl  My girl my wife 
You know I love you  My pain my strife 
Oh baby oh baby
I would never leave you girl  Good days bad nights 
You know I love you  Lovely fistfights 
Oh baby oh baby
Killa for look at us forvever fucked up
All we do is fuck fight and get Xed up
Enough enough
We bad for each other mama
But our sex life aint right without drama
In combat sweet agony upon that
I deliver make you take it soft and break it hard
Like dope dealers Im a husband to a wife
But Im ya nigga and you a perfect drug
Make a nigga heart quiver
You a hard breakin hard liquor on my liver
Like dro and gin go together you a mind shifter
Body dark like a Cognac Im pussy drunk
In light  I stay drunk
My pretty little vampire my delila
Teach me how to hate the truth and how to love a liar
You a malicious mindbending Mary Magdalene
You the perfect drug ultimate high and Im a fiend
Chorus
Youre my path to the pen or the crazy house
I deliver dick raw and wont take it out
Best sheeba your the devils daughter cant fake it
Killing me slow I know and I cant shake it
Please stay please leave please dont go
Please walk away and let me be to die slow
This love is deeper than the grave and its forever
Snake pit youre venom beyond measure
Pandoras box a lot my treasure
If love is strong as the grave make me deader
Jezibelle got my soul and my cheddar
Everytime I beat it down it jumps wetter
Like a dark cloud bringing me pain and bad weather
I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella
I couldnt write the words I blame this letter
Til death do us part we deserve to be together
Chorus
A living drug youre the bitch I hate to love
Learned to suck good dick by fuckin thugs
A nigga cant teach you spread like a track meet
Breaking Dboys MCs and athletes but not me
Told you from the start this shit forever
We gon go through this bad weather together
Whether low road or high side we gon ride
Through the fistfights and black eyes its you and I
Ike and Tina our love is measured on a milimeter
They say a partner dont love a nigga til a nigga eat her
But Im full and tired of the motherfuckin talking
Ill be goddamned if you hit the door walking
Im stalkin the depths of Atlantis evil enchantress
Slick and underhanded
Fuckin with you like dancing with the devil no command bitch
Known for leaving niggas emptyhanded
I lost everything I had just to lust you
Bitch you take another step and Ill bust you
Bitch you take another step and Ill bust you
Chorus
