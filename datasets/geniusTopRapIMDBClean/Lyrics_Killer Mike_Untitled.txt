You are witnessing elegance in the form of a black elephant
Smoking white rhino on terraces
Will I die slain like my king by a terrorist
Will my woman be Coretta take my name and cherish it
Or will she Jackie O drop the Kennedy remarry it
My sister say its necessary on some Cleopatra shit
My grandmama said nope never that its sacrilege
Tend to agree because the thought is so disparaging
The Lord give a load you got to carry it like Mary did
Thats why Im giving honor to all these baby mommas
It takes a womans womb to make a Christ or Dalai Lama
The world might take that child turn that child into a monster
The Lordll take a monster and fashion him a saint
I present you Malcolm X for those who saying that He cant
Saying that He wont when I know He will
You usually dont know its you until you getting killed
For real
Dear Lord have mercy
On the ones that go through life like its a game
Dear Lord
I wont be forced to shut up when I dont feel the same
Cause people gonna lie
Some people gonna steal
You gotta be careful not to shit where you live
Them people might try to have you killed
Lord have mercy life is such a battlefield
For real
I aint never gave a fuck
I never did and never will
Live my life on principle
Keep it true keep it real
Better said I keep it trill
And no matter who dont like it homie
Thats just how it is
Naked truth like the stripper thats in front of me
And I keep a blunt and a Bible and a gun on me
Why Cause Im countrybred
Actually Im southerern
Something like my brethren
The legendary Andre 3K Cee Lo Goodie and some other men
You should pay some homage its an honor this
This is not a fiction that is sold by conglomerates
This is Soul of Black Folks mixed with Donald Goines shit
Better said Robert Beck esoteric I could get
This is John Gotti painting pictures like Dali
This is Basquiat with a passion like Pac
In a body like Biggie telling stories like Ricky
If a rapper was to spar please tell him better kick it
You with me
Dear Lord have mercy
On the ones that go through life like its a game
Dear Lord
I wont be forced to shut up when I dont feel the same
Cause people gonna lie
Some people gonna steal
You gotta be careful not to shit where you live
Them people might try to have you killed
Lord have mercy life is such a battlefield
For real
I dont trust the church or the government Democrat Republican
Pope or a bishop or them other men
And I believe God has sustained me with rap
So I pick a burning bush put it in a Swisher wrap
And they cant kill a G I seen how I die
Im only going once a coward dies a thousand times
Until that chariot come and take a nigga home
Imma spit this ghetto gospel over all these gutter songs
Im gone
