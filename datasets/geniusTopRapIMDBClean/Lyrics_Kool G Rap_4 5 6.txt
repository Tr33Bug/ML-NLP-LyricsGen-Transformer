4 5 6 is in the mix Im hittin them with trips
Headcrack time to get the bread black
4 5 6 is in the mix Im hittin them with trips
Headcrack time to get the bread
I rolled on every ceelo corner that I know inside the city
Kiddies I got a fat mitt in my pocket lookin pretty
So who wanna get paid on the block
A thousands in the pot
Now go and grab your knots from the stash spot
I shake them up and shake them up
Roll and I break em up
Two tracies and a poundcake
Yeah nigga wake em up 
Keepin my fingers wrapped around the joint
In case niggas start brawlin
Because I see em falling to the strong point
One by one they losin down the line
A fifty fucked roll or duck pose
Oh nigga pay me mine  Damn nigga 
I grab the dice place your price all you men are mice
Riffin as Im sippin on a Heineken and gettin nice
I shake them up they papes is gettin deader
Nigga sittin on a Beretta
Said he wanna bet that I dont throw a better
Now the game is surrounded by some money hungry bitches
I put the kisses on my fists and rolled the triple sixes
And once again it be the point that I shoot
That be puttin crazy loot
In the pocket of my army suit
Now who wanna come fo another round
I rolled a fo a six hold up
Now I seen a fuckin pound
Yeah you niggas know what the name of the game is
Im in yo anus
Ceelo you know that shit that made a nigga famous
Hookers up on the dingdong I cant go wrong
Rollin for two hours long and still rollin strong
4 5 6 is in the mix Im hittin them with trips
Headcrack time to get the bread black
4 5 6 is in the mix Im hittin them with trips
Bettin Grants with the ceelo champs
I make em sweat from beginners to the vets Im a threat
Some niggas double up on they fifty bets
I gotta be nice to the dice so Im talkin to em
I step back gave a tap on the sidewalk and threw em
Nigga went and put his foot in the way see
And tried to ace me
Now I got niggas rollin to that bitch Tracy
Yeah but Tracy aint too gentle
Niggas thought she was simple
And loses with two deuces and a fuckin pimple  A loser 
I crack another brew sit back and watch what niggas do
Who threw that two You Im rollin the whole fuckin crew
One by one niggas come payin that fell to the trey and
Furlough inside the bait thats what a nigga sayin
Your luck is tough Im makin enough to buy a kilo
Uhoh look out below I think I rolled another ceelo
Pick up my crap niggas dont get back a dime of that
And keep my hand right by my waist where my nine is at
One more chance and niggas quit thats on zero
Broke cryin broke Im doin backstrokes in ceenotes
Crazy pockets are empty what a god damn shame
Niggas you know the name of the game
Word the fuck up
