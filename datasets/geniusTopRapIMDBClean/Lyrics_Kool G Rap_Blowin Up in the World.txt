Back in the days was kinda crazy kid I started out with nothin
Wasnt livin like Thanksgiving I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the po house
Say mama caught the drama she would bleed tryin to feed fo mouths
Wasnt rockin Girbauds I barely had clothes and when it snow
And temperatures droppin below zero you know I froze
No CDs a black and white TV I see thats about to retire
With a hanger for the antenna turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin in my cabinet but cans of Raid
Im knockin on my neighbors door to borrow a cup of sugar for my KoolAid
I wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
Im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black I had KitKats on top of Cracker Jacks
Walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldnt speak I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin humped from the stunts I always struck out
The one you like says take a hike if you cant pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines you know what Im sayin
Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines yeah
It seems like only yesterday my moms is on my back
Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack
Black I dont disown her Im just a kid from Corona
With a GED diploma with more ribs showin than Tony Romas
In order to get straight I gots to to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles with the black tops
For cops got my shorty watchin my back hops
Makin mad lucci bought up Louis Vuitton  Gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi while they smooch me givin up the coochie
Now Im a felon started sellin and splittin melons
Some started jellin and tellin police just cause I was swellin
Hangin out on the corner playin ceelo rollin for half a kilo
Yo youll never see G low or goin below
Yeah straight gettin fortunate  as long as fiends was torchin it
It started gettin hot around the block the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin too risky
So now I just lamp collect stamps snatch tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines you know what Im sayin
Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines yeah
I got put on by DJ Polo cut the record Its a Demo
And started chillin in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin no time for pains sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame nothin changed Im still the same
Just spendin twenties and tens at women pullin on my linen
Then grinnin cause I was winnin in this game from the beginnin
The lyrical skills was kinda ill gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build known for rappers run and go write wills
And turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low now I puff on cigars and blow Os
So catch a flashback of a G Rap track attacked like a head crack
Get smacked through your cap with the lead black
And heres a new cut for poobutt rappers hangin from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G Rap dont sleep money unless its with ya girl
Straight up kid Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines you know what Im sayin
Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Im blowin up in the world I gotta get mines I gotta get mines
I gots to get mines yeah
