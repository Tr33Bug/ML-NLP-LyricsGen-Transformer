Yeah
Shake your funky ass bitch
Yaknowmean
Yo
Yo we divide cakes to rise the stakes
Me and my apes die for papes
Bust heat and hide from jake
Up in the skyscrape on top of the world
Back yourself against the wall gun brawl
Kid I end it for all yall  Shake that cake bitch 
Sonll stop the dough from flowin
Spotless rock glowin shots are blowin
Pop the clock rollin waistline and Glock is showin
We keep it thugged out who not knowin get your knot blown in
Yo yo
Bob Digital and Kool G Rap we set the booby trap
African wiz wit the gat inside her dooby wrap
Derelict rhyme crabs you rappin for a Scooby Snack
Foultongued bitch you bound to lick my doody crack
Verbal pellets spray tec sound makes my amex
Every slap on my snare drum son could break necks
You get yanked up and spanked up your face shanked up
Who the FUCK raise your rank up I blow your tank up
Pop the lock on a cop handcuff puff a dutch of dust
Bust the jump up and snuff out the judge
Fuck a cell block black top capsule the mailbox
Its cherrybone birds stash Glock in the nailshop
One the strip took a sip twist the L top
The God jewels son sound like a third rail shock
The gold crossbone doorag universal flag
Blast at the turbo charge and purple herbal drag
Known for the W carry a doubletwo in the shoe
Iron snub rubber noose in the bubble goose
Bullets soaked in oil hot heat will flame broil
WuTang slang I bang makes your brain coil
Shaolin gods we known to stack cakes
Desert Queen projects son they bake cakes
Uptown Pilan dogs you make cakes
Cold Medina sons they known to take cakes
Yo we have the WuTang we let twos bang
Thats how we do thangs thats how we move thangs
Shoes paid wit two in the brain
Keep the ice blue in the Range
Me and The RZ quick wit two of them dames
Got my dick blew in the Range
My nigga keep it true to the game
It aint no tellin what I do to you lames
If my mood change choose to aim
Do you and your dudes the same
Go against grain and lose a fame
Who claim life in the thug lane but life is real
Lead come out of pipes of steel
Rob kill or heist for mills
Spill as I let out and slice your grill
Nigga dont think twice to peel
Just open shop and dice to grill
Send the six out bust crib route
To the brickhouse steppin on new terrain bring the click out
The streets dont wanna see you read let a clip out
These niggas slip out make they blood drip out
Yo we divide the cakes to rise the stakes
Me and my apes die for papes
Bust heat and hide from jake
Up in the skyscrape on top of the world
Back is up against the wall gun brawl
Kid I end it for all yall
The floodll stop the dough from flowin
Spotless rock glowin shots Im blowin
Pop the clock rollin waistline the Glock is showin
E keep it thugged out who not knowin get your knot blown in
