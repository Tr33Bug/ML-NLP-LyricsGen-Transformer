Dont you know that G Raps straight thuggin
And you know you cant stop the shine
Uhh uhh
Kool G Rap Underworld Illville
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do 
Whattup whattup whattup
Uhh uhh
Daddy Bigbucks got the fortyfive cal tucked
Giovanni style tux see the Cristal erupt
Be up at the bar what Diamonds carved and cut
The sluts get starstruck wonder if the cars what
The new BM rimmed up the Navigator truck
Feet be like skinned up in only gator stuff
For fly mami get hemmed up she got the Jada cuts
These cats pushin they lens up they cant hate enough
They countin what I spend up already made enough
To live plush you must eat out a fat plate of mush
Got what you lust the Bulgari smothered with slush
Yours covered with rust diamonds studded with dust
Mine flooded with crush rides big as a bus
Thirtytwo plus what can you and your crew do to us
But look in disgust plot to seize the shinin sea
From coppin the VTWELVE
Pissed off at Gs but we dont believe in knockin knees
We cock and squeeze and leave some shit shot and breeze
Attractin these chicks mixed black and japanese
And slappin these nitwits with fat stacks of Gs
Bag your rat she should lack grabbin the back of threes
On her knees see more semen than all the seven seas
She goldminin lookin for new fashion designin
Rings with rocks blindin cause my world started shinin uhh

Chorus Miss Jones and G Rap
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do
When you see mines and cant stop the shine
Sippin wine from up a little grapevine
Too much ice up on the wrist to tell the time
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do
When you see me up in the 6 with a dime
Yeah chicks of all kinds mad concubines
Will you cock the nine and sneak me from behind
My jet leaves down to the beaches in the West Keys
With jet skis only sex Gs with SEs
And Lex GS3s cheese to bless G
Baguettes be the ice makin my neck and chest freeze
Vietnamese Tibetan Gs with wet beads
In sets of three breasts in 3D that slept with me
The sexy beauty of the week of the Jet Gs
Bangladesh Gs on the other side of the Red Sea
The lefty sippin Remi inside the Pepsi
Jewels shinin holdin down what you fell behind in
Mink shit with silk linin penetrate right through
Your hymen handle a nine like Im Lex Diamond
Organized crimin bank rolls yeah we get those
Fly clothes slip those spot foes then we hit those
The whole click glow click the sickoes
With the chickos hit the ones with the sixohs
Hollow tops spit those let the dough pile
Leave no profile drama wild leave you layin Castellano style
With fifth llama cows whole click be kinda wild
On a mission get the death kiss end up missin
Chorus w variations to end
