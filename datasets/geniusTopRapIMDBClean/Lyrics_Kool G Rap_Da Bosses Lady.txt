That chick hes with  huh  she like me
Oh she likes you huh How do you know
I know  The eyes Chico they never lie
What are you serious
Im serious what do you think
Man thats the bosss lady
sarcastic The bosss lady
Youre gonna get us killed
Fuck you mayn The bosss lady that guys soft
You got some of that for me
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat
Had to have her
Since my first glance at her pimp stance at her
Watchin men throwin Banjamins and Grants at her
Bottles of Italy and France at her
Advanced at her spit romance at her
Champagne glasses chatter
Ass fatter than that actress up in Family Matters
Lips thicker than Mick Jaggers
Dick so hard the shit could stab her
She pushed a sick Jaguar
Paint shined like it was black lacquer
Carried a small gat for back up whole shit spectacular
Peepin out her frame walkin in back of her
She had the hourglass shape girls disgraced stay out her way
Past late get that ass raped fast tied up with mask tape
Mad papes I could tell by the way she was draped
Her sex mates caked up like Drakes
He got the crib by the lake
Wanted by the Jakes for takin powder weight outta state
Straight surrounded his grounds with tower gates
Garden lookin like a flower wake
Every hour he make about enough dough to spoil this bitch sour
Sex money and power pussy good enough to devour
Hit her up inside the marble tiled shower
Snapped back to reality told me her name was Valerie
Dont fuck around with the help
Nigga on the salary pockets too low calorie
Her manll send the cavalry straight turn the town to a shootin gallery
Off his life
To get in good with the bosss wife
Cross his life just to floss his ice
To get him hit for the cost of rice tossed at night
If the thoughts is right
Bodies could get lost in sight
The bosss lady I cocks the fourfifth and hold it steady baby
My man ship mo weight than the fuckin Navy
Out to get this gravy so you cant take mine
You crossed the line fuckin with the bosss devine
Aiyyo his mans they commit crimes  yeah right 
Found out you tryin to fuck with his dime you lay your life on the line
But the cards are in my hands
I love this rich man and fuckin you is not in the plans
Im out to get grands and livin on my own land
So why fuck with that help Im livin in wealth you under his belt  whatever 
Hourglass shape I know you felt wonderin how the pussy smelt
Lavish tastell have you livin in debt
Fantasizin bout his wifes sex how could you disrespect
The man who supply the cash for yo checks  So what 
On the low cause you know he blaze tecs and you fear for whats next
Your life could be dead for tryin to get my pussy wet
Realize the bigger picture I deal with bigger figures
Dont have time for affairs with the average niggas
Keep the lustin to a limit cause aint no benefits in it
Too much to lose if I let you hit it
You know the force is deep and you wanna creep
Thinkin how sweet it would be if I just let you eat
But till the boss show I gotta stay true the chump change wont do
For me with you isnt evident boo
I like your style kid you get wild let the chips pile
My click slit smiles across your mans throat so look who big now
Barkin on shit like a big growl lame chick you got this shit foul
We got the big bricks shipped in from miles
While Im whippin shit 6 plus 6 valves
Do a milli from sick style we regulate it
Yo boo I guess you havent heard the latest about these new ages
Stackin outrageous
G Rap 
Yeah I heard about the way you flip birds
Got these niggas standin on the curb leafers and herbs
You and my nigga exchanged words then parted ways
You swore to God all day your squad would spray
My man in all kinds of sick and retarded ways
Straight gave him a harp to play 
I peeped your resume  You with me Angel 
Yeah no doubt but I should bang you
