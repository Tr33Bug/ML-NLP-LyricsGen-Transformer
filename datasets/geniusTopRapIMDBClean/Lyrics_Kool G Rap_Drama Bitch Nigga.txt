Drama  Bitch Nigga  LyricsEhbody always wanna know what know what the G
In Kool G Rap stand for Giancana nigga gangsta
Quick to gank ya ass with a gigantic ass gat
You heard
Yo here come the one thats known to keep it thoro
Queens the borough  straight up 
Live nigga rep that  no doubt 
Cock the techs back and move on em weak cliques  move on em 
We deep bitch
And none of my Gorillas are scared to leak shit
All yall niggas wanna speak slick what you say  what 
And couldnt beat dick
And quick to flee to them dicks
As soon as the heat spit
Cement your fucking feet to a brick
And draw them big
Heats on ya chick
We creep when we flip
Giancana baby thug for life I love this life
Guns hoes drugs and iceaight
How your heart pump koolaid when theres blood in mice
Why you tryna fight slugs with a knife  dont do it 
Bitch nigga
Had too much of that stiff liquor  dont do it 
Plenty gun talk front for New York
And wouldnt draw stick figure  ha ha 
Bounty your head for bout six figures cook a bitch liver
End of the war who lift the fifth quicker nigga  you know me 
My whole approach sicker
To all you rappers with names hot as flames
Ill be there when the shit flicker  getem 
This one go out to all gunslingers  hitem  and brick flippers
Big dick don G rap nigga piss rivers
Drama is the life I live
Bossing is the things I did
Problems is the things I finish
I been known from hood to hood to handle business
Money is them things I take
Ladies come on and bounce with me
G Rap I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you bout your cake
Ayo my whole life is under nonfiction
Drama friction
Beef blood in the street bullets with bombs ticking
Just to become a don from sinning
Harmful living Giancana the street boss peoples loss
Left a dog reapin the cost
Had to go in deep in the forest
The whole police force peeping the floss
Conduct family biz have my Yosemite Sam kids
That park vans where you live  oow 
Run up in a house and put a hands on the wiz
Give me fifty grand to live  Bitch 
G Rap Americas Most see the name embedded it and toast
Im here til all yall niggas perish and quote
We lust money but cherish the dope
Meat cleaver sever your throat
The smoke for the big bread and the a boat
So all you guys with gimmicks die timid  die die die 
The skys the limit
Better believe that Imma ride every minute
In this game its all about the pies and the spinach
And the liver this shit get the liver the menace
Never violate the lines of scrimmage
G Rap Giancana kid I vow to keep it live to the finish  uhhu  yeah
Drama is the life I live
Bossing is the things I did
Problems is the things I finish
I been known from hood to hood to handle business
Money is them things I take
Ladies come on and bounce with me
G Rap I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you bout your cake
If you bout your cake
If you bout your cake
All about that cake
Yeah Giancana mob boss nigga what uh
