Fast Life  Norfside Remix  LyricsThe time has come we gotta expand the whole operation
Distribution New York to Chicago LA
We gotta set our own market and enforce it
Verse One Kool G Rap
Champagne wishes of caviar dreams a team thats gettin cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin the life of rowdy packin fifty calis
Rockin lizard Ballys while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beamos then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas he runs the whole staff we count mad for seen bad
Weve seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used to shootin targets soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
Thatll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders lookin straight charming in our Giorgio Armanis
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin bola holdin mad payola
Slangin a Coke without the Cola
Me and black dont fake jacks but we might sling one
It aint no shame in our game we do our thing son
Chorus
Livin the fast life in fast cars
Everywhere we go people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the american dream
So were plottin up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
repeat 2X 
Verse Two Nas Escobar
Yo I got guns from Italy smoke trees considerably
Midstate and Green it seems is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin up my Lex over whos petrol
My tec blows straight off the roof and tests yo respect though
But dough dont respect me it got me handcuffed
The rough life I just be up nights breathin with scuffed Nikes
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like its my first child lickin shots holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters Wallaby down
Twentyfour carats countin cabbage like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
Its Nas seven hundred wives King Solomon size
We on the rise me and G ghetto wise guys
The luciano Frankie Aiello Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a trade thats illegal

singer Brother youve got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh get this money yeahhh
Brother youve got to make it happen
When youre living in the fast life heyy yeah yeah
Verse Three G Rap Nas
Aiyyo my lifestyles exquisite yayo like a blizzard
Its choir attire standin on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
Bodies on ice
Livin trife rollin fixed up dice
Gamblin Grants
Handlin stamps
Moves are sheist
My bank grows got the cops comin in plain clothes
Tryin to arraign again cause of our fame thats how the game goes
True
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm  Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico puttin in cut inside perico
Heat for foes shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Carribean suites deep rippin beats with flows
Aiyyo we went from standin on blocks without some socks
Sellin rocks to pickin up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah so heres a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings graveyards is buried with kings
Chorus
singer does same part again with variations to fade mostly I for you
