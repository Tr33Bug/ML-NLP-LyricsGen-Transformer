The time has come we gotta expand the whole operation
Distribution New York to Chicago LA
We gotta set our own market and enforce it
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams
A team thats gettin CREAM
With sales of fishscales from triple beams
I gleam livin the life of Riley packin fifty calis
Rockin lizard Ballys while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin Bimmos then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas  he runs the whole staff
We count math from steam baths
Weve seen HalfaMilli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major playas gettin papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin targets soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us  we got hookers with heaters
Thatll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders lookin straight charmin in our Giorgio Armanis
You wanna harm me and Nas
You gots to come get through our whole army
The ceelo rollers money folders sippin Bolla holdin mad payola
Slangin that Coke without the Cola
Me and black dont fake jacks but we might sling one
It aint no shame in our game we do our thing son
Livin the fast life with fast cars
Everywhere we go people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream
So were plottin up a scheme to get the sevenfigure cream

Yo I got guns from Italy smoke trees considerably
Midstate and Green it seems is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery  shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin up my Lexo but whos petro
My TEC blow straight off the roof and tests yo respect though
But dough dont respect me it got me handcuffed
The rough life I just be up nights breathin with scuffed Nikes
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like its my first child lickin shots Holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters Wallabee down
Twentyfour carats countin cabbage like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
Its Nas  seven hundred wives King Solomon size
We on the rise me and G  ghetto wise guys
The Luciano Frankie Yale Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade thats illegal
Brother youve got to make it happen
Yeahhhahh yeahhh get this money yeahhh
Brother youve got to make it happen
When youre livin in the fast life heyy yeaaaah yeah
Ayo our lifestyles exquisite yayo like a blizzard
Esquire attire standin on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like its spacious
Bodies on ice livin trife rollin fixedup dice
Gamblin Grants handlin stamps moves are sheist
My bankrolls got the cops comin in plain clothes
Tryin to arraign our gang cause of our fame
Thats how the game goes  True 
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm  Hammer
Supplyin scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom Veuve Clicquot
Dimes look magnifico puttin a cut inside perico
Heat for foes shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites deep rippin beats with flows
Ayo we went from standin on blocks without some socks
Sellin rocks to pickin up stocks in boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah So heres a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings graveyards is buried with kings
Livin the fast life with fast cars
Everywhere we go people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream
So were plottin up a scheme to get the sevenfigure cream
