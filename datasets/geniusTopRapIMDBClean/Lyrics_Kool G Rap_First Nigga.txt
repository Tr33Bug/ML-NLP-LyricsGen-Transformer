Kool G Rap is my name
Yo who that first nigga that writ about it  Kool G Rap 
Who that first nigga that spit about it  Kool G Rap 
Whats that nigga name Forget about it
First nigga that writ about it  Kool G Rap 
Who that first nigga that spit about it
Whats that nigga name Forget about it
Yo who that real Don of that thug shit
Poppin slugs shit cock n block shit
Spit about street murder and drug shit
Brought you the facts on twenty tracks on how they mug shit
Taught you to survive in these streets you gotta lug shit
First nigga to spit about rocks and shit
Diamonds and jellyjars nigga yeah proper shit
Even told you I was pumpin on the block and shit
Who the first nigga that told you he would pop ya shit
Who the first nigga to spit about jail cells and fiscale
Bail on sitL ripping a bitch teadL
Who took you from the Road To Riches the Ill Street Blues
In a jacuzz with the uz crack avenues
Black you lose to a wolf pack packing tools
Who stepped up in this rap game a sane actin fool
Who the first Wanted Dead Or Alive
That told you live and let it demise
Ten steps ahead of you guys
Started 4 5 6 on it
G Rap and Rakim was the first niggas that bought a eightyman click n it
Look at my life baby Im a eighties man rippin it
Legendary cat laid the path for yall to get with it
Who that nigga that took the rapflows to the next level
Wish only I was black fish rappers and exrebels
My second LP bitch showed you the sex devil
Photo shoots and silk suits special effect rebels
And its a shame you saw the rocks around a Lex bezel
Smacking niggas with stacks and ones
On the run clappin the guns
Stacking crack funds and packing the slums
Told you how them kids blow off they ratchet for crumbs
While some of yall niggas raps was too attached to the huns
I was the first nigga to spit graphic
Strictly about dealers and slick addicts
How to click matics and split a cabbage
Yall niggas shit was average
Except a few cats in the game that came to reign and have shit established
Kool G Rap is my name
