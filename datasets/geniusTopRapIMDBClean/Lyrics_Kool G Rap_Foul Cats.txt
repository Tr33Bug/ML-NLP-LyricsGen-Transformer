IntroOutro repeat 2X
Foul cats schemin out to setup
Tryin a leave me and my team wet up
Two in the head leaded up
Call the coroners to make they bed up
Infrared shit from neck up
Before they got to lift the TEC up
It was a setup
My nigga got hit they blew his chest up
The hollow tips ripped his vest up
Son is messed up and blessed up
Call my cats up its time to dress up
FourFifth and Smith n Wessd up
Ready to press up and fuck a nest up
The enemy is Hennessey the sessed up
Actin up hit my motherfuckin man up
Never again will he stand up
Yo Big Jan hook the plan up
Put on masks pull the van up
These niggas tryin to hit the fam up
These small times cats yo fuck that I cant see that
Where them niggas be at
Where they hang at Where they live at Where they slang at
Ay yo son one is a known cat he walk around with the chrome Gat this hoodrat know where the nigga home at 
Well heres a quarter baby go and phone that
This motherfucker bout to get his shit blown back
His whole dome clapped
We cocked back the gats and started cruisin
Up the boulevards and avenuesn
Im short fusin and two biscuit usin
Mad hot but not in the mood for losin
We hit the strip pickin up clues and
We on the heels of this nigga shoes and
Out the blue when
We see the chick the nigga screwin
Pushin his whip with the ice cuban
Hemmed her up sweet put heat to her wig piece the Sig piece
To this nigs piece this bitch named Charise
From East New York listen bitch you better talk
Or get your whole frame surrounded with white chalk
Pulled her out a back of the van bitch we dont want you
We want your man you understand
The ho said Please I got his house keys the nigga got Five kis and Mad cheese a hundred Gs
Lie to me bitch you gettin one a these
Fourfive Cs in both knees she said Honestly I promise G
Im not lying then the ho started crying
We hit the road me and my niggas flying
To the crib in Jackson Heights
The nigga live three flights up he type buck
But I aint givin a fuck
Grab his bitch up
Make the ho go first in case the nigga buck
Open the door up and put the stunt in front
Then we all started creepin
He stretched out up on the sofa sleepin
Yeah me and my cats standin there just peepin
Moneys about to get laced
My nigga Ty threw a glass a whiskey in his face
Big Jan ready to blaze the place
He on his way to Amazing Grace
Nigga woke up and saw the big guns
Me and my two sons he knew he was done
He hurt a loved one step back about to let him have one
Yo fuck that aiyyo black where the sack of heroin at
Im bout to give cat some motherfuckin railroad tracks
We dumped the whole bag inside a spoon and left the room
To heat that and came right back yo grab the nigga arm black
Put raw shit in the nigga vein watch the needle drain
Went from being restrained to mad tame
Less than a moment nigga started zonin
His mouth foamin lookin like he possessed by The Omen
His bitch was reachin for the phone and
I had to smack her with the chrome and
Left her on the floor moanin
Cocked back I had to finish this
Know my stee we leave no witnesses
Shot n got the fuck out the premises
