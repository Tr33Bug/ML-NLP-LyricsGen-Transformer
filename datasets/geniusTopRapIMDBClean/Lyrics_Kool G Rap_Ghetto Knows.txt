Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
New York New York the city that never sleeps
Bodies covered in white sheets are layin in the streets
Shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
And holdin Glocks stolen from the cops to get props
You gotta split a top on the regular
Or get plugged in your mug from a slug by your competitor
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder no wonder
Another brother six feet under
You know it aint no jokin when the streetlights are broken
So keep your eyes open or get ready for a smokin loc
Step out of line I hope you got your nine gun son
The Smith and Wess you better press 911  word up 
Or make a run for it theres too many to tackle
The Big Applell put your ass on ice like a Snapple
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped
Niggas act up I back up  PIYAH 
I bust a cap inside your fuckin hat
Dont even pose with them hoes the swinger that you chose
Just might be down with the foes only the shadow knows
And aint no lollipop lollipop over here only the shottie pops
BOOM  Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggas runnin
The shorties  what  the shorties  what  the shorties are comin
To push a nigga wig back and leave his ass flat on his back
The motherfuckin ghetto knows and its like that
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Todays headlines another nigga dead
Six to the body and fo to the head
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead
A drugrelated case and now the place is filled with Feds
Ramshacked the shack disclouse bout two kilos of dope
Two ounces of cokes caught in the pocket of his coat
So another brother caught the ultimate surprise
With blown out brains to drop stains on his eyes
Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news
Watchin his family goin through all the boohoos
You lose like an Ill Street the Blues are gettin deeper
Nothin left in the room except for him the Grim Reaper
Police will take a few snapshots scoop up some blooddrops
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
So they just pull out the white sheets to cover up the dead meat
Seal off the area with yellow tape draw the white
Chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
One more outlaw was murdered on the scene for the green
Died at the age of seventeen
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows 
Strollin the concrete packin my heat walkin the backstreets
I seen niggas pull up peepin me out the side a black Jeep
Six feet deep thats where Im goin if Im slippin
Steady cockin my shit cause I already got the clip in
Now whos the first nigga to run up here they come up
The block hardrocks with Glocks rollin holdin they guns up
I buck I buck and then I struck one in the chest
Nigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest
But now I got three mo niggas pullin triggers
Strays are ricochetin off the bricks zigga zigga
But who got the biggest strap Whos bustin bigger caps
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS
No haps G Rap aint goin out like a sucker
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker
Quick I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me
Cause I wont be too happy with a slug inside my nappy
Two more niggas left they scared to death but Im leary
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me
I went between two cars lettin off the quarter pound
I see another body fallin down to the ground
Quick I run up on him cause I dont think that hes dead
Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head
Thats three niggas down only got one nigga to go
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so
I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up
Nearly shot my whole clip up I got one more slug to rip up
Look over by the GS see his ass stickin his head out
Boom let the lead out blew a piece of his brain dead out
The back of his head now hes dead because he fell face down
Right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled
Yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
And aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows
