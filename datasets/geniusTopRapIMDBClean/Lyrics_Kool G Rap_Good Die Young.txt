Only the good soldiers die young
To stay alive up in these streets you gotsta fly one
Fore the flamers make you famous aimin to ply one
Niggas is dyin over pie crumbs the live ones
Only the good die young 
Only the good soldiers die young
Over chips theyll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums
Only the good die young 
The bullies are back
Gettin the news thats tragic feuds are graphic
Moves through the traffic
Break any rules you lose your attic
Whos in the habit of usin the static
Make somethin ooze out your cabbage
When dudes with ratchets can pay your dues
Stools on the mattress bruised and battered
Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin for clues and maggots
My crew is savage we carry no dead weight
Bet they hide you when I slide kid
All my tools is packaged and lose you faggots
Stay coppin them jewels with karats so whos the rabbit
Trix are for kids in the buggy eye 6 on the strip
Strictly for big wigs so tell me what this is
A nigga thats bout his biz a nigga that dont forgive
A nigga that dont renege a nigga that bust a cig rupture your ribs
Front and Ill bring it to you xactly where you live
BGF surround the crib throw a pound to the kid
Hit a fry when the good die young
Only the good soldiers die young
To stay alive up in these streets you gotsta fly one
Fore the flamers make you famous aimin to ply one
Niggas is dyin over pie crumbs the live ones
Only the good die young 
Only the good soldiers die young
Over chips theyll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums
Only the good die young 
Yo its a whole city of animals
Cannibals bloodthirsty niggas that hammer you
And handle you shots makin you flammable
Thats what an evil mans planll do
Vandal you candle you dismantle you
Leavin your fam and crew pan a few blocks
Bodies in camera view for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggas cant eat thats what the famll do
Leave you for the mantle examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
Thats what the cannons do forever branded you
Spare cannoned you abandoned you rock you to sleep
Niggas surrounded you death wish granted you fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip  throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible havin you livin where the salmon do
The good die young redrum who left to take a stand for you
Only the good soldiers die young
To stay alive up in these streets you gotsta fly one
Fore the flamers make you famous aimin to ply one
Niggas is dyin over pie crumbs the live ones
Only the good die young 
Only the good soldiers die young
Over chips theyll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums
Only the good die young 
You rock a hot bezel and catch a popped vessel
And shot vestibule you got testicles
Beef bringing nigga get shot visible
Rock with the best of you then its back to the block
The blacktops we open up shop and clock decimals
Fake cops scrape from the tea pot for residue
The foul slang liver   page reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around simmer down nigga get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin shed a tear for the one
That caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
Its death for all niggas that left with the Glock smokin
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin
Fuck yall niggas not knowin we make your seeds stop growin
Guerilla nigga we keep rhymes flowin
Bust a four pound man down found in the lot swollen
Drama brung all inside the slum the good die young
Only the good soldiers die young
To stay alive up in these streets you gotsta fly one
Fore the flamers make you famous aimin to ply one
Niggas is dyin over pie crumbs the live ones
Only the good die young 
Only the good soldiers die young
Over chips theyll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums
Only the good die young
