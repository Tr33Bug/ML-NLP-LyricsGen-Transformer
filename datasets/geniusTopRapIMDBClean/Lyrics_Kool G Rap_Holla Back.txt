Yeah its 2G
BrooklynQueens connection
Yall bout to feel somethin yall never felt before
Aiyo G you know Im like a treyeight special
Im close range
Fuckin with you I gotta get AK material banana clip style
Lets do this lets do this
Blow the spot like tea kettle whistles
Federal slugs the leadll kiss you
Infrared burnersll never miss you
All digital hard physical spittle you riddle you
Priest prayin over your body while you in critical
Come in a few give out a doz this what the semi do
See what the Henny and Rmy do
BGF Black Gorilla Family jet Black Godfather finesse
Fifty caliber hole surroundin your chest
Bentley blue steel armored cars with boulder baguettes
We live in effect blaze a gun while poppin a Tec
Recognize killers nigga pop a collar to that
Gorilla breed to the death thats the shit that I rep
Code of silence addicted to havin fattened the violence
AK47 rapidly firin got love for bloodshed and the sirens
Take banana clips to my gun to keep my shit off balance
My heart filled with malice
Yo if you livin thug holla back
My bitches strippin in the clubs let the dollars stack
This ones for all my OGs and street scholar cats
And if a nigga act up funeral parlor cat
Pop a collar to that
Yo wavin cash gun in the stash the click on smash
From rockets that blast yo we in your pockets for cash
Burgundy mask bullets like a surgery slash
Internally burn your staff and dismember your ass
Coroners bag from autops to medical lab
I leave you leakin like Carlito watch your memory flash
Quicksand for fam tied a fuckin brick to your hands
Im sicker with the Henny liquor with the clip to your man
When its on its on do your moms bodily harm
Firstbornll be your first gone beef goes on
Permanent cash put you in the tourniquet fast
Feed you glass and use you to fertilize the grass
Puff green when we fiendin to murder ya whole team
For cream the infrared beamsll shatter your dreams
I flatter your queen and rip her right out of her jeans
Intervene and its the homicide scene for your team


From hideous acts on the one gettin rid of the gats
A nigga back no parole now how pretty is that
The city is trapped bottles popped Phillies is cracked
Niggas is strapped half bent illin spillin they gnac
Cars tinted my rap image too large to mimmick
We mob in it fake niggas dissolve in minutes
Its codes to it real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisiersippin this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different duck when the AK spittin
Its more to it verbal wisely all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it
Doubleedged sword rep for yall seein the board
See yall home soon its better than seein the morgue
So whats the conflict who wanna Don with this
For the streets strictly we got the bombest shit
Two violent niggas sit at the round table in brown sables
Chains hangin down to the navel
Brooklyn and Queens connect get down fatal
Hold the fourpound stable
Wont hesitate to rock a clowns cradle
Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit yall spit sound fable
American Me style knife in the anal who round to save you
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with a gym star spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggas out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit for me to let it rip across your attic
Never valid with a salad but I toss your cabbage
Beotch
