So now its home sweet funeral home nigga thats where youre shown

Who bet they best against mine
I press the rest and let the vest protect mine
Led crimes that head the headlines since Pro Ked times
I used ta catch shines
Rock em when I see you next time
Never regret a threat I meant mine
Soon as I let the infrared shine
Everybody know its hit the deck time
Dont go against mine
I make a whino bleed red wine
Sometimes my own peoples slick talk try to test mine
Get outta line so I give em deadlines
Even disrespectful respect mine
Light weighted but I rep mine
I dont lift weights but I bench press a tec 9
Im known for holdin big shit
The last time I showed the biscuit
I made this dude sweat enough bullets ta load a clip wit
When cops drop warrants and try to get me bagged up
All they hear on they walkietalkies is I need back up
Papoose the braid blaster since jakes want me in the cage captured
I roll wit more niggas than slave masters
Time ta retaliate these fellas actin like they holdin weight
I froze the gate walkin across the seas like Im Moses made
Approachin rappers me and G Rap be the rapper clappers
Try to attack us we break yall down like yall common factors
Better heed thats when the juvy proceed
Im makin rappers bleed off this rapilism I feed
I aint playin games yall rappers better quoting my name
The juvenille straight from Brooklyn where the slugs is the same
So play youre position stuff that I mention grab their attention
Like a magnet to somethin metal so yall blinkin and flickin
Im takin over for the 9 era its now or never
Cuz when I get in the door bringin drama cuz my rhymes is better
Home sweet funeral home nigga thats where youre shown
Call in the cider box 6 blown in your chest and dome
For tryin ta hold the fort down but couldnt hold it
Cuz fuckin wit G Rapll get your arms folded
So now its home sweet funeral home nigga thats where youre shown
Call in the cider box 6 blown in your chest and dome
For tryin ta hold the fort down but couldnt hold it
Cuz fuckin wit this clickll get your arms folded
Eulogy preached by the minister the sinister diminished ya
You miniature send crazy baby fifths is ta finish ya
Bust shots ta limit ya plush Glocks ta hemorrhage ya
What cops got the image of made em block perimeters
They ended up back in forth beef I walk the streets never be prisoner
My lawyers a close friend of the senator
You was full of shit you shoulda took a enema
It mighta not been ten of us murderers turnin your street into a cinema
Swingin gats like pendulums shit out the nine double Im heeming them
Max wit hundred gats send him the minimum
Sendin em but sick of all this I take a step back
And spit the taurus take your moms and chick and hit the Florist
Makin em clip the forest its G and Scarfo
Turnin yo body weight to cargo
While I stretch ya ya bet ya like Fargo
Harps played in the dark like he was Harpo
Get ya hit quicker than Carlo Gambino
Rain on cities like El Nino live well in Reno
Scarf with the Cartiers and Borsalino
Scammin the profits in casinos
Knock wigs off like therapy wit chemo
