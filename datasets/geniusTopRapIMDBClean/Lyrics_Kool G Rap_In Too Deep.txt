Everything everything you know how that shit go
Made to moves I been making for big dough
Heroin paradise making the strip snow
Young nigga slanging in front of the fish store
Leavin needle marks in the arms of his hoes
Gun packer cover the Kron with his clothes
Flow make a dope fiend vomit the shit cold
Bad bitch sit at the bar Im a drink green
Get some insane mouth game in fifteen
Don Mr Clean she know when the whip mean
My main man in here serving the head fiends
Im a fly motherfucker the man of a chicks dreams
Thirty large sit on the chest and the wrist gleam
Seen about half a Peru on the trip beam
Money like Lenox 116
No doubt Im in it to win it and get cream
For the love of the game
Fast lane wont you tell em my name  G RAP 
Beginning to the end city of sin
He bout to win he get it in
Im in too deep linen blue sheets
To get through sleep gotta sleep with two freaks
Run with two heats cause the streets do speak
No exit out the game yeah Im in too deep
Im like Ron ONeal Antonio Fargas
Thats right she call me daddy Im the only hoes father
Gator shoes gettin lined up at the barber
They see me as that nigga in these streets goin harder
No dough for my hoe believe Im a starve er
Understand its worth it the plan worked perfect
Curvy bodies on the curb standing in that fur shit
The man want me in the can gotta stay alert with it
Cold cash stacks and
Slowfast action
Kids wave at the Caddy when I roll past Jackson
Real about my paper showin no compassion
Let her blow my dick hear the hoe go attachin
Bitch run her trap and we all know what happened
Let her live a bit Im a slow mode assassin
Long barrel strapped and not one for the chat in em
Plenty up in the stable let a hoe off the wagon
For the love of the game
Fast lane wont you tell them my name  G RAP 
Beginning to the end city of sin
He bout to win he get it in
Im in too deep linen blue sheets
To get through sleep gotta sleep with two freaks
Run with two heats cause the streets do speak
No exit out the game yeah Im in too deep
