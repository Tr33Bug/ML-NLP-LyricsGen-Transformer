And once again its big G
Runnin the number rackets wearin Pelle jackets
Fast loot tactics Im well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with Olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benihanas
Bentleys limousine the front yard stream is full of piranhas
Im set a private jet I drink a lot of Becks get a lot of sex
Condo and duplex diamondinfested Rolex
The leather recliner the wall units with silver china
Sippin on finer winer you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness kingpin of heroin
Im thorough when I have to bring the terror and
Handle business in each and every borough and
Town or city Im rollin like Frank Nitti Im rich and pretty
Back up kiddies I got crimies thats grimy and gritty
A nigga thats spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin most of my money from all the dope fiends and junkies
I learned from the best
The ones thats livin and the ones thats put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a SmithNWes
And then Im off to get the snaps not the scraps
The game is  Be a real mack the name is Kool G Rap
Now its a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin in this game sometimes it makes you wanna holla
Its a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin in this game sometimes it makes you wanna holla
I got a fly hoe up under the wing
A swinger that does her thing and if you step inside my ring
Shell bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at restaurant tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin Charentes brand label shell rock a suckas cradle
And yeah honey gets more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe a Foxy Brown hoe standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo shell turn into a bustaround hoe
Fly as a Heavens Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hang and dangle gettin money from all angles
Shes pretty under the New York City bright lights
And real late way after midnight I hit it cause the slits tight
Wake up early and make my rounds break a brick down
Packin a silver four pound some clowns be tryin to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of Cnotes
Them slick stickup kids dont get no free dough bro
Cause I aint tryin to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and his honey nothings funny
Its a damn shame what I gotta do to get the money


Now its a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin in this game sometimes it makes you wanna holla
Its a damn shame what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Livin in this game sometimes it makes you wanna holla
No it aint no sweet hangover
No sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
No it aint no sweet hangover
