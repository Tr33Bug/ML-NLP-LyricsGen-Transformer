Hey yo we bringin you the international vibe live from Brownsville
Where we juggle and struggle to survive  YOU KNOW THE DEAL 
We rhyme from 12 to 12 schemin
In the cut on the corner by the bodega with the hammer steamin
Friend forgive him for his sins  he better watch his step 
Mentally Im home alone and since youre deaf
999 of the times Ive got my mojo
BukabupbupbupbupbupbupCLAK like whoa
Aiyyo I bring sorrow you wont make it to tomorrow
Flames spit from the nozzle pop one up in your furrow
STREET TEAM  East coast up toast up
We dont put posters up we post up
Imma front line nigga you dont want mine nigga
Play tough  and I fuck your shape up BUK
You have a wheelchair chaffeur with your arms in slings
Both legs numb from them arms an tings
Its the legendary street team
Kool G Raps  BACK 
Fizzy Womacks  BACK 
Billy Danze  AWW DAMN 
Thats how we do it in the ghetto
Spit fire from the heavy metal  WHERE YOU AT 
Aiyyo  my attributes of life never too nice the rules are too trife
You lose life hit for blue ice dead over two dice
My ape click potty chips body shit
Shotties click on you stick you like PoliGrip
One false move and your body ripped niggas lay in they lobbies hit
Kickback of my gun is like a karate flick Gotti shit
Mothers and hotties hit we stash cash sellin dopen
Cops on the rooftop be telescopin be tryin to bust your melon open
Gates of heaven is closed hell is open shells are smokin
Road blocks yellow tape from four shots
Murder plot door knocks heads drop inside of coops
Get buried in corn crops with tall tops
Hammers drop magnums pop you get spotted
On some six oclock shit on your Magnavox
Taggin your knot stab a lot with ice pick shit Obituary RIP shit
Iller than Pillsbury with the biscuits


Hey yo we step up in the club in a disrespectful manner
Stomp through the crowd wavin the MOP banner
Keep fresh coppertops in the player hater scanner
Who am I  WILLIAM DANZE  Right then you dont wanna know the man
OHH  The hooded soldier one should never overlook
In posession of eternal life as a crook
It been written in the books embedded in the streets
Yeah pushed out of crack spots
And bumped out of jeeps
Im from a place where cats look conspicuously raw
Fitzroy PNoid stickin to his arms
Catch you at a pay phone kickin it to moms
Lift your FaceOff like Nicholas and John
WAVE YOUR FLAG PARTNER  put a hole where you thin
BAM BAM  Pop a hole in your mink hat
Brownsville motherfucker its so true
Put that ass in a threepiece suit with no shoes
Yall niggas act like yall know
First Family Black Guerilla Family united yknow
Its a Queens and BVille thing word up
Yall niggas come scrap witchall heat
Or get laid the fuck down word up no games
Yall niggas know
Bitchass niggas
