Yo I come in the form of danger lurkin
Blastin a mag straight to murkin
Shot at strangers from out the Ranges and Suburbans
Curtains for anybody perpin
Leavin em hurt for certain
Blood on the curb with bandages like turbans
We roll the Durban
All in this dirt puffin the herb and
We bring the verbs and
Double actions loaded with Germans
Areas urban blocks hot where we be swervin
Gun fights strike like a serpent
Leave your nerves jerkin
Lay down any person
Strictly for just target rehearsin
The skills remain tight as Holy Mary the Virgin
Slowly carry the burden
So we varied the shit you heard and
Hit you with the different methods and versions
We simply let bullets rip until the clip is empty
Get laid in your tracks as if you was SMPTE
Hit you like Jack Dempsey
The MACpackin MC with gats clappin like an MP
Open your friendly wimpy frame like a MD
Blow you until your blocks windy
Be on sort of a shot frenzy
My Glocks dont stop til the cops end me
Blow only hollow tops in me
Hazardous shit  guns is accurate
Sendin niggas to meet the King of Nazareth
Playin me close has a risk
I bash cliques like they was masochists
Blast of tear gas thinkin Im pacifist
Pass the fifth
One last kiss before your ass is missed
These bastards is gettin clapped by the strapped activist
Yo let the games begin
The TEC and MAC10 flames begin
Thugs to the end my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firin pins
Me and my kin be makin you spin
The Lord of The Devil be takin you in
Its the Corona Queens apocalypse
My block is hit with a dark eclipse
Take in the hostages and grab the Glocks and clips
The raps apostle as big as the Loch Ness
Large as Colossus is
Marvelous shit get shot at the esophagus
The thug saga novelist
Sex in this rap shit monogamous
Rainin like the tropics while you be topicless
Blood money monopolist
Do it for eons
Shinin like its neon
Heart colder than freon
Decidin which MC to pee on
Baby cause thats the shit that we on
Niggas go to Warrick like Dionne
Put the G on
I analyze guys with Montana eyes
And vandalize any man alive
Soon as the hammer rise cut em down like samurais
Kickin that real shit that you fantasize
Niggas step aside and recognize
That G the real cat pack a steel gat baby feel that
Leave you layin flat wit ya shit clapped and peeled back
Battle at this rap shitll put you in back of a Cadillac
A bad decision fuck up your whole vision like cataracts
Red roses on a dead foe
Layin in wet clothes from head blows
Your whole brain be exposed
Get your body torn out the frame from lead throws
None of my victims ever bled slow
Stiff as Edgar Poe thats how it goes baby
