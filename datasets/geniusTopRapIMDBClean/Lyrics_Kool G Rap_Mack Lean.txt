Born of a hustler Im a bad motherfucker
Keep a pocket full of cnotes some kilos stuffed in his muffler
Pimp daddy mack lean tilt the suede hat mean
Cadillac and pad clean that nickelplated mac gleam
Flare bellbottoms shells he shot em
The hell if he not he a problem like a cell up in Harlem
Shouldve been in an asylum the way he funeral parlour em
Bottom bitch with the healthy bottom
My bells no cotton
Come from a slum off a strip made of legends
See her face with fresh enough mirror paint on that fresh Benz
King of my city I run for mayor election here on
He step in the scene you to the fifth wing what happened
The don is session brunette and blond sex and Im on rest
And my weapon I hit em with arm injections
Firearm your direction no arm wrestling peasants
Palming that bread he got off on the own connections
No question
Pimp daddy with the mack lean
Luxurious suites 80inch flat screens
We made money stickups and crack fiends
New York City certified rap king
Nina 12 gauge
Imagine if I seen ya twelfth grade
Schoolboys how I handle you
Your mack book was a computer mines was a manual
I dared a bitch buy a whole book of Emmanuel
I cook with the mechanicals you shook Thats understandable
I took a gram or two and made a grand or two
Sold to your mother and your grandma too
Oh they a lover of my grandma too but who better than Kool G Rap
Im in the booth with a Biggie sweater this coogie rap
Uzi clap youve been warned
Put the snug to it uniform dont make me clank the nose like a unicorn  get it 
Youve been on for a couple dont diss the forefathers
Your mom dont know who your pops you probably got four fathers
Im from a different era
Violate if you should ever Fred the Godson
Pimp daddy with the mack lean
Luxurious suites 80inch flat screens
We made money stickups and crack fiends

Mannequin nails headline with Steve Harvey
History was Teflon try to stick to degree bodies
No no no bloodline pristine Gotti
Ill with the Rambo knife plus he busting the mean shotty
Weave spinning had emptying in his family
Intelligent hoodlum still familiar with tragedy
One problem away from losing his sanity
Telling whose situation get nasty thats word to vanity
Nightmares and dark fantasies they toetagging me  try to kill me 
Playa had a death wish she kept the best bitch
Whats snapping with fingers he make her step quick
Respect me homie dont play the phony
Them hot shells will turn you to macaroni
Shout out to Treach and Naughty I do my dirt by my lonely
Ninja nigga shinobi
Creeping through the block then walk away like Im Kobe
And play the mirror like Moany
Pimp daddy with the mack lean
Luxurious suites 80inch flat screens
We made money stickups and crack fiends
New York City certified rap king
