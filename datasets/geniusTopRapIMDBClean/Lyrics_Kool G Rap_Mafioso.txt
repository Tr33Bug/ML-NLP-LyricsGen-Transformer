Verse 1
Who macks the most shit smoke ya whole clique like roach clips
Who flows ramped enough to hold drips and float ships
No mo shifts
I hold enough chips to toast Cris
Its G Rap the cat thats on your wanted most list
I wrote this so you could sweat this and soak this
Get the focus the made family kid not the bogus
Youre crime culprits put hot shit up in you like holsters
Left for the vultures with DTs picking up cultures
Threethousand volt ya just like the third rail
And if you heard shells a herb fell swift with the words well
All on my dirt trail
Kick up enough dust to hurt cells
Swerve the SL so get G murk swell the shirt braille
Curved in jail cells for jakes that wanna Hblock those
Niggas in Pacos keep the block froze and the shop closed
Where the pots grow with young cats coppin the drop Roves
Get the Nachos so no cops show when the shots blow
Shit red hot though
Streets remain flooded with Ds
Bundling Kis to maintain a hundred degrees
Main crime wave we handle a beef in 9 ways
Get your mind grazed from TEC9 sprays your spine blazed
When it get too hot on the block better believe the rhyme pays
Put all you cats in cradles if you crave to find graves
Diamond mind crazed rays blindin you with my shine glaze
Unlike them other rappers that get stuck in a time phase
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse 
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
Hes a man that came from the bad lands 
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse 
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distribution
Racketeering prostitution paid executions
Verse 2
Made corporation
Body casing watch where you pacing
Thug orchestration
This is live niggas you facing
We paper chasing for that million baby we lacing
Fifty Caliber gat embracing
Leavin you wit legs without sensation
Whos full of malice Who thug the wildest
Act childish get your body sent to a stylist
Who live the foulest
Be grippin cannons till my hands are callused
Pile this paper longer than mail list from New York to Dallas
Purchase a palace sip coladas with the whole Borgata
Bodies be dropped while I attend the opera
Land on casino roofs in helicopters
In Las Vegas Nevada
Cant stop until I got a casa up in Trump Plaza
929 Mazda foreign chicks talking with accents like they Zsa Zsa
Mean like Idi Amin Dada
Thug saga
Slugs burn you like they lava
You and your bimbo get hit up through your car window
See you an drift slow and let ten blow
From out the darkest shadow
Remain straight as the archers arrow
I spark this barrel hit my target
Even if the mark is narrow
Lay you like a pharaoh
With fragments inside your bone marrow
Get your wig flown just like a sparrow
Chorus
