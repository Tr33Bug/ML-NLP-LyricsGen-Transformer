95 keep it live
Here to make papers knahmsayin
Motherfuckin Kool G Rap and B1
And my motherfuckin man Grimm
Just comin up with somethin to keep the brain stimmed
Its Big 1 son Jamaica Queens is the turf
And Imma exploit heaven and earth for what its worth
Its the MC extraordinaire the jewels glare
The God is rare Im takin bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours strippin niggas to they drawers
No probable cause with the chrome double 4s
Its the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In 84 it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now Im sippin Harveys Bristol Cream with the Glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin to get dough like Pablo  today fuck tomorrow
Seats RECARO as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science
Its the clients that turn smalltime hustlers into giants
Three course meal waitin for my appetizer
Blowin like a geyser time only makes me wiser
Paraphernalia and material makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you sippin beer with two
Handlin business properly form a monopoly
Storefront property if not another robbery
Im puttin forth the effort murders the method
The steak is peppered
Son when I let off you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggas deaded and wetted
Dont forget it  moneys the metal and my hand is magnetic
I gotta flip these bricks cause bein broke drivin me insane
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
From Ozs to Kis the triplebeam bring fame to my name
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
Niggas be schemin they team and but still I maintain
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
Cause money and murder go handinhand
And it aint nothin but a game
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain son
Cryin hopin God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonalds makin mills servin
Fuck a Landcruiser now cause I got two Suburbans
Stressed out sittin thinkin past bedtime
Scared cant sleep nightmares about Fed time
Diamonds linens ostrich and all that
Phat shit Ill talk in code cause my phones tapped
Crackheads worship me like Im Jesus
Uncle Sam cant stand me cause Im fuckin all his nieces
Cuties every color who I wanna fuck next
Buy a new car maybe Lamborghini truck next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck TECs
A large ratio in this game dies
But that Im flippin pies til the Senate legalize


I gotta flip these bricks cause bein broke drivin me insane
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
From Ozs to Kis the triplebeam bring fame to my name
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
Niggas be schemin they team and but still I maintain
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
Cause money and murder go handinhand
And it aint nothin but a game
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain son
Im sportin flavors in Timbs a 95 Benz with the chrome rims
Presidential Rolex two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with lucci leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in restaurants eatin shrimp scampi and sushi
Fly minks with icicles that blink inside Cuban links
Lookin spanked brothers think got loot like Im doin banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammys
The broke niggas cant stand me
Hold the flame blow hotel suites inside the Flamingo
Its owned by the dagos I step up in em rockin Kangols
Straight up fakin no jacks
Cause all my crack shacks are jampacked
My mad stacks show that Im on the right track like Amtrak
So stand back cause Imma make whatever it takes
To shake Jakes and shoot snakes
And bake more snowflake cakes than Drakes
Cut up your grill like Im the Barber of the bill
Steal like Gotti bodies are found inside the harbor cause Im ill
Its war but no more kids are bein kidnapped
Matter of fact aint with the shit black
I was young when I did that
Theres dope in the Copacabanas
Cock back the hammers til niggas in pajamas
Get they wigs split like bananas
Stable of hotties niggas with shotties catchin bodies
Neighborhood John Gotti with more notes than Pavarotti
Yeah Paid as a motherfuckin bank teller
The Goodfella I stay a motherfuckin drug seller
I gotta flip these bricks cause being broke drivin me insane
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
From Ozs to Kis the triple beam bring fame to my name
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
Niggas be scheming their team and but still I maintain
Moneys on my fuckin brain  Get the cream 
Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It aint nothin but a game
Moneys on my motherfuckin brain
