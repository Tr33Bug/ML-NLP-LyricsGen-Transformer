Judge often gave fifteen to QGods
Started riots in the jungle like the Rodney King charges
In LA what up esse  whaddup  I spray tre pounds  yeahhhh 
To nueve Im loco nigga  loco 
Im the one that made attempts on the popo bigger
I put crazy work in  thats right  fuck who criticize my verses
I only rap cuz the streets is sour
The money is good and I couldnt find cheaper powder
I could get on some bullshit  on some bullshit  yall niggas understand me
I keep heat like Miami fry for family  what fry for family 
Rubbing tat for infanity I curse the game

Halfnaked bitches dancin to tunes  uhhuh 
Marble floor to the terrace nigga glance at the moon
Play the jacuzzi til your hands get blue
Rugs tight bright as the white sands of Cancun  yeahhhh 
Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom
Nigga we crop grams in dunes Cuban cigar brand of grandest fumes
Prison niggas that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan to June and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed self built do
Down to the mink pelts gator belts and silk suit
If I cant stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street its spilled juice
So where that Don be In the calm breeze in the palm trees

Bulletproof armory school of the hard knock honoree
Washin the jackpot like laundry
