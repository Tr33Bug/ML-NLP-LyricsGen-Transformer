Giancana the name break it down simple and plain
Went from a small chimp in the game to gorilla king pimpin the game
Know how to tempt dames to tense in the Range
Hit the block to pitch rocks the strength of the name
Limp with a cane lactosin limp for the king
We even pack toast expend from the flames my aim
Strictly about makin that bread pop  yknow  blocks red hot
From feds and cops lookin for rock bottles with red tops
Tradin lead shots with dreadlocks
Infrared dots til their head drop we fled spots
Word on the curb is when it came to birds we spread flocks  no doubt 
No tellin when the bloodshed stop glide til the sled stop
Copped the latest every hot flavor in them crocs and gators
Somebody clique riff pop the bravest
Out of town trips in whips I got from Avis drop knots in Vegas
My plot for paper was crockpots of wafers

Wont stop til I die for this

Ill be thuggin with youuu
Thug it out baby thug it out baby
Wont stop til I die for this

Nigga into warm mansion rooms wall to wall with handsome goons
Halfnaked bitches dancin to tunes  uhhuh 
Marble floor to the terrace nigga glance at the moon
Play the jacuzzi til your hands get blue
Rugs tight bright as the white sands of Cancun 
Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom
Nigga we crop grams in dunes Cuban cigar brand of grandest fumes
Prison niggas that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan to June and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed self built do
Down to the mink pelts gator belts and silk suit
If I cant stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street its spilled juice
So where that Don be  right here  In the calm breeze in the palm trees
Bomb G under the armpiece
Livin in harmony coke farm pharmacy
Bulletproof armory school of the hard knock honorary
Washin the jackpot like laundry
Fuckin Don of the year nominee honestly
All of my life I live
Ill be thuggin with youuu
Thug it out baby thug it out baby
Wont stop til I die for this
Ill be keepin it truuee
