Last night got caught in a gunfight
I think it was like four niggas clutchin they burners and bustin but only could see one in sight
The one on my right yo son he like We both got gripe
He wanted my life committed nigga wit a gun an a knife
He tryin a make me the wiped out nigga layin up under the white
But I aint tryin a go up in no dark tunnel and brung to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight and tryna breathe with one in my pipe
But Im not one of the type and Id rather lose or hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receiving CPR at one in the night
Now I can run and take flight but Im like Yo son Ill be hype
When I play mother nature before she O and clap her thunder tonight
I step right inside of the street light my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ and let my shit slice In front of him twice
Let one splice cause fuckin with price aint tryin a be nice
I want him on ice no back home to a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life shiest but none of its nice
I peeped shit and seen his whole clique was runnin in fright
Instead of comin to fight get some of the fight you son of a dykes
With one in the pipe Im aimin to light the one on the right
They all deceased so yo my asspiece get hunted for life
Four niggas cut down and I could receive one hundred to life
Up in a jail cell thats crawlin with lice and runnin with mice
Live trife fillin appetites with nothin but rice
Slow biz and no kids nigs stay runnin my wife
Only got one life yo get this fuckin gun outta my sight
Back at the house after midnight Im done for the night
