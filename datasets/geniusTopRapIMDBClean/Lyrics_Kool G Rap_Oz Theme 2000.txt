From the street blocks to Cblocks sleep in a box
Creep with an ox got beef from the shop catch heat from the cops
That sharp blade you keep in the crotch
Prison guards deep on the watch
Fifth tier is steep on the drop
If your knees knock theyre peeping it Pop
Though they not speaking a lot
They plot eavesdrop greasin the cock
Come to shove meat in your chops
Flee the spot sheets in a knot
Get tied from your feet to the top
Get caught in the hall make your blood skeet with a mop
If you do a shift in the kitchen bloodll leak in the pot
Its just a long game of sheep and the fox
Phone time beef for your slot
This shitll make you weep in your cot
Mess halls get messy yall
Nigga get shanked up in the chest he fall pressed against the wall got the best of yall
Stitched from neck to balls skin cut flesh and all
Stretched out unless you brawl nothing sexy at all
The life destiny wall hope the Lord bless when he call
Stand like a man or be a Debbie in core  
Heavier they come more heavier for niggas to whore
Could be a predator or dead in the morgue
Spread em some more
x2 
In the prison industrial complex
You got taxes politics jobs death
Growth stunted coldblooded dark and heartless
From the pyramids down to the projects
What do it take Vandal tryin to escape
I got a homemade shank  wrapped the handle with tape
Better move quick fast got a trick for your ass
Niggas in my clique stick dick to your ass
And we dont give a fuck trying to make time pass
Here eat it up feed a nigga fine glass
Got jailhouse wine in the stash
Every time the caf serves swine yo I tell em I pass
Do like Beecher did to Shillinger and shit on your ass
You the feature when Im killing ya a hit on your ass
Supreme Allah said We got time to kill
So when its time to kill we got time to kill
In the yard with the guards when its time to build
And this time is hard got to use my will
See shit has changed ever since they killed Adebisi
You never know  niggas might try to grease me
x2 
Welcome to the prison industrial complex
You got taxes politics jobs death
Growth stunted coldblooded dark and heartless
From the pyramids down to the projects
The image that we project is still God
Time to reflect but the reflection is hard
Like sticking mirrors out between the bars seeing the guards
Seem like everybody innocent regardless of the charge
You face death rape threats and place bets on who getting laced next
Forever faceless never waste breathe
Blowing out the candles that the wind already snuffed out
They locked up your body  your mind could bust out
Police dont sweep to get the dust out
They want your name in the system
My need to mention the death penalty is legal lynchin
People listen they got teenagers up in the lineup
To fill the new facility they built they need the crime up
Please the War on Drugs is really war on the youth
War on the people war on the truth
The violent crimes rise
The silence dies as sirens cry through the night
People fight for whats left and not whats right
x2 
In the prison industrial complex
You got taxes politics jobs death
Growth stunted coldblooded dark and heartless
From the pyramids down to the projects
Word is bond
Darkness
For three days straight
Only darkness  think of it
Sittin in your house for three days
No lights no TVs not even the flashlight you keep for a blackout
