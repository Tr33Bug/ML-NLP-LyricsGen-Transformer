You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You can bop your head to it or get it popped off
Yeah the clique got niggas with names
And they pitstop to get at your dame
And if you riff pop Ill spit at your frame
Dont get it mixed up just get it arranged
You gonna need a syringe and a needle to get it in vein
Keep them wolves on his back like he Grizzly Adams
I get rejected by a chick I throw my whiskey at em
Your best friend will curse you out like bitch you had him
And he right the lights is low and the ice is still blowin
And he got a whole waist of big faces like Samoans
Chest piece like I got stoned by the Romans
And dont try to keep up if your money Gary Coleman
Nothing but Sprewell V12s yeah what else
Be still stuck with that V8 what you tryna stay healthy
Keep the cost of your whip I blow them chips out in LV
Far as brick spots more kis passed than Dell B
And G Rap lost He falling off as soon as hell freeze
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You can bop your head to it or get it popped off
Concealing my lines
Unappealing at times
Cant rap worth a damn
Fam I really can rhyme
Shot to your temple
Puss pour pop at your pimple
Indeed the Gshock with the watch presidential
Goofs and bagoons
Bitches got balloons in their wombs
Literally shitting bricks in their Fruit of the Looms
Thug in his essence
Drug is the preference
Bitch the mother father sister brother love is the message
P a primate in his prime
Think of violating the ape ape be changing your mind
The fellow saw dumb shit
Fuck cops that popped at Eleanor Bumpers
I came to lean haters
Faggot ass church niggas and tambourine players
Ruck thuggin machine
You a nothin butt plugin and nut huggin your jeans


You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You can bob your head to it or get it popped off
Could care less about your shooters and street respect you still a wreck
This killer strapped two guns smoking big as Gorilla Black
Shit is facts I dont do fantasy when the hammer squeeze
Green thumb D1 gun rose and plant your seeds
Get it popped off in a second I dont plan to freeze
Too Legit toolll spit got em shaking like Hammers knees
What you niggas know about murders that you did yourself
Red dot headshot body drop and shit itself
I flip scripts and spit out a motion picture
Im Scorsese they all hate me Im poured liquor
You poor baby I court Lacy and owe your sister
The whore made me get all crazy I know you miss her
I blaze first then ask questions who want the interview
Ill send a few causing a racket blow off his tennis shoes
So make way for the bad guy
If Im masked out best believe Ill make your ass die
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
Yall wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
You can bop your head to it or get it popped off
You wanna get it popped off
