Raw  Extended Alternate  Version  LyricsOne two doin a few for you
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow so
Get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you are loungin around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
I do declare Gettin busy is where its at
But with what youre sayin you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rockin How many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothin you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect
Im out to collect cash money but thats another subject
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin
To sound like me so soon Ill have to open
A school of emceein for those who wanna be in
My field and court but then again on second thought
To have MCs comin out soundin so similar
Its quite confusin for you to remember the
Originator and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator but Im much greater
Im A number one second to none
A sufficient title for me would be champion
Of any event in which I present
Fresh lyrics you hear it and mark them excellent
Very exquisite and explicit
Extraordinaire so what is it
Nothin but the finest your supreme Highness
Out to diminish delete and minus
All rappers thats inferior playin my area
Rhymes I recite will make them deteriorate away
And just get this straight
To compete I will defeat and totally humiliate
All imitation with the combination
Of rhymes more deadlier than Freddy or Jason
Ill be on ya like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know youd step the hell off
On a peaceful eve give me space to breathe
The way I be rockin you wouldnt believe
Im athletic energetic my rhymes are poetic
And while others are pathetic my style is copacetic
Innovator dominator rhyme creator
My rhymes are food for your party now allow me to cater
Cause Im the rappers idol and my title is so vital
MCs tryna take it Results are homicidal
All MCs try to handle me are led to misfortune and calamity
So to whom it may concern please try and learn
That in a battle with the Kane you just get burned
Cause Im a slayer rhymesayer thats out to kill
Progress manifest drop science and build
And any rapper tryna stop me from comin through
Like Chaka Khan I Feel For You
Destruction and corruption is what will occur
Much damage bein done as I injure
And when I get through rockin the mic like this
Youll have to thank the God Almighty if you still exist
Like that yall its like that yall
And when my Ballys run down I get taps yall
So Kool G Rap my mellow my man
Get on the mic with the gangsta plan
This little note is like a formula the antidote
For copycatters I quote they wanna deepthroat
Lyrics that I wrote placed upon a beat so neat
Orchestras and bands cant compete or compare
Or even come near to this here
This is a mere affair you just stare and cheer
Crystal clear to your ear perhaps some rappers are up there
To me theyre just Hollywood Squares
Music I create rotates on a plate
And I know some people hate me because Im great
Got a lot of females cause my records make sales
While the others on the shelf is goin slower than snails
And this shows the pros are so composed
Also enemies and foes to G Rap theyre only zeros
Not heroes theyre fractions minus the action of satisfaction
Also the brain of the main attraction
Im not mixed with any studio tricks
No special effects like you see in the flicks
Im dramatic so there you have it Im fantastic
Competitors are plastic stretch em like elastic
Then grab the microphone
And create a relaxin tone like a saxophone
If you dont like it then use the exit to hell with it
Im Kool G Rap and I made it I did it
Mission completed suckers are defeated
I sweated and bleeded but yet I succeeded
So please be aware that this is a war
If the shoe fits wear it cause thats what its made for
My metaphors are excellent yours are poor
My literature will score more for sure
The creature feature searcher preacher teacher
Torture rupture capture rapture reach ya
Musical master rhyme reacts as a
Brain that has the knowledge of NASA
Youre just a KitKat small as a TicTac
But Im a Big Mac cause Im G Rap
Well equipped with a hiphop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bassll give a shake of an earthquake
Itll make you sucker MC wanna jump in the lake
Cause Im murder homicide comma
Crush kill destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker sound seeker you become weaker
My art is a smoker your material is mediocre
The rap Olympia devastate the area
Im gettin brainier lyrical mania
Power source energy enforced
Your headboards will need Red Cross
So come one or two step through a few
Doubles and couples and Ill cripple all triples huh
You cant handle it
None or any one or many some or plenty
Cause Im not a stranger just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive keep out danger
Packin Gs while you try to be me
But for these MCs I call em the wannabe Gs
What I write is in the smokin section
Heres an injection of rap perfection
So what the heck You select my dialect
Next mans cassette yo reject and eject
Cause I could use a technique modern or antique
Beats never repeat show you that I can speak
Totally properly but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy just like Monopoly
Figure it out
Kool G Rap is about makin armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
Cause when I start rappin I keep the people clappin
Suckers that be yappin dont think that this can happen
