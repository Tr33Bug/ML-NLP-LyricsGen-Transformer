Kool G Rap
I spit a lot of gangsta shit but you know I like to refer to it more as just reality rap you know what Im sayin And if you ask me how long is that gonna stay around thats always gonna be around
Yall gon feel me on this one
Aight real real rap
Fuck is the deal man
Its game over raw coke on the mirror by the 
Two dames on my shoulders they hanging over they training yoga
Sexin them crazy Im sinking colas Im yanking molars
Like Im supposed to my main soldier swinging his toasters
Nigga hard cold as a polar bears bake from the rover
Threeleaf clovers if you ever thought my reign was over
The pipe game I have him flying with his stinking odor
I push a button on your life like its a game controller
Mahogany bed with a mommy on the spread
Im a monster nigga turned into a zombie for this bread
Dont think Im claiming Im banging cause their Mazis bloody red
The sawedoff doublebarrel filled up with double lead
Fuck blowing your head off Ill blow your body from your head
Its the return of a don
Got nothing but dick for the world
A kiss for mixing me wrong
Its the return of a don
Homie a rink is nothing
If  thanks for nothing
Its the return of a don
Go in and tell every slinger  that holds pimps
Tricks are charms
Its the return of a don
And he about to get dirty
The hand goes as pearly Im going in early I mean it
