Shit aint never gonna change  Fuck it 
Time to load the clips  Then we take em to war 
Niggas wanna flip  Then we take em to war 
Break a nigga proper  Then we break him some more 
I represent the murderers and felony offenders
Who even bought time out to get these legal tenders
Surrender  Nah Im goin out with a bang nigga
Fuck Pataki I gotta do my thang nigga
Fortyfour mag bustin into action
Brains left in particles fragments and fractions
Grimm the money stacker heat packer
Im lurkin Im waitin attackin like a linebacker
Fuck what you heard crime pays
And always unorthodox I hold my pistol sideways
We kill crews hearts go numb
And if retaliation comes then yo fuck itit just comes
Yo who you  Im Dr Death motherfucker ever heard of me
Close your eyes cross your fingers time for surgery
Im already dead so nahyou cant murder me
Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly
Shit aint never gonna change  Fuck it 
Time to load the clips  Then we take em to war 
Niggas wanna flip  Then we take em to war 
Break a nigga proper  Then we break him some more 
Since I murder for hire rapid fires what I require
Makin niggas perspire so send a message through the wire
Cause violence is contagious it got me bustin gauges
The 95 Larry Davis and Im wettin niggas for wages
Queens is the home of 1 the known felon
And aint no tellin when Imma crack your fuckin melon
For the right amount of chips I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin niggas bloody the leather seats is where the shit drips
With the poundseven I be creepin rockin niggas while they sleepin
Shots repeatin leavin faggot niggas leakin
When I cock back the iron niggas is dyin marchin to Zion
Cause the poundcake roars like a lion
Word son niggas be collapsin cause my weapons is
Ready for action makin your heart catch contractions
In the underworld shootin gallery niggas lose calories
Cause my salarys based on fatalities
Shit aint never gonna change  Fuck it 
Time to load the clips  Then we take em to war 
Niggas wanna flip  Then we take em to war 
Break a nigga proper  Then we break him some more 
Here I come to get some motherfuckin wreck but first I gotta
Umm vest check gun check clip one check clip two check Im set
So let a motherfucker move a muscle
When I tussle theyll be piecin niggas back like fuckin puzzles
Cause Kool G Rap is known for bringin mad noise Im bad boy
When I was younger always carried guns I never had toys
Grimm gimme the infrared and semi and Im puttin red dots
On niggas foreheads and makin motherfuckers Indian
You got beef Go get yourself a wreath because its murder
Cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fopound
Cock back rock black gun a nigga down
I see em hes comin out the fuckin colosseum
And hopped into a BM shit
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk then we start to glide
Im rainin on him  faster nigga  oh yeah were gainin on him
Oh shit hes with somebody else  fuck it put his brain on him
Boom boom no survivors lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him hell be a backseat driver
But I aint finished with the trigger yet Im lightin up a cigarette
Bang Bang I left the other nigga wet
Its G Rap baby you know me you try to hurt this
I split your fuckin top and leave a fingerprint on purpose
