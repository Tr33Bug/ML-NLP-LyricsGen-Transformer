Killers in spanish villas in Sante Fe
Eses all about hammer play
Desell Marachi preferred to watch me
Its a Tekilla Sunrise over the sky
Tea rocks in the watch be flaring but hot see
Got these from my nigga Vatche
How big your blanks be aint nothin scotfree
Im ready to cop three talk to me papi
Before the shots put out the Nazis
Call off your Rockies
Yo pap they cockin back the glocksies
Pap had to stop three two sombreros ready to
Mop me drop me proceeded with the head of the click
Bread in their fingertips
The sly chick came out with three bricks
From out of the V6 yeah mami like peep this
Yeah you got that sweetness
This ebony Gs to bust open
One of the bastard get the heavenly freeze
Im runnin with these
Yo hasta luego amigos
And up and away we go
Before they decide to bring the beef burritos
While they count the Fritos
Im makin my way to the GS3ohoh
Big bag of the megalitos three whole kilos
Spot about four vitos
With bullet belts filled up with torpedos
Im leavin niggas tore meat though when I draw heat yo
Tryin to leave me dead in the street yo
Mami  con tigo
Showdown at sunset Im leavin one wet
Slowly I step my head sweats my hand on my Tec
I die for my respect let the slugs and bodies connect
All for the wreck gotta support my rep on the set
Tekilla Sunrise my two wives decides who lives or dies
Leavin my rivals flat on they back facin the sky
From out the left took your last breath death in disguise
With open eyes you dead in the desert Tekilla Sunrise
Im cockin on low ready to hurt foes on dirt roads
Makin my hand jerk from every burst I gave the first blow
Keepin alert though givin em red glows givin they shirt holes
Three birdsll blow up in the back seat I swear to God fuck
She couldve been a model Coke bottle figure instead
She bent it just like a Desperado left her hair hollow
Two slugs to swallow  whose next to follow
Some cats behind some cactuses
Clappin hazardous who these niggas is with low shot averages
Bustin right back at they cabbages givin em flashbacks
Of baby carriages this mexican inside this Lex is
Tryin to crash my shit drivin reckless
Look like he desperate
Pulled down the tinted glass and let the Tec spit
Its hectic car flew in bodega with his neck hit
Body and head was seperate totally disconnected
Bust back two shots
At ones that standin with cannons up on the rooftops
That drew Glocks but my 2020 spot em for two blocks
Im wettin shit like its rainfall they doin dew drops
Two more shots came out saloon doors
Im blowin shit up like platoon wars
Hesitations I got no room for
Assume sure the head honcho was bullet wounds bored
Out in the dusty sand gun was still in his hand
Kicked the can when shit hit the fan
Fuckin around with this G Rap the Hitman
This is Mary White reporting live from the town of
Seenalojo Mexico where there are dead bodies
LITTERING THE STREETS  Details remain sketchy at
Thr moment but  this appears to be a drug deal gone bad
Mexican authorities have just arrived on the HIDEOUS scene
And will be issuing a statement shortly
This is Mary White reporting live from the town of
Seenalojo Mexico  Back to you DICK
Showdown at sunset Im leavin one wet
Slowly I step my head sweats my hand on my Tec
I die for my respect let the slugs and bodies connect
All for the wreck gotta support my rep on the set
Tekilla Sunrise my two wives decides who lives or dies
Leavin my rivals flat on they back facin the sky
From out the left took your last breath death in disguise
With open eyes you dead in the desert Tekilla Sunrise
