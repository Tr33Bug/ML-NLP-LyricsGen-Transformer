Yo is it me or the damn chain  My chains 
Is it me or the champagne  Let me know 
Is it me or the tan Range
Is it the dame cant restrain cause the man flames
Youre the type a bull a little smaller with the damn rings
Is it she see me push the business around
Is she living in a town where syringes are found
Is it cause she know Im rakin in stupendous amounts
Invite you out to the house and your friends is aroused  like wow 
It just couldnt be the waiters and the catered food
Great booze lake view and a room like a Laker do
Just to show you what a good amount of paper do
The big faces he drew look like a cape would move
Laced with jewels wrist neck chest full of ice
Look like you ran inside of Tiffanys and pulled a heist
Where you stay inside the PJs is full of mice
Yo its just me you like Cut it out you pullin pipe
Theres a limit to your love
Yo whats the meaning to your love Ma
Theres a limit to your love
Tell me the meaning to your love Ma
Theres a limit to your love
Whats the meaning to your love Ma
Theres a limit to your love
Tell me the meaning to your love
Is you here for the long run
Is you here for the long sums
See where you at if a storm come
I bet you up and leave a breeze like its no wrong done
A ounce of weed a day baby you got some strong lungs
But what would happen if God forbid Im in an accident
Lose my two legs and my back is bent
And every stack sent to doctors for puttin brackets in
I bet youd say Salute captain and go and pack your tents
First time I seen a chick do a backwards limp
I be like What happened baby I thought G Rap your prince
Shit brought you back to senses when a nigga back in rent
I bet youd have a foot forward and one back to sprint
When its all gone and life no longer immaculate
When his pockets flat and he down in the dumps
The whips no longer thumping those sounds in the trunk
Now you frail and youre sunken like you crown of the chumps
