We bring the thug shit for real nigga
You know how we do
Yall know how a nigga bring it
Straight direct at you kid
Like a Don from out of Sicily under the arm is where the pistol be
Top of your forehead the kissll be
Planted ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture before the torch apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seat of his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
Ill die a rich man before the FBI figure me
40 stories up inside a highrise in Italy
No hidden forces only natural causes deliver me
Gray hairs from the great years the fears never shiver me
Reminiscing how we carbombed ignitions
Of politicians judges strongarmed to listen
Men turnin up dead or hurt harmed and missing
Bulletproof cars are driven Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk
Gettin surrounded by bitches blowin cigars drunk
One of my stonefaced goonsll make your heart pump
Electrocution with cables that make ya car jump
The yard punks that sittin with a life sentence for sellin hard junk
The Family the whole Commission
Has been around since the days before prohibition  no doubt 
Mathematics was good then no slow addition
Some overdosed down a coke slope a dope addiction
Lookin back on them days I ran a whole division
Some of the Jake and the state was tryin to throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission
Beyond these tracks
A life of networking sippin bourbon and cognyac
First version observin the stock and bonds we stack
The chronicles these are the days of Don G Rap
With murder on his mind take it in blood
We takin that aim and niggas throwin shit in the game
How it feel when we comin at you these gats blowin at you
Personally dont give a FUCK where you at
And an unfamiliar face you know we like WHO DAT
On point nigga it aint goin down like that
We do our thing underhandedly still tuck a mill
For the family will mansion and hot wheels in Amityville
Treat a snitch nigga like Sam when he squeal
Break the code of silence just hand me the steel
For every wrong done a manll be killed theres plans to rebuild
Curtains and drapes got these Jakes tryin to can me for real
Until then be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canopy ill
With two mamis handin me thrills Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubber banding these bills tryin to duck the fame and the glamour
Tryin to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searchin the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some of them got they bodies slumped for capers
Barcaleno hat ducks and gators
Got a crib full of housemaids butlers and waiters
My clique from the minor league jump to major
We gon rock until we jackpot FUCK THEM HATERS
If we have to run up in City Hall abduct the Mayor
Any man against the master plan can fuck with craters
