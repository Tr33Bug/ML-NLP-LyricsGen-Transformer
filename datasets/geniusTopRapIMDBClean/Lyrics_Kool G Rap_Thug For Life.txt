Im thug for life aint no changin me
Im thug for life aint no changin me
I pop off guns and live dangerously
Im lot more nigga than you aimin to be
My Range bling platty chain hang to the knee
Im thug for life aint no changin me
Aiyyo who got the drop my gun been cocked
Spits from fourfives to flintlocks pinky finger with the pimp rock
Hustle on dim blocks and sip Hennrock
Draw quick got a second hand like Big Ben clock  ya heard 
Reach for that heat put your wig in the wind pop
Fill your belly with ten shots if I get hit
And you see blood then flood the bullet wound with gin shots
Put beef in a Slim Jim box
Bitch you wanna pinch and win slot
Clap lead until your big friend drop
Niggasll front until I send chin shots
Beat the rock until they send cops  or what 
Til one of usll get carried out on the thin cot
Emergency room skin chopped by ten docs
Got it locked like a bid in the state pen box
When I dares peers hangin to where my shin stop before I struck rich
Fucked bitches and killed em with a ten inch cock  freal 
Bitch nigga stuck him with a ten inch ox  yknow 
Bread bloods and stiff vodka deep in this game
Know the feds want the clique locked up
We love brain so we headhunt like witchdoctors
My lil momma let lead dump from big poppa
Even the Jake surrounded the spread with pig choppers
That taste preposterous tear gas tanks of oxygen
Like we in banks with hostages  what we want 
All we want is minks and ostriches  what 
Diamond cuff links and proper shit
Snitches left stinkin in carpet stiff
Or get they carcasses turned to link sausages  freal 
Aint nuttin sweet we known for bangin cartridges
We got the heart for this
No matter how light or dark it is  ya heard 
No matter how light or dark it is freal 
Thug for life  what  Rep by strips  killers 
Let loose clips  dealers  Stack mad chips  you know we 
Bag bad chicks  my niggas  Push fly whips  all of the 
Hoes blow dick  nigga  G flows sick  what 
My whole life about chrome rims and stone gems  what 
Big boned skins Capone brims dick blown in my own Benz
Quick to Scarface thugs who raise up blown brims
Dolla trickin never politickin with grown mens
Ideas of settin me up for loot I wont bend
Just make that light bulb at the top of your dome dim  uhhuh 
Who raphappy nigga keep the lyrics and poems grim
Get found at the bottom of the river with stone Timbs  word 
Babyface swimmin flash stomach and toned limbs
Wake up every mornin work out in the home gym
Reppin this rap game until my zone ends  uhhuh 
Til mixin boards melt down the microphone bend  yea 
I spit about street shit but never condone sin
Kept it thug for life baby followed my own trend
Kid Word thug shit
Queens shit for life nigga
