Strictly for all the chicks thats on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that dont ever trip to hit 
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew
Strictly for all the chicks thats on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that dont ever trip to hit 
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew
Dont know who is this kid you better check the formula
Before I have to send these busters just to warm you up
Man Homicide be looking for whoever tore you up
Flood up the whole block with paramedics and coroners
I can roll up all by myself and make a street close
Yo you could be twenty deep and still get your feet rose
Believe me aint none of them running up when heat blow
You sleep though youre whole sweet and low
Free to go deeper than six feet low
This wiseguys enterprise we emphasize who ever die
Never sympathize still on the rise no matter how many we minimize
We send  chicks with bricks inside their inner thighs
Some real thugs conduct the drug traffic in the skies
Never high we lay low stay unidentified its all live
Chorus
Strictly for all the chicks thats on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that dont ever trip to hit 
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew
Yo its the radical mathematical fanatical
Magnifico money making myth in Mexico
You try to fuck me yo Ill bust you in your cherry whole
Still run the streets and now you feeling me in stereo
I felt the graces from the highs to the very low
One day your counting money next yo you digging holes
Dont try to do this at home this is professionals
Congressionals street medal award winners
Making a point thats hollow do you follow wanna meet tomorrow
What greet the heffer with the pink pucker sucker
Cut out your luck with a wink of an eye
Make ya die make ya fly in the sky you asking why
While your souls floating over me you owing me
You shouldnt been owing me not blowing me
Now your lifes a big mystery a casualty
Another faded memory thats awful Bee
Cuz Im still breathing steadily
You think that Pokaface is bluffing nigga ante up
And unless you ramming me with that iron put your jammie up
You pointedly regret Ill blaze you and your family up
You on your ass for showing trying to show it pull your panties up
Me and these cats we making a living making sure you dont
Informations not to be given making sure you wont
Shits real now wanting to be dead goes off in play it clothes
ATF here but scared to get close like in WACO
Nickel plate pros made men who make those
My red eye dont  but best believe it shakes foes
Reflex reaction if i hear you disrespect the fashion
Fuck these niggas like menage giving them double action
Up to no good fellas making out a faux pas
Savage niggas turn your cabbage into cole slaw
Using my dome causes to notify your next of kin
The snitch you looking for hes in the trunk I left him in


Strictly for all the chicks thats on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that dont ever trip to hit 
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew
Strictly for all the chicks thats on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that dont ever trip to hit 
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew
