Yo if you make a lotta cream and dont share them stacks
Yeah it aint where you from its where you at
I know a lotta niggas thatll tear your back
It aint where you from kid its where you at
Listen if you goin out of town and dont bear them gats
It aint where you from kid its where you at
If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap
Dogs it aint where you from its where you at
Shit thug listen  What up baby 
Aint nothin round here but drug addiction
Niggas is antilovelivin
The sluggivin little shortie on the snub itchin
For beef he might get left in the street with his blood drippin
The poor niggas sling crack real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be  Yeah speak to no one 
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run some guys light the blunts up
And then what  And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin to speed a nigga pulse up
Yo hes a cold blue  victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin hot flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots fiddle with Glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks hoes and thugs  Thats right 
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin on your do with gloves
Let the 44 blow for grub its no love


You got uniformed cops the Ds when its hot
TNT knockin down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin they case they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your moneys that long you aint that strong
Informantsll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you
Thats your competition them niggas tryin to eat too
Theyll set you up for dead if you dont show strength
Extort all your workers cause you aint built for this
Plus stickup kids and jealousass niggas
You gotta watch your front sides and your back  Damn 
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin so fed
