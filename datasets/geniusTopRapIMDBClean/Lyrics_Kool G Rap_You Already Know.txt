This where legends get made claim titles through the edge of a blade
Afro bro flow smoother than 70s suede
Number one headband hold an edge youse a dead man
No wrist IDs IVs or bed pans
Sword stroke left hand blood in the red sand
You know where I rep the desert lands where the desert blam
Queens baby working my heavy hands dudes call him Afro
Get sliced down from wig piece to asshole
And yall talk like Im the one to listen
Im on a long mission dude is gone fishing
Seven thirty early you beating the dog fisherman
I dont chase em or replace em I fish em in
I take a rib shot and walk away whistling
Plot on tops of the five fam at the christening
Bubble goose double loop like the Michelin man
Streets of NYC to the Michigan man
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Straight out the woods where the hoods dont come
Its the legend and Im second to none son its better to run
Try and test before you get to ya gun
You gon leave wit ya head in the trunk
Sho nuff Im a beast on the strength realize
You done said ya last words once I reach for the hip
Man dont even give me reason to flip its the season to flip
You know the drill so dont even resist
The kid lives wit the blade one wit the jungle
Calm and Im humble but I said it in the rage
Im looking for some getback getback
Im quick to push ya wig back nigga shouldnt have did that
Now Im on your ass like tight pants
All across mountain top deep water and highlands
See me see the Indian dance for all yall
Im death in the flesh remember my face
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
Boy you know you already know boy you already know
