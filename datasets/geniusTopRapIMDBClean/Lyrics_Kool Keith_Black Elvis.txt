Black Elvis  Black Elvis 
We get raw with this  hand me my guitar 
Tour bus packed  tour bus packed 
Black Elvis recordin in the 48track studio
Madison Square Garden soundcheck to speak direct
Fans in the upper level backstage passes
Wearin diamonds around my glasses leather coat
Thirty thousand from Wilson countin the mills
Im talking to Andre Harrell with a chaffeur drivin me around
In the green Rolls Royce parked parallel on Fifth Avenue
Steppin in Bloomingdales waitin for Celine Dion to get her nails done
Tour dates start tommorrow MCI send the cash through Wells Fargo
Black Elvis 28 Gs a night
Tour bus with the Motley Crue who gon stop who
Rock star dont need no tattoo
Guitar out of the sharp Fender bass with the Stratocaster
With Prodigy Rage Against the Machine flyin over the Atlantic ocean
With the potion
Black Elvis rock star walkin down Broadway
What yall thinkin about
Black Elvis rock star walkin down Broadway
Chillin in the project hallway
Tour bus painted neon green with black wheels
We do big wheels count big head Franklin bills
Movin up thats when Im Black Elvis at the Civic Center
Promoter book venues that are too small ignore the call
Seventy thousand jam packed arenas
With rock fans wearin backpacks
Merchandise sell nice gold shirts with red lights
Sponsored by Dial soap and a Heineken
The biggest rock star gon rhyme again
Roadie cases for eight months Samsonite suitcases
Rappers comin home with no money on the red eye with dead eyes
Stadium tickets watch scalpers get wicked
Pull up in my limo ejecting your demo  your demo 
Stretch lamborghinis with four doors with four floors
Followin right behind yours basic Continental
Get out your rental before I get mental
Yeah baby 
Huge signs on highways you see the biggest advertisements
Im at Tim Mandelbaums office getting my next assignment
Walk in the Sony building grab checks
Stop in a Hilton Warner BrothersChapell on the back
Of my royalty statements my name is Matthew
Three apartments on the West with 200 songs
Five minutes each on Ampex reels
At the Shark Bar chewin billionaire meals
At the Apollo can you digest
Im a hard act to swallow
With a Paris France model with a real estate agent
Thats building me a kids playground in Denver Colorado
Vacation unknown when Im speakin 3way with Roberto Duran
And Sugar Ray Leonard on the cellular phone
Upstate Connecticut hold you rap style with a better grip
Im a rock star now
