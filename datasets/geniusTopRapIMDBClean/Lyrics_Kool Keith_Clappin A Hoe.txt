Sample of EazyEs BoysNTheHood  Remix 
Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
If you a faker stop hallucinating
Stop procrastinating we dont run with traitors
We so real were so bout it bout it pimping
Aint no cash flowing unless its strictly stricken
Aint no weed blowing unless youre going half
Aint no liquor pouring until you pay your tab
Aint no bitches bending over backwards 
Steady pouring something that I  lack 
And stack up with money  were loaded to death 
These niggas thats bummy  they hate me to death 
But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go oneonone they value their health
They know Ill slap a ho straight to the moon
Like I was an animal sadistic goon
Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money  thats doom 
Power to people that hustle like me
247 they grind these streets
Shine like gemstones when I creep
Ooh  blind mine enemies
I dont know the definition of sleep
If I couldnt starve  I wouldnt eat 
So my main focus is my cheese
And slap any ho that dont heed ugh
If she a prob if she cool
If she a dog if she rude
If she a prob if she cool
If she a dog if she rude  Yeah 
Slap a ho x8
Backing them up pushing them down
Blocks up Im knocking them down
Coked up fucking around
Pee on the nose my writing gross
Microphone sipping Patron
Breaking the center slap the dungs
Make them sung like Simone
Drawers made by Louis Vuitton
What we design  slimes
Block clop fizzy activity
Diggitywiggity dickitynickity
Wickedywickedy ball out
The girls with titties slang dope
You make it rain  more
Come fly to Ukraine spazz up
Hop in the truck pop your dog
Get tummy tucked run and duck
A Uncle Buck move with us
You cool with us I dod them up
Like groupie dust how it sound
Coke puffs who roll the blunt
Now what you want tonktonk
My car horn go bompbomp
You beepbeep I bonkbonk
Excursion rider hand glider
Put my finger right inside her
She was wet wetwet wetwetwet wetwet
