Clifton  Santiago  Lyrics
Yeah straight from the ranch
Motion Man echoes
J Reno Kool Keith echoes
Kool Keith
I used to rock a booty butt banger with a hanger
Snap back with back slaps bypass them corny raps
Perhaps some action maxin in the Turb relaxin
Unique investigator sportin Mauri alligators
From here to Virginia clubs when I step up in ya
Tailormade from my toes to my shoulder blade
Extreme act up on front stage make em back up
You get that workout that head piece gettin slapped up
Now turn yo lip up you drop that mic you turn yo lip down
I spin on stage like blowin mics make you sit down
From here to North Carolina 95 to South Carolina
Atlanta Georgia Florida flowin down like Im water
Mexican Indian fly girls the Puerto Ricans
Pumpumpump the eightoheightoheightoheightoh peakin
Now start spectacular expert them legs will work
Bronx Bomber watch em strip Eddy tip that fine mama
Hydraulics expand while drums bang like Gap Band
I clap hand take his mic give him five to my man
Switch his work to talent shows I do concerts
Light up shirts like 4th of July atomic fireworks
Extraction attack white backpacks on wack macks
Yeahhhhhhhh
Chorus Motion Man  Kool Keith  repeat 2X 
Clifton Santiago
Keith Telavasquez  PSYCH 
My name is Cadillac Clifton Santiago
At the bodega I need a fat sandwich major
You know my switches Impala drop scrapin sparks
I mack these bitches white Asian Puerto Rican
Black Russian Haitian with jungle fever I aint hatin
A cup more Coppertone Im cappin on your kinky ear
Bitches they stare cause Im WILD cock diesel
Boy hopin that I recognize they girls in this song
Boddaboomboddabing boddabingdabingbong yo check it
I call up Televasquez hes gettin ass
And when he finish call up Santiago and bring the cash
Im out to desecrate move wild Western state
I got your sister lickin ass suckin hairy balls
My occupation downfall and bringin niggas bad luck
My name is Clifton Santiago salesman at the mall
Im full  a hundred niggas deep up in the movies
Like Greg Im groovy yo Bobby sit and watch the movie
And kick that ho out with that one tooth lookin goofy
Shes on my tab better make popcorn to pay her half
They know Im wild I dont mess around with chickenheads
Barney and Fred Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles
On different channels lyrics 

Chorus
Slidin through the back of the do
You didnt see me in the midst with my pistol Ev Dog
Flyin heads is my job I will clobber you
Walkin backwards shoes and jacket turned around
Gloves on opposite hands
Can you recognize me
I wear Blu Blocker shades so you cant see what I see
Holdin a mirror up so I dont run into nobody
But I dont care cause I know karate  HIYAH 
Vulcan Pinch and that Yoga too
Dont you know Im Stretch Armstrong in the flesh
With a mocha tan and a criminal mind
Like Chairhead Chippendale yeah
Comedy Yes no Maybe not
But if I got a lip dont zip
Baggy jeans on walkin through a crowded room
Avoid all contact with me click boom
People scatter stop that chatter they resort to screamin
Am I dreamin drunk or just zooted out
I need help call 911 pronto
My modus operandi is complete
One down many to go others to show
That Noggin Nodders aint no fuckin circus sideshow
Ringling and Barnum and Bailey we are not
Wild Kingdom Mutual of Northern Cal
Hahahaha
Chorus 2X
