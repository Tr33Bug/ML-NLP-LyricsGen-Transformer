Yeah headin across country
Aint no stoppin
Diesel truckin baby  poppin NoDoz for nights
Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway  tanks full of gas
Look in your rearview kid Im up on yo ass
Diesel trucks with big engines Caterpillar motors
Yall move over we honkin the horns behind your Escalade
Bambambambammm Thats us
With one overload behind your Range Rover truck stops
Last night we made the drops air pressure on the brakes
Fssssssssshew one tank better than Jake
Yall talk a lot of mouth while we pulled up at the waffle house
Interstate we movin forward 18 gears the bridge aint closed
4008 Peterbilt orange and gray longnose haulin apples grade A
Swap trailers on payday
Your meat get delivered on tough beats
While yall supposed to be movin on tough streets
Play it back baby crank the pipes I dont think they got heat
Breaker 19 this is Fat Mic 
Diesel truckin baby  poppin NoDoz for nights
Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway  Im overweight runnin late
Didnt stop at the scale highway patrol on my tail
Diesel truckin baby  poppin NoDoz for nights
Lookin out the tight skirts rollin up the turnpike
Rollin down the highway  tanks food gas
Look in your rearview kid Im up on yo ass
Diesel monster truck rollin huh burgundy
Surly more deadly and ready for roadkill melee
I shear runnin over deers and queers
Niggas way back suck cheers and beer last chance for fear
Hey  HELLLLOHH little kiddie
Pink bows in your hair and ahh youre lookin  pretty
What I really look like I leave no one else
No mercy a killer kiss my pinkie ring come kiss it
Sit in fun seats shiny skirts big dice on the dash
Flamin all lost with David Lynch highbeams flash
The cash in ya brastrap is how much I spent on hubcaps
Blew my 8 cylinder right before I split ya
Put a nice suck me suck me cut me orgasm champagne
Vibe bully pistol me kink throw me slit my throat shut me out
It was out in my diesel truck that I call Lil Sally


Man youre ready for Kansas up here Im rollin
21 gears behind a lady drivin a Volkswagen I cant stand this
Box weight ox weight
I gotta be in Grand Rapids at a quarter to 8 not a quarter too late
When I hit the clutch everything shake
I dont know what route Imma take
Hit Flying Js in the Great Lakes
Engine red hot his coffee pot two barrels of fuel on each side
I laugh at the gas exit when youve gotta stop
Respect all the way up to the radars check my rearview
Wave at weigh stations its all love for you
With sheriffs and cops Detroit diesel engine you cant stop
When the reindeer lock everything stay 100 speed limit
Watch the grill block
Watch out out there this is Fat Mic up the road they got a jackknife
