Yeah girl
Ive been checkin out Big Willie Keith
He been trickin a lot of bills on me
Mmmhmm
I think Imma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah thats what Imma do
Yeahhhh
Im like a freak from Hunts Point the Bronx and the Goat
Wear my drawers in tight mode naked with no coat
Walkin around I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots and hair like Medusa
Brownskin fine I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty Im up in here feelin naughty
I like the gogo girl go head work it shorty
I got no time to trick on the average girl
Im in paradise caught up in the booty world
And for you regular honies tryin to play fly
I aint no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot everybodys butt naked
Pump with Gstrings watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up yo Jimmy turn the bass up
Yea yeah yeahhhh
Chorus Kool Keith  girl  repeat 2X 
Yo baby  whassup 
Dont crush it when you sit upon it
Yo baby  whassup
Dont rush it when I sit upon it 
I see you scopin me the fourth time you cut your eye
Let the brother to catch wreck then tell the man goodbye
Im next on the menu runnin up and in you
With seven rubbers on me dont try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind crank up the R Kelly
Delicious kickin no leather like Im Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it dont stink
Im in the mix like Funkymaster Flex
Im shootin gizm then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it like palm trees in California
Now you a lady mature and Im rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask Im on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in and bone a sweetie look like YoYo
She had a good time knees bent in the chair
She said Get wild  I like it when you pull my hair
I gave her cream and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
Im in the front row chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle shes scoped by an ass pro
Im from the back kid smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches and watch she make it lowride
Zoot zoot zzzzzzzt

Chorus 15X
Its three oclock the morning shifts about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance that grey hiney aint no slum
I gets my workout my slickest hand from every angle
Shes on the job right cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real a hundred dollar bill
Im comin straight up and not for a breakfast meal
This aint no Burger King this aint no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
Im pullin nylon yo dead up G to the side
Feelin soft flesh Im hard Imma let her ride
Jump up and down get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax shes happy with her orgasms
Go on girl
Chorus 2X
