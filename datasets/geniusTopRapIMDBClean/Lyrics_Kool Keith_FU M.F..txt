FU MF LyricsSo what you got your first deal
Who you signed with nigga
Epic
Def Jam
I dont give a fuck if youre with Warner Bros
Who you signed with nigga
Muthafuckin Loud
Interscope Columbia Sony 550
Fuck it if youre with Dreamworks
And a few of you inhouse commercialass producers
Can suck out the interior out of my dick
Yall still 75 that aint no new shit
Fakeass wannabe hiphop shit
Dont worry about who the fuck I hang with
Jealous muthafuckas
Im tired of niggas fooling muthafuckas
Actin like they drug dealers
All you rappers fantasizin that jewelry and car shit
You can pull the Speedos and suck my dick
Tell your corny fans who believe that shit
Lick the back of my ass quick
Imma shut faggots down
Especially muthafuckas with that gayass production
New millenium homo sound
Smack the shit out of you for doin that wackass shit you do
50 bodyguards surround you
Keepin men that fuck you in the ass around you
Standin like you runnin shit you aint the fuckin President
Posin with ugly bitches in your video who take AIDS medicine
You dont wanna fuck with me or rock with me
Or rhyme on any block with me
Fuck the rap museum
I should be on the wall next to RunDMC
Between Public Enemy
Some asshole was jealous of me
I dont care no more about your lyrics
The average MC is bullshit I dont hear it
Fuck you talkin about you rap with a good spirit
I make rappers intimidated
Over wackass beats they get motivated some have ministrated
Even suburban kids copy your shit and duplicate it
My balls you now cherish
By some newass MC about to perish
Type of muthafucka to eat a lotta celery
Your CD was buttersoft  what you tellin me
A bunch of N Sync type of fans hyped you up like Bill Bellamy
A bitch like you would rhyme with a curfew
Niggas with real shit will hurt you
The girl scout club I refer you
Bastard you
Your man rap new nigga hes wack fuck you
Stay low Im above you
Erase your shit I dont dub you
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU

Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
Yeah
You been rappin for 20000 years
And you aint got your fuckin deal yet
What the fuck
Dont take your problems out on me
And the rest of you muthafuckas
Walkin around lookin like some old alien niggas
Muthafucka I pull your face off
bout to show you what the fuck you look like
Cause you keep it real
Too real muthafuckin broke
2001
Nobody was sayin that shit when I was payin for them fuckin hot wings
Hope you burn your fuckin lips
FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
Muthafucka
FUCK YOU
ASSHOLE
