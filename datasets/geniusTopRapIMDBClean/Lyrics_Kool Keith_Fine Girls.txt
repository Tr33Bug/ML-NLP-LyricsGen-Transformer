 Hey baby my name is Keith
Hi Keith
I always see you comin home from school work
Or college wherever you comin from
Mmmhmm
Im a big secret admirer of you
I see you all the time
Sometimes you dont even look very happy
No Im not happy at all
I wonder whats really goin on in your life
Would you tell me
A lot of problems
But I got things to tell you
I like your pretty eyes
Tell me where you get your hair done your face so clear
With fourteen carats diamonds in your ear
He beat you up Ill eat you up reheat you up
Come fix your life make you my wife improve in time
No wine and dine dont waste my time mature your mind
I redesign you changin faces
Stop playin games girl you two of clubs Im pluckin aces
Your girlfriends dont matter
Jealousys another info she thinks Im mental
I love you keep it confidential
Chorus Kool Keith
Youre that fine girl from high school college graduate
Lady always on my mind girl can you imagine it
repeat Chorus 3X
I seen you cryin
Relyin on some old backbone prone
I give you stuffed animals sprinkles on a chocolate cone
You turn your face up
Your body shaved legs to the waist up
You feelin sad face down always lookin mad
I counteract eye contact
Spot you out where the maps at
I caught you starin why you actin baby
Theres no slackin the second time I work this
This aint no clown and circus
You takin Advil for headaches
I met you girl on purpose
Stressed out with girlfriends
That zero hero leasin his Benz
You under peer pressure
You think about it girl think what you really doin 

repeat Chorus 4X
I dial your home phone
Know your code and area zone
You trapped in moms house restrictions feel like Minnie Mouse
I know you turnin yearnin learnin
Plus your heart is burnin Im still concerned while you blinkin
My mind is thinkin outside your area
You got that space for occupation big motivation
Let me drop my fierce information
Come here girl I wanna talk to you
I wanna tell you a lot of things
Different things that you never talked about
Different things you had to go through
What Ive been through before youve even been with
Im tellin you
repeat Chorus 4X
