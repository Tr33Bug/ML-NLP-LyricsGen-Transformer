Goodbye rap
This song is about everybody involved in hiphop
People that just came into this business so late
All the DJs that dont know what they are doing that dont know real records
And everybody that think they can rap wasting time
This song is called Goodbye Rap
This song is the last song
I quit rap couldnt find competition
I threw hiphop in the garbage
The rap hall of fame had to pay homage
While everyone was fat cookin sausage
I was wearin ostrich
Rap aint been the same since I had it hostage
The last song I guess was written wrong
First class flight Im leavin MCs to fight over whos the best Im gone
To a secret shelter in space
An astronaut ready to take off
Go home to the Bat Cave and take my cape off
A rock star still I will shock tomorrow
Rap went out the door all MCs cry with tears
Miss my metaphor
Inspiration gone now they gotta see artificial tissue on tour
From the Bronx true story
Ask Bambaataa and Kool Herc
I dont rap no more I dont rap no more
Thats it
And the downloaders you get no credit
You destroyed your own thing all over
Remember that You aint really fly
The ciphers WHACK
Everybody samplin old man records WHACK
Everybody tryin to collect records WHACK
Everybody trying to get up on open mics WHACK
All the DJs playing trendy music WHACK
Commercial artists trying to collaborate with pop artists WHACK
Everybody trying to think they can grow dreads to become hiphop WHACK
Finalists and panelists talking on TV shows trying to judge rap WHACK
People that just got into rap yesterday WHACK
WHACK
