Kool Keith in Bronx housing
Ninetynine 2000
As we get biz yeah
Imma let you have it
Lets do this
Yo my life is clientele while pro people talk about me
Cut empty pocket shark faces like electric sockets
Sideburns with afro nasty pro throw like Rollo
In Wells Fargo cashin checks while you tryin to borrow
My game is cut through plastic come we can see through
Disco music jazz loops I aint tryin to be you
Nineteenninetynine 2000 black new design
My head is on right
Back up kid you wasnt born right
Playin center I block your wack raps like Bill Cartwright
Pick up your rebounds plastic soft production sounds
All MC groups will be cartoons like Mother Goose
No joke I bust back
Kid for real watch your buttcrack
Entourages movin neighborhoods like Mr Rogers
Slam rhymes on concrete mash em up in car garages
Cadillac spin open magazines Vibe again
Youre jealous stare lickin paws like youre RinTinTin
Im back again I stop your programs like Gentle Ben
Yeah  yeah yeah yeah 
Chorus Kool Keith  repeat 4X 
Ill be the man watch your backpack pen and pencil
School today Grown man I dont play
Back up the turnpike watch Mad Max turn into you
Get gassed at truckstops leave diesel fuel burnin through you
I come to boo you best believe Im a damager
Cancel shows interviews I dont need no managerfan
Half of yall think Im the Elephant Man
Look through my records analyze me like Im Michael Jackson
Collect my vinyl DJ moves spinnin on my wax and
Groupies in line camera flashes I dont need the action
Sweaty hotels dumbbells Id rather shop in Modells
While yall wear backpacks with corny macks rollin Ls
CDs get melted ask your favorite rapper how he felt it
I turn on others light up this when Im cookin muffins
Thats on the grill make your girlfriend buy my Ampex reels
Pay for studio time droppin verse with dope words
Im on the real herb pick up mics you got some nerve
Rahway State Prison bring my projects in the music business
Thats if you with this yo Craig there will be no witness
Im comin through with Bronx Crew a black boobababboon
Tecs in my pockets make your feets dance do the lockin
Yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Chorus
Yo what are you doin lookin in my closet
Why are you tryin to try on my sneakers
Stop lookin around in my kitchen
Thats right its Honeycomb up there raviolis
Everything a regular man eats
Im not the Elephant Man whassup
You dont scare me Im the man that bought your girl some hair
Walk in giant arenas and stop your show at Madison Square
With security you cant call the Secret Service
Got your roadie cases packed up your bookin agent nervous
Backstage passes special units break your Fendi glasses
Cancel your flights Town Car see me in the brown car
Rip up your passport I follow you through Kennedy airport
Lock up the gates town seize up like Norman Bates
Book Hotel Niko change my face up in Puerto Rico
Julio Gongado bumpin beats in a El Dorado
Im movin swiftly the game is fast very quickly
Greyhound bus tickets Ill vick you for the whole season
Thats the reason Ill be easin eatin cheese and
Thats right kid yeah  yeah yeah 
Chorus
Yeah thats right watch your backpacks
For the ninenine to the 2000
