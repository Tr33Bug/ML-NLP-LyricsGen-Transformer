These are the things that robots carry
To get they hair done
Eyes made up
Difference effects to their bodies
Sometimes too many to even know
The life of a robot
Yo dont waste my time on the phone girl Im goin to bed
That movie resteraunt you need cash that game is dead
I pull your wig off you step back you have a tantrum
I hold your rent money contacts I hold for ransom
Cut off your phone bill Merecedes wrecked in the Mobil
Thats on the real deal your credits off how you feel
Give me my meat back now think back you sing on fourtrack
Your mothers callin for WIC checks she soundin wack
I bought your first food highclass you was rude
House with no heat on with slippers on you walkin nude
Back with your girlfriends I cancel banks stop your shoppin
You work with kneepads you loose stiff on Soul Train poppin
Your head keep boppin you face out with purple tracin
I put you out we can end this at the gas station
Lets do this now not impressed Ima show you how
Chorus Kool Keith  repeat 2X 
Im seein robots passin by everyday  Im seein robots 
Im seein robots lah lah lah lah lah lah
Im seein robots passin by everyday  Im seein robots 
You drive in Hollywood long hair Buick Regal
License in California IDs phony not illegal
Livin with roommates you camp out with paper plates
Broke Panasonic speakers missin playin Puff and Mase
Clear up yo acne girl what yo how you act B
Call police up tell them what  How you tried to smack me
Im movin thorough on the freeway callin you on three way
Watchin my back got your friends all on instant replay
You say you married sewed your weave in yo wheres your ring at
Interscope records got your demo girl where you sing at
Pull out your masters your DATs all you have is cats
Pet little turtles in your bedroom enough for headroom
Usin your restroom when company come thats your best room
I stay the dopest while you party hard losin focus
Starin in mirrors combin hair with the kids on welfare
I watch your mailbox like Vietnam guerilla warfare
Thats not your real hair rip credit cards I dont care
Liposuction Jenny Craig is yo introduction
Volkswagen fog up your dirty engine Boo smog up
You hit the malls and with chip phones makin calls and
Im audi 5 yeah

Chorus
Im seein robots passin by everyday  Im seein robots 
Im seein  goo goo gah gah them ugly kids call me dada
Missin they father while you try to pawn the ring and phones and
You probably Jonzin gettin greedy eatin at Tony Rhomes and
Stuffin your mouth out with fat pigs you smokin cigs
Rip out your buttcrack no bras out to fit your back
Skinny legs trip on you get your grub and rip on
The DJ spin the club is wack yo they close at ten
They turned the lights on I seen your mug you looked bugged
Close your face I see your rims I know you freebase
Chorus 3X
Im seein robots  All you model robots
With mechanical legs fake hips implants
Little chips in your arms
Body movement metal metallic unpure
Robots  little robots 
Stiff arms kneecaps oil  ROBOT 
ROBOT  Metal robots
Little go go romance robots 
Little go go romance robots
