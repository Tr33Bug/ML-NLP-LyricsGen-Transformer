This is the intro
Why are you looking hard with a hood on and Timberland boots
Staring at me for one hour
when you could walk up and shake my hand Why
Why are you making those mean faces in your videos
With the fish lens effects Why
Why do you walk in the clubs with 30 people around you
And stand in the corner with big bodyguards for no reason
Why
Why do you pull up in valet parking with your Benz that is rented fronting on a cellular phone that doesnt work Why
Why are you smirking up your face making obnoxious facial scenes
Like I supposed to be scared  Supposed to be scared  Why  Why 
Who are you  Who are you 
I circle like sharks while yall panic  I cruise the Atlantic
Yall think Im spaced out human from the Earth planet
Thats right tomorrow I plan to boo your shows at the Apollo
You follow in the crowd the audience is hollow
Never ending while Im mind bending resending you the first verse
That you was worse a drag queen with a purse unrehearsed
Dont try to reverse harsh words send you to a nurse
Emergency with urgency nonrappable comics and
Half of yall out there got me vomitin  BLEH 
Turnin Islamic and Dominican Indian Cambodian watchin Nickelodeon TV
You see me lookin at me grabbin my peepee yall still sleepy
With hard faces tryin to look creepy
You are the monsters of the original Mr Softie ice cream trucks
sung  background Open your eyes tell me why cant you see
Why are you hating a player like Keith
Why cant you see that your fakin is weak
Open your eyes tell me why cant you see
Why
Your exaggeration perpetration levels are at exaggerating full speed
Why must I answer to you evil monsters
Hey Keith we are The Official Haters
And you have sunken into The Official Hating Zone
In which you witness the most salt shaking
Behind your back speaking
Record criticizing cock blocking
In the club costume jewelry wearing
Valet parked Lexus renting
Undercover starstruck
No gamehaving fake Versace shirt wearing
Motel hell living
False Muslim being Jungle Fever having
Porkeating demon people
Our purpose here on your planet is to BRING YOU DOWN
If you can evade this evil youll be the man
