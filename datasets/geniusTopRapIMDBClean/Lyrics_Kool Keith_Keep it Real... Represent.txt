Keep it Real Represent Lyrics
Yeah rappers spread your cheeks
Pull your panties down
Take your wig off let me see your bald head
Thats right I got you on Kodak
Your pictures are goin out to Black Tail
Youre gonna be a star
Yeah
I heard you quit rap your wife went back to porno flicks
You turned drag queen a call girl doin tricks
Nighttime prostitute kid Imma take your loot
I heard you queer now like Boy George blowin flutes
With high heels you stole your moms birth control pills
You on some new stuff I heard about that sex change
You got a vagina your grandmother think its strange
New eyeliner you was flirtin with a gay designer
Your girl felt mines and pulled off her Calvin Kleins
I saw Tampax gonorrhea red stop signs
I looked at her and said Mmm put your panties back on
Then jerked off to Foxy Brown when her verse was on
I wanna stand back and bust nuts at your butts
Your girl is cocked up with lollipops doggie style
I feel Im dealin with plastic watch these fake smiles
Yeah meet my left and my right
Keep it real represent what My nuts  2X 
I got utensils back up kid yo guard your rectum
Im crazy out here mental man dont respect him
You now in pain your mom just had the abortion
Big head Boo I put some roaches on your whole crew
Have you scared with crack pipes your family throwin doodoo
Wear out your welcome your little girl sex desires
Have you handicapped some friends of mine blow your tires
Like Alfred Hitchcock the ghost stands on your block
With nine mils for drug addicts I keep triggers cocked
You on some methane my witchcraft is on your brain
Blow out your headpiece and break out quick on the plane
Seal up your coffins and celebrate with champagne
Get my drink Absolut cranberry juice
Paranoid by rug spots you see the purple moose
You smokin sherm or what I paralyze that butt
Lick my dhead you girls still pee in the bed
Yo take that wig off yo punk let me see that caesar
Keep it real represent what My nuts  3X 
I gets more wreck than  kids in babys Pampers
Your wife is banned for leavin bras in my hampers
That heffers ugly plastic why you still bug me
Im on Melrose the coast takin sun strolls
Black girls with weaves white girls with flat butts
With the name HOMO spelled in your name
You was a woman one time man I know your game
With panties stuck up sweat leakin in your crotch
Collard greens you wet pig you cant eat that much
I shut you down your whole face two oclock
Have your girl on sunset in Dennys suckin cock
With white pumps up blonde wigs rottin in the trunks
That homeless monkey Barbie doll crystal junkie
Im no joke and have respect for your kinfolks
Tie your tubes back my scope is on your asscrack
You got paid for doodoo that package rap was wack
Yeah yeah you know what Yeah
Keep it real represent what My nuts  4X 
Thats right ninesix and seven  Reverend Tom 
Representin the scrotum  Octagon 
All the hairs under the testicles  The SharkMan 
Lick  Kool Keith 
Yeah dont buy The Basement Tapes
Sheisty things going on somebodys on the pipes
Labels foldin goin down in ninetysix
Nobody play the records
Citys out no Tuff Tuff pity
