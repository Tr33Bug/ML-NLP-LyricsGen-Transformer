New York City  Keith Turbo 
Youre listening to the number one
The one and only  Keith Turbo 
Keith  Keith Turbo  Turbo
Pontiac GTO
Thats right we do it like that
Keith Turbo the new man
Here we go
Move in close range with the ARTCC
Air Route Traffic Control Center
I freeze MCs at maximum degrees
Efficiency from the street when I ripped apartments
And the Corman suites
Two and a half units available bass you cant trace
Your girl starin in my face at 7000 feet
Turbo jets in the cockpit
You flock with weak kids on the block with
For protection Ill ruin your whole section
For major alteration my final approach is to spray yall
Attack ya like roaches
Dont step to me at the food court at the municipal airport
Your unmatched performance cant stop my endurance
Runaway 18L pilot one change in your slot
Number two youre through dischargin your battery
Stop rappin to me
New York Citys number one MC thats real G
Whos that kid B Passengers are in position
Change your whole vision
Commercial instructors stop your stretch marks
Take off your shirt I see your ribs
Fakin like you Tommy Gibbs
Technology program you used to know
I used to study with Son of Sam thats right
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO

Man  Keith Turbo 
I can throw a hundred thousand pound walrus right through the walls
Thats right
Mad like five gorillas in a vocal booth 
Its all Turbo
Yo Mom Dukes pass me my helmet
Let me show these kids what to do
RPM 600 pound gorillas 22 not hot
Engine accurate GPS storm scopes on your folks
Monitors equal my three million new fans are white people
Geared toward the universe while black people think the worse
Realistically expect my gross is twenty times your checks
Triple that diamond around your neck besides I hate cars
You feel the turbulence fasten seatbelts close your vents
Rugged horsepower M20F executive manifestin you a lesson
False representationll leave yall sweatin in the train station
Remember Im blacker than your used Acura
Thats why I laugh at ya
Like a anorexic model on the crack bottle
Yall play Frankie Beverly Im in the future with a phaser network
I bet ya Ill make your beck hurt
Endorsements from the universities cant stop my abilities
Financial trainin on the campus
Sock ya like Jabbar did Kurt Rambis
Fax you that flight number stand by frequency
Dont mess with me
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO
Keith Turbo  Pontiac GTO

Thats right yall its all about Nassau
When I ride around in my NASCAR
Dont think Im Richard Petty or Bobby Unser
Or even Al Unser its all Indy 500 when I run around
You know it I come with the fluid like Jackie Stewart
Keith Turbo

Keith Turbo  laughing
Keith Turbo  laughing
Keith Turbo
