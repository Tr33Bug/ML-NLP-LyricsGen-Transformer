Yeah motherfuckin Kool Keith
Im doin this motherfucker
Imma get in this motherfucker
Im worser than chocolate ExLax kid
Ill blow out your asshole
On some Mt Helen volcano type shit
Dare your girl to try to act fly at the Nassau Coliseum concert
Defend your emotions when I attack
Fuck the words of the monkeys back and forth
Singers and rappers Im guaranteed like 5 Fingers of Death
Reach in your stomach with the iron fist
You cant fuck with the iron wrist
CupaSoup noodle niggas
Talkin shit you on my lyin list
Your makeup is Mac
Everybody against the wall before I piss on your buttcrack
Plastic bastards
I cover your staff members with battery acid
Five people in one motherfucker Im drastic
Like a bitch who do a fast kick
Kiss my ass nigga  kiss my ass nigga  repeat 3X
You get meaner with that bullshit you talk
Tie rappers up in the basement like preacher
Scrub your fuckin forehead with brillo pads
Gasoline is my ammo
Wipe you motherfuckers up with glass cleaner
Three bottles of Pine Sol shit on your mixtape
Ill catch you at the mall
Lookin more fake whackass wigga
I used to shit on your babysitters
Shut the fuck up piss all over your transmitters
Motherfuck a garbageass nigga
Screamin over your music FUCK YOU
New York makes you bitter type of faggot ass nigga
To sit in cat litter everybody suck my dick
Playin one or two niggas
Look in the mirror doc Im on your time clock
Always inkin a deal
Urinate on your paper when I sign dots
Your CDs up at Universal in a cardboard box
Stop fuckin borin me
With overnight niggas with no stories
Motherfuckers gettin they first model bitch
Im on Simmons level I shit on your Pave jewelry
From the Brightling to the Jacob to the Rolex
None of these Sesame Street Big Bird Oscar niggas can fool me
Been eatin chinese food with Greg Nice
Cant stop the fuckin hustle my lyrics are Smooth B
