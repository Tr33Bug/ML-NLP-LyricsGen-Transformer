Yeah
Every morning I wake up lookin in the mirror
I am the original Black Elvis
Thats right when you see me with my wig to the side
Wearin my short leather jacket
Marilyn Monroe on my back
Im livin that life
Im for real with this
Thats what I think about
I like to tell my fans
I got my shades on big rock star compared to Elvis
Signin autographs for rappers while girls move they pelvis
Write songs strictly for Elton John or Lionel Richie
Call up my butler get clothes washed by the maid
Ivory soap dishes clean feel like Cascade
I count the bills roll through Detroit in Sedan DeVilles
I throw my skully on big robe like Marvin Gaye
Step in the front row primetime I move your way
Budweiser Fest soundcheck demanding your respect
I come correct through the Metro and turn yall petrol
Im up here early bitin donuts sippin on espresso
While you sleep I creep gainin ground by the week
Ampex reels makin phone calls Im closin deals
I move with skill ride through Philly streets and Cherry Hill
Im doin it well Im doin it swell
Yeah
Flying saucers spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin astro tell me how you feel
One two one two
Movin roughly straight to the desert San Antonio
I talk swift the Rock King Black Romeo
I pack clubs promoters put me out in Tokyo
Damage your area Imma launch a fierce missile
I roast fools movin butt like Im toilet tissue
What is your issue You over man I dont miss you
Scottie soft you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff
New Jersey Nets real man you aint no Darnell Hillman
Bald head like Slick Watts I run rap like Mayor Koch
Forward your info while Tony Liu crank the Benzo
Move out your driveway while girls look turn they eyeway
Jealous in fact tryna rip the capes off my back
I move with timing potential through instrumentals
Yall front on BET with slum gold drivin rentals
I get real dino runnin groups like a rhino
Endin careers thats my job yo your rap is final
Cancel your instores your new job is moppin floors
Fixin tiles stoppin potholes up on the roof
You work for service no tips man I speak the truth
Flying saucers spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin astro tell me how you feel
One two one two
Flying saucers spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin astro tell me how you feel
One two one two one two
Pull your hoods down I bumrush your afterparty
Have your manager scared the radio station saying sorry
Pack your bags I move my luggage to the coliseum
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum
Changin my zones drinkin cocktails on cellular phones
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones
Booked by the agency famous artists payin me
Hotels with fly room with sneakers starin at the moon
Mad atmosphere ridin first class on British Air
Lobster and steak while yall back in time doin remakes
Im futuristic ninenine to the year 4000
I make announcements drop skills then I bounce with
Fly young ladies AMG kicks two thousand Mercedes
Brand new models only seen one in Colorado
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar eatin salad
Lorenzo wheels valet park shoppin in Beverly Hills
Step up your wildest spaceship kid in the Plymouth Prowler
Comin down
Flying saucers spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
Livin astro tell me how you feel
One two one two
Flying saucers spaceships move at warp speed
MTV level three when I fly on BET
