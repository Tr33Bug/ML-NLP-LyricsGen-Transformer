Blast bulletin Keith still solo with no manager
Time clock out studios need to block out
Heres my number call me direct get no feedback
No interviews channel four see me on the news
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone
Address you wonder dont try to catch me home alone
Up seven oclock while you trying to find me on my block
Im at the airport you think Im strange boardin the plane
Turn off my pager then quickly relax my feet
Hotel unknown drinkin brew watchin Sesame Street
You thought you saw me with a wig on at 711
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear
My George Washington robe I still travel the globe
On PanAm airflights I roll in cities after midnight
Stand in your lobby unsuspected you get neglected
Traffic was hectic

Order room service transfer quick to Holiday Inn
Check out time nine oclock coat on Im out again
You comin so wack you sound like the Bulworth Soundtrack
Im in the mall steady shoppin while you tryin to call
Its on my answering machine to speak to me is a dream
Pacific Bell known the phone is off and Im well known
1800 number cancel code see to summer
Extreme complicated businessman cant be reached
No type of headquarters deserted land by the waters
Target my focus on internal thinkin by myself
You catch the treatments hiatus like jam on the shelf
Move out your zip code with UHaul watch you fall
I tape up boxes callin Mayflower every hour
You scratch your brain out askin neighbors what now you wonder
Where could I be 
growl sound
One two three four five
Who could that be
Xena

While you search lookin deep in your Rolodex I flex I tell the truth
When Im serious you think Im mysterious drop rap in minutes
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace
Hold up your meetings papi lets cancel the papparazzi
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a twoyear old crayon writing
Talkin to yall decidin
Communication leads one step to aggravation
I got my ears closed back to bookin my own shows
Level seven eight nine  second dimension
Stand by
