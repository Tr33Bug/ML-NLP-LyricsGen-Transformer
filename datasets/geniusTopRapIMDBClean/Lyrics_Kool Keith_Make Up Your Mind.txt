Yeah so you called me last night
You was kinda confused huh
You didnt know what to do
All excited over these football players and baseball players
Whassup You lookin for a million dollars or somethin
Man you kinda confused
Freak mode Im in the set so let em feel
Touch my private my thing made of steel
Shootin gism she ride like a Geo Prism
Im out in Cali San Bernardino Valley
Im on the hill not North in Peekskill
Big Willie servin now tell me how you pimps feel
Im in the Cadillac drivin in a droptop
People dont know my style watch when they heads bop
Im on the highway girls pull em down my way
Credit cards and checks man she get paid on Friday
The womans out the Phantom pushin more clout
Im watchin him with Sam drinkin Guinness Stout
Bourban booze green alligator shoes
Union comissioned sex government intelligence
What you see girl that Benz is irrelevant
Materialistic ugly man is plastic
No class in a suit cost rather cheap
Got the nerve to blow the horn and he try to beep
Interfere in my spot and hes comin near
Shes in the white boots breathin in my ear
Chorus Kool Keith
Make up your mind who you want to pump the butt  4X 
No infections condom style I got no yeast
Worldwide trunk funk no jazz on the East
Breakin honies down mackin here to Petersberg
Virginia Slim turn the freaks out in Lynchburg
With brown bootie Joe Smith hit from Pittsburgh
The right player even if I choose odds
Let me shuffle jackpots women pick the cards
Your hydraulic butt bounce like a sixtrey
Im on the case jealous man steppin in my way
Hot pursuit why she play herself Get the boot
Actin like Troop he say he signed with a group
He wrote for Babyface did songs toured with Snoop
lyin to you to get through
Droppin them old lines his breath smell like doodoo
I got a style if a brother wanna know
Smokin that stank blunt you still sniffin blow
Nose runnin on time with green slime
Step in the club I throw urine on your mind
Big Luciano diamond rings on the grand piano
Girls flock and guys hop on the other jock
Im in a twodoor with bass comin through your block
Sound kicks I got the fly broads in the mix
California butt MCs suckin more what
Like Gerald LeVert you try to make it work
Jheri Curl Jones spendin cash on a skirt
Plan to win whassup with Uncle Ben
Brother is slab fatback bacon
Still fakin his voice chords achin
You know Im perplex exotic on Ampex
Dogstyle champ hittin booty for butt sex
I cant disguise myself like Michael Jackson
The flasher are you ready for action

Chorus Kool Keith
Make up your mind who you want to pump the butt  3X 
Make up your mind who you want to pump it
I got a summons my clothes is off Im buttnaked
In a discotechque dont tell me ladies cant take it
Just to have my drawers in a overcoat
My El Dorado lean the black Caddy float
Down the hill with Frankie Dolla Bill
Honies in red zone tell me how them drawers feel
Suckin on the hippie on the Mississippi
Econo Lodge a cheap way to get a quickie
Five and five equal ten
Add twenty up Im back in the spot again
Blowin it up I drop my own bomb
Two big green mitts and tails on my arm
You in my way my man yo B excuse me
I didnt call your girl why accuse me
I think youre insecure not sure
If your girlfriends home if shes knockin at my door
Back in your ride no apartment no place to wash
You cant clean  tell em black 
He dont know yet my discipline how to act
Stack with fume and twentyfour flicks
You cant win takin shots like the Knicks
Im old enough with skills to be your daddy
Go ask grandma your freaky Aunt Sally
Pretty woman standin there with a ugly man
I dont wanna shake his hand
Chorus Kool Keith
Make up your mind who you want to pump the butt  6X 
Make up your mind who you want to pump it
