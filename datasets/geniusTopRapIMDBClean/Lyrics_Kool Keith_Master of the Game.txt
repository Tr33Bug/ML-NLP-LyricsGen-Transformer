Jacksonville Jacksonville

Master of the game
In the rappin Hall of Fame
Like Tag Team back again
Here we go with a flow get dealt with quick
Now Joe I know my rap style pro
Let em know with the quickness yall need to witness
Step to the side yall mind yall business
Exercise like physical fitness
Ride through I glide through
Bass pump to the trunks inside you
We move it quickly rap styles swift B
Cadillac rollin neck full of gold and
Crafty nasty cant put it past me
Step with skills better call your family
Turn adverse worse climb in the first verse
Move when I back it up attack and I smack it up
Girls connectin it Ultra legend and
Why yall rhymes soft fruity affectionate
I keep steppin and boost my rep again
Speed up go slow you got the next again
Do the La Bamba turn to Mexican
Swift to shift up change the pitch up
DJ mix ups your face get fixed up
Nuts get licked up quickly strictly
Chorus repeat 2X
Hes the master of the game THE MASTER
All the girls know his name
Hes the master of the game THE MASTER
In the rappin Hall of Fame
Im warnin watch yo backpack mack
Yo crack lack facts I tax yo ass
So fast you press up mess up step up
Through this when I do this
Im the smoothest when I groove this speedy
Turn back yo dont try to be greedy
Houston Tex out of New York City
Girls get pretty yo look at them titties
Astrofunkn revolve in the trunk and
Partys live might turn into somethin
Let them know though Im still pro though
Companies what wanna sign me solo
Squeeze your knee let your man try to read
Ease the bleed shut up animal feed
Step or ski let you know what it be G
Cruiser shades at the bar cant see me
Grizzly Adams grab em pat em
Suckers dont know how bad Im madam
Turn and flex and servin necks and
Any anorexin fools wanna flex in
Yall wont know when I pull up in a Lex and
MasterCards with certified checks and
Bank bills fly rims in the hills
Yall get cups get more refills
Chorus
Check your watch now watch me partner
Start to welcome back kids like Kotter
Move your fans while I rock a little harder
Hoes and foes hit em all with blows
Watch girls work it movin unopposed
Hip to flip throw the thing to they lip
When I dress yes put em all to the test
Rock a suede vest pink jewels on my chest
Rappin clappin fingers start snappin
Watch how you actin Im rubbin on the back
And MCs is slack and your groups sound wack
Whered you turn B Nobody burn me
Style get complex why you concerned B
Im your chalkboard now you can learn me
Round and round and big bass soundin
Down South Hustler big bass poundin
East West top down to the bone
Motorollin on my cellular phone
Change the tone get up out my zone
Movin next to you rhyme will flex to you
Stop Im overdue jumpin over you
Status go to the baddest bro
Chorus
