Chorus Kool Keith
I see maxi curls  Yeah  
Players activator
I see maxi curls  Yeah  
Remote control alligators
I got skill youre on my tip now back off
Slack off let me do this and yall turn the wack off
The radio stereo here we go flow and blow
Puerto Rico Salsa Latin youre feet pattin
Black people mingle white people buy my single
Bingo bango leggo my steel Eggo
Throwin rhymes in spirals like Joe Klecko
Miami Dolphin now shut up close your mouth and
You be hatin debatin regurgitatin
Ratin laten and perpetratin
My albums NINE mics tough like dirt bikes
You get frantic New York City run and panic
California I switch up boogie on ya
Like Don Cornelius on SOULLLLLLLLLLL TRAIN
And heads I clip off in rap leave a bloodstain
A bigger pain you would need novacaine
Bite off Rakim you copy Big Daddy Kane
You know my steelo I rhyme against a million people
Who think they equal disguisin as Jamaican people
Fakin funkin youre pedigree your beat is sunk in
Tonka toy of little boy steppin down to Roy
Im no joke I rap for cash and youre buyin a coat
Bronx bomber superb on the freak momma
Stinkin movin my whole crew is comin through
Yeah
Chorus
Bout it bout it like Master P makin money G
No time for promos get paid when I MC
You know my feeling Im dealing with tracks so real and
Radio blackout your format is not appealin
RB can step off but cant compare to me
You oughta know  how I feel
Thats wack with bookbags packed on your back
Video Vibe my skin is black BET
Program your channels your grandkids wanna see me
Freakin status freakin styles freakin flows
Freakin foes freakin lyrics freakin spirits
I make a deaf person hear it
Duplicate you demonstrate what I used to make
Remakes I watch your crewll imitate
Motivate still skills to pay bills
Creative sauce watch out Im your boss
On Panasonic like Steve style bionic
You get to workin your head bop you not jerkin
You be out lurkin for danger in my Ranger
You think Im bugged man With Catwoman like a stranger
Packed with speed supersonic level read
Steelo jets and Bill Blass like rockets
In your pockets damagin your brain sockets
Yeahhhhh
Chorus
Like Mobile settin up shop in Alabama
For proper grammar my style Arm  Hammer
Strong computer underground like Roto Rooter
Fools critics they mimic copy sloppy
MCs get hurt you blockhead try to stop me
Digital thinkin youre blinkin career sinkin
Old like Mod Squad you rap like Lincoln
Sideburns turned you catchin ringworm
A heavy virus worser than hepatitis
Schizophrenic like ten people out the clinic
Yankee Stadium uptown you cant win the pennant
I do construction you pack up your whole production
Your lips are ready your girl has a nice suction
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags right
Pack her bags pack her bags pack her bags left
Your style is A B CD
EF GH IJK LMNOP QRS
Dont test I taught you how to get your deals
You put my style on your reels
You went uptown claimin my sound
Get back stay down
