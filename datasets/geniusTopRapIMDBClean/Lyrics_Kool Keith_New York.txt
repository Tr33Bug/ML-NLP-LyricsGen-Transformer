Overload of thoughts released to melt the courts

Able to progress take chicks away from Payless
To better slacks I never wear black
Only covers designed
Everything custom from Beck  Stand

Remember yours is not better than mine
New York speak coffee for you is real cheap
So you can open curtains and take a peak
Blackberry been had it
When phone booths was on the street
Before radiators and emcees had heat
