Yeah Kool Keith should keep it real
He should ent  rap about space and Mars
Yo Im tired of looking at everybody Same boots skully hats in
90 degree weather looking to get into clubs for free Im not
Smoking blunts or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt
I left New York the city itself was stress depression
High boots and urban beats that wasnt my direction
Producers filtering join in with RB
A million rappers some clones trying to sound like me
Biting my space styles biting my horrorcore
All I saw was little Kool Keiths on my tour
Record companies I Gdoff all my royalties
Watching vinyl spin local groups wack MCs
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap
Karl Kani jeans fat stomachs in the limosines
Mixtapes by wack DJs as doo doo play
Im on the turnpike the city drifting down the highway
Like a mirage the style there is all illusion
On videos out of town peoples spot confusion
Rolling high with caps pulled over down my eye
Since I been out yall cant see
Chorus x2
Is the world made of plastic
Is the city buried in dreams  Yeah 
Is the world made of plastic
Cause thats the way is seems  Owww 
Watching TV so bored while imbiciles hold the mic cord
Graffiti playgrounds are played out yo howd that sound
Army fatigues are weak is for the minor leagues
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz
Crews on stage acting hard with a thousand friends
I saw the place turn plastic crack heads looping beats
People with no deals walkmens rappin on the streets
I turned my back 90 of the city sounded wack
Payola scams switch DJs like a rubber band
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier
Clearing your samples your SP12 fake examples
My money grosses with green from my own label
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label
Your tristate ways are shut down by barricades
In fact I pack my bags and listened to E40
Mac Mall CBo and other rappers you dont know
Youre narrowminded in styles of mine you wont find it
My sound proceeds with Moog and undertone bass
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face
I come back real solid rock razor steel
Tappin your program show the world Im the man
You copy Poppa Large the industry is robbed

Chorus x2
As I do see soda wack rugged beer commercials
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles
From Manhattan I heat up yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare
No promotional shows girls wear corn rows
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes
I walk with straw hats and glasses in the projects
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage
Playing my numbers waiting for the Five to come
Spaghetti out the window people acting dumb
Fire hydrants wet the neighbors your familys nosy
I come and go as I please on blockhead MCs
You bought sneakers no car scrambling on the corner
Im not the star you are the citys fallen far
My mechanism youre on my tip
Stay off my penis youve duplicated me for years
Yeah yeah yeah you are the one
Chorus x
