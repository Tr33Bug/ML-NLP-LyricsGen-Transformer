I keep in shape and do my physical fitness
Your heads numb so your brains a miss this
Pick em up eat em up pick em up heat em up
Pick em up picklehead pick em up picky
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Grippin the mic I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer Im coming out like beers
Like Rheingold Miller Coors and Buds
Im a eat em wit popcorn and treat em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack wicky wickable wack
Black jack thats a fact writing exact behind your back
The funk rhymen master blaster
Kicking up in a brainstorm rainstorm
Rap storm rap form
Rap time rap rhyme
Rap class Im here to fail and to pass
To continue furthermore on the hype tip
I roll and rock rock and roll
Jazz and pop rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion brain confusion
Look at the lights what a night on the town
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
Now Im back to funk freak the funk
Hype the funk swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on em communicate wit the world
Man woman a baby boy and a girl
Poppa large looking out the bombs drop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop look learn to read learn to write
Learn to talk learn to walk
And watch your step though Im hype and ripe though
Kleptomaniac a rhymen psycho
A Ricky Ricardo a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a ragtop an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood Im screening the boulevards
The rhymes is gain type Im ready to pull a card
Jacka Ace Kinga Queen
Call me the deuce Im pouring out like juice
Hitting the top feeling the rim
Getting a trim I never rhyme like them
On and on on and on on and on
Until the break of dawn
I go overtime rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime switching off to Primetime
Pacific east strolling back in the west time
Ride the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope hype the frame
The mic is smoking yo I aint joking
Rhyme to kill rhyme to murder rhyme to stomp
Rhyme to ill rhyme to rock
Rhyme to smack rhyme to shock rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy
On the microphone
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
Youre dripping sweaty coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing em all serving them wit the mic stand
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is live you can play as the manager
Run wit the money I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom taking life more serious
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight program to kill more
A son of Sam how could I be Gilmore
Grabbing the mic you see the dark and shadows
Youre in living hell without time to battle
The funk ignited hands are writing brains dividing
Im coming out in sighting
Like Im Blackula a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular
In fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you cant be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose
Thats a bad habit stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic come and turn to page one
Look at the master my rank is higher
My lyrical burns your brains on fire
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
