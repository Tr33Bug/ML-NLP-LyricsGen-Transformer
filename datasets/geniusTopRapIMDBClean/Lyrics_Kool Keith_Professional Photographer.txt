Honey whats up this is Kool Keith
Gonna take you on vacation
Get your bags ready Ill call you in 2 hours
Baby you look good under the tripod directors we work hard
Edit your film every angle like elegant angel great shot
Hold your pose honey be professional
Watch your earrings dangle for the camera hold it right there
You got the answer
As Tina Turner would say tonight youre my Private Dancer
On the premises properly I deal with models
Like threepart harmony with skill like Debrye
Hair cover the side of your face
I get to see just a little more from the back side
Show me one of your eyes the professional photographer
Professional photographer professional
Im beyond you changin your clothes
Put this mask on cmere Catwoman take that off climb into those
Now you an action figure with boots up to your hips
With a Halle Berry haircut with light green over your eyelashes
I wanna see how you pose
It depends on the perfect outfit and how much you expose
My perfect Hollywood grand prize star the deal we gotta get it closed
Cindy put a little extra makeup on her nose
Scars we cover thats a cute tattoo everything goes
Move the sparkle shorts a little honey
Its better when everything shows the professional photographer
Hold your face cmon show me your confidence
Relax you dont have real tits
Your blouse look hot its magnified
Jim give me her black and white prints
I love those panties girl where you get those
Red and white your tassles that show on the side with lil peppermints
FHMs greatest a sensational hit youre the latest
To the public youre awesome how can I explain this
The portrait is a winner we gotta do somethin with that
I love it give me a little more body turn to the side and twist
I can see it comin magazines everywhere
Start signing autographs right now miss the professional photographer
