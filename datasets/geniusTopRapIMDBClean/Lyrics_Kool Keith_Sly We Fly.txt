Im known The Phantom with my black mask MCs go to hell
And Im the obtuse and acute guy
Im known as Motion Noggin Nodder
My flow is so dark I open coffins like Im Dracula
And Im that kid who raps about who what
That guy whatever
We pull the drawers off girls who  sly we fly 
We wash in gold and silver  sly we fly 
We walk in clubs with sneakers  sly we fly 
We look out windows and stare  sly we fly 
We fly the planes ourselves  sly we fly 
And if our records dont sell  sly we fly 
I put my MASK on another night for the Phantom
I got the Halloween jackolatern
Yo EdO I know some kids funny Silly Putty PlayDoh
They wanna step to farms and build a hay dough
I drag bodies on down the yellow brick road like Leprechaun
I come in comet killer mode
Yo grab your neck and your mail
With a WIC check plus I inspect my roots
And walk in naked with spirits and ouija board
I ShakenBake it naked like Betty Crocker
I use a black marker I draw your face in a sketch
Like a ARTISTE
Two broken arms from my shoulder have a piece
Yum yum you know you welcome come in dumbdumb
Hey whats that smell down there Look in the basement
Two eyes missin next day where your face went
With Dolly Parton music playin in my pickup truck
My gold sandwich a swigger liquor chewin duck
I got no taste no salt I need mayonnaise
Im lookin at TV lookin for good love and some lovin
We pull the drawers off girls who  sly we fly 
We wash in gold and silver  sly we fly 
We walk in clubs with sneakers  sly we fly 
We look out windows and stare  sly we fly 
We fly the planes ourselves  sly we fly 
And if our records dont sell  sly we fly 
Deckin in chins to knock a rapper hes bawlin bro
Off in my Timbs I makes an exit  hes bawlin 
As ill I cut the cheese and step on forks
Thats when Im Super Guy
I kicks it for what terms unpatterened knowledgist
A species unkind when human three minds one head
That brother took the alley  I followed him  hes dead
Hes datin Yakos Alli  shes awful  gives head
Say what Your coat is red hes just a white guy I know
He likes marijuana I like holding his bitch
Make giggles in the sauna rap when I swerve  pbpbpbpbpbpb
Hey bud I got your phone number I called you hung up
You push  69 you broke into a cold and hot sweat
Thats no address of mine you reached some mortuary
Youre talkin to an empty box Im gettin away
Im gettin away Im gettin away
We pull the drawers off girls who  sly we fly 
We washin gold and silver  sly we fly 
We walk in clubs with sneakers  sly we fly 
We look out windows and stare  sly we fly 
We fly the planes ourselves  sly we fly 
And if our records dont sell  sly we fly 
Motion Man 
I creep in Cutlass my orange my blue my black self green
The robot yo sixfo you buggin lookin mean
Yeah we pay no mind to eyeballs and kids as rivals 
We got our money in stacks you bet your chicken shirt
With massive ammo the fools out there dont want no work
With massive ammo the fools out there dont want no work 
This aint no movie no play you in a matinee
Im watchin screens of your dreams you actin everyday
Playin a part that you actors cant play
Yo hes perpetratin  gettin burnt like slab bacon
My days are numbered nitwit I work in  spot
My sherms ill as liquid I mix it up in big pot
And takes the top off and adds a drop off
And laughs my ass off and cakes in my part would rather
I wrap a new bomb its serious
I lost my mind yo help me find it
We pull the drawers off girls who  sly we fly 
We washin gold and silver  sly we fly 
We walk in clubs with sneakers  sly we fly 
We look out windows and stare  sly we fly 
We fly the planes ourselves  sly we fly 
And if our records dont sell  sly we fly 
Yeah changin four years in a flow  thats right 
How many you got  thats right 
What you think about that girl over there
What you think about the kid comin up the blonde
What you think about Keith walkin down the block
Same girl at my bed
Pringles fun

How much we need to take in at the party tonight
