 Yo Sadat whassup
Yo Im right here
I got these two girls
They ready to roll up the highway with me
Oh really
Imma get a little bit of gas
Think you can make that trip or what
Yeah I definitely can you know thats a fact
Of course
Alright Ill be back in a few minutes
Imma go back to the gas station and get some gas and fuel up
Alright Imma get some  and all that
Chorus Kool Keith Sadat X
Static we bring trouble to your right side
Hey as I think to myself what a wonderful world
Static we bring trouble to your right side
Hey Keith I just met this chick why am I arguin with this girl
Static we bring trouble to your right side
Man we here we just livin positive
Static we bring trouble to your right side
Hey we givin it all and thats all we got to give
Bumpin systems rollin down the street in Detroit Michigan
I switch again bucket seats with my girlfriend
Wearin Paco in a Bronco cologne is Pronto
Movin quickly like the Lone Ranger X is Tonto
Back up the turnpike Oldsmobiles roll with two pipes
440 engine blowin wind through her hair extension
Two bags of six packs with 38s wrapped in gift packs
Big attitude shes on the two train I roll like Mad Max
Keep it simple baby young girl now squeeze yo pimple
How dare you walk around ignore the First National Bank
My name is unknown dont dial my family call me Hank
I go way back like you still shop at Alexandos
Buy your sandals for your little son named Romandos
Watch your step Theresa chew up on your slice at Easter


Can you surround me in the black tan
My living room trips to Cancun with these  eighty ladies
The Jeffersons to the Brady Sanford and the Son
I want the whole world and my old girl back
She left me for the postman now she send me letters
I got a bottle of Grand Marnier drinkin in the stairway
With the wizard Kool Keith and Im SPORTIN my rhymes
Funeral chimes signal the beginnin of the end
Cowboy with more in with my private dancin chicks
They live way out in the sticks but I put em in the mix  uhhuh 
Took em to Reno in an old Camino gamblin in a casino
The movies Al Pacino
Chorus
Got my check cashed you posin new stop actin girl like a fool
Got the Benz on loan Sadat rollin by your school
You brought your frontin friend Gwen beggin for the Benjamin
Ill see you a ten with a haircut like Scottie Pippen
My man Mark rippinin the backseat my cousin Clifton
You get me pissed and wearin big gloves like Sonny Liston
Leon Spinks with afro on ready to rob the Brinks
I see you got your thongs out Daisy Dukes and buns out
You call me when you broken hearted when your money runs out
Back from the Conway you did it girl the blind way
Hold your horses and evil forces
Dont press star for Pathmark Ill be home after dark
Im tired of Pop Tart
Yeah
Im touchin Gwen with the butt love the rubber glove
Im touchin that ass she swingin her hair claimin shes an actress
But wasnt she that same chick I seen with the black dress
Traded the ninetyeight for the sixtyeight Mustang
Me and Keith at the bar do they know who we are
Apparently because all the drinks are free
Its Our house in the middle of our street
And when you come in here you better wipe your feet
Im from Alburqueque New Mex to the great state of Texas
I rode across on a gray horse 
Get to the sauce and add spaghetti nonpork  what 
Imma own New York with a big spots of the BX
And German outposts with the communists close  no doubt 
Im verbose I host the most yall should roast me
People watch closely and rewind me on the tape
Study this here then look and listen
Take a step back and watch the black pearl glisten
Chorus
