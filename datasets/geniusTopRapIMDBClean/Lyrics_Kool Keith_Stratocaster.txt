Im a leopard with leper skin  factual  thats steppin in
I guess they went from mulberry to strawberry
That will show em how to use the    cock the pen
Pronounce syllables with oxygen
Put laundry on Marie Osmond watch me bring profits in
Accountant act will come out your esophagus
I can see your wordplay close up like binoculars
Show em    red wine go with fish eggs and octopus
Im a mafia boss twin brother of Rick Ross
Til Maybach pull up Im givin out jobs off the books
The see through Bugatti make Danny Green wanna look
You rollin windows up manual let me show em buttons I push like polygram and Def Jam
The iron fist I bought from Iron Man on my left hand
Tuxedo made by Vince Camuto
Im ready to ballroom dance put Janet somewhere where she wont panic
Virgins come up first class on Atlantic
Many hopped on Wingo the Bentley Coupe got me writin romantic
Im hyped with nannies Vanessa Williams in panties
All BUS to try an extreme from Sammys
Steroid taker with the leather mask With Maxine

Yeah
The bushmaster we shush disaster like kush and shastas
Unlimited rounds demented with imminent sounds
The masters pound is senatorbound
Pretended the crown of a clown with a pen is profound
Walk in the room Boom Turn the ish to a tomb
Poisonous fumes consume a toys voice n his tunes
We sicknesses fake Adidas spitter we slick it in wigs
Ridiculous he split its a mystery hit
Ominous looks terrorize a con and his crooks
The dominant don prominent for    with his  jukes 
Nothin common its anonymous
Designin this nine n it hit ya monitors with timin thatll ponder your mind
Remindin ya spine we tapped it smacked it around
Like Monica with kanaka shots definin the crime
Im the incredible gamma man roll in the AM van
Eternally fresh leave ya soul for the ambulance
The day to smash a blackasMadagascar
As a matter for rappers the rash is a graphic disaster
The path of the blast is nasty when slackers are splattered
And they silly chatter shattered like a stratocaster
