Kool Keith on the phone
Hello  did Cathy come in today or what
Im startin to not to like whats shes doin at me
Shes not on time you know her hair aint combed
Shes not dressed properly
Shes always wearin jeans and this is a company
Where you wear dresses and you look neat and come in
With your briefcase
And were taking cutbacks somebody gotta get dropped
Capital investments by sequence automatic mechanical problem secure
Space investor Wall Street Journal analysist
The rates of companies by speed PaineWebber
Merryl Lynch no other than Solomon Brothers
Banking system with my computer wisdom
Immaculate suit pinstriped with my shirt and tie
Girls know Im fly  on the AX1 new floppy disk
Hello Theres somebody out there to see you
No tell her to call me back
Im busy with the President of the United States
Discussing more rates on a higher level
Dont give me feedback I dont need that
Two trips to Costa Rica Ill be a week back
Before you sign a new act find out if they wack
Your budget will be low and youll be fired highly retired
Im the new boss of this company girl
I want you to fax yourself to China OK Do this now 
Chorus Kool Keith singing  repeat 2X 
The girls dont like the job
Secretaries dont like my ways
I hire and fire give you checks on the spot
I hire and fire give you checks when its hot
Down at 55 Water Street
Top official always seein Chemical Bank Wells Fargo
Bank of America with my fine secretary Erykah
Me and Al Sharpton was talkin about real estate in Compton
With a loan from General Mills
I would start a new NBA team Baldwin Hills
The Baldwin Hills Spacemen
Lime green uniforms with a orange basketball logo
Me coaching the group solo thats right dolo
With the comissioner of the basketball
Passin yall in my ASR Rolls Royce
Yall cant stop my voice and opinion heres a card and my phone extension
Not to mention I ripped up four tickets to the Grammy awards
I had pasta with my new team and my roster
Agents beware Im talkin to Shaq behind the Lakers back
Michael Jordan Im important keep tapes recordin
Buyin baseball stadiums talkin to Joe Morgan
Cincinatti Reds Im over your heads
Call my limo Nancy make it fancy Im in a rush
No time for coffee ice cream from Mr Softie


Tom Hanks calls the base of Keith in the UK
We sold a lot of Mercedes Benzs
And BMWs to the small starving communities
Even as an import its just a regular cab in foreign countries
Materialistic for just the ignorant ones only the United States
Im goin to lunch Ill be right back
The girls dont like the job
Cutback on time
Employees research files tryin to find my styles
Sippin on a glass of Sprite
Toni Braxton wanna sing Pride with me tonight
I gotta work late the office the kids the dog
Puppies groceries hopin these things get done by the end of the week
I been through the week did you book my airline flight assistant Terry
Youll get no record deal actin like Neneh Cherry back to work dont flirt
Give me them passes to the James Brown concert
Front row seats at least PLEASE dont bother me I need peace
Terry you been late a lot
I hate a lot of those same black pants you wearin dancin
Take two days off Im goin to the playoffs
Chorus 15X
