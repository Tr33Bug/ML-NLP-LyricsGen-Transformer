Yeah We here tonight live on stage
Quincy Jones James Brown Prince Madonna
And of course Kool Keith
Take it away at the Grand Auditorium
Now youre up late cant get no sleep Im outside
Cruisin down 5th Ave makin love in your ride
You want that baby but Im out here thinkin maybe
What if you flip  but its OK when youre on my tip
Take off your shoes dont spread my business news
Reachin for the rubber tips its time to pay your dues
Two girls in the back bring your friend make it three
Its the big thing honey thats the policy
I got to pull down and bring the steel home for you
Break the headboards and tell your girlfriends come over too
Put my motorcycle helmet on and feel the power
Rock and lift the boots spank the lips for a hour
Chorus
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly  2X 
Keith is in town it sho was good goin down
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly
Keith is in town it sho was good goin down
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly
Yeah I must show up scope the cheeks well with clientele
When a sister wants to see me I should not really tell
I bought some movies some strippin joint type of coolies
Boots and thongs girls flip on my theme songs
They know I damage with gloves my equipments on
I got a cape like Superman Imma put it on
Grab the Vaseline make your hiney shine like Mr Clean
With a purple Gstring you wanna do your own thing
Girls dance for me pumpin over me
Big Smith is back word to honeys crack
Chorus
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly  2X 
Keith is in town it sho was good goin down
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly
Keith is in town it sho was good goin down

Keith is in town it sho was good goin down
The mack is back doin good and lookin fly
