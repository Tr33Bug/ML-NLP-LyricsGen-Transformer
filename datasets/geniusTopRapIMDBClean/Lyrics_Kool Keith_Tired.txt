Yeah
Im so tired
Im tired of everybody
Those who are envious
Those who cant stand it
Those that it hurt
Their little hearts their soul
Tired of everybody knowing where Im at my whereabouts
Rappers who aint recording just sitting home chewing bean sprouts
Lazy boys who sink in the couch thats why Im tired
They deny it in private some sleep so tired
They wont open their eyelids
They get surprised when I come up and shine like the sun
I just look at them Im tired of what they havent done
Many chasing their own tail like a play puppy
Im tired of people adults who wear huggies
Who love to talk about me bad and bug me
Knowing Im up there with Kanye and Kid Cudi
JayZ is my buddy
The masons say Im not fake
I cant believe Im so good Im in the studio with carrot cake
Other rappers bake
Im tired
Im so tired of
Im really tired
Im tired
Im tired of the laziness
Fugaziness
Im tired
Im really tired
Im tired
Im tired of no relief
Turned over a new leaf
New leash you chumps never knew grief
Getting stole like a true thief
Edo and Kool Keith tired of getting played like a motif
You punks dont know beef
Yall just living with no peace
I got beliefs but aint wishing to it
Aint tired of radio cause I dont listen to it
Im tired of cops that dont love us
But Im more tired of my brothers killing brothers
Weather going take the planet from us
Im tired of promoters trying to take advantage of us
Im tired of complaining people sitting next to me
Looking at my hands control my own destiny
Im tired
Im so tired
Im tired
Im so tired of
Im really tired
Im tired
Im tired of the laziness
Fugaziness
Im tired
Im really tired
Im tired
