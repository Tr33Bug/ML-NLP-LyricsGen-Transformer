World wide lamper world wide lamper world wide lamper
Between my legs the ladies like the way I ball handle
Especially when Im going to the basket making examples
Reverse dunking a punk and tap your girl on the butt
When she shoot at the foul line
Coach many from the top like Phil Jackson
The matte perrriwinkle Rolls Royce Wraith is accurate
Job application rappers you can scratch when I itch
The nutsack once a month on the fifth
Your mommy twerking while I smoke a spliff
She a mother of 19 kids pass her a brick
When she wear a wig export the imports
My jockstrap sniffed by TSA at the airport
I see a lot of Mickey Mouses on the wrist fossils dont count
Show you the Rolex out of bounds
Prada leather trench
Your lady show pretty pink to be Hershey dog brown
Take her off the campus with Dion and Colonel Sanders
The hawks looking for a good dude to cook food in Atlanta
Serve me frozen sodas from Fanta
More leg room show me where they expand us
I heard of Kurt Rambis by the lot playing Krampus
World wide lamper world wide lamper
How gully do I keep it
I can make you richest in the world so stop sleeping
In the rap game Im the best kept secret
Never made a penny from it you know how Im eating
Why they mad though 
They mad cause Im Fonzie
Walk up in the bar leaving with your aunt Ronnie
Plotting up a scheme like my last names Ponzi
Push a button on you suckers so dont ever get cocky
What you do for fun 
I get a kick out of winning
My main man Roddie gets a kick out of sinning
Doesnt know gymnastics but he always starts flipping
While Im at the waterfalls on the rocks Im sipping
They must like you 
Word being treated
From the roof of my castle looking down I see you scheming
Stickup kids jotting in my motor now they pleading
Every human being that ever tried to challenge been defeated
You life life 
I live life like a coozhound
With a quarter ki of coke and my goose down
Hit the dance floor ladies get loose now
Every time I leave I knock boots down
BARS Murre gives fucks none
I got that hot shit spitting out my tongue tongue
World wide lamp world wide lamp
Dirt Nasty baby faded now 
Cause I socked your mom in front of Papa Johns
Bumpin Dr Octagon with your Walkman on
Dont make me switch my pitch up
I smack my bitch up in a Cadillac pickup truck
Those dont exist 
Im world wide lamping now
Skinny dip with your bitch II I am the captain now
I am the captain 
I sail the seven seas in a gold scuba kit that cost 87 Gs
Thats expensive 
The ice cold freeze in the thaw on my dick when its 88 degrees
Say cheese ladies hit their knees
Cause my whip so sick that it got a disease
Rest in peace 
Fuckboy wearing a turtleneck and corduroy
Im eating dead Bok Choy with Soulja Boy
Yep the palette exquisite
My gynecologist make a sushi fried chicken
Thats racist 
She be on some cop shit
Talk shit Imma sock you with a chopstick
Nah bitch Imma knock you on the cockpit
Drop and kick your mom dick in a mosh pit
My suit is extinct
Its made of of ref panda bear beef ring
I meant to say its made out left panda paw and lion mink
All red leather bikini Sandusky made forever
And ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
World wide lamper world wide lamper world wide lamper
