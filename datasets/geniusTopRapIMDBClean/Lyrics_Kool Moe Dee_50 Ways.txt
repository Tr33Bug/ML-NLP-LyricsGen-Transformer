Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Always clean and my rap is mean
The biggest fiend youve ever seen
Can you relate Do you know what I mean
I got money to flaunt and I always get what I want
I got 50 ways to get ya
The erogenous zone of the female species
Attracts on to me and if not at least shes
Stimulated to a point where she sees something intriguing
But to me shes just suppressing her inner thoughts
Your physical jive cant be bought
I got 50 ways to get ya

Ill take your mind on a mental trip to a place youve never been
Make you see things in a way you never thought possible and then

Sit back and let you take control

Some girls like to play the game
Make you wait a year like it aint the same
