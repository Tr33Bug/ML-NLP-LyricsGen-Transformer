Its about time for some action
Im hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than physical attraction
Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good head on her shoulders
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that Ill go to the butcher store
Cause Im choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The sweet magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
Im up so get ready to work
All night long
How many ladies are deep enough
To handle a man like me
I mean mentally emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like em hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like em oldfashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women thats a slave to passion
But knows when to resist
I like a woman thats not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever were good to go
All night long
Scintillating sultry stimulating sexy
Super subtle smart and seductive
Sensitive serious succulent sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of mental stimulation
Thats causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I cant stand a groupie
But Ill always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause its cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long


I never like to make the first move
Imma rapper but I dont rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
Im much too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
I mean someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if youre for real
And right is how Ill do ya
Ill give you something you can feel
Its like a romance from a storybook
Without the wine and candles
An encounter youll never forget
But dont try it if you cant handle
All night long
