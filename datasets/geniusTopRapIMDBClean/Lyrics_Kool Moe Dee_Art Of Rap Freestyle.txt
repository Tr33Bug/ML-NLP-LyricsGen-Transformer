Braggadocious rhythmic vernacular
Designed to back you up
I back it up with the spectacular
Youre just a fraction of my perpendicular
With no particular linear structures
Im giving you ruptures
As I erupt into your cerebellum
I tried to tell em I open a vortex
Your cerebral cortex sends a reaction
That has em like a spasm
Upon further review you see it was lyrical orgasm
How did it happen You cant even describe the vibe
What was the essence of gods presence felt inside
Bestowed upon you from the moment I dropped it on you
I strike like a thief in the night and cant nobody warn you
Im on you I got that truly godlike
Metaphysical Neolithical
Ask what you see in me lyrical deity
Hip hops pantheon one step beyond so I stand beyond
Whatever Shaitans fans be on
I lights em up like neon locks em down like Dion
Reclaim my title three times like Ali when he beat Leon
And thats what I be on for the peon  we gone
