Since the day I was born I was on a mission
Never played out of position or wishin or missin
I came out kissin was no spankin the backside
Just ovulating nurses waitin for black eyes
I  I was talkin way before I could crawl or walk
And what the ladies heard wasnt baby talk
Id drop a line like a bomber would drop a bomb
Highly explosive but notice I was cool and calm
Ready for action at the age of 1 the fun
Was just beginning I was winning the ladies would come
With arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
I stripped down huh and watched the ladies bug
I stood up for a while then I started walkin
I heard the ladies say Look whos talkin
Thats right baby you can leave me alone
Cause if you cant please me dont tease me cause Im bad to the
Bad bababad bad
Big bad 	 Run
As a teen I was on the scene cleaner than clean
Mean lean fighting machine with selfesteem
No dope crack coke flat broke Im not
Sell smoke no no wont smoke the pot
Gettin high off life was more than enough
And peer pressure aint pressure when a boy is tough
And I was tougher than tough Im from the darkside
And hangin out in the park and in the parkside
Play a brother in any game he wanted to play
For fun or money for money if he wanted to pay
I wasnt diggin for niggas so brother dig deep
If one got over its over I let the kid keep
A little change its strange he want to bet it back
I took his claim to fame he want to get it back
And when the night was over I took his girl home
I dimmed the lights and showed her that I was bad
Now Im in my 20s with plenty money and honey bunnies
20s and 10s drive a Benz you cant take nothin from me
Cause I came up on the streets a straight up poor boy
But I beat the game but it was war boy
Because the streets entice you for the wrong things
I couldnt pay the price I wrote a song theme
And from the moment I touched the microphone
It was known that I was bad to the bone
But weak rappers and a lack of promotion
Made the job hard I had to throw some
Weak lyrics together just to get paid
Go See The Doctor and I got played
The train continued to the Wild Wild West
I heard some brothers say He aint the best
Huh but check the records that aint well known
And look around and see all my clones
By the time Im in my 30s my worth be  I bet Im dirty rich
Sittin on the top of the world with about 36
Million in my pocket and rockin it from the mountain top
Livin it at ease cool breeze because Im countin top
Dollar Im a scholar seekin knowledge Im a truthseeker
The baddest brother on a microphone and two speakers
On turntables Im able to start a movement
And when I move the crowd the ladies move with
Fire in the eyes the eyes never lie
So feel the fire and desire keep your eye on the prize
Ladies listen to the man and watch me work
Fellas keep your cool when she goes bezerk
Cause I touch em in places that most men dont
Dont get jealous fellas oh thats all she wrote
Then when the night is over youll be alone
Cause ladies love ya when a brother is bad to the bone
