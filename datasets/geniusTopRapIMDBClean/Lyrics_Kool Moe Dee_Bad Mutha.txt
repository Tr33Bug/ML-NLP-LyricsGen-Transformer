Other MCs I want you to know
If you ever wanna battle me dont move slow
Come and get it cause Im waitin and I got nowhere to go
Head to head toe to toe rhyme for rhyme blow for blow
We can go
Bad self 
Bad self 
Huh When I get busy the crowd gets dizzy
And when Im on the stage the party people say Is he
Really human or is he a robot
Because when Im on the microphone nobod
y does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control and if I choose
To call you the paperboy youll spread the news  bad self 
Like Paul Revere A real rapper is here
Yeah Moe Dee is coming Moe Dee is coming
And teeth will chatter plagiarists will scatter
Nothing is the matter youre just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin me I guarantee you wont recouper
ate cause I am great I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin my success but envious and cursin
You want my autograph dont act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound cause Im a bad bad bad mutha
Mutha mutha muthaf
Bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
I put a hurtin on rappers egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed asses are bust
Hearts are taken souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But Im not like you bitin barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
Im cyanide deadly and lethal
I never run out I got an automatic refill
I never get cold I only get lukewarm
When I wanna get hot I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin my talents start showin
And if the music stops Moe Dee keeps goin
Im bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy are these MCs really startin to irk me
Make it to the top then try to jerk me
Ask em whos the best their shoulders start shruggin
Like they dont know they must be buggin
But I like the controversy it makes me bloodthirsty
And one day Ill make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you wanna act like a sucker
Dont ever make me mad cause Im a bad bad bad bad
Mutha mutha muthaf
Bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Scratch it
Im the kinda rapper that a dummy wont dig
My IQs too high my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I wont do and heres an example
I wont make a LaDiDaDi an Oh Veronica
A Dear Yvette or a LaLatoya
Im not tryin to diss the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highlyrated Moe Dee
I have a formula Im like a scientist
And I must put words together like this
My voice is auriferous coming out an orifice
Expressing hyperbole verbally or if its
Mental or symmetric that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that cant be disconnected
Im a rhymer with a timer Im a English dialectic
My ideas are impeccable rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me agree or debate me
Watchin suckers gather round bow down and fellate me
Cause what I do orally is something so morally
Stimulating emulating heat thats callin me
My mind is both flexible and resilient
Pugnacious tenacious vivacious Im brilliant
Through rigorous training its selfexplaining
Why Im standing on the top and thats where Im remaining
My brain rocks like Mr Spocks
And any other MCs are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss so line up and pucker
Sucker MCs Im a bad bad bad bad bad
Mutha mutha muthaf
Bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Mutha mutha muthaf
With your bad self 
Now I was never solo I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day you idiot you knew from the giddyup
You didnt have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughing and youll be the stock
Cause thats whats good about havin you MCs on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But every time I speak I get unwanted protgs
If youve been lucky so far dont press your luck
Cause you dont really want none cause Im a bad bad bad
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Mutha mutha muthaf
Bad self
