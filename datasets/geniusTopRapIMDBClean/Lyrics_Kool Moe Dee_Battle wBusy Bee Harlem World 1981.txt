Battle wBusy Bee  Harlem World 1981  Lyrics
One for the treble two for the bass
Cmon Easy Lee and lets rock the place
One two one two
Do what you do now
Hold on Busy Bee I dont mean to be bold
But put that badittyba bullshit on hold
We gonna get right down to the nittygrit
Gonna tell you little somethin why you aint shit
It aint a emcees jock that you dont hug
You even bit your name from the Lovebug
And now to bite a niggas name thats some lowdown shit  Shut up Shut up 
If you was money man youd be counterfeit
I gotta give it you though you can rock
But everybody know youre on the Furious jock
And I remember Busy from the oldentimes
When my man Spoonie G used to sell you rhymes
Remember that rhyme called DittyBaDitty
Man goddamn that shit was a pity
Too hot to trot here to rock a spot
Spoonie G rocked it whether you like it or not
He begged for the rhyme asked for it twice
He says Spoonie G Ill buy at any price
When Spoonie finally sold it oh what a relief
Busy B stole it like a fuckin thief
Came out rockin the partys hard  Shut up 
Got everybody thinkin that that rhymes yours  Shut up 
Every time I hear it I throw a fit
Party after party  the same old shit
Record after record rhyme after rhyme
Always want to know your zodiac sign
He changed the shit to the favorite jeans
Cmon Busy Bee tell me what that means
Hold on brother man dont you say nothing
Im not finished yet I gotta tell you something
Too hot to trot Im here to rock the spot
Im gonna rock your ass whether you like it or not
Ill take the title right on the spot
How can I take a title you aint got
Youre not number one youre not even the best
And you cant win no real emcee contest
Celebrity Clubs and bullshit like those
Throw the kind of shows that everybody knows
Celebrity Clubs those are the kind you can win
Theyre all set up before he comes in
But in a battle like this youd know youd lose
Between me and you who do you think theyll choose
Well if you think its you I got bad news
Because they hear your name youre gonna hear some boos
Cause youre fakin the funk cause youre fakin the funk
And at the end of this rock you can call me uncle
Moe Dee rock shock the house
Call me uncle
Rock the house yall
Like this yall alike this yall
Like thisathis its like this yall
Now you popcornpeanuttoy emcees
Never ever ever heard no rhymes likes these
Cause my intent from the time I sent
Is to say those rhymes that I invent
And for your pleasure a rhyme youll treasure
Please dont try cause you cant measure
The length of time cant touch the rhyme
Hip hop dont stop cause you know Im
An MC supreme and Im oneofakind
And if you search real hard Im sure youll find
Aint another MC who can rhyme like this
Not your mother or your father aunt brother or your sis
Sit back and enjoy dont try to fight
Cause its very hard to say any rhyme I write
But do it like this do it like that
Concentrate real hard and get the rhyme down pat
And no matter how hard you try youll see
Youll get your mind into mine and cant say it like me
But you wanna be  Busy wannabe
And he know he wanna be another Kool Moe Dee
So lets all chant because you know you cant
Everybody salute to the new MC champ

Its like this yall like this yall
Like thisathis its like this yall
Now that badittybadadangdadangdang
Sound pretty good but it aint no thang

Man with all the superduper
Disco breaks have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes
Can rap it low Im not a bore
Baddest man you ever saw

Rhyme rhyme battle time
My opponent hes all mine
Im not the baddest not the maddest
When I win I am the gladdest
No beginner not a sinner
On the mic Im just a winner
Very very merry merry
Every time I bust a cherry
Oh my god its fame and glory
Thought Id never tell this story
Only time Im from the mic
Because its something that I like
To reassure the rhymes are low
I always keep some sex in store
The baddest bad superbad
Never sad always glad
Rhymer that youd rather have
If you fail I never have
Sleek sleek so unique
Guaranteed to move your feet
So ladies rock without a doubt
Guaranteed to turn it out
Remember me MC Moe Dee
The man thats at the TOP
And ladies dream the way it seems
When they see me their eyes are gleamin
Im so shocking when Im rocking
Bound to get your fingers popping
Have no doubt I turn it out
Cause thats a partys all about
Cause we do it right on through it
