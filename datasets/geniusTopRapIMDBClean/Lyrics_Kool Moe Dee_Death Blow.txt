To the break of dawn to the break of dawn
To the to the to the
Times up punk
Yeah yeah time to settle the score
To da break of dawn another dumb move
Ha ha ha this time its over boy
This is me and you head to head lets go
Here we go beat down round two
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you face to face head to head
Mic to mic I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn  Beats nitro
Lyrics weak say goodnight yo
Star Trek shades man cut the joke
Lets get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr Pitiful
Heres some mouthwash G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap C
AUSE youre riding me
TODD junior Moe Dee
Stop biting chewing swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son I need jock relief
Heres a toothpick now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it  Yeah  finished  Burp 
Now let a real man go to work
Cause Im a whip you like your daddy beat ya like a baby
Sic ya like a dog dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause youre nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
Im a treat ya like a hooker punk change your clothes
Put you on the streets in with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and Ill keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
Youre trying to come off and dont know how to come
Youre young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
Ill do you with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
Cause you cant hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue youre out of your league
Youre running out of gas and youre tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause hes petro
Take youre whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I aint smiling
Im shooting the gift of gab brother youre ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed you wont live to laugh
If theres laughter Ill get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So whos got no style look at your profile
You cant dance cant dress and youre so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you aint got a chance in hell
Youll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they wont show ya
When I finish your mama wont know ya
Cause Ima rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read He had no win
So RIP Rest in peace ripped em
DID dead indeed did em
An HIT hitman  so whatcha hit him with 
A rhyme silencer I hit him with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
If mama said knock me out come do it
You cant win and that  scratch  knew it
Ima send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
Youre out of here over finished all in
And Marley Marl cant save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn  Another dumb move
You cant go hard youre just soso Todd
Im that type of guy  Oh my God
Its gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because Im a rock up L
Low life loser life like luna
Lackadaisical listless luna
Tic liver lifeless living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league lard larcenist liar
Label ledger left the leper liar
Bull lull lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish language local logo
Light laboring limited loco
Now LLs a laughing stock
Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now youre down to a broken L
Your records aint hot and your shows dont sell
Yo tell em how you fell L  Hard as hell 
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it whos your daddy
Kill em kill em
Make you say Daddy I dont want none 
I did em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the to the to the get him out of here
Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on headtohead Kool Moe Dee versus LL
Put a little pressure on him cause the boy aint got no heart
Cause he knows what time it is
And anybody out there that dont know what time it is remember
I never said the brother couldnt make a good record
But when it comes to a battle we gotta go headtohead on them lyric tip
And when it come to lyrics he cant hang
