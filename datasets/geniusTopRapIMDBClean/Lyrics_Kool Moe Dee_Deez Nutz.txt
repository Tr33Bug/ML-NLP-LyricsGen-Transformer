Once again its the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Aint it a shame  rap is goin crazy 
The lyrical skills  are gettin kinda lazy 
The gift theyre shootin  couldnt even graze me 
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind only a handful
Only the deaf dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet Im tired of hearin this
Bang bang shoot em up baboo you get buckbucked
If you aint down with whats up
Then you can get with these

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasnt
Nothin lyrical hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters nothin against your
Fake lifestyle but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive cause its inedited you think its better with
Explicit illicit lyrics  but like a sedative
The rhymes aint hype so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brothers flows like
So here come the flow the lovable huggable colorful flow
The brother that glows in the dark cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe the highs and lows
Its up and down and out you go
So back up regroup slow down and check the cut
And if you still aint down get up on these

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook hed get props
Treated like some kind of hero most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one Im second to none
I come in the circumference 360 as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High you know the rhymes most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets I sinks the ships
So one shot aye captain I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin theyre mackin so I pimpslap em
Showin em whos large in charge runnin em up outta dodge
This is a hostile takeover Im takin over searg
Give me your stripes and your mics enough is enough
You can roll with us or you can roll with these
