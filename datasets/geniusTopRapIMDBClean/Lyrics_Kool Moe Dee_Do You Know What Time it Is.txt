Do you know what time it is
Girlies are partying touching my body and
Talking to me like Im a kindergartian
Today shes on mine tomorrow shes on his
But dont worry about me because I know what time it is
Time to get mine while you try to get yours
Ill get mine paws in those silky drawers
Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick
Cause all youre ever going to get is a piece of my dididiuh
Didnt you know that my girlie my toe
Its easy to come and harder to go
Hope you got a good heart and youre a good sport
Cause Im a treat you like we were on a basketball court
Im gonna run you around take you up and down
Take you out and leave you in the lost and found
So if you wanna be down then listen up miss
Before you deal with me youd better know what time it is
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Do you do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is
Some girlies are pretty some girlies are fine
But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind
They like sporting new gold and riding in cars
And most of them they dont care who you are
Theyre materialistic and unrealistic
And to most of them youre nothing but another statistic
Whoevers got the money theyre all on his
But yall can save it for David cause I know what time it is
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Do you do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is Check the clock
Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time and lets rock
Girls for me come a dime a dozen
And thats why I never ever ever was in
A situation where I could get jerked
Im like a mechanic all I do is bodywork
Want my money  You must be a fool
Cause like Billy Idol said Im gigalo cool
Moe Dee thats me introduce yourself miss
But dont try to be slick cause I know what time it is
Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised
String em out so they will always want more
Dont come around here and try to get richer
Dont ask me for no money cause baby baby baby
Betcha dont know me from a can of paint
And I bet you think Im fronting but I tell you I aint
And I bet you think you know but Ill tell you like this
Ill bet you dont know  Know what  What time it is
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Do you do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is
Its time to get money time to get paid
When its time to have fun its time to get laid
Like to front like Im poor I dont drive instead
I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red
Riding all around the city and half the world
And after talking from girl to girl
All you ladies seem to sing the same old song
Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along
Now Im a veteran a girl allpro
And as many as Ive had I still dont know
So I made a little system so I can tell
Doesnt always work but what the hell
Dont ask me for nothing and dont gimme nothing
And keep it like that for about a whole month and
Half and Ill laugh and maybe one day miss
Maybe you can be down maybe you can be down
Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Do you do you know 
Do you know what time it is   Tell me do you know 
Do you know what time it is Check the clock
Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time and lets rock
