  phone rings  
Yo Moe whats up
Where you been man
Whats up with the new sound
I aint heard from you in a while man
What you been doin man
Some of my homies dont even know you
Whats up with that
Whats up with that 
Let us begin with a funky intro
My name is Kool Moe Dee what up what up  yo
And for those of you who just dont know
Or might no recognize me from the funky  flow
I am the brother from the Wild Wild  West
But Im not comin on the new wild  quest
Because I cant get with the new  sound
Because I dont like the way its goin  down
Brothers always say they wanna keep it  real
But how many brothers really kick the  skill
So what you got a little street  appeal
So you promote genocide for what A  deal
Well I was never with that  scene
Because the ends could never justify the  means
And if its all about gettin that  green
I been there I done that I mean
Im doin my thing kid
Yo what kinda flavor is that man
I want the new stuff man 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
The hardcore gimme the hardcore stuff man
Come on 
Im doin my thing kid
I hear you but the brothers aint with the positive stuff
Wont you kill a rhyme 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
Shoot somebody in the next verse aight
Kill somebody 
Brothers say they wanna be hardcore
So in their own communities they start  war
You really dont care because you say you got  yours
But think about it for a second stop pause
If all you wanna do is get  paid
Then you aint nothin but a paid  slave
The Uncle Tom of the New  Age
Cause sellin out aint nothin new  wait
Cause you can pull a trigger on a nigga well
You think youre bigger nigga stop and think you sell
Aint nothin hard about committin homicide
Cause genocide is really suicide  right
Well think about it on a higher  level
You sold your soul and you got hired by a  devil
To reek havoc in the ghetto yall go head on
Keep runnin with God like a runnin rebel
Doin my thing kid
Whats all this rhymin about God
What youre tryin to do man 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
You a reverend or something
Tryin to be a preacher or what 
Im doin my thing kid
Give it up with the preachin God
Just rhyme just rhyme 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
Alright then flip the flow change your flow
Be like somebody else 
Im true to the game so I keep inventin
Hype rhymes for the times and Im representin
Kick flavor while Im eatin up the best of em
Then put em in the pile with the rest of em
When I flip it and hit it some brothers dont get it
They want me to kick it like others  forget it
I tailormade a style for the microphone
You can search the rap files but its mine alone
I wont get in to fit in the flow its wont simulate
Now bein one of the best causes them to hate
The freestyle master cause Im a outcast
You ever stop and ask yourself how to outlast
All those before me and the many that came after
The critics who dissed this I dimiss with laughter
Aint no puzzle put a muzzle on their face
And watch the hype crowd sing
Im doin my thing kid
Man
Alright I see what youre doin
I can get with that 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
I kinda like that yo
Go ahead and do yo thing kid 
Im doin my thing kid
Yeah yeah I dig it I dig it
Go ahead do your thing 
Hey yo Im doin  my thing kid
Hit me with one more and let em know where its comin from 
I worked with Sugarhill Gang Run and Heavy D
Eric B Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
From 79 to 94 now thats longevity
You got a problem with the flow heres a remedy
Just sit back relax in fact try to hear it
Cause Im comin back to back you gotta wear it
Aint no sense goin against the grain
Get yourself a surf dude ride the wave
Cause this aint the regular style aint no competators Ill
Take out the negative while just like a predator Ill
Prey and on play on and stay on the airwaves
You heard Im fallin or fell chalk it as hearsay
Aint no defense mechanism or criticism
Capable of doin no nothings here thats how Im livin
You can bring whatever you got to bring
Im the champ the master the king
Im doin my thing kid
Yo Moe you all that man
You gon go far man 
Hey yo Im doin my thing kid
Im not lyin you gon make it to the top 
Do your thing kid
Do your thing kid
Do your thing kid
