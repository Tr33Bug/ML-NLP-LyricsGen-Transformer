I get on the mic for one reason that is to be heard
And when Im on the microphone I hope you dont miss a word
Im not saying do not enjoy yourself dont take a chance
To shake your head pat your feet clap your hands but dont dance
Cause if youre up and dancing then you wont really hear
The smoking rhyme that I design for you all to compare
With the other brother lovers of the hiphop culture
Beat is working rhymes are perking and its gotta be felt
But dont dancedont dance
They consider me epitome of rap and I know
Rappers wanna get rid of me cause at a live show
I got a voice like Luther Im bulletproofa
A rhyme that I design will always make you the
People take notice on how I always show this
Funky style forget the smile your facell say Yo this
Brothers not playing you know what Im sayin
MCs on your knees say Please start praying
Dont dancedont dance
Attention at ease emcees
You pay too much attention to the rhymes like these
One took part of my name others part of my fame
One took the rhythm now the people think that were on the same
Level of intelligence but thats irrelevant
If we ever battle head up you wont do well against me
Im the originator the only real creator
Called time bomb with the end of my detonator
Ready to blow up and totally show up
A rapper Ill slap and with a mean rhyme slow up
Huh you wanna go up against me then throw up
Your mic stand but make plans to get tore up
Cause Im gonna rip ya I would strip ya of the title
But I got it so get off my tip
Ya wannabe me MC ooh weeIm rocking me now
I know Im rocking you cause I could see your hand
Highfivin cause Im live and saying you heard the man
Dont dancedont dancedont dance


I said my rhyme loud proud now look at the crowd
Fellas ho ladies ow how
Could you take my style smile while stealing
You should bow down bend and be kneeling
Praying to me like a god go on
Just say my rhyme youre on mine subconsciously
You know that you cant live up
To my rap status drop your mic give up
Cause I am relentless thats why I spit this
Time to make a fresh rhyme and invent this
Style that youre hearing year out and year in
But suckers keep stealing it and then swearing to God
They didnt take it they know they didnt make it
But you cant lie to yourself give me a break it
Seemed to me that I was your favorite
Hiphop hero back in the days its
Undoubtedly obviously true
You wanted to be another Moe Dee when you
Started rhyming you see you had to be to some degree
An imitation variation of me
And now all of a sudden youre competition
So now you think you can change my position
Dont be dumb Im still number one
When you hear me come you better run and hide out
And enjoy yourself while you got the crowd fooled
Believing youre the best cause Ima take you to school
And if you really think youre better I want proof
Im calling you out this is the moment of truth
Dont dancedont dancedont dance
