Dumb Dick  Richard  Lyrics
Dudumb   Dumb

Dudumb   Dumb 
Ddddumb   Dumb 
Well listen up homeboys I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was Richard some called him Rick
But if you knew him like me youd call him Dick
When we were growin up we stuck with each other
Like white on rice he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong Rick got obsessed
We wouldnt go to class always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass if he would just laugh
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys heda been dropped out
When he did drop out he felt no shame
And if you ask me he had the right name
Cause he hated to go but he loved to come
Thats why I call him Dick cause Dick is Dumb
Dick
Ddddudumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddudumb 
He wouldnt go to school but he had to survive
So he went out and got him a 9 to 5
Although he was lazy he had to work
Cause he had a lot of girls he needed money the jerk
As fast as he made it his money was spent
When it came to girls he didnt care where he went
Hed hound em like a dog so we used to say fetch
And it was no tellin what he would catch
He was in the doctors office almost every week
He became so popular everybodyd speak
When he walked in theyd say  Hi Rick 
And when he passed by theyd say  Dumb Dick 
Really hardheaded cause he said he had juice
But it was cause of his hard head that he was so loose
He was in love with another girl every day
And when we asked him why hed only say
Im the kinda guy who likes to have fun
I need a lotta girls cant have just one
I can understand that but this is kind of insane
Sometimes I wonder if his brain
Was his
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
He lost his girl when he lost his job
So to keep himself from livin like a nogood slob
He hustled on the streets cause he had no choice
And every day youd hear his voice
Sayin Jumbos I got it good
But he never made the money that a hustler could
Cause when he was standin out on the corner
If a girl walked by he was right up on her
He was so hot his heat couldnt be measured
To him his business was his pleasure
A onetrack mind and as a matter of fact
He changed his name to Daddy Mack
The people on the streets he was workin for
Cut him off now hes just plain old poor
And all his girls left because they never cared
The were leeches for a dollar and they got their share
Homeboy disappeared like a magic trick
And everybody wanna know what happened to Dick
Well hes still around but now hes a bum
Chasin bag ladies hes the same old Dumb
Dick
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick 
Ddddududumb   Dumb 
Dumb Dick
