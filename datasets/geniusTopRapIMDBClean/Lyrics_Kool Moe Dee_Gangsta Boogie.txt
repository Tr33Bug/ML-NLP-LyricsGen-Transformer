So you wanna be a gangster
So you wanna be a gangster 
Gangsta boogie gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie gangsta boogie
So you wanna be a gangster 
Gangsta boogie gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie gangsta boogie
Fast women fast cars
Fast money movie stars
Lights cameras glitz and glamor
Action role and broken grammar
Gangster lean threads are clean
Talking red black and green
Gold and diamonds ride shinin
Tape playing Moe Dee rhymin
Living large big mirage
Cops scheming pay the sarge
Girls want him Feds taunt him
Streets haunt him spirits mourn him
Chasing ladies making babies
Living shady wild and crazy
Doing crime doing time
Favorite line This world is mine
City slicker big nigga
More bodies than Adolf Hitler
Coldblooded killer man
Executing a killers plan
Hahahahardcore encore
Drug war blood pours
Watch your back got a pack
Keep a gun on the run
Think quick move slick
Ladies trick take your pick
Money rollin pockets swollen
Rep growin know youre goin
Work a show when fear is showin
Money stolen and whos holdin
Paranoid selfemployed
Cant avoid homeboys
Work witcha mic hit ya
Somebodys gonna get ya
Cops bust em cant trust im
Didnt talk got to dust im
You get him or hell get you
Some police in on it too
Stand tall take a fall
Last call take em all
BBum rap death trap
Backtrack think back
Bad decision blurry vision
Money missin on a mission
Want position steady wishin
Never listen in hells kitchen
When youre livin do or die
The strong survive sell or buy
Crackheads living dead
Their problem theyll solve em
No tears who cares
Getting yours taking theirs
Meanwhile on trial
Evidence on file
Next stop state pen
Bigshot kingpin
Scarface wannabe
Now youre gonna see
The light clear too late
Sold your soul shows your fate
Bad karma time to pay
Got to go judgment day
Sold out now youre cursed
Life in jail if they dont kill you first
