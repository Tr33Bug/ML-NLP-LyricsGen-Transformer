Money  Get paid  x4
I know Im rockin
So stop your sockin
Baby maybe if you play your cards right
Ill be knockin those boots in the future
Youre kindda cute
You got a man I understand
See I wont dispute you
Im here to have fun
Thats my only purpose
Nothing more than good friends
Cause that will only hurt us
And Im very jealous
I know cause all the fellows
And I get from the school of cool
Where they tell us to get paid
Im making money
And now its kindda funny
All of a sudden the girls
They want to give me honey
Theyre always scheming
Their eyes are gleaming
Dollar signs written all over them stop dreaming
Cause Im upon it and I know you want it
I got the money and I know you want it
You try to play me
And youll get played
Cause I come from the school of cool
And all we do is get paid
Trying to get money  Get paid 
At a party girls they like to throw me body
They figure its easy cause they know that Im a hottie
I give them rhythm
I hang out with them
Then they always wanna know what else can I give them
Nothing but a hard time and a hard way to go
Dont tell you what you want to hear only what you need to know
Dont let no wedding bells ring
Dont pay no choir to sing
Aint no diamond ring in this thing
I just want to get paid

Money  Get paid 
Whenever Im dating girls they always heavy weighting
Of course they treat me 
I wear the  cause they know what Im about
Spending money having fun and eating out
So they take me around to the best restaurants
Hand me a menu and say you can have what you want
Pizza Lobster Sushi Chicken Steak
I say forget it lets go to the bank
I just wanna get paid
Money  Get paid
