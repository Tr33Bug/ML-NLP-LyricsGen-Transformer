Yo I had to go for mine
From the bottom to the top is a hard climb
But hard rhymes beat hard times
Gimme a spotlight and Ill shine
Brighter than the brightest star
No matter who you are
Youre outdone I won and for the coup de grce
Competition turns into fans
Like a politician my competition spans
From country to country its never too far
Cause Ill take em all from the Shah to the Czar
The Fu Man Chu the Prime Minister too
The King and the Queen my rhymes are so mean Ill do
A number on the country like never before
Is it a contest or the threat of world war
Choose your weapon no halfsteppin and lets go
But if ya steppin watch ya step and step slow
Take your time change your mind
Cause steppin to my rhyme is like steppin on a land mine
Blowing you to kingdom come this aint Vietnam
A brother thinks hes ready for war bring him on
A perilous journey you catch a hernia
Trying to burn me cause like an attorney
Ill crossexamine
Your rhymes of my design
And Im still standing tall
As the competition falls in actuality aint no competition yall
Cause Im rollin over rappers like a US tank
Meanwhile Im laughin all the way to the bank

Suckers
Tried to put me down
Said rap was crap and wouldnt be around
Any longer than two years
But eight years later Im still here
Fully paid because the rhymes I made
Made dollars and cents I wasnt dense I stayed
Away from drugs I never touched a pipe
When I wanna get high I smoke the mic
I never did white lines cause I only write lines
And I aint sniffin nothing but the vapors from hype rhymes
As I start to float on the rhymes I wrote
Ascending to a level with the gods and I tote
Loads and mounds of people as they reach new heights
A halfamile from heaven is the party site
And Im the attraction the Gods will be packed in
Coming out of their pockets for me to rock it and acting
Like theyve never ever ever been entertained
They try to act godly but they cant maintain
Aphrodite would freak as her knees get weak
And Venus would peak off every word I speak
And Zeus would get loose fully induced
And Ill make Apollos ryhmes sound like Mother Goose
By nights end Mercury is so hyped
Hed spread the word that theres a god on the mic
Captivating all the other gods by the masses
Described as a darkskinned brother in glasses
But unlike the other gods I aint a myth
You wanna riff I suggest you take the fifth

Knowledge
Is the source of my success
History is the course and lifes the test
For those who dont know historys repetitive
The lack of knowledge serves as a sedative
Makes you relax and max the lack of facts
Holds you back and then the odds are stacked
Against a weak mind it makes a meek mind
But mine aint weak I got a piece and Ima speak mine
Telling you the truth as I raise the roof
With rhymes so hard Im bulletproof
One slip of the lip and I can sink your ship
You wanna get hip lets take a trip
All aboard this is the last call
It aint a mandate cause Ill only ask yall
Once and only once yo purchase a ticket
Get on the rap train watch me kick it
From state to state and every little hick town
Theyll all be down with the new hip sound
Treating me like more than just a star of the sport
But more like the judge in a court
They all rise and throw their hands in the air
Pump their fists and solemnly swear
To rock the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
Not only the youth
Cause the young and the old are all alike
It makes no difference when Im on the mic
For those who cant visualize what their eyes cant see
You wanna get the picture focus on me
