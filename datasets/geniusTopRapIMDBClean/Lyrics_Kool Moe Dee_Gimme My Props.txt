Hooooo Ho Ho Ho Ho
This is of low guard what you call a jack move
Im taking your flow cards whoever cant rap smooth
Im calling your bluff Ive seen enough what what
Dont you say nothing until Im finished your mouths shut
Youre answering yeah yeah your heart is inside there
So whats all this I hear theres no one that I fear
Ill tell you what Imma do by showing you what I did
Too clever to ever lose Im stepping so what up kid
Who wanna play hard he who cant go
He who shivers as I deliver the death blow
I hit him with rhythm and leave him livin in sub bass
A musical prison thats only givin him someplace
To exercise thought memorize taught
Lessons his eyes caught while stepping in my sport
And rapping and clapping and fingersnapping and dropslapping
Crashing and scratching an iron asking Im propssnatching
Just give it here  give it here  but dont say nothing
Just give it here  give it here  but dont hold back 
Im taking you to the hole I dont need a pickandroll
Bass in your face anyplace shoot bulletholes full of soul
Come down like an avalanche and youll never have a chance
Believe me you gotta dance forget about backup plans
Who wanna get some Get live get dumb
Come get it get with it when I hit it then you get numb
Cause you cant get with a seasoned vet better yet
An act of halloffame rap name legend lets
Take it to the stage the next phase lets trade
Lyrics like bullets and I wouldnt get grazed
The gift you shoot couldnt hit me at pointblank range
Now how could I ease the pain
Ill damage an amateur flow on an allpro
Wreck a vet like a rookie now yall know
This aint nothing new its old news nothing stops
And after bumrushing crews Im bumrushing props


This is how I change my flow
When its time I got a rhyme to go
A takeout order and Ill take out
Any other rapper even thinking about
I might be or could be or maybe or should we
No matter how good he may think hes a wouldbe
Superstar that never got a chance to go far
The buck stops here bad move its ovar
Cant nobody kick enough relevant flavor
Braggadocious rhythm with intelligence save the
Lyrical madness for suckers who had this
Hypetalkcaused status personified badness
That dont add to nothing but mad faces and hot air
Bring him to the front and let me see what we got here
Ill rock him like his daddy with the lyrics I drops
Rock him to his knees and make him gimme my props
Hoooooooooooo Ho Ho Ho Ho
Now name another rapper thats had a longer reign
Ive been rocking the mic from Sugar Hill to Run to Kane
And any new jack that do that the new jack will gain
Fully prepared fully aware of the name
KOOL MO so well
Established and rap is the habits the local
Wannabe upstarts rappers trying to jumpstart
Careers but Ive got years ripping up charts
Any attack you attack will be countered
Any diss that you diss Ill dismount it
Cause I get off on a soft aint hardcore
Sucker whos paying no dues but he got more
Props than loot my new groups a substitute
Back up court backs back on the bench recruit
No more sixman costar title shots
The longreigning king of the rap games taking props
