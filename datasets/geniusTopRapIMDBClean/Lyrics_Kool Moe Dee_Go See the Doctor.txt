But three days later go see the doctor
I was walking down the street rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neat and petite
She was so sweet yes I wanted to meet
And so I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said Listen up fellas come over here bust it
They said Did you get it I said Yeah they said How was it
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later go see the doctor
I rocked her to the left rocked her to the right
She felt so good hugged me so tight
I said Goodnight
Three days later
Woke up fussing yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said Mama mia
Ima kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got the more I reminisce
Why is my thing thing burning like this
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldnt wait to rock her world
I said Hey good looking what you got cooking
What have I done stuck my dick in
Now I know why her exboyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later go see the doctor
I went to the doctors office I said What have I got
He said Turn around boy and take this shot
I looked at him like he was crazy and I said What
Aint nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
Have it your way if thats your choice
And Ill put it down if you want me to put it
But dont blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You wont be able to screw the only thing you can do
Would just kick her so go take karate
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said Next time Ill use some protection
If I see another girl and I get an erection
Im walking in the other direction
Cause I dont wanna do the sick sick dance
So Im keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up Ill make her go see the doctor
