 Fun fun funky 
Got to be funky 
Funky 
Funky enough 
Look look look look look look look
Look at me cool as I wanna be
Fly as they come Messiah to some born to be
One of the chosen few chosen to go into
Rhymes that change in time as it grows into
Riches hitting switches your whole lifestyle
Youre in the spotlight overnight flight miles
Away today Im flying high
So I give thanks to the Man in the sky
I remember a time whenever a rhyme
Left your lips it only could get nickels and dimes
But nickels and dimes wasnt enough to eat
So I guess you could say I was saved by the beat
On the street surrounded by sin
I never sell out and I wouldnt give in
God said you can win look within
See your skin youre my kin
And I made you Funke
Is it funky enough 
I like it 
God made me funke
Is it funky enough 
I like it 
God made me funke
FUNKE
Esoteric nongeneric potent lyrics
Only those with ears will hear it
As above so below
Lucky seven seventh heaven heaven flow
Back and forth
South to north
Right to left
Life to death
East to west
Knowledge step thirty three degrees
Three hundred and twenty seven left to see
So God created a light in which I shine
With sublime rhymes that inclines the mind
To find ancient secrets seek it speak it teach it
Keep it peep it we get stronger and reap its
Benefits but then it gets more intricate
As you get deeper into it
To open the door the power of Gods the one key
And I opened it and God made me funke
Funky  is the way God made me
Funky  is the power He gave me
Funky  like the fans that pay me
Funky  like the stations that play me
Funky  is how I made it through the 80s
Funky  connected to the ladies
Funky  you know a devil cant faze me
Funky  I aint afraid B
Funky  cause God made me
Funke
Im over over like a fat rat
The blind see what I got and others see how I got that
Position with vision
Precision decisions like a livin prism
Im shining light on the money I made
And the rhymes parlayed
And you can see Im paid
I condemn them that focus on the ends
As opposed to the means killing machines men
Im the real high roller cause Im rolling with God
Save the children thats my job
Working overtime going over rhyme
Mind over matter spirit over mind
I sympathize with the brothers on the street
Cause its genocide and we all got to eat
But do the right thing and youll never be hungry
I kept the faith and God made me funke
