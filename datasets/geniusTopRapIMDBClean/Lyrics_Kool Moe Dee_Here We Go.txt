Here we go
Come on
Yeah yeah
The word is out
Kool Moe Dees in the house again
And here we go again
And word has it the brothers esoteric knowledge
Is a little too deep for the fans
So he gon come this time with a simplyfied rhyme
Check it out
Around and around and around we go
People comin to the jam to hear me flow
The live lyricist is here and its so
I got a funky beat to let you know
Only real brothers wanna hear real rhymes
All the soft suckers want the nickelanddime
Candycoated sugarcoated bubblegum rap
Long as its movin on a funky track
My vocabularys over their head
They cant understand a word I said
So I gotta come with the watereddown sound
With mediocre adjectives verbs and nouns
Party people in the party only wanna dance
Its hard to rock a party when youre lyrically advanced
I tone down the lyrics supressed ego
Got a funky rhythm now watch me go
Here we go
Come On
Go go go go 
Here we go again 
Yeah yall come on 
Here we go again 


Go with the flow no no no
I am the brother that sets tempo
Intelligent relevant eloquent speakin
You do the dancin Ill do the freakin
Some people wanna dance some people wanna listen
Some people at the party only wanna hear the dissin
My versatile styles Im able to adapt
You know Im talkin shit cause Im all that
I drop science for the brothers on the street
Intellects get it and others want the beat
The way they feel I could be erased
All they want is you to pump that bass
Rather than tryin to change the times
They would rather me change my rhymes
A positive brother yeah yeah we know
But they would rather just watch me go
I am a brother young gifted and black
Theres no need for the profane rap
Im lyrically potent very well versed
Some rappers cant rap and try to hide it with a curse
Money in the pocket gold around the neck
Rings on every finger boomin system in effect
Tryin to imitate or better emulate
I can relate but I rather innovate
Like the creator I love to create
Peace and love conquerin hate
I got a date with faith
To be known as the great
So all you sissysoft suckers gainin weight
Become irate while the ladies girate
Infatuate lust and mate
Mental state compensate
If I get too deep then you wont relate
So now I gotta tone down the sound
Cos I can pick the beat up and turn it around
Turn any jam to a political party
Raise your conscience and rock your body
If you cant relate just clap your hands
Listen to the rhythm and do your dance
And Ill just party with the alter ego
Rockthebodybodybodybody here we go
