Yeah yeah yeah
Ice water watch your daughter
Your mother and your sisters aunts
Nieces and your wifes ought to
Know aint nobody safe when Im in the place
Im dropping more bass when facetoface
Erase haste with the taste of a steady pace
Aint no time to waste and it aint no race
You state your case and work your weights
Without a trace and just wait
For doubleblack to double back and make that move
Break it to ya Ima do ya and I aint that cool
Enough to take you plus I aint just
Here to bust so you know what it aint just
Another brother or another joke with money
Cause Im giving you something to work with honey
You can feel the heat but it aint no pressure
When I turn the heat on the cool breezell refresh ya
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
Put it in flowmotion ice cool with a nice cool breeze
Nativesung native tongue for the young ladies
Dropping rhymes rocking minds and concubines
Treat it like a king of this hip hop thing that rhymes
Manifest as a vehicle and see a full
Picture Im witcha Ill hitcha with mixtures
And become a fixture inside your heart
Make you feel the pulse of my beat even miles apart
Aint no mountain high enough or a valley low
To stop Kool Moe I got a cosmic flow
I glow like a moon it dictates your mood
But cool aint a mood its an attitude dude
Its a tone its a tempo a mindset a rhythm
A lifestyle religion its just how youre livin
Im righteously cool while here and hereafter
Im so cool that I have to ask ya
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
Easy does it not because its easy
Turn the heat on and it still wont freeze me
Internal climate control controls the climate
Thats why I rhyme at the temperatures Im at
Usually freeze competitive emcees
And breaks them down in threes and lights them up like Christmas trees
Fortified with tranquility to deal with the trilogy
I got the ability for upward mobility
Break calm genetically athletically mental
Exercising thoughts cause I went through
Party like a trooper complete mind fighter
And now Im known a super elite rhyme writer
Now theres women and millions in dollars and loads
Fly gear to wear as the stage explodes
Role model for the people cause I keep a level head
When I look into the mirror the reflection said
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
I never lose my composure cause I aint supposed to
I rose for the occasion thoughts never froze I chose
A pattering pattern that patterned to the battle zone
You can get rattled home so dont even travel roam
Or drift or wander into my vicinity
Ill respond and conk with no affinity
Identity scrape broken down on tape
And it aint no escape and you gets no breaks
I make few mistakes cause I strive for perfection
Head for the hills if I shoot in your direction
Protections limited heroic images
Are broken down hellbound from the minute its
Image is amplified Ill be damned if I
Believe the hype of stereotypes I plan to die
Like a warrior fight until Im free
How cool Can One Black man Be
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
How cool how cool how cool
How cool can one Black man be
