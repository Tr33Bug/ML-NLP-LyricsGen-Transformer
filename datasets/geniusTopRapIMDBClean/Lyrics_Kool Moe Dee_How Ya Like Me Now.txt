All aboard for the night train
I throw my tape on then I watch ya
Three seconds later I got ya
Shakin your head dancin instead of sittin
The rhymes kick the beats hittin you
Just like a home run slammin like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC get paid
Usin my rap style
And Im playin the background meanwhile
I aint with that you cant forget that
You took my style Im takin it back
Comin back like Return of the Jedi
Sucker MCs in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
Im no phony Im the only real micaroni
Playin the mic like its supposed to be played
New jacks you all shoulda stayed
Out of the business what is this
Amateur night at the Apollo
Get off this stage Im in a rage
Im like a lion thats been trapped inside a cage
Im the real king rap is a jungle
I never understood how could one go
To a party watch me stand around and jock me
Become a rapper then try to rock me
Schemin like a demon youre screamin and dreamin
Im from the old school I used to see men
Die for less but Im not living that way
Ill let my mic do the talkin
And let the music play
How ya like me now


Rap is an art and Im like Picasso
But of course why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture and try to get ya
Self in my shoes but they wont fit ya
Im bigger and better forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again respect I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect
Vernaculars pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
Ill make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MCs Ill make your girl say Ow
And shes jockin now how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know Ill serve
Run around town sayin he is the best
Is that a test Im not impressed
Get real youre nothing but a toy
Dont ya know that Ill serve that boy
Just like a waiter hit em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he pay the bill
And leave him standin still
When hes had enough hit him with a refill
And for dessert it wont be no ice cream
Im just gonna shatter and splatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath beat him down and laugh
And when I finish then Im gonna ask him
Who is the best And if he dont say Moe Dee
Ill take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good then Ill make him sweat
Always talkin about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did how could you beat me
Youre so petrified youre scared to even meet me
My words the law thats why you dont beef
Youre nothing but a punk track star and a thief
So Im puttin you on punishment just like a child
Never touch another mic how ya like me now
How ya like me now
I could continue theres more on the menu
But Ill relax cause Im so far in you
You had enough I know youre overstuffed
And if I keep going youll be throwin up
Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day
When you used to come to my parties and pay
Nobodys ever gonna rock me and this I vow
So all I wanna say is how ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
How ya like me now
