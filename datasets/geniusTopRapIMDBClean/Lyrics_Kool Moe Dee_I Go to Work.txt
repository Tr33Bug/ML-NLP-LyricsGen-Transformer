I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic you got to like
The way I operate I make miracles happen
Just from rappin Im so lyrically potent
And Im flowin and explodin
On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill as I build a guild
For all the rappers of skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang em in effigy
If hes a sucker hang em to the left of me
Cause my righthand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keepin at a steady pace
Aint no reason to rush it aint no race
Ima hit the top just when I wanna
And its a matter of time and Im gonna
Cause I know when to go head into
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya
Runnin around holdin ya head
Asking your homeboy Yo man you heard what he said
Another funky rhythm look at your man and give him
A high five cause Im live runnin around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
Its time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation
Of rappers and after I came off vacation
I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone Daddys home
So open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and whos the ace
Start the race Im coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers cant capture Moe Dees rapture
And after I have ya I have to slap ya
Senseless with endless rhymes dont pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous and when this
Rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap youll lust another one
But you gotta wait it takes time
I dont write I build a rhyme
Draw the plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if its weak when Im done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work


I go to work
I go to work
I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme rocks ya
Sometimes it knocks ya so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks so power packed
Before you can react youre flat on your back
Down for the count get up and dismount
Cause Im coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch but dont worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level so you cant relate
Unless youre intelligent so stay awake
Sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorkers
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencils
Writing a rhyme in its highest form
And Ima drop it on ya like a bomb
And when it explodes Ill blow up
A few casualties but so what
If youre slow you blow you know you go
I flow I throw allpro I go to work
To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me youll compare me
To a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhymes a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work
