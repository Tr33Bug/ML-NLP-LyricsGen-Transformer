Hey baby you think that maybe
We could hang out But not today because
I got another date and Im already late
But heres my number call me dont procrastinate
When you get home pick up the phone
Leave me with a message dont leave me with a dial tone
And when I finish hanging out with this girl tonight
Im calling you and you better act right
She said Hold it you got a lot of nerve
What makes you think you deserve
A call from me and I said Save it
If you didnt want my number you woulda gave it back to me
Right away and as I walked away under her breath I heard her say
Youve got it Ill call you later
You like the way I played her Im nothin but a player
Im a player  Aint no trick 
Nothin but a player
Im a player  Aint no trick 
So what Im a player playing the field
If you want me you better yield
Proceed with caution without a doubt
Im the guy your mother warned you about
But I wont deceive you love you or leave you
Dont tell me that you love me cause I wont believe you
Im straight up with you so be straight up with me
You could do what you wanna do and let me be what I wanna be
And thats a player girllayer rhyme sayer
Im on a mission to prove that today a
Man doesnt have to lie unless hes just an average guy
Lying to girls just to get em in bed
If anybodys confused Ill repeat what I said
Im a fullfledged player you better believe it
Now you know what time it is you can take it or leave it
Im a player
Aint no trick   Aint no trick  Im a player
Aint no trick   Aint no trick 
You said that I dissed you from the way I speak
Well I call em as I see emfreak
Wanna play miss prissy innocent with me
When I know what you were doing last week
Riding around all over town in and out of cars
Now how that sound
You got a hundred beeper numbers in one phone book
And been with every other guy in town
If a guy has a hundred girls hes a hero
A girl with a hundred guys is a zero
Dont blame me that society made the rule
But I think they made it for me
Varieties are right for me but ladies in the place
Dont you even try to be
A player thats my JOB and Im playing it to the T
Im nothin but a player

 Aint no trick  Im nothin but a player
Aint no trick   1 2 3 4
