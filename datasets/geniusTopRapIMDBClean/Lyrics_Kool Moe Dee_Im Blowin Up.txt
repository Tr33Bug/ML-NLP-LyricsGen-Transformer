Im TNT and I just cant lose
An EMCEE with a fuse
When its lit Im hit with the lyrical wit
Of a scientist thats tryin this
Sugar coated rhyme loaded with gunpowder
Now see how the crowd will yell louder
Now the rhyme is dropped and you hear a pop
Think its a shot but you just cant stop
Your heartbeat vibrates at my rate
So why wait I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado the winds start gustin
Rhymes unload reload and explode
Ride the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast outlast F the press
When I hit its like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
When I go I go for broke Im blowing up
Im on the hype tip Im on the mic with
Tunnel vision cause Im mic whipped
Strung from lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes that come from
A zone thats hidden and forbidden
If any man enters good riddance
A mortal mind is just no contest
The rhyme zone is my conquest
The Twilight Zone will seem like childs play
Am I a genius Heheh Ill say
Im so cool and yet so hyped
When Im on the mic its something like
Hiroshima remember Pearl Harbor
Feel the fire but dont bother
To run for cover you dont escape
On record compact disc or tape
Once you play it the fuse is lit
An explosion you getting hit
With rhythmic prophecies visions I foresee
Me blowing up in your face now stop to see
Smoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room because I went boom
Ill light the sky like a comet
When it comes to rap Im it Im blowing up
Im blowin up for the fans that crave
Hip hop with relevance Im here to save
Rap from an early grave like god I gave
Life to the mic as I watch it enslave
All the sellouts who yell out obscenities and spell out
MONEY to propel out of the ghetto but like Othello
You kill the mic a cappella youre in the cellar
You rap like rap is a dash for cash youll run out of gas
Its a marathon how long can you last
With repetitious nothing renditions of something
You cant create so you imitate the pumping
Only the strongest can last as long as
I last my reign is the longest
In hiphop history check the book
Victory after victory man look
Rapping is a science the mic is an appliance
So I applied it to an alliance
Of words put them in a rhyme song
Blew them up like a time bomb
Other emcees caught the debris
Little bits and pieces of me
Put my ideas on a track you laid
Is like pulling my pin and Im a grenade Im blowing up
Clap your hands to that
Old track that brought back the man that raps
Much better than the next man Ill take an exfan
And make them rock harder than any other brother can
Whoever didnt understand my game plan
Should feel ashamed like a lame cause Im the same man
That ran the rap yard for years worked hard for years
But never got paid and slaved and starved for years
Then other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft
I went with the flow and you said I fell off hah
Dont be bogus wheres your focus
I did what I had to now notice
The dollars are rolling no more holding
Back the rap attack Im back on top controlling
The whole rap game again like I did way back when
Def Jam was a dream I was slaying men
Whoever thinks he wants some he dont want none
Hes got to be insane or just plain dumb
But if you think you got something to prove
Jump make your move
But come in a tank and ten suits of armor
I wont whip ya Ill bomb ya
And when youre on fire it still aint enough
Cause I dont just burn you boy I blow ya up
