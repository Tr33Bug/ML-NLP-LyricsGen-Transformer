Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No ifs ands buts or maybes
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into a catalyst
Thatll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhymes contents beyond nonsense
If youre not convinced get tense and wince
Cause Ill make a skeptic look epileptic
Shake and break like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul I control
His mind is mine cause my rhyme holds
Minds in limbo as you resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin like a leaf in disbelief no chatterin teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger spinning like a top
Weak at the knees and youre about to drop
You cant find your heart you need a warrant to search
Get off your knees boy this aint church
You can say what you wanna say pray if you wanna pray
Did you forget you was ambiguous youre gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme you better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds if you got caught
I taught lessons for secondguessing reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic known as rhyme
Addicted to rap and youre a fiend for mine
For my rap info youre a nympho
Ill raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
That Imma leave you scarred
Cause I dont just hit ya
I hit ya hard
I weave and bob to do the job
Set you up with the left as the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move behind the groove
As the beat gets better the rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more than just a fight or a bout
You aint goin down boy youre goin out
No count necessary cause you aint gettin up
Bad mouthin ends very very very abrupt
Thought patterns converted through overt overtures
Prepared your mind much better for metaphors
More rap classics believe me theres no man
Not Bach Brahms Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut and rings a bell too
I come out smoking hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee and the bell is the worst sound
Cause I dont wanna let up if you can get up
Im fed up the rhymes are sped up to mess your head up
When the rhyme is over they tally the scorecard
I get more points cause you hit the floor hard
The very last thing that you remember
Is a rhyme in your face and the crowd yell timber
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I dont just hit ya
I hit ya hard
When I rain its more like a hurricane
You wanna dis then think of another name
Cause I go to work and my rhymes slam
Put me to the test youll fail the exam
Cause thats the kind of test you just cant study for
Youre guaranteed to end up bloody or
Broken twisted fractured blistered
Decapitated mutilated violated its the
Kind of defeat that you just cant live with
Try to compete but you just cant get with
The Mental Master hardryhme supremist
My words have ya mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like H2O
Cleaned with chlorine to make green so
The rhyme is purified you cant drink it
So biters and suckers dont even think it
The green I made is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates I get paid
Then its time to rain with the rhyme I know
And like plants watch my people grow
I heal sick minds like Christ himself
Touch the soul like no one else
Theres only one President Pope and one God
Theres only one rapper in that class
And Im hard
