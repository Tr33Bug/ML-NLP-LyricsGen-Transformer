Im 
Huh
What are you crazy You know who I am
Moe Dee  Yes Im the man
I am the flyest cleanest baddest meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
Ill take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if theres someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross theyll say Dont you know
Really really really dont you know
Cause Im a real rap warrior Elite Astoria
Ill take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And Ill prove that theyre all ducks
Cause I dont care nothin bout your money and gold
Dont wanna hear about how many records you sold
Cause none of that dont mean nothin to me
Cause Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
What are you senile Have you lost your mind
Im the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rappers hall of fame bein that its all a game
I might not be down because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin thats why Im tellin
You when I go homeboy Im gone
Cause Im better but dont get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And were all enemies on the court
But when the game is over Ill shake your hand
Give ya a pound cause youre still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy its a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause Im an intellect ya
Bird brain rappers I call hiphappers
Not hiphoppers cause yall just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But Im perfect I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
Dont piss me I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off Dont diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers beam em up take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by megamillions you witness a birth
Of a new society rappers with variety
So much prestige flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
Its hard to believe but think about it it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
Theres no race no contest Ill never have to jostle
Theyre small time to them I am collossal
Im a gladiator with the image of a god
Im powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm recite em as a poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god apex of the hiphop cult
Im the leader rhyme breeder yes I am the ult
imate idolized figure theres not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and thats cause I
Really feel that Im the best so I personify
Rap to the fullest I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I dont stop rockin under no condition
I rock nonstop but dont ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if its your brain the answers of course cause Im a
Autohypnotic reversepsychotic
Thatll make you feel if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
Im the greatest but not Ali
Im Kool Moe Dee
Im Kool Moe Dee
Im Kool Moe Dee
