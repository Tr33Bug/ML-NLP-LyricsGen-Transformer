Im not goin Im gone
Up up up and away and Im on
A higher plane with a brain with a flame
Feel the fire desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom and understanding
Possessed by gods transferred to man in
A script of a book or a scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong subliminal
Message divesting all men from criminal
Acts of the Devil revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
Read the Holy Koran or the Bible
Because its liable to be a revival
For the weak who seek power itll bring
Infallible power knowledge is king
Now who wants some Come get it
A battle is a test of wits and Im witted
Hard beats a torch and I lit it
Set the world on fire I did it
Now that it feels good Im heating up
I feed off knowledge and cant get enough
Cause knowledge is infinite suckers aint into it
Ignorance is bliss and theyre kin to it
They party and dance and dont ever glance
At a book or look for their mind to advance
Caught in a rut chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar or a nut
Evil feeds off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind and of course you have to be
Less than a man more like a thing
No knowledge youre nothing knowledge is king
My knowledge comes from a spiritual force
Stronger than any earthly source
Propaganda hype or slander
I wont believe the hype I understand the
Media dictates the mind and rotates
The way you think and syncopates slow pace
Brains cant maintain
Ascertain insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame traditions
All praise fame positions
Want to be a star drive a big car
Live bourgeois and wont know who you are
Lost in the source and praising the dollar
Whether your faith is Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God will teach one thing
The dollar is moot knowledge is king
My rhymes make a weak mind anorexic
You cant hang without slang so eject it
Ive selected rhymes for records
To affect the effect of the rhyme that left it
Hangin like a pound that cant come down
But youre hanging in the brain so your brain is hellbound
Lost and found by the serpent sound
What you dont know cant hurt thats profound
Absurd is a better word
An ignorant fool is a real cool nerd
Your pockets are fat with an empty head
Got a little bit fame and a name and youre brain dead
You count dollars so ya think ya in
You know how to count but you dont know when
Ask history today and it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes cause the brain aint acute
You need knowledge to understand the concept of sacrifice
But man dont understand so we have to fight
War killing people we never saw before
Some dont even know what theyre killing for
Following rulers instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya but the knowledge can stop it
Souls cant be controlled cause its a spiritual thing
But you got to have knowledge knowledge is king
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Knowledge
