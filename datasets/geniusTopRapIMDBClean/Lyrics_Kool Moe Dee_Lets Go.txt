So tell me how do you feel about Jack the Ripper
Get him 
Want me to get him Well I got him
My mouth is an Uzi and I shot him
With the hundreds of rhymes and rhythm designed to make him rewind
This time I draw the line
Hes mine just chill
Dont nobody touch him cause Ima get ill
The boys phony as a threedollar bill
And this time I shoot to kill
Just like a sucker you took the bait
Now youre like a dead fish on my dish too late
So party people kick your feet up Im about to heat up
Youre hungry for a battle now its time to eat up
Boy Im gonna chew you cause I knew you
Was talkin that junk punk now Ima do you
The way you should be done call you my son
Make you say Daddy I dont want none
Ive had enough of you actin tough
You huff puff grab your stuff you cream puff bluff
Talk about a battle but you dont wanna do it
You got yourself into it you blew it
You egomaniac Im a brainiac
You came back with a stone cold plain attack
Your rhymes are weakwack how can you speak that
You need to sneak back to the drawing board Jack
The Ripper down with my zipper
You get paid to be a Moe Dee tipster
Trying to knock the way I rock get off my jock
Ima knock you out the box lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Put up or shut up get up yeah what up
Huh get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics Huh I laugh at them
So you got paid take the money youve made
Bet it on yourself are you afraid
Money talks BS walks
When I stalk like a hawk a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is you dont know about this
Battlins for real men and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
Youre just a sucker and its funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like youre a big man but youre a big fan
Stridin and hidin while ridin my big man
You aint got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin but you sound like a girl
How you like me now Im gettin busier
Im double platinum  Hold up is he a
Man or a girl What in the world
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you wanna battle me on the microphone
Leave that crack alone
Lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
I said lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Come on boy lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Better than me
Picture that with a Kodak
I dont take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard run the rap yard put up your guard
I dont get even I get odd Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept you took a back step
Ruined your rep and wept you shouldve kept
Your mouth shut you know what
You gotta say youre sorry  Im sorry  So what
You call me a punk you wanna see whos soft
Put the microphone down lets squareoff
You need a hand you got hands for
Tryna be me now LL stands for
Lower Level Lack Luster
Last Least Limp Lover
Lousy Lame Late Lethargic
Lazy Lemon Little Logic
Lucky Leech Liver Lipped
Laborious Louse on a Losers Lips
Live in Limbo Lyrical Lapse
Low Life with the loud raps boy
You cant win huh I dont bend
Look what you got yourself in
Just usin your name I took those Ls
Hung em on your head and rocked your bells
Now here we go blow for blow lets throw
Rhyme for rhyme yours and mine and yo
When its time to battle rhyme I know
How to make it flow so lets go
To the ring rappers sing and swing
Words and verse see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didnt know lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
Lets go
Go go go go
Go go go go
How can you say youre the best
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I gots not like before
Huh Im formidable unforgettable
Youre submittable you look pitiful
Yeah youre headstrong but youre dead wrong
Wanna survive Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you dont boy youll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin on stage buttnaked
To make up for what you cant do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realize
Im on the rise and youre on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and Im serious
I aint sellin out and now here he is
Frontin and fakin and talkin about makin
The money from money now dont you know they can
Use your support cause you got caught
Signed sealed delivered sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper turned into a businessman
Loafin on the job and cheatin the fans
Im too potent powerful and spiritual
Mental emotional physical and lyrical
You wanna beat me Its gonna take a miracle
Youve got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
