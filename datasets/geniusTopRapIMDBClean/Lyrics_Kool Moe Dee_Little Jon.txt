Little Jon is on the streets late night on the ave
Lookin at the pretty girls and the things hed love to have
Street life heroes dont mean zero but thats not what he sees
Sidewalk stars and fancy cars makes him week at the knees
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
Slipped away
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
End today  huh 
Hangin out in the midnight hour comin home late at night
Nothings in the kitchen but a can of beer his father wants to fight
Hes not ready hes not ready for this theres but so much he can take
He wants to get away but he doesnt wanna work lookin for a easy break
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
Slipped away
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
End today
Kids at school are really cruel they tease him about his clothes
His shoes are worn his coat is torn hes hungry and it shows
He cant take it he says Forget about this I know what I can do
Ill stand on the corner make money and Im gonna live better than all of you
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
Slipped away
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
End today
Sirens shots
Years have passed and at long long last hes really lookin good
But hes not livin comfortable hes foolin the neighborhood
Competition is jealous the cops are hot they all want him to fail
Now his only choice in life is to die or live in jail
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
Slipped away
He was Little Jon
He slipped away
He was Little Jon
End today  kick it 
Sirens
