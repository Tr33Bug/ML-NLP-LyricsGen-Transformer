Monster Crack the crack monster
1986 return of the horror flicks
More deadly than The Omen a killer and a showman
Like the devil in The Exorcist
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause its more than actionpacked
Its alive and killing and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster
The crack monster mmmmmmmm

He talks to ya like hes alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come running the older and the youngin
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money only your money
Hell make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high dont last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is inanimate hell make you feel
That he can breathe think talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all hes about
Is just making you broke and stringing you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep deep breath
Then youre hooked for life cause its the kiss of death

Like savoirfaire hes everywhere
Hell hook an innocent baby cause he dont care
He loves to eat girls and boys and hes nothing but poison
The biggest hit since Michael Jackson hes making noise in
The streets hes notorious to pushers hes glorious
To girls hes a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
Thatll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when youre possessed by Crack God bless
Your soul cause hell take the rest

The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
Their mind like Toucan Sam instead they follow their nose
And the more you get the more you want
Youre killing your brain now so later on itll haunt you
You become insatiable you cant get enough
When your money gets low things really get rough
Its your only objective you lose all perspective
On life youre obsessed possessed and defective
Losing weight and disappearing but still persevering
Your body tells you no but all youre hearing
Is the crack talk
Monster Crack

Monster Crack the crack monster
In South Africa many a brother died
Trying to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole worlds trying
To prevent another war but I got a surprise
Theres already one right before your eyes
And were nowhere near the end this is only the beginning
Until this point the crack has been winning
Weakening hearts corrupting minds
A stonecold killer very easy to find
And once hes caught by the law he cant go to jail
Cause hes nothing but a little piece of matter for sale
Using people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king more powerful than the rest
