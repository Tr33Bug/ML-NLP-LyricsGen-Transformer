What you want you aint gon get it
What you need you wont admit it
It really dont matter how hard you try
Cause money cant buy respect
The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think theyll get respect
Bought a big Mercedes and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies and youre a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak so when you speak
Youre obsolete your mental peak
Is in the street your mouths a beak
Big like a bird and your futures bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
Youre sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brandnew ride to go beepbeep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know unless youre slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the rivers where youll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold no fancy car
And the brothers inside dont care who you are
A 7foot brother doin life
300 pounds says youre his wife
Walks in your cell and says Fix it up
Then you look up and say Not the butt
He says Shut up But but No but
Now what you gonna do freakydeaky or what
The money was good the money was fast
No business mind and the money wont last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause youre here today gone the next
And youll find out the hard way you get no respect
Man you must be crazy and bugged
Whatcha mean I dont get no respect
You crazy
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets boy
Aint nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In 72 I was killin em boy
Man go head go head
Im tellin ya I was shittin on it
Word up I was the man
And a car  these niggas aint got no cars today man
My car was so pretty I ride by niggas dicks get hard
You dig what Im sayin
Haha man get outta here go head
Caddy boy Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony boy
Aw man go head shut yo broke ass up man
Word I spell it out Ill yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all youre about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every days like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
Id like to know what youre thinkin about
It sure aint dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before its too late
Or theyll be doing your makeup down at the coroners place
And you will have lived just to die
And youll die with no respect
Yo man what about hoes what about hoes
Hoes
Shit man I had mo bitches than muthafuckin Coned got switches boy
