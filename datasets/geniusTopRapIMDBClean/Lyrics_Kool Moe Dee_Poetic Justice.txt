 Ladies and gentlemen
There are seven acknowledged Wonders of the World
You are about to witness the eighth 
Karma
Poetic justice
What goes around comes around
Ebb and flow
Stop look listen learn
Play with fire and youll get burned
You think you want some but you dont want none
A fight on the mic you dont want one
I turn the heat on proceed to beat on
Any soft sap who think hes gone
Na come in my realm when Im at the helm
Nightmares a joke when Im on
Elm Street sleep but you dont dream
Awake and achin takin Codeine
Now youre tryin to OD
Cause you dont want none of Moe Dee
Pain relievers wont relieve ya
Suicide wont do it either
Even after I cremate you
Im a reincarnate you
Bring you back for another round
Just to put you back in the ground
Over and over again
When is it over It ends
When I die but I wont die dont try
Rhyme forever huh why wont I
Crush whoever tries to crush this
Hurt you like the truth poetic justice

This is a flurry a fist of fury
A rhyme so fast that it has to blurry
Your vision dont wink blink or stop to think
Or you might miss the next rhyme
Ink flows from the brain to the pen
And comes alive when the thought transcends
From the pen to the paper and paper to tape and
A tape to the wax and back to the tape
Another hit which you cant get with
A brainiacll react but a nitwit
Cant relate he cant hold the weight
The rhymes too deep and he sleeps awake
The comatose need a double dose
Cause Kool Moe Dee dont rhyme like most
Simplified rhymes or out of the norm
But I simplify if Im to perform
Records for the poprock playlists
The pop jocks dont play this
In an intent to hold rap back
They stop the hard  hard  and play the wack  wack 
They play the weak cause the weak wont speak
But that just makes a fan go seek
A station that they know will bust this

Poetic phonetic genetic frenetic
You connect it
Those who chose to oppose are foes
And usually cant grow afros
As the rhyme flows the spirit grows
But only those with a pure soul knows
The relevance of the beat of the drum
And where its coming from
For those of you who just dont listen
Heres the second boat youre missin
Just like Noah had you swimming
Raps a warning of an ending
Of an era a reign of terror
Over like a nova never ever
Try to amplify the lie
The truth wont die and thats why I
A versatile child of the Nile
Speak with a ghetto style and meanwhile
The reason I relate to the youth
Is pure souls can feel the truth
The poisoned souls have tried to stop it
But just stop it cause hiphop is
From our roots and you cant touch this
This is our ancestors poetic justice
