Can you feel it tension in the air
Racism and violence everywhere
Davis Howard Beach Bumpers and Brawley
It appalls me now its there really racial justice
Its time that we discussed this Im disgusted
And I dont trust it whats this about
New evidence brings doubt on who took King out
Must have had clout he took the Kennedy route
Witness stories contradict and
Confliction make Black men say it had to end
It wont happen again
Pump your fist  3x 
Can you hear me hittin home
Knowledge is the danger zone
Liars and bigots and hypocrites start to panic
They get frantic
Power generated by the truth
Time to educate the youth
The lust for money is out of control
Heres proof
Drugs always a tragic ending
And at the risk of spending
Time in jail
Caught on a bum sale
They persist knowin deaths a risk ignorance is bliss
They kill their race and chump their face
They deserve to get dissed
Pump your fist  3x 
We feel the wrath
From what happened in the past
Has made us walk a path
Made by slavery
Though bravery we lost
Our unity our source
Of power and we lost all race pride
In our Holocaust now its my creed
Im from a stronger breed
My ancestors indeed had to bleed
Whipped till they were freed
And now I look back and say wow
How did we allow
Physical slavery
Never again I vow

Pump your fist  3x 
But are we free in actuality
Lets talk reality cant you see
The slave mentality
Its a sickness that eats you up like cancer
And moneys not the answer wont advance ya
Dont take a chance youre just a lame
Selling drugs for fame
Thats the weak mans game its a shame
You got chains on your brain
Youre givin drugs to kids and livin
Half your life in prison
Gods forgivin but you got to work with him
Pump your fist  3x 
Distortion  confusion
Equality  illusion
Justice  collusion
No racism  delusion
History  erased it
Lives  wasted
Victory  tasted
Drugs  face it
Knowledge  wisdom
Educational  system
Blurred  vision
Liars  dis em
Voice  loud
Black  proud
Truth  vowed
No sellouts allowed
Pump your fist
