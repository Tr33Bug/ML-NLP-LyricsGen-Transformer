And yes yall the sounds that you hear is gonna be so real
Youll have no fear cause three live brothers are here
We got KRSOne from Boogie Down Productionsn special shout to Melodie
We got my man Chuck D in the house from Public Enemy
And I am Kool Moe Dee
So are you ready
Are you ready to elevate
As I rhyme on time youll illuminate
Hard as diamond knowledge shinin
Its that time and its all in the timin
Four hundred years blood sweat and tears
The rain is over and the sun is here
Yeah bright and clear countdown to the year
No fear cause Im in there
Holding my mic like the staff of Ra
Bringing true light after dark
Brothers are live but still unborn
Its almost morn and its time to mourn
See the light like a crack of dawn
The comatose and the cracked are reborn
Regurgitating the garbage were fed
Cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Rise and shine
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Aint that funky  Yeah thats funky 
Get up
I rise and shine like the sun on the one
We dance together we overcome
A wakeup call to wake up all
Stand up tall get up and get up yall
Clap your hands in jubilation meditation
Recreation procreation of the mind
If you seek well find
Born two times but still one of a kind
Learn your past find your path
The truth is infinite like math
Countdown to the year two thousand
The thought alone is arousin
When we sing Ill wake with the third eye
Rise with the sun and think with a birdseye
View as I watch our exodus
When the higher conscience connects its just
The microphone is my funk receptor
When I speak on beat Im trying to connect us
To whats left us messed up
Egos dressed up got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it hear them see them three ways
Combine the rhyme to any one of nine
For some still the light wont shine
You can take a shot in the dark but keep missin
You aim with one eye you just dont listen
Cause see in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated
The sixth and seventh is how you elevate it
Ringdingdingdingdingdingding
This a KRS with a different something
What come in a dance and we come down for sing
This a KRS me say go
Nuff slaveships come from Africa
Full of Africans sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill the African
Check it white man is European
And black man is African
White man never say EuroAmerican
So why should the black man say AfroAmerican
If the black man is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be LongNoseAmerican for the white man and
Jump around and move your bottom what
Make no mistake we dont shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
Its the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on to never flunk
Cause papa dont raise no punks
Got to make it known and to pass it down
Yeah sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me uh
Each one teach one if you cant find one
Talk to the little ones
And youll see theyll listen
To fill the missin
Peace to rise and shine
