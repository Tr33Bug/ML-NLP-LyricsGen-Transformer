I roll hard  Ohoh oh my God 
Thats right baby I run the yard
Got the bass for your bottom if you feel it in your butt
Do your dance and I tell you what
When this party is over therell be no more rappin
You and I can spread out and anything can happen
If the partys not enough and you still think youre ready
You aint gotta clap your hands and dance but we can still rock steady
Rock steady
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
If the partys not enough and you still wanna rock say
Rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Come on rock  Rock 
Rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Come on rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Am I a trooper Im a super scooper
I enlist girls like I was a recruiter
Gettin ready for an allout war
Im a lover thats out to score
I wanna see you at the party we can dance a bit first
And if you really rock your body we aint even gotta converse
After the party all I wanna do is come over
And tell you that I want you
And if you dont wanna go just listen to the drums
Feel the beat and itll make you come
And dont try to front cause Ill call your bluff
Dont kick me no bass cause I got enough
Just let the music keep flowin watch your head start goin
Up and down suggestin yes without ever knowin
Youll be soakin wet and drenched sweaty and ready
But not to clap your hands and dance but you can still rock steady
Rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Come on rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Rock steady baby
Ladies if youve been gettin the short end of the stick
Come over here and get some of this real di
Different kind of lovin that I call rockin
Oh boy can I rock All night long
Cause my rap is strong
I betcha Ill rock your socks
Cause Im a super lover undercover
Watch your sister and your mother
Scream dream cream kick bite and fight each other
I make em drool cause Im so cool
I got the tool to rule and I guarantee youll
Encounter a night like never before
If you ever walk through my party doors
Youll come over and over again and again
And next time youll bring a friend
Because at my party you gotta be ready
Cause Im takin no shorts baby doll Ima make you rock steady
Come on rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Come on rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Rock  Rock  Steady  Steady 
Everybody rock  Rock  Steady  Steady
