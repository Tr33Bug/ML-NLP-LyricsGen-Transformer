Oh yeah   Rock you 
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you 
Boy youre going crazy really getting lazy
Rhymes as weak as water even shorter than the days be
So you on the pop charts got off to a fast start
Now its slowing down homie show me where is your heart
I want you to battle me but all you do is saddle me
Ride on my bone and you wont cause you know thatll be
Your crucifixion my resurrection
Heres my prediction you need protection
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you 
On and on til your rhymes are gone
We could battle head up without singing a song
Well just go rhyme for rhyme youll run out in due time
And Ill keep going while Im blowing you Im showing you Im
Your superior cause youre inferior
Jump out of line one more time and Ill bury ya
Say something I dare yamatter fact where are your homeboys
Bring em on the more the merrier
I know how to put an end to all of this
Is battle winner take the money and the losers gotta quit
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you 
Like youve never been rocked before Ill make ya sore
Freeze up like an ice cube and never thaw
Until I turn the heat on and once the heat is felt
Like ice youll burn twice youll do more than melt
Because Ill evaporate you and consolidate you
With the air youll disappear Ill annihilate you
You might still be living but you feel deceased
You oughta name your next record Rest in Peace
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Oh yeah 
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you 
Oh yeah 
I got a rhythm to ride I can feel it inside
Of my bones I got a jones Im the microphone pride of New York
When I talk other emcees walk
Street critics rave and the ladies hawk
Complements are given cause my rhymes are driven
By a ego that prevents me to bite cause Im not living like that
I am authentic like the Titanic
But Im unsinkable believe it and then accept that
Its reality you have no choice
No screaming or yelling I got a real voice
Im badder than bad no reason to get mad
When I pick up the mic the young boys are had
And I can say what I want cause nothing can be done
Cause I dont fear none cause not near one of you
Pussycat candy rap need to get a jap slap
For saying that bullcrap and trying to call it real rap
Sorry chap youre just a new jack
Line up at rhyme prison get in the back
Because I am the leader the rhyme breather
And and you know you need a real leader
To to to help you see the way to be the
Man that you really think you are a superstar
You fall short of that status and by far
Because supers call me super and that means superb
Not a nerd using verbs and I aint the herb
Thats gonna sit back and relax and backtrack while you wack
Boys get paid and parade around stage cause you made
A few hits now you get do shit like your hits
Forget it I aint wit it
You know Im the best so admit it
And any rappers out there that dont like what I said
Step forward and Ill put that head to bed
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Oh yeah 
Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Rock you   Oh yeah 
Rock you   Rock you
