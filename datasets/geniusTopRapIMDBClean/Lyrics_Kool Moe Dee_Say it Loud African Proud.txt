Say it Loud  African Proud  Lyrics Ugh 
Ugh 
Some say we got a lot of malice
Some say we got a lot of nerve
But I say we cant quit fighting
Until we get what we deserve
Just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair
Brother we cant quit
Until we get our share
Come on
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Come on say it loud
Im African proud 
Louder 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Now I worked on jobs
With my feet and my hands
And all the work I did
Was for the other man
We demand a chance
To do things for ourselves
Were tired of beating our heads against the wall
And workin for someone else
Come on
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Everybody say it loud
Im African proud 
Louder 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
And yes yall
Rise and shine
Brothers and sisters its that time
As the modern day prophets speak in rhythm and rhyme
Under the influence of the benign
Our rise as the weakest decline
So stick together and keep a positive mind
And sing this song one more time
Come on
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Everybody say it loud
Im African proud 
Brothers and sisters say it loud
Im African proud 
Louder 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Now we been whipped chained
Beaten and scorned
We been treated bad
From Knowledge to Born
Now weve got African Pride
That runs deep as the Seven Seas
Wed rather die on our feet
Than keep living on our knees
Come on
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
This aint the sound that you hear
Its gonna be music to your ear
You have no fear
Cause God is here
As the righteous get it in gear
And the wicked step to the rear
Youre outta here
Feel the power in the rhythm
As our souls move vocally
Come together in a montage
A collage of harmony
Spirits manifest in our voices
As our hearts provide the beat
For a source of inspiration
When we speak in unity
Though it seems like its a dream
This is as real as it gets
Controlling your environment
Through chanting your concept
Breathing life into lyrics
You can hear it loud and clear
You can almost see the spirit
From vibrations that you hear
Im a brother of color descent
From the mother continent
And I been sent with the intent
To rectify the hellbent
From the line of the divine
Of those way before my time
Like a star Im chosen to shine
As the God of Rhythm and Rhyme
Comin strictly from an Afrocentric point of view
I talk to you in a tongue that relates to the young
And if you cant relate it aint meant for you
This is strictly for the restoration of pride and enterprise
Esoteric knowledge  essential to our rise
Come on
Im African proud 
Hehehehe
Im African proud 
Come on say it loud
Im African proud 
Louder 
Say it loud
Im African proud 
Ugh
