Look at what youve got with ya
A painted picture
A Mona Lisa in disguise with bedroom eyes
The kind that always gets you
Young dumb hot rookies
Hot for the nookie
Young and dumb quick of the tongue
And dont know how to boogie
Cause once you get in the groove
You cant stick and move
A little slip of the lip and the youngn is whipped
I want to let you know you
Got a lot to learn in this world
Actin like the Duke of Earl
Sportin your new stuff as everybodys old stuff
And you callin that your girl
Dont be stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Remember when you were broke
And your pockets were no joke
When you asked her to hang out with you back then she laughed so hard she choked
But soon as you got your ride
Shes under your arm at your side
She said remember what I said I didnt like you before
I lied
She already done chucked your face
Now heres a typical case
Of a man whose world evolves around a girl
His brain below his waist
Now you remember how the homeboys did her
Shes out for the highest bidder
She didnt want you when you had no money you dummy
Now youre a 
Dont be stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Then on the other hand
You got the greedy man
The one that makes the women say a man will be a man
Cause hes got a girl thats loyal
And treats him like hes royal
Simply put the hand in foot treatment have got him spoiled
Cause he still has to mess around
With every other girl in town
And when your girl finds out what youre really about
Shes heartbroke and let down
Cause the love you had you ruined it
Shes cryin and boohooin it
Shes too sweet to cheat but she knows you cheat
Whats to stop her from doin it
Dont be stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Then ya got those saps
With the weak weak raps
Nothin to say theyd rather pay
They just cant crack
You know how much they spend
On one girlfriend
So many dollars on so many girls they call him George Washington
You know what youve been given
Your girl and how shes livin
Sweet though with a dollar bill
Now she cant stop sniffin
You know how the story goes
And shes your girl who knows
She dont know her damn self
She just follows her nose
Dont be stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
