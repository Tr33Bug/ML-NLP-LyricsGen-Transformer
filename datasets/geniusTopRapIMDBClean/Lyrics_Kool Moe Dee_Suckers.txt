Suckers
Im not your average rapper so I cant half step
I gotta come off right I got a Moe Dee rep
And Ima live up to it cause yall cant do it
Other rappers have triedbut they blew it
Theres a heavy demand for me
Cause I am the man you see
On stage and front page newspapers and TV
Radio stations dont play me enough
But it makes no difference cause Im so rough  Im tough 
Either way you look at it rappers wish that they had it
As good as Moe Dee thats why they try to be me
And what theyve become is a facsimile
Now people wanna see me rappers wanna beat me
Making new comparisons so why dont yall just leave me alone
Cause I own the microphone
And when it comes to rhymes Im bad to the bone
Suckers
Now I ask you whos the best and everybody replied
But if you guess Im not the best youre just as wrong as apartheid
Double up thoughts think twice
But not about me bein Kool cause Im ice without a doubt
So predictable its a shame
Although you cant predict the rhyme you can predict the aim
And before the rhyme is anywhere near through
You just like the whole world knew
That Id rock no shocks
Some rappers will jock the way I rock
Cause its real and nothing phony
I can send the crowd into pandemonium
Lyrically equipped so I can be choosy
Potent and deadly just like an Uzi
I can be strapped just from rapped
Because its superhigh powered not like you saps
Suckers
Its been proven history is made
The world gathered around to give me a parade
Records were set dollars were bet
On me to emerge victorious no sweat
Hustle or crime nor search to find
Ideas and words to put in a rhyme
Designed tailored by me but not for sale
Although there is a black market for biters but to no avail
Some cant read it the rest cant say it
You have no choice but to love it and play it
Play it rewrite it and discreetly bite it
Although you dont want to you cant fight it
Cause its kinda like going to school fool
And since I am the teacher I make the rules
Youre under my control and youre starting to bore me
I dont say Im the best no more you say it for me
Suckers
You silly boys with your plastic toy
Rhymes sometimes really annoy
A vet like me cause yall are rookies
When I was teaching rap class you played hooky
Now your records are fake from the dollars you make
Its hidden well like icing hides a nogood cake
Since youre the cake once the people get a taste
Of what youre really worth theyll see you were a waste
With  hype the newspaper types your name in big letters
But Ill still wipe up any of you rappers and I mean any
In actuality it aint but so many
That I could consider a big spot hitter
You rhyme like babies and I am the sitter
Why dont you children play a mans game
When they talk about the best believe me your name
Is not ever mentioned cause I get the attention
For being the baddest since the invention
Of rhyming on the microphone alone
I own the floor you clone
Get off my phone youre in the danger zone
You speak so weak your rhymes are bleak
You try to freak youre meek and so you have to sneak
And say youre better like a sucker instead of
Tellin the truth youd rather let a
Knucklehead whos never heard a real rhyme
Think that youre great the blind leading the blind
Now the young hiphoppers dont know what its about
Cause when rappers was real they wasnt hanging out
Now they see you phony a  pony
Sneakerwearing no comparing to the one and only
Darkskinned in leather all of yall together
Could team on up and battle me yall could never
Ever amount to what I am
Cause Im Kool Moe Dee better known as the man
No matter how you suckers feel
I am the best
Cause Im for real
Suckers
