Bought a brand new car
Driving down the boulevard
Turn the corner like I wanna be chilin hard
The scene is set for me to get wet
Cause it wouldnt be right if the ladies didnt sweat
Pull the seat back to make contact
Eye to eye you know I aint living like that
I wear shades and I get paid
And when it comes to girls I cant get played
Fly girls used to ignore me
Now I pull up and let the car rap for me
beep beep 
Enough said
Better hop in while the lights still red
Homeboys scatter
Whats the matter
Here come the cops 
Oh yeah that again rather than
Beating them down I just talk to the men
They dont understand how Ive got my cash
Then I get mad and tell them to ask
Their daughter I bet she bought a
Kool Moe Dee tape for her recorder
Were not always thieves and thugs
And what law says we gotta sell drugs
I get paid and Im making a killin
But when I come home
I just like chillin on the
Avenue aavenue  4x 
Action 
Thats where the stars go
On the weekend its like a car show
Ladies flock to jock cars go by them
If Im walking and talking they ask what ya driving
When I peep that same old weak rap
Ask her her language tell her I dont speak that
Pull out a G a car key and a Visa
Walk her to the car leave her there see ya
She didnt want nothin else but a payday
Now shes sinking hollering Mayday
I knew her con cause two days ago
I saw that same slick girl in a brokendown Yugo
Riding with a hustler layin low
Couldnt drive his Benz cause the cops said so
His homeboy got shot in front of his crack spot
He moved cause it got too hot but not on that block
The cops are watching baiting and plotting
Setting you up for the raid in the block and
When they come everybodys got to go
But not Kool Moe cause they all know
The knot I got is way over their knot
But Im working so thats why theyre not
After me theyre after you
Cause Im just chillin on the avenue
Avenue aavenue  4x 
Homeboys on the block all wanna get paid
Well we can do this the right way
You get money and respect
Live large and correct
Then come back driving through the neighborhood
When you look good we all look good
Cause its all for one and one for all
Its got to be a better way
To get the money yall
