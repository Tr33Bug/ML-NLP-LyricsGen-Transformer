Like other music rap is an art
And if you wanna get the feeling got to feel it in your heart
You need brain power dictation
Vocabulary articulation
Creativity and originality
Execution of a feud formality
Versatility and a voice thats loud
With the ability to take a crowd
To its apogee and always has a
Feeling like youre havin a mental orgasm
Makin all minds come to one conclusion
You are the best and its not an illusion
The best 
Rockin my beat 
The best 
For instance
If this record was an atom Id be the nucleus
The center of attention Kool Moe Dee and Im just
Like the core of an apple the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand Im like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concretecreated
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if its weak
You wont wanna speak if your rhymes not peak
With verbs and nouns and adjectives
Combined to make a phrase
Thatll play with a beat
Stop and start slow it down at a part
And totally amaze
The whole crowd leave em in a state of awe
Cause Im as perfect as a diamond without a flaw
And yes Im legendary also very very
Educated proficient and extraordinary
In my field the other rappers yield
A knight in shining armor and the mic is my shield
In rap Im vital the other rappers idol
The best MC and Moe Dees my title
But you can call me Kool
The best 
Thethethethe best 
Rockin my beat

Now when I rock instead of just average Im better
Than the average man and thats why I can
Make a real human feel like a mannequin
I mean a coldheart dummy from the time I walk in
Ill shock ya and amaze ya hit ya then Ill daze ya
Either way Im gonna phase ya cause Im sharp as a razor
When Im rhymin to the cut you know what
Im the best MC many imitate me
They never would admit it they just cant get it
I rhyme like the rest but the juice I possess
Always seems to be more Im a rhyme connoisseur
My taste for the beat is also elite
Im the best hiphopper from off the street
Cause when Im rhymin on the mic I always take control
Cant another rapper touch me with a tenfoot pole
The best 
Rockin my beat 
The best 
I rhyme a 100 miles an hour with lightningspeedin power
Make the sweetest of the sweet MCs look sour
Timber as they tower because I devour
Any other rapper and I can prove it now or
A little bit later cause Im a graduator
From a rhymin alma mater but some say alma mata
Like you say patata I say potato
Tomata tomato my datas up to data
Cause somethin is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama like the kids at Wonderama
Im very good at actin Im very good at drama
Ill confuse you with a period colon and a comma
Cause when Im rhymin and I take a pause
You think the rhyme is over but when you end yours
Really check out what Im doin then you say ooh
When they say whos the best MC to you
Youll look at me then you say I know who
