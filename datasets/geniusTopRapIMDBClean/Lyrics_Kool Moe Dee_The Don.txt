Im The Don armed and dangerous
With a mic I like ordain I just
Make a wish it becomes a command
The rhyme family is my fans
My territory spans from New York to Hollywood
The whole countrys my neighborhood
I extort fans support
With rhymes that taught lessons and caught
The ears of listeners they enlist in the
Hip hop mob on the job stop dissin us
No drugs at all we dont steal or rob
We just get paid in the Moe Dee mob
I demand fans family loyalty
Tour support and record royalties
Whenever a band tries to take my fans
I put out a hit understand
Im The Don
Started out in parks
As a hit man killin with the rhymes that sparks a mic
Sparks of light turns dark to light
Freeze emcees and they drop the mic
Hit the deck you know what this is
Dont nobody move and I mean biz
One dumb hero tried to step
So I pulled out my mic and rhymed him to death
Other emcees wouldnt put me on
So I took over now theyre gone
I made the connections got paid protection
Fees from emcees and no late collections
I take no shorts up front on the double
You aint got it you got trouble
Ill put out my mic and a rhyme to bust
Huh another one bites the dust
With the ladies Im not just a Don
In fact Im more like a Don Juan
Pull ladies in bunches
Break my heart I roll with the punches
Write em off like a tax no respect
You aint down next
Cause Im like a hardcore Casanova
Cross me once girlfriend youre over
Outta here quick as a jet no sweat
Theres no limit to the girls I get
No time for games make no mistakes
Dis me youre done thats the breaks
One conversation gets my point across
You dont like me its your loss
Spread the news I get rave reviews
Ill make you an offer you cant refuse
The Don takes control of the action
Without question and whos askin
A takeover is now in effect
A world tour to make my connect
The RB radio family supports me
Put a hit on Top 40
The video families BET
Put a hit on MTV
Store reports and the Billboard charts
Work hand in hand with the local jocks
As hit men for hire personal hit men
Makin the hits from the very first shipment
Red and Chuck and the fans that love me
Mr Magic and my man Buggsy
The hottest DJs in every town is down with the Don
A sucker emcee in a second Ill dis
With a flick of the wrist hell kiss my fist
Tip his hat and bend and bow
How ya like me now
The OK Corral and the Wild Wild West
Is recreated and put to the test
Sparks will fly like the 4th of July
My name in flames will light the sky
Other rappers go down tryin to confront me
You know where to find me whenever you want me
But think real hard before you step
And remember Im a vet
Runnin the yard ever since grade school
Never played the fool but always stayed cool
Before you think about steppin I already saw ya
Step off boy I got somethin for ya
