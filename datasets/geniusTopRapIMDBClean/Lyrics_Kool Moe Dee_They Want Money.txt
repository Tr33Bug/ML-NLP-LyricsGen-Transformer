Im drivin Benz 190
25 and you know where to find me
Driving down the highway girlies behind me
Jockin blindly no need to remind me
Who I am I know you know me
Stop screamin and pointin and yellin Im low key
No I aint got no time for a picture
But slide your number and Ill get with ya
You want a ride You shouldnt have said that
You played yourself and I know where your heads at
Drive my car Dont make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek maybe
But I aint trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Heres the deal so spread the word
No I aint got no girlfriend
No I didnt buy no car
No I dont have no babies
A lot of ladies Nah they want money
And I can see em a mile away
And when they push up I just smile and say
Back up off me smell the coffee
Youre schemin and plottin and Im killing you softly
Watchin you melt from the second I kissed ya
Heard dollar signs in your careless whisper
I know the game its old and lame
Youre holdin a flame for my name and my fame
Livin like Givens schemin on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I aint nice and I dont play that
If it aint tax I dont pay that
You think youre in cause you turn me on
Here one minute and the next youre gone
I made the rhymes I made the cash
Why get married and you take half
No I aint got no girlfriend
No I didnt buy no car
No I dont have no babies
A lot of ladies Nah they want money
The police Im givin them fits
A young brother in a Benz legit
I dont sell no drugs and take no shhh
Park my ride and the ladies hit it
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all wanna get with
The man with the money so they wanna sit with
The microphone master and ride shotgun
So people can see ya and think I got one
No sorry nothins happenin
Moe Dees single while hes rappin
If girls keep lyin and crashin my party
Yall gonna make me hurt somebody
No I aint got no girlfriend
No I didnt buy no car
No I dont have no babies
A lot of ladies Nah they want money
