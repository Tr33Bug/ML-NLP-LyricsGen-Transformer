Times up 
I wanna rock right now 
Times up 
Times up 
I wanna rock right now 
Times up 
Times up 
I wanna rock right now 
Times up 
Times up 
I wanna rock right now 
Times up 
Times up black is back
Other rappers make records and Ill make an impact
I dont want you to move I want a movement
As I proceed I move with
Knowledge wisdom understanding
I make progress while Im slamming
Hard lyrics putting money in the bank
But these futile new styles stake out the joint with point
A to B to D
Cause you cant hit what your eyes cant see
Nearsighted shallow hollow mundane
Rappers untrained just cant sustain
The heat that hits you think its a homerun
But hold that thought brother dont run
Cause you hear the pop it drops and guess what
Times up
The clock ticks the rhyme kicks
Im kickin off knowledge as I drop this
Brothers aint takin their time with the rhyme
They wanna get paid cause its hard times
I got patience meditation
Helps creation and correlation
Is takin its toll in platinum and gold
I get respect with the records I sold
Cause the rhyme is always up to par and on point
I wrote a message in the music while Im rocking this joint
Its jumping slamming bumping
And meanwhile Im saying something
For all ears to hear and prepare
To persevere from year to year and get geared
So weak rappersll have to selfdestruct
Times up
Im harder than times in 29
Hard enough to cut diamonds rhymin Im
Sharp as a razor cuts like a laser
And my rhyme can graze ya Im able to raise ya
From a dead level I aint a rebel
I just dont dance with the devil
Unless were dancing in the ring
And then my dance is an Ali thing
Cause I shuffle and flow and showboat what I wrote
And sugarcoat the globe and collect sweet gnotes
Go for the throat and watch the wicked choke
From the words I spoke because the rhyming smoke
Provoked thoughts of hope no dope to cope
Cocaine and propane no pain and no gain
The white demon is powdered and cut
Taste the real rock times up
High performance is lying dormant
Your mentality is out of the ordi
Nary structure you aint a sucker
Go get paid like a renegade buster
Lyrical format I put down
And when it rips better skip town
Metaphysical spiritual conscience
Manifested in lyrical contents
An ancient rhetoric Moe Dee better kick
Soulful social science and let it get
My class needs to thinking straight
Cause with speeds of light they cant relate
We live and learn but what are we learning
The dollars teach and weak souls are burning
So when I strike its like lightning struck
Times up
