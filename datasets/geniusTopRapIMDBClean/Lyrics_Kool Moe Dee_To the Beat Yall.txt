To the beat
To the beat yall
To the beat yall
To the  to the
To the beat yall 
And yes yall
This one goes out to all the homeboys
From the old school
Takin you way way back
When we used to rhyme like this
Check it out
Aint nothin but a party everybody come along
Keep your body movin while Im groovin with the song
I got funky rhythms funky rhythms with a beat
Funkfunkfunkfunky rhythms for the street
Keep clappin while Im rappin while Im rappin clap your hands
Listen to the listen to the listen to the man
Turn the party out without a doubt Im in the house
Kick it to the beat is what its really all about
Party party people if youre ready listen up
Cause I can get the lyrics Easy Lee can get the cut
An automatic systematic rhythmatic sound
If you aint with the program you gotta get it down
Breakin competition competitions ripped apart
Find another brother cause LL aint got the heart
I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
To the beat yall
To the beat yall
To the  to the
To the beat yall 
If Im mentally conditioned then Im physically prepared
To cold rock a party with the microphone I bear
Im ready for action satisfaction guaranteed
Give the people what they want and what they want is what they need
Desperately to hear a brother kick a rhyme like this
Dont settle for another cause you know what time it is
Time to pick your feet up put your body in the mode
And listen to a real rap veteran explode
Other sucker brothers always comin incomplete
Forget about the lyrics cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like youre hard but its only a facade
And now youre goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

 To the beat yall
To the beat yall
To the  to the
To the beat yall 
Excercisin patterns sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremonys one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket phoney homies better run
Cause Im doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets so I never need a gun
Just a microphone speakers tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And Ima rock a party till its time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug then Ima pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun and then Im gone
Strapped ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
To the beat yall
To the beat yall
To the  to the
To the beat yall 
And yes yall
As we proceed to move on
To Da Break Of Dawn
Hehehehehe
Takin you all the way back
The way we used to do it for you and yours
At the old school
Kool Moe Dee signin off
In the house
