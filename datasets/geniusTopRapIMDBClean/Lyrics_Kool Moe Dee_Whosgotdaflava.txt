Im a bad bad man 
Lemme tell you something 
Bounce bounce 
Bounce bounce 
Bounce bounce 
Bounce bounce 
Now who want to jet want to jit want to jump  jump 
Now who want to step want to rip want to pump  pump 
Your fists in the air without fear cause we in there
Yeah  Like a rocketeer  boom  yo we out of here
Now whos blowing up on the cut getting up  what 
Well whos getting off coming off with them for  us 
Well lets get busy lets get the party started yall
Flow like water  flow  burn like a fireball
With onehundred proof bulletproof raise the roof
Im breaking through coming through pulling through move through
Im making suckers who never want to give props give it up
Propproppropprops  nuff props rippin up
The mic is second nature I always made your route
You say you got the flavor I cant taste ya
I could blam when you stand only dancing could save ya
Lets make this party bounce  bounce bounce  who got the flava
You got it  Who got the flava 
You got it 
Well here comes a clean rap fiend on the scene  ho 
Dont want to be mean pipe dream routine  no 
Just straightup massive no one surpasses
Dark skin and glasses do when youre asked if
Nothing exists except music to live  what 
The musical gift that I use when I rip  up 
The mic the party the park the house the show
It makes no difference I rip them wherever I go
Cause I get hype when I see a mic that I like
Grab it a magnet I have it I got a hype
Rhyme for all occasions if not I rise to
Any occasion I raise up and rise you
So get up on your feet put your hands in the air  yeah 
And get up off the wall cause the flavors in here  here 
Front and center stage with the juice I can taste ya
But I cant taste the juice so whos got the flava


Make it bounce brother bounce bounce
Let me tell you something 
Im a bad bad man  
I got to  and you got to get ice
I dont flow like slow like soul
Like what the fit up is it up 
So get up get it up give it up  pop pop pop 
Goes the rhyme as I drop the nine
When I want to hit you this is how I do a line  shoot 
I shoot the gift  fat  fat like a spliff  smoke 
Smoke it and sniff  rip  Rip every riff
I sit up appeared in the mid aisles I sit in
I  and Im out like a fed
Makemaking them bust on a move as I Krush like a Groove
And I must improve checkonetwo
Never played like plaids or fade like fads
I just update rhyme styles that I had
And this is just a sample of styles that I gave ya
Like sweet to the beat when I speak taste it whos got the flava
