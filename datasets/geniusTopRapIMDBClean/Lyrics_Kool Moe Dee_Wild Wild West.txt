I used to live downtown 129th Street
Convent everythings upbeat
Parties ball in the park
Nothing but girls after dark
We chill nobody gets ill
In the place we call the hill
But if you try em
Thats when they will
Get wild but they dont fight they kill
At the
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

I remember parties out in the park
With the girlies rubbing up in the dark
I was smooth until someone pulled a gun
It was over they spoiled my fun
I was flying just like a track star
Dying nah I ran through the back yard
Trying to get into my building
Saying Why in the heck wont somebody kill them
One day the fellas got together
They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block and terrorize us
The gangs that used to do it now they idolize us
Guns we dont like to use them
Unless our enemies choose them
We prefer to fight you on like a man
And beat you down with our hands and bodyslam you at the
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
We dont start trouble but boy do we end it
Our time we like to spend it
Snapping boy do we heat up
But well take time out to beat up
A sucker if he wants static
Beatdown yeah we got it
Good and well accommodate you
Thanks to us a lot of brothers hate to
Come back to this very day
Cause losings one thing we dont play
If youre ever in a fight and youre beating one of us
Break out before you get bumrushed
