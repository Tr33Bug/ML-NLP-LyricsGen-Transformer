Now make it clap clap clap clap
Now make that ass give a round of applause
Clap clap clap on rhyme barry bonds
Got a redbone here a latina and a thong
Look look
Now make that ass give a round of applause
Clap clap clap on rhyme barry bonds
Got a redbone here a latina and a thong
Penny in the t shirt put in work no job
On the mob mobbing is mobby
Party at the hotel bitches in the lobby
Ratchets on hoe man this nigga gonn copy
Baby booty on swoll bet a nigga got pour
We can do it on the bed we can do it on the floor
Spanish mami give me compassy she straight from mexico
Try to find me Im prolly be finnin but never see in it
One man with be feelings never trickin for a hoe
Fin to know caletti bly line hunned
Girl I really do it tell the nigga quit frontin
She told daddy hit it from the back cause I love it
Love it all but fuck it its never nothing

Put me in Im a deep threat going
Bet Ima catch it bet Ima stretch it
One stressed out hit the backdoor exit
Now thats an entrance fresher than an incense
Getting cash money thats word to the imprint
Ferrrari 559 off the hood right
Shout out to fire 59 what it look like

Once I up clean it up get to kitchen get to cleaning
Chicagos off the motherfucking hook

So in love with the head I put a ring on her tongue
Gold digger city lights jeans full of 1s
Once I get to throwin I aint leaving till Im done
Big hit it baby

Smoking on kush in the air now
Sippin on patron and stare down
