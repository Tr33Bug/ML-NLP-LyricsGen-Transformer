Ride ride
Rough ride on ride on
Roll on roll on

Ride on
This is the game you wanna spit to a nigga
Let a nigga know its all right cascades
And Gz stompin on niggas like parades
Escapades and charades played
When the stampede stopped
And it continuously Young Gotti
Seen so many bodies
Drop fours hop classics and drastic measures
Principles a pleasure and penal endeavours
Whatever the case whatever case its caught on a chase
When a chase it began in the facial of race
Me and Fred he make beats I make rhymes
And Snoop he controls and calculates
Impervious moves the Pound Pentagon
Wit a pistols I holla where the gangstas at
Daz poppin his coller nigga sweet and sour
Pop Chucks and collers rollin through the streets in my 84 Impala
Holla holla if you wanna
We gon run it from the cona its the killa Califonia
Ya see I do it to ya
Cause I know it screw ya ya try up do us
But you cant cause you lovin this beat
Uh uh we dump dump to make you pump pump
We comin wit the heat to make ya trunk bump
Freddy said he had a whole a gritty down to go steady
And stick up Eddie for his fedy and bring it all back to daddy
I want bread cheese now put it on the patty
Knick Knack style kick back and flip files
In the verge on now listen now honey child
Bow Wow do ya now how ya like it doggystyle
Smile and grinnin sippin on some ginn
Roll wit a cap and ya all strapped in
Once ya back in its straight mackin
I keep it crackin
This is how we all get down
Bring back that G shit fo me
I know I slept you kept ya finna fetch ya
Snatch ya back too slapped you and rapped too
The vacuum sat chu and rat packed you act two
Now what must I do to get you back
To the way is used to see DPGCology
Im not talkin bout chemistry or biology
This Gology you feelin me
Niggas be killin me and willin me
Silly he thinkin yall gon smash on me
Blast on me the audacity
Ill take ya back to the ol skool and let ya cut class wit me
Get some ass wit me
Then get us somethin to drink and let you sip out the same glass as me
And now you a killa
And it was all over weed and a tall can of milla illa
Kill a nigga like a flea
Bigg Snoopy DO double gizzle
Way off tha hizzle my nizzle
I hit niggas and bitches if you fuck wit my mental
Cause Im a killa and stick release ya pop like a pimple
If you dont got my money I suggest you run
Cause the Gold Loc he do you like a 20 or done
Aint no fun the way I play nigga I plays fo keeps
No details youve just been sweeped to sweep
Locations directions not even a trace
Bitch I doubt it if ya body get found like waste
In the alley killa Cali this Eastsidaz Crips
Never slip set trip and smoke chronic dip
Cuz
Snoop Doggy Dogg has to give it to ya
Fredwreck got the reefers bumpin through ya
Goldie Loc can put the G and the C
Wit Kurupt Young Gotti from the DPG
Bitch
