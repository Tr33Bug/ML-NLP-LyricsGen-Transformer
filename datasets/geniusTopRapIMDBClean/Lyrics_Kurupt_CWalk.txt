Yeah Ima tell you like this
Kurupt you know how it was for me


Been regarded as the hardest since I hit the set
Young nigga with a rep kept that gangsta step
Blue Crocka sacs or blue Corduroy house shoes on
Flossin for the hoodrats gettin my groove on
Hangin in the park til all hours of dark
Tryin to catch a mark slippin with this thing that bark
Cry Baby on the swamp got the exit locked
And aint no doubt comin out he gon wreck you not
Pass me the satin loc so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakis with the Raider coat
All the hoes really want is gangstas just like us
Rough and dont give a fuckaint that right Kurupt
I stay bangin on these niggas on a regular basis
Big paper chases facin felony cases
Made it to be famous livin hard and dangerous
Steppin on these bustas in my blue Chuck Taylors
CWalk homie

Hah Hawthorne is in the house 
CWalk homie
And we CWalkin ya dig it 
CWalk homie
You know that gangstas rock gangstas roll
Heres the gangsta shit we on a gangsta stroll
Cause gangstas ride gangstas slide
In the gangsta ride with the gangsta glide
Cause gangstas move and gangstas groove
Most gangstas got nothin to lose
Gangstas live and gangstas die
Gangstas form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstas give a fuck a G dont ask why
Gangstas dont snitch and gangstas dont cry
Gangstas boogie gangstas dont dance
Gangsta pull the strap out yo pants and blast
Gangstas dont run and gangstas dont hide
Im a gangstaass nigga from the sick Southside
Thats how I know exactly what a gangsta do
You love the gangsta shit aint you a gangsta too
