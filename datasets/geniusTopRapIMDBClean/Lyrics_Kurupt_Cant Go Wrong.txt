The reason that Im here Imma drop til its clear
Let offKs to front middle and rear
Switches couldnt switch like these switches a day
Just to sit and sippin and dippin all over the ways
That they ears and chairs dis on this years
Cokes drippin off juice and gins
As a matter of fact takes matter of fact
To duplicate the great yall get played like a sax
Trumpet or trombone
Too shotty Young Gotti millennium bone
If she raggedly Im sendin em home
Puttin 10 in the chrome lettin all ten to the dome
It dont quit  dont quit  it dont stop  dont stop 
Let the beat knock  the beat knock 
Let the beat knock  the beat knock 
Pull up at the spot pull up at the stop
In a drop top gettin what I got I just
Cant go wrong releasing all my thoughts through songs
Dont give a damn on the real Ill say just what I feel
Dont matter what you say Ill never stop Ill bust all day
No time for delay Ill do it my way
Kurupt what up  Imma drop til its clear
In these ravines and ponds its Vietnam time
Tossin Cnotes the Magnificent Magneto
Dippin through comin like ay
Dont expect nothin less Ds gleam on the tray
All night and all day its the best in a 2001 SS
Its the prince of the West
I aint tryna do much tryna do too much
I aint even really trippin
Its just me Snoopy and Quik and
Someone like you with the biggest mouth to put a dick in
Most of yall malfunction like faulty equipment
Shifted drifted different uplifted
Kurupt Young Gotti just call me Paul Vitti
With the skirts from Tahiti workin at the mall
With young Roscoe you fool and hostile
I just tuck my roscoe the Apostles colossal I
Cant go wrong releasing all my thoughts through songs
Just dont stop 
Dont give a damn on the real Ill say just what I feel
Bounce them switches 
Dont matter what you say Ill never stop Ill bust all day

No time for delay Ill do it my way  Yeah
