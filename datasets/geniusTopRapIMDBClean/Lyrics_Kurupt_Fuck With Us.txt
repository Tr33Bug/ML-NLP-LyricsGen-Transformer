Dumpin out the truck Kurupt dont give a fuck
Its how the West Coast riders ride
Livin life nothing nice on the dice Im
Livin life homicidal domicidal with the dome arrival
With Goldies star way 380 and Trays rifle
Snoops berretta or the Mack 11 from Kevin
Holler at the Reverend and look up to heaven

Getting locked in the gates of this LA zoo
