A SoopaflyDaz production  Suckas
How many real homeboys yall got out there
Can yall count on one hand I can
Straight up Dogg Pound Gangstas
Funky fresh in the flesh
Yeah thats what Im talkin bout
Yo Kurupt kick that
I aint shit without my homeboys although at times it seems
Tryin to make it to different stages lifes and dreams
Different mistakes that was made during the time of the struggle
Two pits unleashed but held by one muzzle
Its complicated like a puzzle puzzle pieces and money double
The royal rumble fools really in trouble
Imma hit the spot and snatch all the knots and pots
Then get ghost while the most of yall get gots
To get the fuck outta here aint nobody else I can call
Who that  Besides my motherfuckin doggs
I aint shit without my homeboys
When theres trouble who the fuck can you rely on
To die on onsite me and niggas do it wrong or right
I ignite the fire marijuana gets me higher
All this drinkin and smokin really gettin a nigga wired
Gettin paid thats my only desire
Big Style Lil Floss Tray Deee and me
KURUPT Soopafly and Crooked I
Until then I hope God dont pass me by
Everyday I work harder to try
Never to fall but I hope to rise
Everyday before I open my eyes
To my cousin Big Flip locked down in the pen
To my other homeboys I wont ever see again
Life gone in the wind like a lottery spin
When it comes down to it nigga whos ya foe and ya friend
And I aint shit without my homeboys
So what could make a crook stay down for his troop
Could it be the gunshots we ducked as a youth huh
What about the cops we hid from on the roof
Or the shootouts we survived without wearin a bulletproof
We fruits from a tree that was rotten to the root
We wasnt posed to make it our survival dont compute
I had to chase the paper cause the loot would run from me
We had Navigator dreams and only bus money
We rise and we fall together all together
We crawl and we ball together doggs forever
Like uh  and ya dont stop 
Fuck around with one of the homies watch the Glock pop
One love and keep hollerin back
We can split my last dollar in fact pop your collar to that
Crooked I need the whole clique
And like frozen chitlins thats some cold shit
My nigga some cold shit


Cold shit when you elevate and get into some more shit
When we ride together niggas be like Oh shit
Dogg Pound in the house rockin the party all night long
Gettin high to the break of dawn
Chipped up like a cellular phone
Back up watch it shine like chrome
Individually we the shit
But together we cant be fucked with we crush shit
Never settle for less than the plush shit
But still dont forget when we was broke
About 9 or 10 locs with only one joint to smoke
Man I can count on both hands the different stands
And plans niggas took to make it better for the fam
We made our first five grand was like god damn
New khakis and Cortez
We learned the essential meaning of what a whore is
Still clockin more biz
Always lookin up cause if you look down youre fucked
Soopafly Taylord up like Chucks
But I aint shit without my homeboys
And thats real shit
I aint shit without my homeboys
True thuggish Capones real niggas I knew before I was grown
A lot of motherfuckers died but Imma still ride
And represent the evil motherfuckin Westside
It aint nothin but trues real niggas who paid they dues
Picture me rollin with gay dudes
Nigga please we Gs and dress like we serve kis
On the block where we chop rock recop and make Gs
Down to die for each other its you and I for each other
In a gangsta matrimony we brothers
Cant nothin seperate game we game from initiation
Marks fuck around and catch heat sparks
Casino Gangs the gang that a motherfucker claim
Rump Segal Lonnie Mack EMack its you mayne
I aint shit without my homeboys
