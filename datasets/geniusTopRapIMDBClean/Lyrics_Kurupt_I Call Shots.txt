Psychosomatic automatic static
Catatonic supersonic bubonic chronic addict
Astrononimcal in the Thunderdome center
In the depths of the dungeon dangerous dastardly
Catastrophes metamorphosize into a pit
TyrannoDon crackin the bricks on the walls
Camouflage on the side of livest
Bout to put somethin up in that could ride

Get dropped mopped and stomped like a parade
Persuasion phase three of the invasion

Loose in the jungle blaze a botanical garden up

Money stacker tshirt cakalaka
Verbal predator fake rap attacker
Gotti jawbreaker Roscoe the back cracker

See me on the streets walk by and I just stare at you
Tough talk when theres bullets flying through the air at you

We astronomical phenomenal magical mathematical
Taking your firstborn as collateral
I call I call shots round here
