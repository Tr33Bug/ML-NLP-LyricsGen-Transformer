Psychosomatic automatic static
Catatonic supersonic bubonic chronic addict
Astrononimcal in the Thunderdome center
In the depths of the dungeon dangerous dastardly
Catastrophes metamorphosize into a pit
TyrannoDon crackin the bricks on the walls
Camouflage on the side of livest
Bout to put somethin up in that could ride
Its time for world war three motherfucker

You can miss me Im probably chillin up in Mississippi
Or Poughkeepsie or Baton Rouge guzzlin whiskey
Im a walkin franchise and I wanna get paid
Get dropped mopped and stomped like a parade
Persuasion phase three of the invasion

Loose in the jungle blaze a botanical garden up
Nowadays niggas aint hard enough

Renegade revolutionary infantries

Money stacker tshirt cakalaka
Verbal predator fake rap attacker
Gotti jawbreaker Roscoe the back cracker

See me on the streets walk by and I just stare at you
Tough talk when theres bullets flying through the air at you

We astronomical phenomenal magical mathematical
Taking your firstborn as collateral
