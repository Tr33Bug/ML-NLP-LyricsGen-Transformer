Intro repeat 4X
Yo man I dont think they heard you
Wont ya tell em what your name is  Dr Dre
Daz Kurupt
Aight everybody get on the ground RIGHT NOW
Yeah this is not your money this is insured by the Federal Government
So this is not your money dont move
Dont be a hero and you wont get BLOWN THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW
Yeah aight yall we got three minutes
Startin now lets keep it rollin
Hit the bank from the back
Double the trouble forcin my entry
The first nigga that I saw shot him in the jaw
Xzibit started stompin him and so did we  GET DOWN BITCH 
Aww shit about time we started dumpin on security
High society  takin whats mine
Snatchin each purse after purse  for every nickel and dime
Premeditated created by the scorn and the hate
But I made ma the big time lights and the shine
Its a full scale war  everybody bear arms
Wear body armor national arms
Dip away to get away  sirens alarms screamin
Yellin out Hell demons of war
Hell hounds that surround the Wells Fargo browns
No tomorrow hollow harness rounds
Take a sip of your Perrier
To pay Imma dump like a dumptruck scramble to make my escape
Dat Nigga Daz shootin so nothin else come in
Im shootin in the opposite direction we closed in
Shells spread nigga  because we can do the work
First things first  like Snoop Imma shoot the clerk
And I did  now its time to split  get nigga get
lets go  Dumpin and shoot the hostages
Soopafly outside in the ride
Bout to start shootin everything that he see outside


Loose cannons face covered with bandanas
Chrome pieces  motherFUCK the police
Its everybody killers on mine
If I ever get caught for crime wont be doin federal time
Loose cannons face covered with bandanas
Chrome pieces  motherFUCK the police
Its everybody killers on mine
If I ever get caught for crime wont be doin federal time
