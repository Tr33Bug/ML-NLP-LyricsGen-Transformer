Intro Kurupt  Daz Dillinger 
Verse 1 Kurupt 
Come to Pelican Bay
Where the pelicans play
And fly pelican fly
Fly away
Take this bird to the homie on 19th Street
Its in the back in the trunk under the seat is the heat
Hollow tip melodic
Soopafly psychotic
Super Sonic
With a little bit of chronic
Gin and tonic
Cant have a phone nigga
Without the hydrolics
Cant purchase no powder
Without the cauliflower
Holly Colly high power
Bangin with the homies
Bustin on bustas
Dumpin on cowards
The homies said move to left home boy
Hit your chest
Knock out hold your breath home boy
Ws for the West home boy
E is for the East home boy
DAZ and Soopafly
Motherfucker Priest home boy
My niggas
Blaze a ounce
Hit the stage
Bitches strip
Niggas bounce
Chorus Daz Dillinger 
All my Dogg Pound niggas better
Make some noise
All my niggas in the back better
Make some noise
All the bitches in the front better
Make some noise
All my homies all over the world
Make some noise
All my niggas all over
Make some noise
All my niggas in the back better
Make some noise
All my niggas down with us
Make some noise
Everybody around the world
Make some noise
Verse 2 Kurupt 
Process of elimination
Total devastation
Total world domination
Struck determination
Capitations
Determination
To injure the nation
And leave a whole half of the world
With a million decapitations
With no hesitation
Fast
Blast with the homies
Its all set to blast
To bust a nigga touch him
Bustin aint nothin but bustin
It aint shit
See you aint quick enough to draw and spit
So you fall cause youre hit
Aww shit 
And your homies get to runnin
Another nigga still gunnin
Got a pistol fool
You know the rules of the hood
Refuse thats on you
You know the rules of the hood
Im a G fa sho

From the back to the middle
To the front of the door
You got a Cadillac Seville
I got a license to cock back aim and shoot to kill
Now nigga how you feel
Chorus Daz Dillinger 
All my niggas clockin paper
Make some noise
All my Dogg Pound niggas
Make some noise
All my gang bang niggas

Verse 3 Kurupt 
Nigga what
Youre just a space invader
Takin up all the space motherfucker
And Imma tell yall to yall faces
When it takes place
Yall never know it takes place
Little busta in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
I aint hatin
Fool Whats crackulatin
Is it sex or Glocks
Money for rhymes or rocks
All my home boys with 9s in they hands
Put them in the air
Bust like you just dont care
This the Terror Dome
Home sweet home
For the chrome
Pack your homies
With the foes
And all gold in the bones
Hit the strip club
Get a little sip get my dick rubbed
What the fuck
They love Kurupt
But I dont give em a sip
It aint because they dont deserve it
Its cause they love Kurupt and love how Kurupt be swervin
And if Kurupt make em bounce
Indeed I make em bounce
And blaze the weed
And rock the party with an ounce now bounce
Chorus Daz Dillinger 
If you down with Kurupt would you

Everybody all around wont you
Make some noise
And all my real live niggas wont you
Make some noise
Everybody down with  would you
Make some noise
