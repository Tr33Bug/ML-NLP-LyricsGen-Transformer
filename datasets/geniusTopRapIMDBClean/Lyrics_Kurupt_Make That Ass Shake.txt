I got a fucked up habit for dumping and blasting
Just picking on my niggers rolling around in the classroom
Just making shit happen tired of tripping
Its time to start living
Start enjoying the rhythm
Forget what I gave them  the joy in the rhythm
I gave them what I give them the joy in the rhythm
Im forced to come doing five fours
Youre trying to take anything my lifes value twards
Trying to beat Caesar in Rome I roam
Its my dominion nigga what I call home
You can live how you want to live I dont give a fuck
Nigga bang how you want to bang on who and when what nigga
And all you broads I wanna see you shake something
I want do something rub you leg your back your stomach
She looked me in my face then she told me to my face
There aint nothing that she cant do to make her ass shake
More than a handfulll make that ass shake
Pussy popping back and forth look at that ass shake
Fine seductive bad than a motherfucka
Just the kind of girl I like to cuddle in this motherfucka
She said anything got pleasured in this motherfucka
I have to admit she said treasured in this motherfucka
I know all she wants to do is get paid
That pussy popped all up and down on me
Make it pop make it pop make it pop
Take it off take it off take it off
Shake it up shake it up shake it up
Shake em off shake em off shake em off
I put on  and she let me grab her titties
Bitch dont you know I run this city
You better ask these niggers all about me
And anything you think about me
And all you niggers is this what you call war
Is this the future Im looking twards


All I know is lifes a bitch
Let me hit you with some G shit
Look busters wont leave me alone
Im being attacked by imitations man like  and clones
I aint out to get you
Want to party Ima party with you
Which one of these flips you want to party with you
But if you want to play we could play it homie
Kick back and let the toy speak and say it for me
Ive been a fool beforeI know the feeling
Getting in the game nigga I know the feeling
But them ks and the bananas thats pilling
Make us go bananas blood pressure to the ceiling
Ive got a funny feeling
Money to the ceiling
Make a nigga like feeling impenetrable
I feel a strange awe if I hit the store
I might have to chip one two three or four
Niggers in the front door nigga on the floor
Niggers  and hit the register drawer
