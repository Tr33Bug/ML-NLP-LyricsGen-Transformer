Come and flow with me down mystic river
Im like moonshine I shift your liver
This a Kodak moment life is pictured
The frame is the world that surrounds the picture
After two sons and three daughters Im purified
Like Arrow Head mountain spring water
Life can suck breath outta you like mosquitoes
I scooped up the game like two steelos
I locked up bangin a lot
Stuck in a sink for a Newport menthol box
Is there any way I could escape
From the bad decisions in my life I made
Grab up the tape clear the floor
Strap up the 8 nigga and clear the door
Its like UHaul trucks
Hittin every vicinity you heart touched
Its about to be a house party crackin up the street
With them bangin ass woofers the speakers and the beat
Just a little bit of this and get a little bit of that
From the front to the back  back  dip to Battlecat
Im on float like doves
Sit on the clouds and smoke my dubs
Im up above like cuz sit on the balcony and smoke my bud

Specific formulas of untapped encryptions
I got it all mapped out  out out 
Think about it for while til I blackout  out out 
But now Im back in curcuit
To reconstruct the service the game is hurting
Dogg Pound Gangsta gang remain and working
Political purpose squeeze like nooses 
Theyre about to raise the curtains were at your service nigga
Dont get nervous
Cause I get ya slit ya ankle to cervix
Cause they always wanna doubt ya
Niggas like bitches they cant live without ya
Ay homie tell me what you think
Niggas wake up eat shit n sleep hate
Ay homie tell me what you thought
When your homeboy got rolled the fuck up huh
Ay homie tell me what it is
The cars and the bitches the diamonds or the cribs
Ay nigga tell me what you want
My memories my future up front
My memories my futures what you want
The nickel or the rage or the gauge ride pump

The life of a G
BC Young Gotti Snoop DAZ nigga
