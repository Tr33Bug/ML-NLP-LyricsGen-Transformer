DPG GC   X 4 
Smash just before you talk spaz out
Hittin the switch then hittin the stash
Before the year 2000 all the computers crash

Too deep too strong homeboy
We rollin too deep with two zones homeboy its on homeboy
Zones with two candys painted bronze homeboy
DAZ I cant believe this nigga gon trip

Saggin with my rag bout to drag the street
TripleX sweatshirt with blue Chucks on feet
Killa instincts keep me ahead of my foes
Never doze when I rose let the chrome explode
Man I wish a bitch would try to get me for some child support
Ill stuff my foot up her ass like a super sport
Down shit Pound shit gangsta
Forever whenever however down for whatever
Recognize game when it hits ya nigga
If ya slip up Doggy Doggs gonna get ya
Been doin that thangthang long tryin to slang caine
Just before I was taught  how to gangbang
All my peers through the years know
That Snoop Dogg aint nothin but a fool though
And if ya run up on that man tryin to dolow
Thats when he  pull out his homie
Who  you know
Man I been through so much and Im still goin through it
But fuck all that I got to stay into it
I knew the job was dangerous when I took it
Shit a nigga didnt even overlook it
I was so eager just tryin to get involved
But now I gots to represent for me and my doggs
Yeah 94  became a DO doubleG PO UND Gangsta
Now you can see me smokin dank your neighborhood pranksta
Play a trick quick intimate then out no doubt
Paperboy with a new route
When Im in front they watch behind me
Mission Crush ready to bust grab the tommy  gun
Keep one I role with the heat seeka
Stash the gauge pass the nine to my neega
Roll keep slow peep popo
Creep slow ready to smash with the fofo
I go for broke with loc niggas who tote guns
Never understood niggas highup with low funds
Smoke one represent my seaside ocean
Eastside motion we slide coastin through
