Verse 2 Slop Patacico  Kurupt
My name is Stephen
I eat MCs for no apparent reason
It in you if you skeezin Im pleasin
Those who dare
I advise you not to stare
You be assed out like a flat tyre widout a spare
I declare war before I had to even the score
You got me hot like sand on the shore

I go back like Flava Flav in cold Medina
I get honies to make you say You seen her
Im pregnant but only in my mind
Hopin my baby rhyme grows up to be a triple platinum album
I fell on using the steel to do crimes
Smoked so many niggas they put up no smoking signs
Charismatic asthmatic ballin like Madden
Cream automatic attractive like a magnet
Speedin like car racin

Burned out my Playstation while cats be scar facin
Hey old lady sorrys all I can say

Fox got the bubbled eye Benzo
Im in the back of Kurupt flex truck playin 64 Nintendo
Get peeled skills in the fields
Raw dog raw deals
Niggas either ill fake or real
Penetrates I only heard ah tens and thirty eights
Ride as the niggas turnin states and flippin crates
Get lift like weights
Bust and radiate spreadin infections
Murderous mafia connections
I wanna feel touched like feelings
Start drillin start ampin out
Hittin wid autos campin out
Wid autos innovative calculative creative
Touched nigga hectic wid a couple seconds
A bust nigga from a distance I can peep a fuck up
You on the Ave wid nuthin but cash to get stuck up
