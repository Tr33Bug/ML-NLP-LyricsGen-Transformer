Dat Nigga Daz Dillinger
Kurupt Young Gotti nigga
West Coast California livin nigga

Milli monotone cyclone Stallone
Marone chaperone shiny chrome Capone
Smashin in a 82 brand new Brougham
Home sweet home nigga where the hoodstas roam
In gangstaville where we shoot to kill
Pop the pill pop then drop the threewheels
The tale of tales fly high as a gazelle
The hellhound came through to drown the whale
Pronounce denounce strip then set sail
Soak in a cloud of smoke then inhale
Hold it in never exhale
Smoke whoever niggas zone Im in oh well
Fuck you and ya mama
Drama holocaust through anaconda

Let off a pellet the Desert Eagle start yellin
Screamin the path of a demon bailin

The first nigga saw is the first nigga gone
Smashed on banked and shanked and blast on

Doublefour dumper on my lap for comfort
For you you

Fuck yall punk bitch made niggas
On onsite let off on sight
Lettin off on the first thang in sight fuck yall niggas
Niggas act like they gon get wit me when they see me onsite
But I dont give a shit you bitch cause Im a gangsta for life
Prepare to storm when the storm rain fire and brimstone
Spread throughout the plains like a plague
Back to the Gs and fool
With the heater cocked drownin niggas in they own pool
Hit em hard like weights
Make a nigga feel it like pains and aches
Pump ya temple and make ya spray and shake
Imma get ya hit ya nigga makes no mistakes
