I caint get enough of the block

Ima YA ride til Im dead on the block
Entourage til Im gone watchin me until I drop
Got a pocket full of stones walkin up and down the block
See the cops at the corner real niggas never stop
I see death around the corner so Im hangin on the block
When Im gone to the coroner theyll leave me on the block
I was wrong got a problem you can see me on the block
Thats home Thunderdome you can meet me at the spot

Another black male on the stairs laid dead
What more could I do
Move up nigga aint no rules in the hood
Too many drugs used in the hood

Hold your head soldier Im right here for you
