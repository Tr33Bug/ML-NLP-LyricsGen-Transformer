I caint get enough of the block
I caint get enough cause Im stuck on the block
Ima YA ride til Im dead on the block
Entourage til Im gone watchin me until I drop
Got a pocket full of stones walkin up and down the block
See the cops at the corner real niggas never stop
I see death around the corner so Im hangin on the block
When Im gone to the coroner theyll leave me on the block
I was wrong got a problem you can see me on the block
Thats home Thunderdome you can meet me at the spot
Probably catch you at the club sippin Henny on the rocks
Catch you walkin out the club knock your ass out the box
Im a gangster nigga
Ima gangsta ride  thats right 
And gangsta glide  and glide

And blowin on dicks is all she know
She a ho and baby give me head on the spot
She a sucka for a nigga hardhead from the block
Dear God dont let a young nigga die broke
I hold my pistol with pride with every 9 I toke
Its a tear I done shed
Another black male on the stairs laid dead
What more could I do
Move up nigga aint no rules in the hood
Too many drugs used in the hood
We all young black and abused in the hood
15 years old they got him doin life
No sense to keep cruisin Ima keep cryin
The judge got a grudge the DA lyin
You gotta give him mercy Lord let him breathe
Good or bad seed he a seed in the soil
Hold your head soldier Im right here for you
And that go for all my homeboys  yuh
