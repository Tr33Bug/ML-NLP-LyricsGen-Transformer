Take over conversations nigga stop acting like a bitch
Stand up just like a man get your game together
Before a nigga gotta teach you some table manners
Like Kokane said To all you suckers get your motherfucking
Knuckles off the table motherfuckers
I smoke me a cigarette nigga knew ports
Just came up with some other knew thoughts
Like people get paid when we smashing on our own
Doing what we want I smash them on my own
Get the black and the brownie few
Put Ks and 9s in the hood
Put crack and crash in the same area
So we can make it look no good
Blame it on hiphop and gangsta rap
All why these streets keep polluting
All off the murders and all the shootings
All off the hood niggas trapped and stuck
Fucked nigga blame it on Kurupt
Or how Tha Dogg Pound is broken up
Cause I just dont give a fuck
C Delores Tucker use to burn our records
Rivernal shockers use to burn our records
Now niggas making money off other rappers
So beat a dick and eat it or eat a dick and beat it
Back in the days you were professional clappers
Clappers turn rapper rappers turn actors
Doing it big and everybody wanna show niggas where they live
Nigga Ima tell you niggas like this
Get the fuck off a real niggas dick
And break bread nigga
