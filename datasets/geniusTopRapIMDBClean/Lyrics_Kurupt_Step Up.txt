Daz
Aw yeah
Right about now its time to get busy
Huh straight out the box nonstop
Kurupt the Kingpin Xzibit Crooked I
Wait a minute um 
Crooked I
This is the art of manslaughter
When Im rockin Im more shockin than droppin a boom box in bath water
You entered the wrong scuffle
You catchin a chrome buckle
I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles
Deliver the sick verbals
My shotty spit a round before you hit the ground
Your body spin around in six circles
Diminishin infamous menaces
Im waitin to get dicced if not Im a start finishin innocents
Lyrics  lyrics  Im breezin the region
Freezin gs in your legion
Freakin ancient techniques when Im speakin phoenician
Its all about Crooked
These bitches shout Crooked
Ill make you say the West Coast aint shit without Crooked
I own a vicious label niggasll get disabled
When Im spittin rhymes written on project kitchen tables
I load this 45 and let slugs dive at ya
Now thats for Crooked I the scrap happy mic snatcha
Daz
Motherfuccers can you dig that huh
Can you fucc with this
Lets get Kurupt the Kingpin to fucc yall niggas up
Yall dont wanna see none of this west coast MC shit
Yeah how you like me now motherfucker
Kurupt
Terror starts in the midst of your heart starts
The storm my vocals float like arks
In the mystic state of mind when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing MCs like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin MCs
Kaboom the room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extraterrestrial microphone terror
In effect get infected
Tell me what the fucc you expected
These venemous injections
I leave whole sections and sections full of injections
From these poisonous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode
Baboom alone in my own zone
So dont compare me to none
Not ones nearly
Severe cause I severely impare MCs
Near me oppose and fear me I got plots and theories
Sincerely I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock

Daz
Yeah back in effect it dont stop
Turn your speakers up DJ Battlecat on the table
We fuckin it up like this and like that yeah
Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuckin house
Alkaholiks
Xzibit
When I was enlisted
I came to the table double fisted
Sadistic heavy artillery for all my enemies
Bust shots up in the sky screamin obsenities
Make niggas sport khakis and chucks from here to Italy
Itll be a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail
Act like a bitch on bail tuck tail and run
See we do it how it cant be done
Im the rough cut plus how the west was won
Or direct descendant of the gatling gun
Dont test me son you fucc around and catch you one
That aint a threat thats a promise I can definitely keep
You cant compete wit 25 niggas wit heat in the street
Ready to repeat round after round at you
All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through
I found that you and yours can never fucc wit mine
I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes
Cross the line now you gotta pay the piper
Im The Alkaholik sniper that be keepin the crowds hyper
Its ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Cant stop till me and my niggas is platinum plus
My Dogg Kurupt
Daz
Yeah no shit
Yeah yall cant fucc wit that
Thats what Im talkin about
West coast we been doin this shit for years
Aint nothin happenin wit that
Battlecat
Dont step up 
Right right
Dont step up unles you wanna get hurt 
Huh huh huh
Get get get get hurt 
Whatcha say
Motherfuccas that be hangin in the battle
Get hurt get get get get hurt 
Thats what Im talkin about
Daz Dillinger
Dont step up unless you wanna get hurt 
Break it down break it down
Huh
mixed with Battlecats scratching 
Motherfuccas cant fade this shit
