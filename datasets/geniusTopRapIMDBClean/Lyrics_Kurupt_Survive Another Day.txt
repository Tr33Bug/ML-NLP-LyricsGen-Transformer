Gangstas
Lets spark up an idea you know
Gangstas
I dont know why you cats insist to get involved in our game man
I mean Drug money thug money its all funny money to me
You know Scared money dont make no money man so you know
if you scared stay out of the game baby
Verse 1 Kurupt
Another day another dollar
Another nigga jacked for his sack
Jeans and them collars
What the fuck makes life so complicated
Why they playahatin instead of congratulating
One of the homies just bought a new 64
And they mad about it
And talking bad about
Dont trip cause you smoke dubs and he smokes ounces
Your fo rolls and his fo bounces
Planted on the ground and this fool skyrockets
Got a nigga hot enough to want to shake his pockets
Roll like Biggie nigga
Two Glock nines
Any muthafucka whispering about mine
All I got is my twelve shottie
Im a gangsta nigga
Kurupt Young Gotti
Me and Gonzoe and Capone
With a chrome
And a bone with a zone fucked up getting blown
Scared money dont make no money
Cause drug money thug moneys funny money
Dont it feel good to survive another day
This fear money dont take no money
Scared money dont make no money
Now I was standing alone against the cold world outside
Without no place to hide or no will to survive
Thinkin who can I run to
Basically it was the big homie to go get the heat is what it come to
I look around from the gate Ive been down
But Im still broke as fuck depressed and down
Sometimes I fuck around and wish I wasnt here today
Now here to say sometimes it scares me to feel this way
Aint there a name for this
Aint there a phrase that fits
Aint it called psycho schizo paranoia or some shit trip
With the mentality of a kid in the village of the damned
Walking through the hood with a gun in my hands
I had plans to be a superstar rappin the rock
But all that stopped and dropped once the hammer was cocked
I had to get out of Dodge I aint tryna hide
Im just tryin to find a way to stay alive and survive right 
Chorus
Scared money dont make no money 
Cause uh drug money thug moneys funny money 
This fear money dont take no money 
scared money dont make no money 
Verse 3 Gonzoe
Nigga gotta stay strong cause the weak die
Please God separate my life from the bad times sufferin
Survivin aint enough to cover it cause I spend to much
Plus Im scrapin the tops of my pies to make crusts
So Kurupt nigga tell me how Im sposed to feel
Notice my attitude drinkin only smokin the real
And it feels so good in the car with us
Lavishly feel the extasy bustin a nut
Another day a nigga worship his weed and Alize
And the pussy Im fuckin 
And aint no scars on my Daytons my shit intact
And thats real candy paint all original Lat
Its so depressin a thug with a hustle no one messes
And Im destined Im kissin my gun so you can bless it nigga
Another day another dollar
Yeah nigga its me Gonzoe
Dont act funny haha
Outro
Them promises didnt do nothing for me
Its time to set ourselves free
But as time marches on
the races grow strong stronger than Ajax
And niggas wanna be free but they still watch TV
even though they cant see
And our Chinese brothers dont cop no pleas
for theyre into unity Isnt that
the way we want to be But the Man
watches the music cause the black people are confused
Conquered and divided tricked and undecided
and the good guys are there
with slugs  in the air But the rain still falls
and the  Chorus  sun still rises And the Man Man
Man is still full of trickies
