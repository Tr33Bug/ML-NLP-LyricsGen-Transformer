Daz and Kurupt Kurupt and Daz
Nickels and pennies and pounds of hash
Double up the dough double my money
Let it can boil and bubble get a grip aint nothin funny
You cant survive off no conversation wit words
Betta get up off yo ass nigga go flip some birds
Hand me my cash nobody moves and nobody get blast
My first words are my last
I got a platoon mask and armor suits
First infantry of riders on a global pursuit
Parachute and jump held high on a stump
Wit a pump bout to dump put a end to the hunt
Tha streetz iz a muthafucka
Dope game rock game cocaine package was sold Figuero
Ride and roll pistols up as high as they go
Gotta let em know the gang muthafucka fa sho
In and out dos chrome rollin in 64
I aint got time for none of you bitches so fuck off ho
Ever heard of a gangsta Well you must have heard of us
The gangsta gang full of jack artists and murderers
Automatics rang out you left dead nigga wit yo brains out
Walk back to the porch wit some salt to wash the stains out
Murders my hobby kidnapping jacking and robbery
Wild as a safari in a paidfor Ferrari
Pay the cops off as I peel out and jet
It aint no thing when we connect we posted up with Tecs
Nigga we bury you alive in cement thats what we meant
Now when the nine goes click yo ass wasnt shit
Get out your war tactics get at you get the job done
One gun you hung seven bullets in your lungs
Struggle with heron and Ill tear you apart
Through my veins and through my heart
Thats when the drama will start
Nigga gimme what you got let off some more shots
Run through what you got destroy yo block
Gotti Dillinger forever runs your spot
When the nine goes pop thats when your homeboys drop


I seen it befo 44s explode
Niggas fall on the flo the hardest nigga on the flo
The hoes late do what the fuck ever a nigga say
Its like this every day on the streets of LA
Gotta a lumberjack the size of a tank
Im a hammerhead with a hammer the size of a tank
Ever heard of a gangsta Well you must have heard of us
The gangsta gang muthafucka its on dawn to dusk
Well nigga wonder why we do this it aint really nothin to us
Plus you aint nothin to us you cant do nothin to us noooo 
I represented and presented the bloodbath
Feel the wrath we get what you had you get stabbed
We grab for the opportunities thatll soon to be a chance
At the eulogy I knew youd be dead while in prison
Making critical decisions
To the brain to his neck
Goes 27 inches for tellin the snitches
Shut the fuck up nigga
