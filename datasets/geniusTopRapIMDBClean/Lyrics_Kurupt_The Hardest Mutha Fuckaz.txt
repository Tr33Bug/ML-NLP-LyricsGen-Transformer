Some try to repeat my flow
Others neva try cuz they know
I told ya that the game dont wait
Im so tight that I can wait for the game
Just about as tight can be
Thats why you never see em fuckin with me
Get ya chance to bow out gracefully
You standin face to face with defeat

So what you know about this West Coast monopoly
Enough animosity to tear down democracy
Anarchy you wanna analyze and copy me
But mutha fuck that stay off my god damn property
Xzibit burn a couple ounces of that broccoli
Step into the function make the crowd bounce properly
Yeah I know about your little shit talkin mockery
Tryin to see and pour 6 feet of gravel on top of me
And all my playaz go to wakes so the next nigga can take my place
And try to invade my space
Make my enemies search for God like Mae  Yeah 
You should avoid catchin 2 to the face so I can avoid catchin a case
Youse just another fuckin rat in a race
While I explode and expose to this multiplatinum fan base
Never seen before I kick in your door
Aint no time to run for them guns just get on the floor
