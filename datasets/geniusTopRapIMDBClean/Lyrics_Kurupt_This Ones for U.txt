Hollered at one of the homies the other day
He said someone approached and then he looked the other way
He turned back and drawed and all he saw 
Was a vision of himself he choked and he awoke
And I just paused to laugh thats some familiar shit
Cause the other day I dreamt up some similar shit
So I tell him I love you and stay safe
Then I skates to a whole different hood where different shit takes place
Ive been G since the age of 18
When I first ran into heaters ninemillimeters
Get the cash as one all the homies mash as one
Toke the bong and smoke these a hundred spokes
Holler at the big homeboy CStyle  what up CStyle
