Rainstorm the back of the bank bustin loose like Muggsy
Typhoons Kurupt Calhoun
With a platoon of backwards ass buffoons
Ready to shoot anything that moves
Load to tunes from The Blue Lagoon
Mask on khakis ounced on house shoes
So Imma start it off skitzin on the first nigga
Saul here for stacks heard me hear me
Heard that word dont pass the front do
Before you gotta show em your heart and soul and Desert Eagle fo
Explode then watch em fold the other niggas froze
He knew better mask in an all blue sweater
Two pumps ready for a riot
Full Baretta six hostages with a loss of oxygen
Wet as a river sixteen bricks to flip
After I flip these bitch niggas for they shit
I been down with the twist since eightysix
Hyperactive with a automatic snappin reaction
Im sick of waitin a thirtyeight Im jackin for Daytons
Kick the door in for sure double fours rammin
Hollow bandit ready to knock him off if he standin
Position the cannons telegraph the whole parameter
Paralyze anything that walks through perimeter
Cervical veins lacerated lost to missiles
Interrogated and I paraded posted with pistols
Time for war this is when the hearts exposed
Change up the game cockin and sparks explode
Im a marksman touch of death ten steps then draw
And thats all end to anything before
In a world war off like a Concorde jet
But fool DPGs the set
In a world war this is when the hearts exposed
Change up the game cock sparks explode
Manicdepressive panic and then start skitzin
Not givin a fuck while all yall bitchin
Dis is for all my Gs my homies
Flippin birds and servin kis
Im with King T and Tha Liks Alkaholed it up
Like bitch get the fuck off my dick
I got pistols pills acid bomb crank
Crystallized coke and limes I dont give a fuck
