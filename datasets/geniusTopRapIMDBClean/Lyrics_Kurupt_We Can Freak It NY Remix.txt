We Can Freak It  NY Remix  LyricsNoreaga
We can freak it out wut we can freak it out
We can freak it out wut we can freak it out
Verse 1 NoreagaKurupt
You gone thug it out gangsta style
Nigga check it out
Ayyo my baby moms hunny let me see my child
Niggas see me in the streets ask why i dont smile
Thats why nigga because my life is a mess
And Im sellin records now but i still feel stress
Neva had a legal job all i sold was drugs
And I still got my moms and the rest of my thugs
But my pops he aint here does that seem so foul
And im drinkin everyday on the wrong route
And cant wait for the day when Capone come out
No doubt my MU niggas thuggin it out
To wut wut all my niggas just funk wit Kurupt
Tell then niggas where they stand at where they end up wut
My niggas mash fom NY to LA first class
Drinkin Don from the bottle fuck the glass
My niggas peep it
Sit back and hold a secret
Funk wit Kurupt nigga wut
Yeah we can freak it
Freak sumthin get sumthin strip sumthin
Rip a sic sumthin my dick a stick sumthin
Just try me see the new millineum came
Im invincible wit my abdominium frame
Daminican ten are gone poetical pentagon
Nuttin silenced they all are violenced
The law story wars over territory
The masses only left Kurupt and Nore
Known to spit brimstone fire and magma
Wit magnums and mosts many and mostly semis
I pays no rent cars wit no lease
Got eight killas wit badges I pay police
Its a freak fest east to west no more wars
Bomb girls feastless nude beaches and nude shores
Baby soft as peaches soft as a plum
Aint no fun if the homies cant have none
Bitch Bitch
Chorus
No matter what you think
You cant see me If you wanna freak wit me Now do you wanna freak wit me
And you aint got the skills to freak with me
Now do you wanna freak wit me do you wanna freak wit me
Verse 2 KuruptNoreaga
Im zoned Nore and Kurupt on roam
And we wont stop bustin till Capone come home
Dirt be followin the presidente of ANTRA
Words of war nigga Im the black Frank Sinatra

Cuz you aint got the skills to freak with me
Now do you wanna freak wit me do you wanna freak wit me
We can freak it out wut we can freak it out
