Make the temperature rise the temperature rise
We cap to ride cap to homicide
Its instrumental heat is in the dead of the winter
In the heart of the cold we restructure your soul
Its Dat Nigga Daz  Kurupt we dont give a fuck
Like nigga whattup  Dat Nigga Daz and Kurupt
Its fatal fire blaze Sherm with a perm
Super superb wiggle like a worm let it burn
I pull up on the corner store what a sunny day
Sunny California the G way display
How to scrape the flo properlike hit the cylinders
And scrape the flo properlike stop at the light
Pull up then drive to the right
Its so good to be back home homey where the feeling is right
Chorus Latoya
Welcome home into LA
Where the tippy roll around and the gangsters play
Its been too long just to seen you come around
Now we can have a good time
Just watch your back when youre comin through this town
LA LA LLLA LA 
Zone on roam and Romeos rome
Nigga home sweet home chromes battlezones
World wars  boys and girls girls and whores
Eightyseven Chevy with switches galore
Impala bounce at the ice cream parlor blaze an ounce
To ounce dice game break and it counts
Kick in nigga before we gotta kick in nigga shoot
And whip out the shank and start stickin niggas
Get jacked for prior burnings we jack for Higher Learning
No concerning is life worth living or learning
We jack for other turnings we keep the burners burning
Witn no concerning is life worth living or earning
First I park nigga then spark nigga
Go from Martin Luther King to Leimert Park nigga
We G nigga we dont give a fuck Daz and Kurupt
Here tell your kids  kids grow the fuck up
Chorus
Dippin and hittin switches Imma hop dont do shit but hop
Pancake let the fo drop nigga hop
Stop pull out your pistol then pop
Hit em two times til he drop when I hop
Up and down the street bounce rock
Ragtop is history in California the bounce rock hop
Roller skate nigga watch a gangster take niggas
Take off break niggas down break niggas trample and shake niggas
Over turf earthquake niggas
Move to the side we ride you ever see a G glide
Slide motivate the crowd a thirtyeight Macleod
Forever boom sound with one single round
Chorus 2X
Welcome home  LA LA LLLA LA 
Welcome home  LA LA LLLA LA 
Welcome home  LA LA LLLA LA 
Welcome home into LA
LA LA LLLA LA
