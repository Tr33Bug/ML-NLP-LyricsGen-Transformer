Awww yeah Do you wanna ride wit us
Who ride wit us
When the sixtray bounce the street scrapin the bumper
Wit the sound for the summer that be thumpin and hummin
Hoppin up the Shaw on a Sunday what a fun day
Dip skip trippin and whippin down the oneway
Diggy Daz a busta aint had enough against
Rough and tough but its never too much
Daz and Kurupt Kurupt and Daz on that ass
We clash blast suckers just like a head on crash
This aint back in the day you get taught and sprayed
AK front to the back cause we hard to fade
We enormous we attackin it plus we swarmin
To Rumble in the Jungle like Ali and Foreman
We rippin it up we be givin it up
On the daily homeboy we be givin it up
We be cuttin it up scufflin to muffle it up
Homeboy Diggy Daz fuckin em up
4x
Livin it up  shakin makin the hood turn
Boil and burn two buckets of yearn
Flippin stickin fools for chicken scrapin the curbs
Scrappin for the domes straight to the head Thunderbird
Im on it homey me and my homegirl Diamond
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhymin
Daz my closest homeboy
California lickin switches a couple toys
Im tired retirin a couple jerseys
Went from the sunny state to Jersey puffin hershey
Let off get off or get spin off
Spit off set off spun off the chest
Off the roof a hundred and seventyeight proof of boost
Gangster Daz and Kurupt let loose
This is it short change dip wit us
Sip wit it us cock your heat or spit wit us
4x
Im tired of this  this  Im tired of that  that 
Im bout to bust fool wheres the strap
G fo flow for sho bounce galo
Up and down stairs beats everywhere I go
Calico excursions different diversions
Homicidal resurgence swerve and see my homey
On the corner chippin the curb and any busta
Get close enough we servin
Homey dont get nervous
Beware thats Kurupt fool beware
Rippin it up fool so you better beware
Of my crew gray and blued up get chewed up
You and your all red crew get bruised up
Im the one you love to hate so give me mine
And pay dues and now Im livin the life of crime
Switched up hit em up blast or get em up
Fortyfive TEC9s blast to hit em up
Aww yeah
