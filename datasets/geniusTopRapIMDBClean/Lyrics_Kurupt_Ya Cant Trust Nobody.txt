Man what you need man
Yo bitch ass always come around here wit this whole
Three dollar two dollar five dollar hit shit
Nigga come around here with a twentysack of somethin nigga
My bills gotta get paid motherfucker
Im outta here  catch me next week beotch
Hop in my Chevy get to wheelin down the block
Makin sales whether slangin weed or rocks
Clockin major strapped up me and my niggas in the house
Might as well BACK UP bustin on niggas if they act up
On a mission with my gang around here we run thangs
Get paid every night where we hang
Cause its a street thang cops and automatic weapon
Keep a nigga intact for these niggas halfsteppin
Daz Dillinger got sewed up for real
Dealers servin these niggas for a quarter of a mill
Ninetyeight my motto to kill thats how it is
Fuck my family fuck my friends when my dope come in
You feel like fuck trust a nigga lose his life
Tryin to trust on motherfuckers like us
Stackin stolen stack stackin it aint nuttin but murders
Kidnappings jackings and vault cracking
Crackin up in these parts heat sparks up in these parts
The dark parts of the motherfuckin park
The tarantulas loose and Im heated now
With somethin in my right palm to keep yall seated down
Repeated headhuntin huntin for heads
Shot in the chest neck arm and legs
Aint no fakin we all out to get paid
Wettin niggas what we do nowadays  nigga 
Around here you cant trust nobody
Anybodys somebody tryin to jack somebody  somebody 
Whether its weed or your life of narcotics
Anyway you get you cant trust nobody
We jack a nigga for a half a thang we back up in this
With a flock of these chickens worth three and a half million
Now we set we relaxed chillin livin the boss life
Every day every night me and the Columbians take flight
Eight hundred kis to fly across seas
When I flip it I make about twelve million Gs
Im a two thousand Ricky Ross transportin the sauce
And it pay to be the boss cause when yo ass get crossed
Every nigga on the street gets paid


A couple pieces spread bear arms nigga warfare nigga
Shut down the alarms nigga
Time to hit off get off then break off
If he dont kick in the bread then take off
Columbian ties Columbian mob members in Columbian neckties
Columbians disfigured
Daz MIDI machine Dillinger
Two shotty Young Gotti bout to put it on somebody
And my mindstate today is fuck everybody
Around here you cant trust nobody
Anybodys somebody tryin to jack somebody  somebody 
Whether its weed or your life of narcotics
Anyway you get you cant trust nobody
Around here you cant trust nobody
Anybodys somebody tryin to jack somebody  somebody 
Whether its weed or your life of narcotics
