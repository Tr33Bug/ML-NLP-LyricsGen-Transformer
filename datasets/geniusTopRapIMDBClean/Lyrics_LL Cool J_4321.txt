Ay carumba
Im gonna Bankhead bounce
No doubt
Watch your mouth
Ayo one two three four five six seven
Blaze the hot trizack that sound like Heaven
Seven six five four to three two one
Momon MethTical come and get some
Playing my position hot Nick son
This one for all the sick ones infliction
Poisonous darts sickenin best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs now Im trippin
On MCs cliche shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me GOD no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie running who
Fuckin punk get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump respect Wu
Yo ayo I put it on a nigga shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release time pent up  Explode 
When you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit I kept low petro your metro
Politic keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit Im driving in come with fog halogen
Terrorize your city from the spliff committee
Kick ass til both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty smack the drivers head in the gypsy
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute I love to burn to the roots
I keep cummin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you Fuck you my attitude is anaemic
Im the illest nigga alive watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type wholl fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough Ill start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough and then Ill call your bluff
Like Yo how many rhymes you got
I could go on for more Millenniums than Mazdas got on the car lot
And theres nowhere to run to when I confront ya
Nigga I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surfacetoair missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty Im already doin a hundred when Im blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Stay out the dark cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown come up off that or Im gon gun it down
Run it now however its gon go its gon be that
See that that shitll finish you dog believe that
Where we at Do you value your life as much as your possessions
Dont be a stupid nigga learn a lesson
Im gon get you either way and its better to live
Let me get whats between your sock cause its better to give
Than receive believe what I say when I tell you
Dont make me put you somewhere where nobodyll smell you
And when the lights is out they dont come back on
This aint a flick you aint gon come back on you aint that strong
You knew it was wrong but you asked for it baby
Yous a big nigga ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street you think Im sweet
Want heat one deep leave him behind front seat
Ayo one two three four five six seven
Blaze the hot trizack shine like Heaven
Seven six five four three two one
Come on Mr Smith come get some  Some some some 
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed  Ha word up 
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension  Uhhuh 
Your little ass should be somewhere crying on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue  Uh 
Ima do this shit for free this time this ones for fun
Blow you to pieces leave you covered in feces
With one thesis  LL Cool J is hard 
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But thats like picking up a ball playing with Mike  Uhhuh 
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight  Uh 
Snapping you amateur MCs
Dont you know Im like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle Im a deadly disease
Ringmaster bringing a tiger cub to his knees  Uh 
In the history of rap theyve never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance  Word up 
Now lets get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side itd transform into a time bomb
You dont wanna borrow that you wanna idolize
And you dont wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And Im daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position and mention my name  LL 
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth dont ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga greatest of all time
