Oh my God you know
Im the best when it comes to makin love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl Ima lace it real tight
Go deep til the full moon turn to sunlight
Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child youre so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When your gone your bodys what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin through the crowd
Heaven on Earth paradise for a price
Its cool though Ill pay it for the rest of my life you know why
Aint nobody does me better
Makes me happy makes me feel this way
Aint nobody does me better
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
Im explorin your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up til you come home
Lovely you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess thats what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin for rainy days
Uh the lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise
Aint nobody does me better
Makes me happy makes me feel this way
Aint nobody does me better
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 


As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible uh its getting critical son
Im on the run from love it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo you hit it right on the head
Its an endless adventure two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever infinite time we intertwine
Destiny we fall in love by design
Whats yours is mine and whats mine is yours
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand Ill be your guide through the night
Aint nobody does me better
Makes me happy makes me feel this way
Aint nobody does me better
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
Come on now a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man give you half for a second
Then Ill give you the full plunge uh
What you want What you want What you want
Ice out infiltrates the scenery nahmean
Its bananas aint it
Aint nobody does me better
Makes me happy makes me feel this way
Aint nobody does me better
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh 
You can take it girl stop runnin uh
