You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
On your loving
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
Thats all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman aint scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
Shes sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honeycoated complexion using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl shes from around the way
I need an around the way girl  Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me  Shes the only one for me 
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
Silky milky her smile is like sunshine
Thats why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didnt tell you then another brother would
Youre sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon silk or maybe even denim
It really doesnt matter as long as youre in em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty youre ready for loving
Youre real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay  On your loving 
Come around my way
I need an around the way girl  Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me  Shes the only one for me to the bridge 
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way youre like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so youre crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa Angela Pamela Renee  On your loving 
I love you youre from around the way
I need an around the way girl  Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me  Shes the only You got me sh 
I need an around the way girl  An around the way girl 
Fine as can be  On your loving  shes all I ask
I need an around the way girl  Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me
I need an around the way girl  An around the way 
Fine as can be  Way
