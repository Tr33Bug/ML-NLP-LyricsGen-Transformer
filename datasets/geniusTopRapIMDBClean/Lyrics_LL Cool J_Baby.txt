Met this little girl she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on toenails red
Your bodys a gun baby pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you moving vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My Pulp aint Fiction its an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo she ride mandingo
She dont give a damn if Im married or single

She likes hiphop and RB
Her lifetime goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
Im really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on em they taste just like cake
We drink some beer inside of daddys 64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6pack she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress and she let me peep that
Im drunk as a skunk feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 730
Bought her some dessert give a damn if its early
Head spinning around like roller derby
Everything about her says you dont deserve me
I hope Im worthy cause shorty Im your

You can search but you never gon find  No 
A love thats quite like mine  No 
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shorty you the shit
He might be good but he aint like this
Cause Im your baby
In the back of the pickup clothing ripped up
She see my chrome wheels it gets more real
Running and laughing music blasting
Side over the road bent over crashing
Mouth all dry I can feel the urge
If you see my mama dont say a word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Dont ask me officer ask hurr
Wanna another drink baby She like Sure
Wanna hit the club She like I dont curr
She all in the rearview doing her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl Im here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even though I had to pay shorty Im your
Cause Im your baby  Your  your baby  Your  your baby  Your  your baby
