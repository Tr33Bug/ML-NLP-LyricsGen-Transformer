Back Seat  of My Jeep  Lyrics
Ah yeah
I wanna send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide
City to city ghetto to ghetto
Some flavor for you and yours
And your jeep
Youre the type of girl that got class and style
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
So I pull up to your door to give you what youre looking for
Uhh hardcore
I know you wanna comein my jeep
We can park on a back street
Youre checkin out my carphone scopin out my jewelry
Lets do this in a hurry
Air freshener is kickin drive through for chicken
I know you need a good stickin
Thats when I see my man Snoop
Peace what up kid loungin duke
As I turn the corner starin in your cornea
Youre gettin hornier and hornier
Im pumpin up a blend tape  flavor 
Youre legs is incredible I do a double take
Youre puttin on your lipstick
I wanna give you this big fat yeeeaaa 
Quick I know a place where we can lounge and cool dont sleep
where at  back seat of my jeep
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an ep
Im pullin over near your building
I light a candle on the dashboard were chillin
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this
You got class but deep down youre real freakish
You got it all but you never had a wild episode
Thats when me and my jeep showed
Up with the funk in the trunk and
Hittin it were spunkin
Ill even get you drunk and tipsy
Cause I know youre feelin frisky
You love it cause its wild and risky
You got your eyes on the hood
Youre up to no good
I took you in the back you hoped I would
You got your black on black so stacked in the back
While Im pumpin it the CD will skip a track
Windows are foggy
And uh back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby
And you aint in between the Isley Brothers sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
Thats how you want it dont ya  yeah 
Youll tell your girlfriends wont ya  nah 
Dont lie
Take it in your eye  Why 
So buckle up buckle up
Whats my name whats my name whats my name whats my name huh
I never knew a fourwheel drive could be so live
Ill put your numbers in the archives
So take em off and put them things on the mirror girl
Its my jeep and your world
You got it going on lovely time to do the right thing
Cause I can tell you wanna swing
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an ep
Were bonin on the dark blocks
Wearin out the shocks wettin up the dashboard clock
Seats full of sweat I told ya I would get it
Your kitty kitty cat cat was hungry so I fed it
Workin as a team
Somebody anybody  scream 
Jump with me to the casbah
Ill be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin waahhh
Damn its so good the mad grip on my tip
Youre still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof  yeah yeah 
Youre so cute wit your gold tooth
Extensions on the carpet
That nice round brown is my target
Its so firm so cushy it makes me feel mushy
I love it when its pushy
But dont laugh Im serious with this  word up 
The back seat of my jeep is priceless
Youre climaxin youre climaxin its full action
You love a good waxin its so relaxin
Ahhh give me a hug
See what Im sayin love
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an ep
