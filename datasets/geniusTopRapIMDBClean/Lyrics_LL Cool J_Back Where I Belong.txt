Yo yeah aight after this particular practice run
Ima practice both verses after this I want you to find a spot
Thats close to when the beat drops to the rewind point locate point
You aint gotta be on that all night this the soundtrack
Yo yeah check it
Okay alright huh okay
The other night I was up at Farmers politicking with some Bloods
They told me Yo L in the streets you aint getting no love
And ever since the Xs and the Jiggas came out
My niggas aint trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
Whats up with that cat Canibus Son played you out
Why you didnt answer back correctly fuck was that about
As I sip on some Henny and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend and all the drama it brings
Been gone a long time had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I dont want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is hiphop and Im hiphop so the streets is mine
Balling as long as you been living thats a long time
Hard to stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleeping and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat but niggas still wanna clap
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey
Some say L thats cool but see times have changed
Niggas got red bandanas and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead niggas rock platinum chains
Trade OE for Henny Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these socalled ballers with big names
And you gotta have a squad cause running from Def aint safe
I know you living good but aint no smile up on our face
Im like a villain Im representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world even if they dont want to hear it
As far as Canibus go my man is hitting his exbroad
Im getting head from his new piece
While 20 gangbangers applaud you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up then you dropped that garbage album
And totally fucked it up I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the afterhours spot when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy I coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget dont believe me look it up
Your AR promotion niggas they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible for destroying your career
A onehit wonder huh
No wonder you disappeared I coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit em word for word
Like you really a rap vet how you take metaphors from books
And put em in your rhyme and how you really from Canada
And you been fronting all this time
I heard your second album that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
Yo L you the man I said peace one love
And drove off in the Lex Land
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey
Yea nigga the jig is up nigga huh ha
You know what Im saying All that bullshit you was talking
Dont mean shit you finish now
Im still the man nigga
The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean come get that shit fuck what
MIC still on my arm nigga word up
Both arms Ima get another one nigga
You know what Im saying this LL you know how I get down
You should of known when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want Hahahahahahahaha
