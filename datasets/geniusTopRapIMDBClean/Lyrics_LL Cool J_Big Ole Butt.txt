I was at the mall sipping on a milkshake
Playing the wall taking a break
Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodys built to swing
Thats when I seen her her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said how you doing my names Big L
Dont ask me how Im living cause yo Im living swell
But then again Im living kind of foul
Cause my girl dont know that Im out on the prowl
To make a long story short I got the digits
Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spanking her and thanking her chewin her and doin her
Laughin because my girl didnt know that I was screwin her
Laying like a king on sheets of satin
Thats what time it is you know whats happening
She had a big ole booty I was doing my duty
I mean yo I admit that my girls a cutie
But Tina was exotic Earls my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down I couldnt hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin
Tina got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Tina got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
Tina got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Tina got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
I went to the high school about three oclock
To try to catch a cutie riding my jock
My homeboys jeep the system blasting
Cold forty dogs smiling and laughing
Girls all over the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
Thats when I seen her her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that Id always remember
I said to my man stop the jeep
Shes only seventeen but yo dont sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl yo you look tired
Lets go get some rest relax by the fire
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss I gave her a hug
I said to the girl them young boys aint nothing
You want to get freaky let me kiss your belly button
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eating
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheating but
Brenda got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
Brenda got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt so Im leaving you
I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parking lot and parked my car
Somebody shouted out I dont care who you are
I paid it no attention I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride
I walked in the place everybody was looking
And shrimp and steak wasnt the only thing cooking
I sat down to eat ordered my food
I said to the waitress I dont mean to be rude
But Ill take you on a platter
She said you got a girl I said it dont matter
You look like youre tastier than a piping hot pizza
Whats your name she said my tag says Lisa
I said OK youre smart and all that
But when you get off work yo Ill be back
She looked at me and said make yourself clear
L where we going I said right here
She looked kind of puzzled I said youll see
I pulled up at ten on the DOT
When she walked out the door I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and placed my order
And gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the breaka dawn
All over the restaurant word is bond
I heard somebody coughing I checked my watch
I couldnt believe it said nine oclock
I grabbed my pants put on my Kangol
Who did I see oh yo it was Brenda
Yo she worked at Red Lobster but I didnt remember
Lisa got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt so Im leaving you  see ya
Lisa got a big ole butt I know I told you Id be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt so Im leaving you  see ya
