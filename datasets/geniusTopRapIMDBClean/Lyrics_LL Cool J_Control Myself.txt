No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Seor LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy ya tu sabes
Uno dos tres muevete
Yall know what this isSoSoDef
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry  Woo 
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me  Uhhuh 
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her  Yeah 
When they tight and thick them jeans dont fit
Im L nice to meet ya  Uhoh 
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didnt want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
Im sweatin just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said
You got you got you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
Its hard to control myself  Aww 
Its hard to control myself
You got you got you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
Its hard to control myself
Its hard to control myself
Its hard for me to control myself  Me too 
And to hold myself back from jumpin on ya
Like I wanna like I wanna wanna
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another  Yeah 
We barely know each other
Yet were wilding like were lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin
The hustlers throw cashin
The bartender keeps splashin
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me youre invited
She said
You got you got you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
Its hard to control myself  Aww 
Its hard to control myself
You got you got you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
Its hard to control myself
Its hard to control myself
Its hard for me to control myself  Me too 
And to hold myself back from jumpin on ya
Like I wanna like I wanna wanna
She licked off her lip gloss
Her hips tossed back and forth
Side to side and up and down
She touched the ground it turned me out
Im battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I cant resist
Stop it dont make me hurt you
She said
You got you got you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
Its hard to control myself  Aww 
Its hard to control myself
You got you got you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
Its hard to control myself
Its hard to control myself
Its hard for me to control myself  Me too 
And to hold myself back from jumpin on ya
Like I wanna like I wanna wanna
