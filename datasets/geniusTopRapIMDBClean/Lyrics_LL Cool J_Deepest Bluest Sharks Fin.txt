Deepest Bluest  Sharks Fin  LyricsUh my hat is like a sharks fin
Deepest bluest my hat is like a sharks fin
Deepest bluest my hat is like a sharks fin
Manmade terror
Hungry jaws of death
Yall dont cross my depths
Ill pause your breaths
I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues
Bleeding to death with no arms and short sleeves
My worlds deep blue
Killers gotta eat too
Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through
Other fish in the sea but Barracudas aint equal
To a halfhuman predator created by a needle
Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep
When your Titanic sinks Im the one you gon meet
Hearing terrified screams they surround my team
All you see is trails of blood
Even God wont intervene
Nightmares of darkness
My apetite is heartless
Even if we related you eliminated regardless
In the deep blue underwater walls
Half man half shark
My jaws dont fall
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Killers sworn to beast
Swallowed them in flames
They switched my DNA
Trip me into Cool J
I cant fight the feeling
Im born to kill prey
To survive an attack
Theres only one way
Battle to the death
Thats how sharks play
Weapons left behind
We dueling with the mind
You blind crippled or crazy
Youre real easy to find
Struggling to flow with hemorrhages in your throat
Getting the lap dance while I smash through your boat
Eat your whole fam
Nothing left but a right hand
Clinging to a rail
Escape attempts fail
Youll never make it home
Tear the flesh off your bone
Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone
Im talking death out a moments notice
You wasnt focused
Me and my crew strike
Like some underwater locusts
Uh uh take it deeper
Uh uh take it deeper
These waters are waist level
The hallways flooded
Lost your scuba gear
The killers coldblooded
His names LL
You dont really want it
I ate your ancestors
The ocean is haunted
Im closing in cause Im supposed to win
How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin
Should have stayed on dry land
Stroke while you can
Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned
Abandoned pirate ships
Eels and sod scum
Fish that glow in the dark
The Titanics hub
Underwater storms
Your blood is so warm
Your life vest is off
And that turns me on
Killer for centuries
The Gotti of the deep
In the next millennium
Im still gonna creep
Sand under my belly ocean over my head
Through the light in the shadows
You become the living dead
Yeah DBS
