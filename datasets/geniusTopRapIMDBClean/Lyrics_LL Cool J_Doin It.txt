Conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me

Matter fact I cant wait for your candy rain
So whatchu sayin I get my swerve on bring it live
Make it last forever damn the kitty cats tight
Mmm daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like a G baby nice and slow

Who aint afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back

More flesh than the Greek Fest

Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Nows my chance to hit you off daddy Im grown
From the back from the side
