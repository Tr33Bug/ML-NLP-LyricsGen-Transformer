Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Bring on the moes and hoes
Dont snooze or doze cause Im rippin up shows
Hold your nose dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted the crowd is amused
Come with it if you feel youre fullfledged
Or yell Geronimo and jump off the edge
Your END is near when I appear
The stage is yours but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer and Im here to lay a load
So watch a player when hes playin in player mode
Uncle Ls bad and youre soon to say
Cause I rip the mic until the tune decay
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
MCs are dumb I catch em in a dragnet
Youre not complete Im battlin a fragment
So creative and witty and outstandin
And I be demandin that youre abandoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While Im at your crib on a cherrygoround
Where will she stop No one knows
Like I said before bring on the moes and hoes
I know my ABCs and my Ps and Qs
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard the cord theres a reward
Some were ignored when they toured for the bored
The crowd wasnt loud lyrics werent endowed
Took a crack of the 40 and went to show em how
You like me now but you didnt before
Cause you forgot I was raw
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Uh
Future of the funk uh
Go head baby
Do it
Go head baby
Do it
Yeah do it
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Yo eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Uh eat em up L 
Chill  Yeah eat em up L 
Chill  Yo eat em up L 
Its so visual the way Im throwin down
Visualize MCs goin down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is Ima get mines
I saw the cordless boy Im gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy you found em in a mouse trap
Dont try to front while the freestyles droppin
He wants to battle he must be needlepoppin
You better notify your next of kin
Cause when I begin its like a needle to the skin
If you wasnt prepared then you ought to be scared
But even if you was youre aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin your rhymes starin at my signature
Bought the album analyzed the style
Tsktsk  Achoo  God bless you child
Im unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapperll fall when the missions complete
I daze and amaze my displays a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition thats lost in a freestyle
Cause on the mic Im the golden child
With the magical wand that theyre callin a mic
And when MCs approach it turns into a spike
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Chill  Eat em up L 
Why dont you just chill  Eat em up L 
Yeah
Yeah I wanna say whats up to my man Kool Herc
And my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation
Know what what Im sayin
My man Marley Marl and DJ Clash
My man BBlast
Rush Town Def Jam we in the house
Of course I gotta say whats up to my homeboys EPMD
Yeah I get busy
Peace
