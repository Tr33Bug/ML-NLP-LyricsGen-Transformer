Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali hmm I dont think so
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali I dont think so
Going back to Cali stylin profilin
Growlin and smilin while in the sun
The top is down on the black Corvette
And its fly cause its sittin on Daytons
Nardi steering wheel plushed out goldleaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
VRRRROOM engines blowin the chrome is shinin
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali hey yall I dont think so
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali
Im going back to Cali shakin em bakin em
Takin em to spots they never before hung
I know a place off Sunset its a trip
Where the ACs cold but the girls still strip
The record skipped but this girl kept dancin
Prancin grindin grinnin romancin
I asked her to the barn so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this Brutus but I dont wanna pay
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali man I dont think so
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali
Im going back to Cali risin surprisin
Advisin realizin shes sizin me up
Her bikini  small heels  tall
She said she liked the ocean
She showed me a beach gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast but this girl was faster
Shes lookin for a real good time
I said Close your eyes I got a surprise
And I ran away with the bottle of wine
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali I dont think so
Im going back to Cali Cali Cali
Im going back to Cali I dont think so
