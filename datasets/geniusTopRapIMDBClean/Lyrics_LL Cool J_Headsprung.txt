They call me Big Elly a bit silly
But big money big really
When Im sliding in the Martin ya hear me
I be slicing with these bars so ya fear me
Let me rip it up for cuz in the back
Let me flip I put a buzz in ya hat

The part that hurts me is when they try to work me
But I could never let ya jerk me
Steady sticking to the wall give it up
Sneaking through the back door live it up
Got the champagne pour me a cup

Got playas on the grind wanna skip wit it
