Word up Ya know what Im sayin
I gotta globe in the world in the mail today
NahImsayin Heh word up
Uhh kid told me Yo the world is yours kid put it in ya pocket
Nahmean
Make a brother feel good word up
Brother feel energized
I wanna dedicate this one to the game that put me on the map
YnahImsayin
I know you love it the game is so irresistible to touch
You should see me when fiendin for microphones that I can clutch
Droppin bombs combinin the club attracts
Like the old Sugarhill Gang King Tim and Fatback
Theres no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed competition that was wishin
They could serve the technician with the number one position
Ugh the real deal Fearless Four scored
Bambaataa was hotter Spoonie was givin em nata
An I was all up in my headzone melody and all
Cosign and The Movement sayin Yes yes yall
Its just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow em up
Aint that splendid
This one goes out to all the hiphop doordiers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire
Whenever and ever
We want you I need you  I need hiphop 
Whenever and ever
We want you do you feel the same way too  I need hiphop 
Kanes era was terror he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick cat lyrics thatll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut chillin in my droptop Benz with friends Loungin with my mens laughin bout all the ends that I spends
Making snaps pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Dan Dookie wrotes Im about to show what time it is
At the rooftop I was with Doug EFresh and Slick Rick
La Di Da Di who likes to party was the fat shit
I mean I saw this hiphop thing on every level
Chuck D PE yes the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist Uzi Terminators
Terrordome techniques that terrorize the lighter shadea
Its all about the game that we play every day
Eric B  Rakim flow to such a different way
Im lovin hiphop cos it help brothers escape
Lets celebrate our music people before its too late


Whenever and ever
We want you I need you  I need hiphop 
Whenever and ever
We want you do you feel the same way too  I need hiphop 
Survival Of The Fittest Mobb Deep and Lost Boyz
Lickin shots got the game hot they even flipped on 2Pac
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre NWA Eazy Es in here
I wanna tell the world they just dont understand
My man Nas Escobar WuTang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you at Ya peep that
Im on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the doordiers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack Notorious BIG
Latifah Heavy D you should reminisce of me
Some say its Naughty By Nature Hiphop in all its glory
A fleet of battleships floatin in different categories
My love affair with hiphopll never fade away
Sincerely yours LL Cool J
Peace
Whenever and ever
We want you I need you  I need hiphop 
Whenever and ever
We want you do you feel the same way too  I need hiphop
