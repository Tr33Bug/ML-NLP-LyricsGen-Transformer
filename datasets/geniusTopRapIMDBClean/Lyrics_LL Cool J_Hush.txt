Hush baby wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
Hush baby wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way  my way my way 
Hush baby 
You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood
Mildmannered or up to nogood
It really doesnt matter either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop Spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But theres faith in our mind
Were spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast the whole worlds in a rush
Everybody just hush
Hush baby wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby dont talk so much
Why ya talkin 
Just wanna feel ya touch
Just wanna feel 
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way  my way my way 
Gotta do it my way 
Hush baby 
Its all a test the pain the drama
The villa in the Bahamas
The highs the lows
The Hooptie the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortons or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way my way my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl Ill swim to France
Cuz ya beautys unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love forever we are attached
Deal with the drama we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach
Hush baby
Hush baby wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way  my way my way 
Hush baby 
I can feel ya pain
Like we Siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothings gonna change
God willin we still be doin our thang
When my sixpacks faded
And raps outdated
But thats many years from now so dont rush
Little mama just hush
Hush baby wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If you do it my way  my way my way 
Hush baby 
Hush baby
Hush hush darling
Hush baby hush hush
Hush baby hush 
Dont talk so much
Umm dont talk so much
Hush baby hush 
Wanna feel ya touch
Hush baby hush 
Hush baby hush 
Hush baby wanna let ya know
