When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names
Then the thought occured tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself look what youve done to her
I can feel it inside I cant explain how it feels
All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal
Playing makebelieve pretending that Im true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and Ill always be here
Although I often reminisce I cant believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way til Im old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
I need love
Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle
Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
Ill give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl youre so sweet
Its deja vu whenever Im with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at Youre neither here or there
I swear I cant find you anywhere
Damn sure you aint in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and youll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run but they cant hide
And when I find you Im gon pour all my love inside
I need love
I need love
I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If youre not standing next to me youre on the phone
Cant you hear it in my voice I need love bad
Ive got money but loves something Ive never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man whos 10 feet tall
Id watch the sunrise in your eyes
Were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
Youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel
Its like a dream land I cant lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something Ill never forget
I need love
I need love
See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer
A playboy on the run I need something thats stronger
Friendship trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
Its taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand Ill be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine
If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man
Im not gonna leave it in destinys hands
I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
Ill search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl
I need love
I need love
Girl listen to me When I be sitting in my room all alone staring at the wall
Fantasies they go through my mind and Ive come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen Ill be waiting
I love you
