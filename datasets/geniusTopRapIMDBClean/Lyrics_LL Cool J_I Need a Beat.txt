I need a beat  I need a beat I need a beat 
I need a beat I need a beat 
If its a malleable beat subject of discussion
Youre motivated with the aid of percussion
Theres no category for this story
It will rock in any territory
I syncopate it and design it well
The beat elevates the scratch excels
All techniques are a combination
Of skills that I have for narration
I need a beat
Lacking a melody but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Drum track patterns are preset
Tomtoms snare hats bass and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic Im nimble
Basic patterns groups and chains
Sequence frequent seek and gain
Break
Break two
Im in the center of a musical scorcher
To some citizens its a form of torture
They hear me they fear me my funky poetry
Im improvin the conditions of the rap industry
The beat expands to many foreign lands
Germany Italy France and Japan
Itll give you a lift no need to sniff
No buts no hows no whys or ifs
Its you I defeated theyll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it
Rap firepower a musical shower
A picture of me on the Eiffel Tower


I need a beat
During this journey Im your escort
Youre bein protected by a musical fort
Im infiltrating your eardrums
Increasing their rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya thats all you need to know
I Need a Beat is the title of the show
Providing you with pleasure of the musical measures
All arranged to alleviate pressure
Im your vocalist your party therapist
Beat programmer and lyricist
Ladies Love Cool J studio user
A million or more screamin people abuser
I predict this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music
Paparazzi wealth and fame
The total propulsion of my name
I need a beat
Computerize then the engineers eyes
Have to be very acute education level high
The product is mine beat under rhyme
The control boards part of the studio design
Track after track culminating on wax
The tape has slack rewind spins back
Expensive but useful the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MCs to duel  duel duel duel 
I need a beat
Farmers Boulevard
Hot as Queens
