LOD
Keith Murray
Def Squad  Def Squad 
Mister Mister Mister Mister Smith
You want a hit
Ugh 
Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo
Im here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like Im on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip  Drip 
Fuck all that sensuous shit  Drip 
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If your if was a spliff wed be all fucked up  Word up 
No need to ask you Who is he Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities
Chicago LA any of em  Ill have to Norman Bate you  Yeah 
I love ta hate you cause yous a freak by nature
Cant wait to face ya mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight with no chaser  Word up 
My verbal combats like a miniMac to your back  Uhhuh 
As soon as one of you niggas try to overreact  Blaow 
The LOD love good confrontation or vamp  Word up 
Break your concentration murder your camp  Haha 
For the jealous overzealous we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis  Bombombom bombombom 
Niggas coming through and acting wild  Word 
Yall commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya
I conversate with many men  What  its time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew ayo you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Secret society trying to keep they eye on me  Nah nah 
But Ima stay incogni in places they cant find me
Make my moves strategically the GOD
Its sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real  What 
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin title read
You get backslapped so hard make ya nose bleed  Ahh 
Some def kids feeling guilty bout the space shit
The truth hurts baby girl so just face it  Alright 
But anyway back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing  Kid 
Everything is real not just a song that we sing  Word up 
From my life to the paper  What  very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will SHINE  Shine baby shine shine yeah 
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me  What 
Without acknowledging this man as GOD
I shot your faggot ass
Ugh now who the fuck you think you talking to
I pay dues I spray crews
Look Im Joey Crack motherfuckers be like Hes bad news
Runnin this racket from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
Id rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitchass niggas know we stronger than these weaklings
Seeking for respect that aint there
Knuckleheads beware theres mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulette this mans wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razorwhich I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spat out at any adult that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebodys getting lucci thats not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack aka Keyser Sze
What the deal pop Ugh
Thug niggas give they minks to chinks tore down
We sip drinks rockin minks flashin rings and things  On the real 
Frontin hardcore deep inside the Jeep mackin
Doin my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king  Ugh 
Bitches grab ya tatas get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers  Ugh 
Flossin rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats the ice rocks pussy bangin like Versace locs pops  So what the deal 
Wanna creep Open like raw asscheeks
Im sexin rawdog without protection disease infested ugh
Italiano got the Luccianno
I gets down fuckin with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo Im jingling baby  Ugh yeah yeah 
I got crazy Dominicans who pay me to lay low I play slow
Roll with The Firm Mafioso crime kingpin
It all real nigga what the deal I shot ya
What the fuck I thought I conquered the world
Crushed Moe Dee  Ugh  Hammer and IceTs girls
But still niggas want to instigate shit
Ill battle any nigga in the rap game quick
Name the spot I make it hot for you bitches
Female rappers too I dont give a fuck boo
Word Im here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared Im detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be the bait
Niggas fight Glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MCs that fuck with LL they gets bucked
Thats real whats up with that I Shot Ya deal
Light shit niggas slip now how the bullet feel
New Yorkll peel in LA they gangbang
But if you touch a mic your motherfuckin ass hang
Thats facts niggas dont receive no type of slack
Cause if they do  Ugh  they ass is always runnin back  Yeah 
Not this time but next time Ima name names
LL shitting from on top of the game
