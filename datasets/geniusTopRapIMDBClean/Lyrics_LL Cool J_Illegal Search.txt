Illegal search do you wanna see it

Illegal Illegal search do you wanna see it
Im gonna do it Im gonna do it

What the hell are you lookin for
Cant a young man make money anymore
Wear my jewels and like freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure Im poor
Cant my car look better than yours
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
Im not a dog so damn it put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case
Youre just a joker perpetratin the ace
You got time you wanna give me a taste
I dont smoke cigarettes so why youre lookin for base
You might plant a gun and hope I run a race
Eatin in the mess hall sayin my grace
You tried to frame me but it wont work

Slam me on the hood yo that aint right
