Calling all cars calling all cars
Be on the lookout for a tall lightskinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol sweatsuit gold chain and sneakers
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east
Alias LL Cool J Hes bad
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
Ill take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso Im a MC cop
Make you say Go LL and do the Wop
If you think you can outrhyme me yeah boy I bet
Cause I aint met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter Im better my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says I wish you would
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over you know Imma win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid dont play
Slaughter competition thats my hobby and job
I dont wear a disguise because I dont owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock I think my phone is tapped
Im bad
Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J
Im like Tyson icin Im a soldier at war
Im makin sure you dont try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes been rappin for ten years and
Even when Im bragging Im bein sincere
Emcees cant win I make em rust like tin
They call me Jaws my hat is like a sharks fin
Because Im bad as can be got my voice on wax
Some brothers think hes making records now he must have relaxed
I couldnt I shouldnt and itll stay that way
The best rapper youve heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze take a look at what Ive done
Used to rock in my basement now Im number one
And can happen on time never standin on line
You wanna try me First you better learn how to rhyme
Im the pinnacle that means I reign supreme
And Im notorious Ill crush you like a jellybean
Im bad
Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group Bobcat E Love and the Cut Creator They are extremely bad so keep your eyes open Use extreme caution
I eliminate punks cut em up in chunks
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk
Im devastating Im so good its a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
Im as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what Im doing plus Im paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai but bustin out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MCs wish that Id die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad just provin Im bad
You want a hit Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
MCs retreat cause they know I can beat em
And eat em in a battle and the ref wont cheat em
Im the baddest Takin out all rookies
So forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies Im bad
Cool J Cool JCool JCool J Cool JCool J
Never ever no never
Never wearin no Levis battle me why try
Ill treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye
Slaughterin MCs and Imma never get whipped
When I retire Ill get worshipped like a old battleship
LL Im bad all the rappers know
When I enter the center they say Yo yo there he go
My paychecks large Mr Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd teachin how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod
Youre a novice Im noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Attila the Hun nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grabbag
No good scavenger catfish vulture
My tongues a chisel and this compositions sculpture Im bad
Think Im gonna need backup 
Think Im gonna need backup 
Gimme that walkietalkie
Yo this is LL Cool J
And youll never catch me so dont even try it
Cause Im too bad for ya understand
Aaaaaahhhh Im bad
