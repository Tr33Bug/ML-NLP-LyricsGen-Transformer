Youre the type of guy that cant control your girl
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls

And gets the seven digits you know the routine
Youre the type of guy that tells her Stay inside

And lick you in the places that your boyfriend dont
Youre the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Not knowin that your main girls bitin my chunk
