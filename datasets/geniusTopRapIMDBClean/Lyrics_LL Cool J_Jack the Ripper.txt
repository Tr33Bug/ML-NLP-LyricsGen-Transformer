Milky and Im back
My ace in the hole was this brand new track
Imma slow it up and speed it up and now youre gonna eat it up
Listen to the funky beat my tongue is gonna beat it up
I did it but the devil didnt make me
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me
Proving a point that Im a serious joint
You can roll me up and puff me and then Ill anoint
Your head with oillots of oil
Make it run like water watch it boil
Cause I made em play it made em say it
Made em okay it made em obey itHUH
Prince of the growl is on the prowl
How You Like Me Now punk You living foul
Heres what my game is kill is what my aim is
A washed up rapper needs a wash up my name is
Jack the Ripper
JackJackJack the Ripper
JackJack JackJack JackJack Jack the Ripper

Back for the payback I must say that
I heard your new jam I dont play that
It aint loud enough punk it aint hitting
This year you tried next year youre quitting
Last year you thought I was dying out
But again and again and again without a doubt
Its the gangster boogie the earthquake sound
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around
I do it up rough tough I dont bluff
And this is an example of funky stuff
When you wanna make hits you make em like this
They aint like this they dont hit they miss
Its a strong record a record for the strong
For those who appreciate real rap songs
Listen how I wont allow myself to go off track
Stay back I got the power Im
Jack the Ripper
JackJackJack the Ripper
JackJack JackJack JackJack Jack the Ripper
King Hercules 
Jack the Ripper a man not a myth
Aka James Todd Smith
Hard like penitentiary steel
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal
Homegirls in the house cmon
Homegirls in the house give it up
You gotta want to get hotter
Moving and grooving and always improving a lota
People dont know how nice I am
He was sleeping so now I gotta slice my man
Like ham in a pan wrap him up in Saran
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van
While youre doing your dance I want you to make moves
No one out there thought you could do
You know my name and my game and what Im here to do
Party people lemme see if you can dance to
Jack the Ripper
JackJackJack the Ripper
JackJack JackJack JackJack Jack the Ripper
King Hercules 
Break it down x3
Yo Bob show that old school sucker punk what real hip hop is boy
How Ya Like Me Now Im getting busier
Im double platinum Im watching you get dizzier
Check out the way I say my display my fame my
J on the back behind the Cool without the AY
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth
It makes me move and Ill improve
As it goes on as it flows on
When you see me dont ask if the shows on
How that sound Dont came around playing me close brown
Pull on my jock to be down
You need to stay down way down because youre low down
Do that dance the prince of rap is gonna throw down
Aiming to please while Im killing emcees
Im gonna keep on hitting you with rough LPs
Day after day after day
Youre smacked in the face by the bass of Cool J
Im
Jack the Ripper The baddest around
Im a beast on the microphone a night stalker
A killing machine a savage street talker
Jason with an axe but I put it on wax
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed
The prince of Hip Hop straight from Queens
Kicking it mean keeping it clean
And youve never seen anybody rock the party
All you funky beataholics this beats Bacardi
I go to the show and terrorize emcees dont you know
Moving my hand like Im playing the piano
Dont touch the dial dont change the channel
Dont let me hear you say I aint debonair
Im better than any emcee out there
As a matter of fact suckers cant compare
When Im rocking the mic people stop and stare at
