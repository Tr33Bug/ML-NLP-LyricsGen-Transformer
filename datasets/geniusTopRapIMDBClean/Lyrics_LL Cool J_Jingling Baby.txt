Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
They call me Uncle L Future of the Funk
Records I recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
While I slam dunk dicks and make em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like its chicken feed
Check out the  pick of the litter not a quitter Im nice yall
And Ima dust you off and dust you off twice
You neer heard this so observant all hysterical fan
natics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent dominant McCoy and Im Real
If youre another brothers fan Forget how you feel
Cause hes soso I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dog now put your ass in the clink
Innovating devastating and dope on the single now
Let me see your earrings jingle
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
I chopped you chewed you baked you and screwed you
That shit you pop you need to stop youre kind of rude you
No good nincompoop tryin to base
How we livin homes Get out my face
Im complete in effect and I cant fall
I rise suprise and I advise you all
To stand back and peep dont sleep or doubt
My skillll get ill I turn the mother out
Im topnotch youre still playin hopscotch
Now Ima do ya while the party people watch
Youre real funny you really try to go for yours
But I know why you aint had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This aint a game yo you know my name
Forget all the MCs who like to mingle
Yo baby let me see your earrings jingle
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
When you first walked in I aint know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your shit dont stink
And tried to run down that I cant get over that
Shit you were sayin  you call that a battle rap
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun
Im Cool J yo you dont understand son
Im a legend on top of that Im livin
Now you look stupid like that bitch Ms Givens
Whoever geesed you up nah how should I say it
Whoever set you up they knew just how to play it
Cause man YO I feel for you brother

Takin out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rollin over niggas like a redneck trucker
Innovatin devastatin and dope on a single now

Cant believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grips too weak you cant hold it B
You can dream of makin progress and gettin this nice
But when I roll up its like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs I never swerve Im superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand lost track of your plan
When I show up I blow up end of story my man
Im a play you like a poker chip thats what you get
I bet your fret sweat and regret you met
The titan of fightin excitin when writin you triflin toyboy
I gotta enlighten so start bitin
You know you cant create and get mean like this
When Im on the court G its strictly SWISSSSHHHH
When its all over said and done my friend
They say That bad motherfucker just scored again
So take a step back give me some room to wreck shop
Heres your token back youre gettin off at the next stop
Ima deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxin niggas
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
Theyre jingling baby  Go head baby
