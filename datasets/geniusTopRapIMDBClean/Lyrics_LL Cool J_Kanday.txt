I met this new girl with big juicy lips
And nice round hips I mean her bodys a trip
And when I go over her house you know what I like
The way she tells me take it off and never says syke
Yo Im never in need shes feedin my greed
She never waits for me to ask she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday shes dandier than Dandy Don
Youre mad and Im happy that she put me on
Ill never leave her for nothin only a crazy man would
Thats why I had to tell ya that
I feel good  about Kanday
Now and Laters gum drops jelly beans
Brothers beg for the leg shes on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked everytime I stick it thats right
When were alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo she blows me kisses she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
Shes clever in bed she uses her head
Shes the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night the chicks outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I dont use a light
Man shes juicy like a berry chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if its good and Ill have to say very
Wouldnt leave her for nothin only a crazy man would
Thats why I had to tell ya that
I feel good  about Kanday
Im feelin gooder than good if you wouldnt I would
If you could I know you could shes kickin back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know cough dont rhyme with boss but she made me her boss
Shes the talk of my room whenever Im in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her bodys bad the girls built skin like silk
Wet steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
Shes all the way live keeps me satisfied
I dont go outside I like to stay inside
Her ways are like an angel with bright white wings
And Im crazy bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldnt leave her for nothin only a crazy man would
Thats why I had to tell ya that
I feel good  about Kanday
Ooh you couldnt imagine Im lickin my lips
If she was tea Id take a sip when Im in gym I do flips
Im in love with the pizznoot its proper as hell
Im hittin harder than hard always makin her yell
Shes cooler than an iceberg word to the mother
In the house down the steps and under the covers
Right away no sation or frontin or playin
Or delayin Im never steppin off Im always stayin
Her mother knows me well father hates my guts
He dont know when were alone shes always feelin on my niggyniggynuts
For a snack cornflakes crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man oh man damn you cant and I can
Last time I saw her exman I had to shake homeboys hand
I said what up he said what up I took your girl so what up
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl but they must be insane
Michael Spellings on my side and big Chuck agrees
Shes my private freaky deak my own personal skeez
Wouldnt leave her for nothin only a crazy man would
Thats why I had to tell ya that  I  feel  good 
I feel good  about Kanday
