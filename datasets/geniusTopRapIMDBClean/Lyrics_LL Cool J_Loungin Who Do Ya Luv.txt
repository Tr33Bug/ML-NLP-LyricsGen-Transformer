Loungin  Who Do Ya Luv  Lyrics
Umm Go head daddy
Its a Queens thing baby 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you
Uh uh Trackmasters rock on 
Who do you love 
We doing it with L hahahaha
Who do you love 
Baby Chris rock on  uh
Who do you love Are you for sure 
Who do ya love baby
The remix 
How you doin miss My name is L Im from Queens
I heard about your man he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin like a Willie cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone with your old peeps dyin to creep tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete uh
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Jewels and Cristal got him actin funny style
He aint watchin you he rather watch his money pile
Cant protect treasures when its in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner Ima turn that ass out
Full blown frontin in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B why you leave your honey all alone with me
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesnt mean your honey wont let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you socalled players never dreamed of
You got to try love cant buy love
If you play your hand then its byebye love


Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love Are you for sure  You know its you 
Who do you love Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
So what you got the cash flow in escrow damn
But your honey ran away like presto alakazam
Man made the money money never made the man
You still fakin jacks throwin rocks on her hand
See you put your mack down now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your caps polar
I got her smokin beedies modelin bikinis
Pushin your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy I make it burn when its my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Dont get it twisted gettin money aint wrong
But she wanna make love all night long Im gone
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love  I wanna lounge with you 
Are you for sure  I do what I gotta do 
Who do you love Are you for sure  You know its you 
Who do you love Are you for sure  Are you for sure 
Who do you love Can I lounge with you
Word is bond Trackmasters rock on 
I wanna lounge with you
Who do you love  Baby Chris rock on 
Can I lounge with you
Uncle L rock on  I wanna lounge with you
Who do you love  Cream T rock on 
Can I lounge with you  Will rock on 
I wanna lounge with you
Who do you love Can I lounge with you
