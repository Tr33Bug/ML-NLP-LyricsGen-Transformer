Cmon man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word  But tonight 
Dont call it a comeback I been here for years
Im rocking my peers putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions overpowering
Over the competition Im towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics thatll make you call the cops
Dont you dare stare you better move
Dont ever compare
Me to the rest thatll all get sliced and diced
Competitions paying the price
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Dont you call this a regular jam
Im gonna rock this land
Im gonna take this ittybitty world by storm
And Im just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr Smith dont riff
Listen to my gear shift
Im blasting outlasting
Kinda like Shaft so you could say Im shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme


Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh  breakdown
Gangster boogie gangster boogie
Gangster boogie gangster boogie
Gangster boogie gangster boogie  Yeah 
Gangster boogie gangster boogie  Yeah 
Gangster boogie gangster boogie
Gangster boogie gangster boogie
Gangster boogie gangster boogie  Uh 
Gangster boogie gangster boogie  Huh 
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh I just dont know
What made you forget that I was raw
But now I got a new tour
Im going insane
Starting the hurricane releasing pain
Letting you know that you cant gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping killing digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol gold
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour tower of power
Ill devour
Im gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that Im not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage uh damage uh
Damage uh damage
Destruction terror and mayhem
Pass me a sissysoft sucka Ill slay him
Farmers  What  Farmers  What 
Im ready  We ready 
I think Im gonna bomb a town  Get down 
Dont you never ever pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh 
Im gonna knock you out  Huh 
Mama said knock you out  Huh
