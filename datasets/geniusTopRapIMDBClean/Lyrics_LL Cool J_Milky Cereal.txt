Ooh yeah

Aint nothin like a nice bowl of Corn Flakes in the morning to smooth you out
Milky cereal  Baby 
Milky cereal
Milky cereal  Baby 
Milky cereal
Mirror mirror on the wall
Whos the baddest female of them all
It was Frosted Flake she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female very debonair
Drivin a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin out pumpin the stereo
She took me to a club I think the name was Cheerios
She walked like she was jumpin a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles
A guy walked over said Your earrings cute
I said Im wearin a earring but it aint no Fruit Loop
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin bugged and I aint know what to think
She ordered potassium calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib threw me on the couch
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth shes
Milky cereal  Baby 
Milky cereal
Milky cereal  Baby 
Milky cereal
Milky cereal  Baby

I went to Vegas didnt think itd do any harm
I bumped into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason we walked in the rain
She had a fourleaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories for real
And I was in the mood for a homecooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet cause her corn pops was home
Kissed her neck kissed her back kissed her arms
I said Forget it let me see your Lucky Charms
When we began her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
Talked about marriage I said Thats risky
Besides its such a waste of Rice Krispies
She had a robe with the velour material
Her pops woke up I said Hello Mr Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper
He said Stop frontin I know you caught the vapors
Thats my daughter so save your croonin
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in
Milky cereal  You know what Im sayin

Then there was Pebbles times was rough
She was turnin tricks to get a Cocoa Puff
Her mind was gone but she turned me on in fact
She was wearin an Apple Jack hat
With a fulllink fox and some pink bobbysocks
Her father had a greedy disease fried chicken pox
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like Tyson and he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his Captain Crunch
The waiter said Jack what would you like today
He said I dont know just make it special kay
He said Cool came back with the order
Thats when I said Hey yo Jack I like your daughter
He said Pebbles Boy are you crazy
I said Nah I wanna ride in a Mercedes
She could sing while Im swingin my thing
Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King
He said Go party Do some minglin
You and my daughter Your brain must be jinglin
I said Its smooth no disrespect
Shell sign a prenup so she dont get half of my week check
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  You know what Im sayin
