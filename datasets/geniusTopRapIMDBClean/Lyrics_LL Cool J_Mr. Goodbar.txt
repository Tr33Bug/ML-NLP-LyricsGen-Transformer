Mr Goodbar Lyrics
Nah yall nah yall uhuh I aint disrespectin though
Im just sayin it happened to me it can happen to him
How you doin
Whats your name
Uh mm haha
Oh you his girl
Hello my name is Mr Goodbar I came to offer champagne
Later on maybe Ill tell you my real name
But for now sip your drink and be merry
And be a nice girl and save me a cherry
Me Ill have a Kahla and milk
Cause champagne always stains my silk
You got a man Thats somethin we wont talk about
Hes smart enough to have ya but dumb enough to let ya out
I like your Fendi bag your alligator shoes
Your hairstyle and your whole point of view
The way you lick your lips and stare
You tell me thats a habit mhm yeah
Honeycoated legs with not one scar
The stylish wardrobe is up to par
Heres my number call me in my car
You deserve a visit from Mr Goodbar
So how long you been talkin to him Word
Nah he cool with me hes cool with me
Oh he loves you
Honey open up a bottle of brandy
Better yet have a piece of Cool J candy
And sweat the man with the masterdisaster
Breakyalikeplaster plan and
The cards on the table and the deal is dealt  Uh 
Im in the mood for a tuna melt
And I cant make you I sure wouldnt rape you
Feelin kinda mellow and I sure would hate to
Leave the job halfdone  Nah 
Cause at a time like this youre the one that Im lookin for
Crawlin on the floor  Woof 
Im comin back for more
If the Mona Lisas name was Teresa
Id get a piece of the Mona Lisa
Then smoke a cigar
You deserve a visit from Mr Goodbar
Yeah so you be callin on the request line Hahaha
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh hes my man word him too
Yeah I like Bobby Brown
Im tellin you hes cool but


Dont be cruel cause youll be on your own
Its my prerogative and my microphone
Come and get this ice cream cone
Or Ill deliver it when your daddy aint home
Grown and healthy thats how I like em
Big juicy legs and a nice pair of kegs  Mm 
Mr Goodbar style
You havent met a guy like me in a while
I jump out a cake dance play shake
I aint got no Body by Jake
Smooth as White Star Extra Dry Mot Chandon
And Ill slip it in your mouth like a Bonbon
You know what Im sayin baby
Im Mr Goodbar  Goodbar  yeah
So you know next time uh your mans out
Check the lobby
Nah nah hes cool
Who my girl Oh I dont know your man might be with her
You know what Im sayin But Im with you
Yeah Mr Goodbar baby uh
And may I say may I say
That outfit you got on is slammin
Juicy lips so honey coated mm
Yo he never says that to you
He never gives you compliments
Yo he be givin you flowers baby
And tellin you how much he cares for you
Does he hold you and caress you and give you affection
I didnt think so
