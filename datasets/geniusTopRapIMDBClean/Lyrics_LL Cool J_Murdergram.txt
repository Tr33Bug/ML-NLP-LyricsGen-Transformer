Ayo dont go near the speakers
The big showdown the display of skill
Im that type of guy so put your girl on the pill
Take a family snapshot and kiss your wife
Cause Im like a knife I cause grief and strife
And Ill take your life and choke you like a python
Ima do you wrong
Any emcee who you wanna name
Im one panther that cant be tamed
You talk about guns punk it dont alarm me
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army
I cant hold back the way that I feel
Cause when I bust a rhyme its like youre slipping on banana peels
Youre like fruitcake and fruit cocktails
First your title now Im takin your female
All of a sudden youre so proud and Black
A baseball hat but you aint saying jack
The ripper is back and you cant escape
Cause one of my recordsll sell more than your whole tape
I want beef bring on the rookies
I got more than just Cool J cookies
Rip rock crush stomp the comp
Im poison come and take a chomp
I bet you your teethll end up around the corner kid
Dont ask me why I did uncivilized damage to a nobody
And Im carrying a gun if Im rhymin at the party
New York Chicago Detroit LA
Ill slay wherever you play
DC or Philly or Baltimore
I murder the rich and maim the poor
Perpetratin in your video heres the real schoolin
Country accents who you think youre foolin
I play Russian Roulette not Craps
Youre only known cause of Yo MTV Raps
And Rap City and BET
And Channel 31 but now here I come
To save the day and now youre getting done
Like a hooker dont drop the soap crumb
The first sign of the battle you little fink
Is you see blood coming out your kitchen sink
Your mics a baby bottle son
Some say they aint but I am the one
To slice and dice and fry and boil to bake and serve a nerd
I heard a word occurred to him that he could move and wouldnt get moved on
Like a shotgun blast
Big mouth emcees Ill bet you none last
Cause they aint stable or able
And I boost the party like jumper cables
So plug me in and put me on
Arsenio Hall so I can battle em all
From coast to coast blind crippled or crazy
You use a dictionary but you still dont phase me
Listen and weep you sound cheap
You preach about Blackness but you represent wackness
Youre knocking on the castle door
But when you fall in the moat I wont see you no more
Lets get together and diss LL
Use his name and your records might sell
I cant believe your band of dead maggots
Crawling all over my name I wont have it
You better look in the mirror and rethink your plan
Why walk in quicksand
When you can stand on your own two feet
Im rippin emcees from Funky Drummer to Big Beat
Name the date and the arena
You three year old ballerina
I cant believe that suckers try to throw down
Whether youre new or older than Motown
Just kick back I dont slack attack a wack and slap a rap
They cant handle the format
Whether youre suave or smooth
Rough or rugged all I need is a groove
I display a way to slay punk play to pay
Mr Morris has entered the buffet
Some of yall are sitting in bowls
Plates of the hot buttered rolls
Beat you with baloney stab you with salami
Cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami
Then I make you wonder
Why you dont hear bass but you feel the thunder
You get kuff Ill knock out your tooth
Well be fighting from the lobby to the roof
You annoy me like a roach at dinner time
Yo Marley  Whats up  Its Miller time
Nah man just kick a little more
Pass the brass knuckles let me break his jaw
When Im on the microphone I want silence
Let KRSOne stop the violence
Aint no rivals aint no competition
Punk Im beatin you into submission
Im gettin busier than ever before
Never more will I slack Ima keep it real raw
Eat you up like a packjam
Videos more popular than Batman
Rippin you to shreds tap you in the head
Then leave the battle lookin happy as a newlywed
Give me a TEC9 to spray
Save the beef and put it on layaway
Im in command your man abandoned slammin jammin fans will understand
Then you weep about the murdergram
