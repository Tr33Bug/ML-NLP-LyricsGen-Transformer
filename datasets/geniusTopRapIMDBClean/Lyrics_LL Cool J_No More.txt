We need to have a conversation
I made you why would I play you
Trade home base for a California angel
Swing at a fast bitch foul out betray you
When I wont even wanna hit it in a day or two
Straight home Id run well thats debatable
I cant front I hit a slump all players do
But tough times are minor to a major dude
We all lose sometimes I call it paying dues
Now youre searching other clubs for whats available
A year ago my slot was unassailable
My feast is a famine without you to cater to
If these walls could talk what would they say to you
Dont understand what were going though
But its like you dont know me
And I dont know you no more
Not no more
And its like damn how the hell we get here
No idea but were not what we were before
Could it be that I dont love you
And you dont love me no more
That girl dont live here not no more
Yeah yeah yeah that girl no more
The dining room has an empty chair
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair
House full of company but no ones here
Were saying cheers while were holding back tears
To keep up appearances in front of our peers
We play holiday card tricks every year
Black jack poker make the joker disappear
The ace cant breathe when theres tension in the air
Three clubs in one night but nobody cares
Cause its still not a full house without a pair
You tipped your hand but the text wasnt clear
Youre dealing from the bottom queen of hearts play fair
Slip in the door you hold my hopes so
All I hear is love dont live here anymore
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold
Were sitting on a fence so where you wanna go
Youre the architect of your life its your show
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow
Before you burn the house down think take it slow
Even arsonists needs shelter let me know
