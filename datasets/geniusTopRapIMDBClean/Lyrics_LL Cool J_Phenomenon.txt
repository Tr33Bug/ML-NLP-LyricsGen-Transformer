Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he dont live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love
She gets the paper when its time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click feel it in their throats
No joke all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up outta there push eject
Tasters Choice have her nice and moist
Or play paper games and floss the Rolls Royce

A brand new year me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin night to morn
Bonin in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion with the lake in back
Got it all figured out mami I like that
Collect chips cop hisandher whips
To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But youre worth it playgirl its real in the field
Say what you want but keep your lips sealed
