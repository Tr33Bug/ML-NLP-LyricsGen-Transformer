The act of makin love is
Pink cookies in a plastic bag gettin crushed by buildings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag gettin crushed by buildings
Ill take thirty electric chairs and put em in a classroom
Thirty MCs and set em free from their doom
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind when we begin
The wheel of fortune it spins
Holdin the rhythm like elastic moldin
Your whole body like plastic
So why try to deny what you already know ya love
Up above
Cause the mania hysteria in the streets
While ya lovers gettin merrier in the sheets
I met this lady named sweet young thing and
She gave me that feelin that sunshine bring in
Hoardable sportable totally affordable
Silky smooth voice was real audible
I said your cool as Ice Cubea
She said youre that Public Enemy I seen on the tubea
Nah Im like your Uncle baby
The style of your beautiful face drives me crazy
Well can we do ya so Heavy Im D
She said You tried to play me like Big Daddy
I said I know your Tribe I Called and reQuested
For you to be manifested
She said You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too
I said You only knew the certain things I wanna do do you
Rub ya down with warm IceT
Make ya feel Brand Nubian instantly
Boogie Down and check this Production
Gimme them lips they look good for suction
She said Sweet Tees cool with a little almond joy
On the side just doin the fly
You like pound cake Come to my house
Turn on the lights and see me on the couch
I said Youre jinglin youre from around the way
I like your earrings two Ls but anyway
Your granddaddy is here to spread cheer
Somethin nice and smooth with my tongue in your ear
Give me a snack some salt and pepper on a burger
Ice Cream Tea or if you prefer the
Taste of honey Kid ride in my Capri and
Thats the joint they got the real clear CD in
She said Stars couldnt get me in a car
I dont know what type of man ya are
You might know karate do me and get away
I got a glimpse of your license plate NWA
