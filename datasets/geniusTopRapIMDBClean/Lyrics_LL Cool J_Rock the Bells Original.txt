Rock the Bells  Original  LyricsRumor has it that youre tired of my scratchin and drums
And of couse I wanna expand to the maximum
So I injected one more element to that of LL
Came up with something funky called Rock the Bells
During this episode vocally I explode
My title is the king of the FM mode
SeeMy volume expands to consume
And my structures emote a lyrical heirloom
Vocally pulsating I initiate gyrating
Ya must respond to my bells theres no waiting
For the duration theres no articulation
Receiving ovation for the bell association
The vocalization techniques I employ
The voice of my shadow could dust a toy boy
The injection of bells into this beat
The result enough energy to amputate your feet
Greater insulator microphone dominator
My name is Cool J manipulator innovator
Connoisseur Im sure my percussion will excite
These bells are gonna rock all night
Rock the bells
The bells make your energy escalate
A sort of musical fury LL might detonate
Subject matter entitled The Bells
The lyrical arrangement is by LL
My program strains the tympanic membrane
Ive been ordained the BLZ Ill flame
Paragraphs I concoct Cut Creators like an organist
Cool J exists as a journalist
I illuminate over any number on the Richter
My throat contracts like a boa constrictor
Youre totally engulfed by the structure and the format
Its not dormant it goes to the cornerman
As you repent youll say I win
To torture individuals for exitement
Ambassador the Thane of Cawdor
Dialect so def itll rip up the floor
Ignite and excite with verbal extensions
What Ill mention will put you on pension
Makin you tremble nothin resemble
The bells and if it does
Ill disassemble
Hit if you bit
I go have a fit
The master impresario of lyrical wit
A hiphop creature concert feature
Amateur teacher my rhymes reach ya
When I commence with excellence
It eradicates levels of pestilence
Upon a plateau
No mortal can go
Mythological characters stand below
Rock the bells
A Bboy symphony complete with bells
No classical fanatic is parallel
From the design of my lyrics many people call me
An immortalized Bboy prodigy
Eeee a misdemeanor cleaner women I subpoena
No conjecture in my lecture name and adversary Gina
Promoter my tune revolves like rotor
Whilst I decodea the cranium of Yoda
Rehearsing steadily growing I sing tweeters midrange
And woofers need guarding
The bells rip your auditory canal
Plagiarism is suicide for then I shall
Be forced to assault
Opposition will halt
Upset you with words
Drink your blood like its a malt
Opposite of illusions
Evidently its true
The beat metabolism supposed to accelerate you
Hallucinating severe convulsion
Your equilibrium is took from my propolsion
I came here tonight to rock
These bells will never stop
Rock the Bells
Ya livin on my live side
Autographs I sign
Inferior fanrecorder of my rhyme
Perfect spectator well Im the dominator
You reline and refine it and you save it for later
Swipe it as you type it
You recite it as you bite it
Then you claim it as your own to get them excited
About it as you shout it
You dont tell them how go it
And you repeat it and rock it
Multiply it divide it ya even sit inside it
Its LLs rhyme I know ya wanna bite it
You announce I pounce destroy annihilate
If you break youll be straight when I eliminate
You study like scholars even write em on your collars
Youll buy em and youll try even for a million dollars
I get like a leopard attack ransack disturb cold crush
Use a line I make em hush
The lovers in the taker faker lovers of the Lakers simulator
Rap traitorl perfect perpetrator
To see ya as you bite the words
Youd think you never heard
The mic sings like a hummin bird
Rock the Bells
Jack the Ripper
King Hercules
Professor of Death in the Seven Seas
Grim reaper of rhyme
Holder of the rock
Eradicating suckers all around the clock
The supreme machine
A microphone dream
My revenge is brutal when you start to scheme
I mean youre my adversary I enjoy the few
The Peruvian rock cocaine or quaalude
The story the beginning of your death is heard
But your cries are ignored by the kind of word
Im the super insane murderer in the reign
Like a vampire goin for your jugular vein
Exterminating crews with my manuscript
And the best thing you wrote was a bunch of bullshit
The night of the nights
Youre my victim tonight
You aint nothin nobody so get outta any sight
Bein crushed by the source
Its reinforced  thoughts 
Now ya feel remorse cause ya know whos boss
LL Cool J is your undertaker
Def hitmaker plus a bonebreaker
Treble terminator bass mutilator
You can drop your drawers Im a rapper castrator
On the microphone you will never recoup
When Im finished with you boy youll be suckin on soup
Music virtuoso melodical employer
I knew you was a sucker first time I saw ya
Roll the red carpet royaltys arrived
Dont try to fight back cause you wont survive
So dont never ever in any kind of weather
Try to mess with the tall young legend in leather
LL servin em well
The beat elevates and the scratch excels
Rock the Bells
