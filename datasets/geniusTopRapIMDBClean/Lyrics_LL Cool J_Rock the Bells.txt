LL Cool J is hard as hell
Battle anybody I dont care who you tell
I excel they all fell
Im gonna crack shells DoubleL must rock the bells
Youve been waitin and debatin for oh so long
Just starvin like Marvin for a Cool J song
If you cried and thought I died you definitely was wrong
It took a thought plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with ELove down with the Cool J force
Specializin in the rhymin for the record of course
Im a tower full of power wind rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard just a blizzard who aint taken no crap
Im rhymin and designin with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin always stickin cause you like it that way
You think its fresh and plus its def because its by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader my righthand man
We rock the bells so very well cause thats the name of this jam
Rock the bells
Some girls will like this jam and some girls wont
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend dont
LL went to hell gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells

Rock the bells
The bells are circulatin like the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip  LLs your name 
Cut Creators  good  Cool J is  goodgood 
You bring the wood pecker Ill bring the wood
The bells are whippin and rippin at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J  It aint rock and roll 
Cause it aint the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
Im not a virgin so I know Ill make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way ever since
If their beats were made of meat then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells
So listen to the rhymes align the rhyme on time
Hell cut the record in a second make your DJ look blind
So all you Jheri Curl suckers wearin highheel boots
