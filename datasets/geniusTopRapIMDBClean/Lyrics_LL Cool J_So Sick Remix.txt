So Sick  Remix  Lyricsscratched To the beat yall
So so sick  TM 
Oh me  My name is L
First of all you a banger straight up and down
Im seein minks on your hangers
I know your momma told you dont talk to strangers
That leads to dangerous situations but I cant be patient
You need communication appreciation
Respect for your style instead of talkin all wild
One smile youre daydreamin of walkin the aisle
In the waterbed rollin around in a money pile
Baby my format is not to be a doormat
But I still pull your chair out at the table and all that
Touch your back softly whatever it cost me
Time money or energy you will remember me
Gotta change my answering machine now that Im alone
Cause right now it says that we cant come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense cause you walked out the door
But its the only way I hear your voice anymore
Its ridiculous  Its been months and for some reason I just
Cant get over us  And Im stronger than this
Enough is enough  No more walkin round with my head down
Im so over bein blue cryin over you and
Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio
Gotta fix that calender I have thats marked July 15th
Because since theres no more you theres no more anniversary
Im so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be thats the reason
Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio


Leave me alone  Leave me alone
Stupid love songs  Dont make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Im lettin go turnin off the radio
Imma keep you equipped in all of the best whips
Pay attention to detail even your lipstick
Give compliments when your pedicure switch
When we on the mattress you wont care if Im rich
Ill love you deeply whisper sweetly
Even when you critique me you can still reach me
Beats me why you sweeter than a peach be
One bites enough sugar for the whole night
Youll be aight you rollin with the Elvis of rap
Cmon move your pelvis and throw it back
I know its forward and it sounds a little blunt
But love money respect whatever pick what you want
Thats the reason
Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio
Said
Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio
And
Im so sick of love songs so tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio
Why cant I turn off the radio
