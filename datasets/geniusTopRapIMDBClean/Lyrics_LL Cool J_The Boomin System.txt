Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah aight but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh thatll work be funky you know what Im sayin
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  Funky 
Cars ride by  For all the cars out there and all the brothers 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  That like to front in they rides 
Cars ride by  Check it out 
You know its funky funky funky cause you heard it from here see
A jam that you love that dont be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when youre ridin around
Twelve oclock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hiphop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side people everywhere
The trunk full of amps there aint no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cause they dont understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
Its because I want attention when Im ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cause my systems fly
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  All up at dawn 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  Just frontin 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cause they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me dont drink and drive I say What is this
Mind your business
Then pass it around
Laid back hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While Im checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
Im frontin and I dont care if you know
The back seat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise its three oclock
The girlies they smile they see me comin
Im steady hummin I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud all the shorties be babblin
My righthand mans here without the swing
Every chance I get Im showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cause Im frontin in my ride and my word is bond


Cars ride by with the boomin systems  Frontin you know what I mean 
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by
Sunroof open so I can feel the wind blow
I dont give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means Im chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say I want bass
I want a hit I want a dose
Youre rollin up smilin but you cant come close
Cause my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane fight the power with PE
Tell the cops You gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin thatll break your trunk
And remember Uncle L is like the future of the funk
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  Yeah thats frontin 
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  You know what Im sayin 
Cars ride by  So next time youre in your ride pumpin it up 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  Just remember 
Cars ride by  Its cool 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by  Peace
