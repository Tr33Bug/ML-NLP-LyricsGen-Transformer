I know a fat girl she wears a orange skirt
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work
Shell take food stamps and a travelers cheque
Because her hair and her face and her lifes a wreck
She wears a bright blonde wig some high heeled pumps
Shes down in the dumps so shes sellin her rump
Shes a hot little momma and she works every day
If you wanna pay to play heres where she stays
Shes at the
Bristol Hotel  Room 515
The Bristol Hotel  Where that at  Jamaica Queens 
I seen her standin there slutty as could be
Offering the putty for a ittybitty fee
Every red light shell come over to your ride
Or shes standin in the doorway tellin you to come inside
The Bristol Hotel cause it aint no thing
And her meat tastes better than Burger King
Japanese executives in threepiece suits
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place
The girlies in the Bristol theyre all in cahoots
He fell asleep and got robbed and cold chumped his face at the
Bristol Hotel  Room 515
The Bristol Hotel  Where that at  Jamaica Queens 
Party people check the story cause the story is ill
Its the story of two men one Harold one Bill
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool
Never ever rush thats the golden rule
I been comin to the Bristols ten years of my life
Ayo what the hell Yo man thats my wife
The 
Bristol Hotel  Room 515
The Bristol Hotel  Where that at  Jamaica Queens 
You see a Bristol girl is a one of a kind
And if you know her good enough she wont make you stand on line
Shell let you inside make you pay for the ride
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died
You say What the heck because you already paid
Not knowin that the guy that went before you had AIDS
Bang bang boogie she was so amusin
Next week youre at the clinic gettin blood transfusions
At the
Bristol Hotel  Room 515
The Bristol Hotel  Where that at  Jamaica Queens 
The Bristol Hotel 
The Bristol Hotel 
The Bristol Hotel 
The Bristol Hotel 
The Bristol Hotel 
The Bristol Hotel
