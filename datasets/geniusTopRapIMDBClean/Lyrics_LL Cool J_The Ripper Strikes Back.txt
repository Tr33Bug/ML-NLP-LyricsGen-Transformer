Haha
A lil hip hop thats all
Relax hold on to ya seats
Haha Uhhuh
Oh yeah this is the Tunnel banger too
Word up this the Tunnel banger baby
Hiphop style baby yall remember
By the middle of March when the pregnancy starts
In your ladies placenta that means L just entered
Ducttaped your little bitchass for fronting
Your foureleven crackhead ass aint hurting nothing
Nigga you want the fame
Now youre famous overnight  Ugh 
Famous for getting fucked by a stick of dynamite
Youre weak nigga You bout to die up in your sleep
The overlord of rap will never meet defeat
Pain to agony I dont touch them zones
Fuck your epileptic lyrical methods Its my throne
Blast your fiftypound ass and make you float
You read it shook nigga I wrote the book nigga
Held down my crown for a decade and a half  half 
Now Im bout to give your grimy ass a bloodbath
Talking bout being broke Nigga Im rich
Cause I learned to separate the money from the bitch  bitch 
Dont hate me cause Im paid
Hate me cause Im everything you want to be
Handsome young plus legendary
Talking bout Farrakhan
Nigga you better call Jesse Jackson for some affirmative action
CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can 
Ugh
Dont ever open your mouth and mention my seed
Talking bout my book you bought to read
You know you watch my sitcom nigga so stop that
Mad rapper but now you turned mad actor  hahahaha 
Fortynine pounds and tryin to be a mobster
Run around town with the Bob Marley impostors
Ask Canibus he aint understanding this
Cause ninetynine percent of his fans dont exist
Im going underground and blowing your rep down
Next time save that shit for the Lyricist Lounge
Or a house party where you can battle some clown
On top of all that I beat your homeless ass down
Heard that convicted rapist on the record too  uhhuh 
Fresh out of jail asscheeks still black and blue  uhhuh ooooh 
Tell me bout the things EarBiter taught you
How to bust a nut or two  Yeah thats butter boo 
You be decomposing but you frozen because my titles golden
Steady rolling in a world that Im controlling
Vanguard Awards are for kings who did tours
Climbed Platinum Mountain so pray to the Lords
Talking bout my first and second and thirdborn
Now I got a fourth Canibus but he cut off
From the riches of my empire Im like a pimp
Who thought he had to retire but found a new CanIPuss to hire
Youre hardcore in a sense like Heather Hunter  huh 
But definitely not with the lyrics that drop thunder
Found you in a trash can
Hot black cause you scared to bust
Nigga in Todd we trust


CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can 
CanIBus  Yes you can

LL Cool J is hard as HELL
You soft as a newborn baby taking a nap
Made my dick hard with that bitchass track
Where you at Smoking in some oneroom flat
Sucking on Clefs dick hoping to come back
Never that Nigga my styles is unlimited
Yours is prohibited of course thats attributed
To not knowin ya limits and who you need to test
When you  Step into the house of the Lord and get blessed
Get on your knees bow down to my decrees
Young slacker save that demo for Jack the Rapper  yeah

Imma tear the skin off your ass with ten knuckles
Rhymes was weak
They made me chuckle like a namebuckle  haha 
You call em lyrics nigga you need to stop  stop 
You going out Ahh fuck it You going pop
I feed you a poisonous verse so dont try it
No more rhyming you on a lyricfast diet
Call the paramedic and tell them that hes pathetic
His lyrics aint energetic youre sweet as a diabetic
Career be over next year yeah I said it
Look over your shoulder nigga Thats where you headed
MOTHERFUCKER Wheres a rhyme when you need it
First rule of lyrical war Never repeat it
You said that same bullshit at House of Blues
Lit the pipe dropped the match and sparked the wrong fuse
Not new Yeah nigga Im goin at you
Stop basing and you can be a role model too  coughs 
Diss my moms Whos the real rap don
Who ruled for fifteen years and dropped bombs
Whos copped solid gold Grammys and stayed calm
LL While you dropped verses at niggas proms
FAGGOT You better battle Number Two
Cause Number One got his title locked down son
The king of all rappers to ever grace the stage
Or the mic Best that ever did it Im wicked
Write a verse and flip it melt it down to liquid
And drown shorty fill his lungs until I rip it
Chest busts open heart bursts its smoking
You see that nigga son  Damn L we was only joking 
Maneuver manipulate brainwaves transform
Your thought process when my pen gets caressed
Warning all MCs better retreat
Look at Cornybus He cant walk down his own street
Better run and get the Fugees  Ohlalalala 
Cause I EAT EAT EAT MCs
Devour they titles cause Im an idolslashicon
And tell Wyclef dont even turn his fucking mic on
