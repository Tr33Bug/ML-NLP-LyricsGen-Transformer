Yeah  To the break of dawn 
All my effects involved  To the break of dawn 
As we get funky  To the break of dawn 
Problems will be solved  To the break of dawn 
Everybody knows  To the break of dawn 
When it come to a situation like this  To the break of dawn 
Little more effects  To the break of dawn 
And I cant resist  To the break of dawn 
So we get funky in the house you know what Im sayin  To the break of dawn 
LL Cool J style but  To the break of dawn 
This aint on a pop tip check it out  To the break of dawn 
What is a panther A animal that kills
Im like a shark with blood comin out the gills
You could never in your wildest dreams
Get a piece of this gangsta lean straight from Queens
Strong as liquor that be seen in a limousine
Now youre gettin done without Vaseline
Wouldnt bite because your rhymes are puppy chow
Made another million so competitors bow
Homeboy hold on my rhymes are so strong
Nothing could go wrong so why do you prolong
Songs that aint strong Brother youre dead wrong
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on
Huh you cant handle the whole weight
Your skin needs lotion teeth need Colgate
Wise up you little burnt up French fry
Im that type of guy
And I slammed you know just like a sumo
Put him in Pampers leave my drawers in his hamper
When Im through hell need a brand new identity
I was scoopin girls before you lost your virginity
Your jam is just a dreamin MC scheme
Gettin crushed by a LL theme
Somethin like Shaft put you in a cask
Buck you little bloodclaat boy you must not know
The rep I keep the MCs I peep sweep
Play cheap and freak with a chic unique technique
Get rid of the yuckmouth smile
Cause brother you aint got no style
Keep on  To the break of dawn 
Yeah  To the break of dawn 
Keep on  To the break of dawn rock that shit 
Ayo thats kinda funky but check this out here  To the break of dawn  yeah
Immaculate styles I use to abuse MCs
So light the fuse and spread the news you lose
To the damager microphone manager
Cold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur
That amateur swingin a hammer
From a body bag so run and get your camera
Get a flick of the stiff dead shot to get swift
But Im the wrong brother to dance with
Cause I dont need a partner to swing
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring
Shootin the gift but you just dont shoot it right
You couldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
Wouldnt throw a rock in a ghost town
So dont try to play post clown
You know that LLs back in town
And all the wannabe sheriffs is gettin shot down
Gimme that microphone
Ima show you the real meaning of the danger zone
Stop dancin get to walkin
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin
Huh you little snake in the grass
You swing a hammer but you couldnt break a glass
Gimme a lighter woof
Now youre cut loose from that Jheri curl juice
Cool J is back on the map
And when I see ya Ima give you a slap
Thats right a little kick for that crap
Cause my old gym teacher aint supposed to rap
Keep on  To the break of dawn 
Yeah  To the break of dawn  pump it up
I said keep on  To the break of dawn rock that shit 
Check this out  To the break of dawn  yeah
How dare you stand beside me
Im cool I freeze ICE
On your trail and Ima cut that ponytail
Youre disobedient with the wrong ingredients
But Ima drink you down over the rocks
While the freak on your album cover jocks
Youre gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon
I took the cover right home to the bathroom
In the immortal words of LL Hard as hell
Your broad wears it well
Shes the reason that your record sold a few copies
But your rhymes are sloppy
Like Oscar and youre bound to get dropped
And stopped I aint Murray the cop
Nor am I Felix but I got a bag of tricks
Mr Pusherman gimme a fix
So I can show you Im immune to them romper room tunes
You little hiphop raccoon
Im not Scarface but I want more beef
Before you rapped you was a downtown car thief
Workin in a parking lot
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned
So tell me how you like your cold cream
On a cone in a bowl or in a wet dream
With your TV on channel fuzz
Uncle L thats how much damage he does
Heres five dollars catch a taxi cab
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab
Keep on  To the break of dawn 
Yeah  To the break of dawn 
I said keep on  To the break of dawn 
Just wanted to funk it up a little bit
My man Pete Rock just walked up in the crib you know what Im sayin
Over here at Marley Marl house just coolin out my man Clash in the house
Sippin on this Bartles  Jaymes premium peachflavored wine cooler
Loungin back keep on
Peace
Yeah thats funky
