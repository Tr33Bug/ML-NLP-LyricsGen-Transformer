Yeah uhh uhh
Word up
And you say New York City
Ahaha word up  Take me away baby 
Uhh uhh uhh uhh
Damn you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown tearyeyed on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma  You wanna use my cell
You runnin solo  This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beatin on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheatin on me
Mmm I said miss let me tell you somethin
Bout whos makin major moves and whos frontin
Huh whos talkin loud but aint sayin nothin
And those who get the one they want but keep frontin
He dont appreciate the well til it run dry
Love is blind its hard to say goodbye goodbye
But smart birds choose to fly
Cause we livin in the hood girlfriend its do or die
Heres my definition of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the askin
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think you wanna ride with L
Some things are meant to be baby you never can tell
I wanna ride with you baby 
Every night every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me you and me
Hold me tight ecstasy
Makin love til ever after
Baby you and me yeah you and me
Now we dippin on the FDR
Its one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talkin and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You schemin L want a onenight stand
Im schemin she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rollin hopin theres somethin more
Dreamin about tomorrow and what life got in store
Livin no drama we can chill relax
Sex all night in the morn count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation we aint livin like that yknow
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the games extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
Cause I want you to think of me
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Im from Queens Ima rep to the fullest
But Id rather chill with you stead of dodgin bullets
Glock in the stash I dont really wanna pull it
On some socalled thug cat thats faker than acrylics
He said your fam be ridin your nerves
And you hate him for never given you the life you deserve
Remember the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whassup


Every night every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me you and me
Hold me tight ecstasy
Makin love til ever after
Baby you and me yeah you and me
I promise you dreams do come true
Theres trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your hearts bleedin how could the sky seem blue
But listen up shorty this is what I wanna do
Be there for you baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharin you
And to my exgirlfriend never comparin you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby Im takin you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tapes bumpin and its settin the tone
Should I jet to the hotel is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust there was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
Cause you wanna be treated like a queen not a whore
Close your eyes dont be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you wanna do however you wanna do it
Back to back baby we can get each other through it
Every night every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me you and me
Hold me tight ecstasy
Makin love til ever after
Baby you and me yeah you and me
Every night every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me you and me
Hold me tight ecstasy
Makin love til ever after
Baby you and me yeah you and me
Every night every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me you and me
Hold me tight ecstasy
Makin love til ever after
Baby you and me yeah you and me
Knahmean  Word up
Yeah yeah
Cmon cmon
Cmon cmon
Yeah I just want you to think about that yknahmsayin
Late at night when you layin there
And you feel like the whole world is fallin around you
Remember these words that I said
Theres somebody out there for you baby
Might be me you never know ahahah
Word up stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky knahmsayin
Dont let nobody tell you you cant make it
And dont let nobody around you tell you
That it aint possible to make your dreams come true
Word up uhh
Knahmean Thats real
Queens represent rock on
