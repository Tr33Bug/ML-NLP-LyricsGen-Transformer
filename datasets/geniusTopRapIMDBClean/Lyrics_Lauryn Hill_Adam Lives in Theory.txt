Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the altar of himself
Making pilgrimages thinking hes religious
Like hes got all the light and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
Cause he knows theyre not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that shes bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitation in the field
She handed him her virtue
Cause he told her I wont hurt you
So she lay with him to see how good it feels
Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
Now after the sensation and the empty fornication
She brought affection home
Into her bed quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good  head 
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They cant even entertain the solution
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says were guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth and loving lies


Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
Now can you tell me what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
Stop walking in pride let the thief be crucified
Unlearn everything you know and let Him teach you
Line upon line and precept upon precept say goodbye
To this decaying social system
He wants to know how far were willing to go
If we love him like we say we do
He will try us
Just you dont regress
Or slip into hopelessness
Once Hes satisfied His love
He wont deny us
And then Hell tell us what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
And then Hell tell us what what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now What we gonna say now
