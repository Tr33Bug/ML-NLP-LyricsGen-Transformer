BLACK RAGE is founded on twothirds a person
Rapings and beatings and suffering that worsens
Black human packages tied up in strings
BLACK RAGE can come from all these kinds of things
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial
Squeezing economics subsistence survival
Deafening silence and social control
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul
When the dogs bite
When the beatings
When Im feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
and then I dont fear so bad
Black rage is founded who fed us selfhatred
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason This grid and its cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things
Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water While they say its raining
Then call you mad for complaining complaining
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth
Murder and crime Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice sacrifice who makes this fortune
Greed falsely called progress
Such human contortion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
So when the dog bites
And the beatings
When Im feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I dont fear so bad
Free enterprise is it myth or illusion
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
Victims of violence both psyche and body
Life out of context IS living unGodly
Politics politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denial of self
Black human packages tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must but you cant have my soul
Black rage is made by unGodly control
So when the dog bites
And when the beatings
And Im feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I dont fear so bad
