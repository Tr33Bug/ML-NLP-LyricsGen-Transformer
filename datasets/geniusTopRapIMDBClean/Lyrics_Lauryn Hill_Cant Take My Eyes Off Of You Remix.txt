Uh uh uh we got the
Oh my God Is it real 
Oh we got the
Oh my God Is it real 
A onetwo a onetwo
Oh my God 
Yeah uh
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you  Baby 
Youd be like heaven to touch  Huh 
I wanna hold you so much  Yeah 
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive  Im alive yeah 
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that I stare  the way that I stare 
Theres nothing else to compare  What 
The sight of you leaves me weak  So weak 
There are no words left to speak  words left to speak 
But if you feel like I feel  Yeah 
Please let me know that its real  Its all real 
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
I love you baby if its quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby trust in me when I say okay  Its okay 
Oh pretty baby dont let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that Ive found you stay
And let me love you oh baby let me love you oh baby
It takes two to make a thing go right 
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Youd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive  Thank God what 
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you


I need you baby and if its quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby trust in me when I say its okay  Check the jewelers 
Oh pretty baby dont let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that Ive found you stay
And let me love you  What 
Oh baby let me love you oh baby
I need you baby  Its a conspiracy 
I love you baby  Its like uhl

Trust in me when I say its okay
Oh oh pretty baby dont let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay
And let me love you oh baby let me love you oh baby
