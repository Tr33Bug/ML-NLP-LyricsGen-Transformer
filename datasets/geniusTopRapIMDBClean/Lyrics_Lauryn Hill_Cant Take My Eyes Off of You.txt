Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Youd be like heaven to touch  heaven to touch 
I wanna hold you so much  hold you so much 
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that I stare  the way that I stare 
Theres nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak  words left to speak 
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that its real
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
I need you baby and if its quite alright
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby trust in me when I say Its okay
Oh pretty baby dont let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay
And let me love you oh babylet me love you oh baby
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you  eyes off of you 
Youd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much  hold you so much 
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive

Cant take my eyes off of you
I need you baby and if its quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
