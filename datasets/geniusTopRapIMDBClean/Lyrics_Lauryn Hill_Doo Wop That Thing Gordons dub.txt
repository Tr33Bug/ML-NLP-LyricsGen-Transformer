Doo Wop  That Thing   Gordons dub  LyricsYo remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like
Wooo wooo wooo
Yo yo my men and my women dont forget about the Deen
The Sirat alMustaqim yo
Its about a thing
Yo yo yo if you feel real good lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah yeah
Put them up put them up
Put them up put them up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think you really goin to pretend
Like you wasnt down when you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably  again
Talking out your neck saying youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Whore you going to tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans come again

Yo Awhen when come again  yeah yeah 
When when come again  yeah yeah 
My friend come again  yeah yeah 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend popping yin  Like you got Yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men still living in his mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child supports late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Girls you know youd better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Girls you know youd better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Hey we have some very intelligent women in here man
Do you think you too young to really love somebody
No no no no no
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love
This is silly you infatuated with them
You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me whats the difference
Whats the difference
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person but you cant stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before they never been in love before
They dont know the feeling to be loved
She poetic
She killed you
We get in that conversation with that right
