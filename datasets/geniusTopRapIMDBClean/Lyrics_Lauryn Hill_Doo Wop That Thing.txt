Doo Wop  That Thing  Lyrics
Yo remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like  Ooh oohooh ooh 
Yo yo my men and my women
Dont forget about the deen
Sirat alMustaqeem
Yo its about a thing uh yo yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Put them up put them up 
Put them up put them up 
Put them up put them up 
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you aint hear him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think youre really gon pretend
Like you wasnt down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck sayin youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending em
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because its in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
A win win come again
A win win come again 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend poppin yang  like you got yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men still in they mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men
The punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Uhuh come again  Yeah 
Hey yoyo come again
My French men come again
My sister come again
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Watch out watch out
Look out look out
Girls you know youd better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Guys you know youd better watch out
Cause girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Girls you know youd better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
Class
Hey weve got some very intelligent women here man
Do you think youre too young to really love somebody
No No no I dont think so 
I say it for me uh Im an adult I say wait
Youre too young to be in love this is silly
Youre infatuated or whatever you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
Its the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody 
Well you tell me Whats the difference
Okay You can love anybody but when youre in love with somebody youre looking at it like thisyoure taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do 
Youre crazy You fall in love you can fall out of love 
You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person 
Maybe they aint never been loved before or been in love before they dont know what the feeling is to be loved 
She poetic 
She killed it we could end that conversation with that right
