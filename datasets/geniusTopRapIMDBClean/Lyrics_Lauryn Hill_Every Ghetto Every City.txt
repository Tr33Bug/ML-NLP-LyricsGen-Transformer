I was just a little girl
Skinny legs a press and curl
My mother always thought Id be a star
But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that Id never go too far
Every ghetto every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem
Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
Kill the Guy in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose til its dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones
Every ghetto every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Bag of Bontons twenty cents and a nickel  well thats a quarter 
Springfield Ave had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and KungFu  wuhTAH 
Main street roots tonic with the dreads
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoes
Member FrelingHuysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick was together
Looking at the crew we thought wed all live forever
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Drill teams on Munn street
Member when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didnt have
Writing my friends names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable PSP
Where all them crazy niggas be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self Destruction record drops
And everybodys name was Muslim  children playing women producing 
Sensations and eightyeight
Attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the wop  wop it out wop it out wop it out 
Jack ya jack ya jack ya body
Nah the BizMark used to amp up the party
I wish those days they didnt stop
Every ghetto every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
You know its hot
Dont forget what you got
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
Looking back looking back looking back looking back
