Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring  Must come spring 
Change it comes eventually
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring  Must come 
Change it comes eventually
I wrote these words  I wrote these words  for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who wont accept deception in instead of what is truth  Gotta know the truth yall 
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules  Who made these rules 
Were so confused  Were so confused 
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything  Everything 
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything
Our philosophy possibly speak tongues
Beat drum Abyssinian street Baptist  Word 
Rap this in fine linen from the beginning  Word 
My practice extending across the atlas I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You cant match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti  Ooh uh 
MCs aint ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty  El Shabazz 
LBoogie spars with stars and constellations  What 
Then came down for a little conversation  Huh 
Adjacent to the king fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum  What 
Now hear this mixture where Hip Hop meets scripture  Uh 
Develop a negative into a positive picture
Now everything is everything  Everything yall everything yall 
What is meant to be will be  What is meant to be will be yeah 
After winter must come spring  After winter must come spring 
Change it comes eventually  Change it comes eventually 


Sometimes it seems well touch that dream  Sometimes it seems well touch that dream 
But things come slow or not at all  They come slow know what I mean 
And the ones on top wont make it stop  Ones on top they wont make it stop 
So convinced that they might fall
Lets love ourselves and we cant fail
To make a better situation  Better situation uhuh 
Tomorrow our seeds will grow  Tomorrow our seeds will grow 
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything  Everything is everything 
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything  Everything is everything 
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter  After winter  must come spring  Must come 
Change it comes eventually
