It could all be so simple  Bababababy baby baby 
But youd rather make it hard  Huh uh 
Loving you is like a battle  Its like a battle 
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be  Who I have to be 
To get some reciprocity
See no one loves you more than me  More than me 
And no one ever will  No one ever will yeah 
Is this just a silly game  Silly game 
That forces you to act this way  To act this way 
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you cant stay  Yeah 
Tell me who I have to be  I know what we gotta do 
To get some reciprocity
See no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It aint working  It aint working no  it aint working
And when I try to walk away
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy this is crazy  Oh this is crazy uhhuh 
I keep letting you back in  You back in 
How can I explain myself  I dont understand why 
As painful as this thing has been
I just cant be with no one else


See I know what weve got to do  Yeah 
You let go  You let go  and Ill let go too  And Ill let go 
Cause no ones hurt me more than you  No ones hurt me more than you 
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It aint working  It aint working  it aint working  It aint working 
And when I try to walk away
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy  This is crazy  Oh this is crazy  This is crazy
