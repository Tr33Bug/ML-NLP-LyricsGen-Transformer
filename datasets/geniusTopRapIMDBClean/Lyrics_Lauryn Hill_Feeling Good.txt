Birds flying high you know how I feel
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by you know how I feel
Its a new dawn its a new day
Its a new life for me yeah
Its a new dawn its a new day
Its a new life for me
And Im feeling good
Fish in the sea you know how I feel
River running free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel
Its a new dawn its a new day
Its a new life for me
And Im feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean
Dont ya know
Butterflies having fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done thats what I mean
And this hold world is a new world
And a bold world for me
Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of a pine you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine and I know how I feel
Its a new dawn its a new day
Its a new life for me
Im feeling good
