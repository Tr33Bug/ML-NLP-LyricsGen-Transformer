Uhuh
Uh
And yo
Uhh uhh  Like fungus among us 
Yo yo  Haha  uh
Yo I treat this like my thesis
Wellwritten topic broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce words so profuse
Its abuse how I juice up this beat like Im deuce
Two people both equal like Im Gemini rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it you cant stop it
Drop it your whole crew microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles and on the cover
Dont discuss the baby mother  Nah 
Business I been in this third LP you cant tell me
I witness firsthanded Im candid you cant stand it
Respect demanded and get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from NewArk to Israel
And this is real so I keep makin the streets ballads
While you lookin for dressin to go with your tossed salad
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
Im about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus to reverse the hypnosis
Whoevers closest to the lines gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
Im about to begin it for a minute then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron things gon change its apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you keep your deen true you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
Cause with all thats going on I got the world in my palm
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour


Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind party like its 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes lets see if that get you out your bind
Now Ima get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
Im making sure Im with the 144
Ive been here before this aint a battle this is war
Word to Boonie I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hoodchic
But it aint what you cop its about what you keep
And even if there are leaks you cant capsize this ship
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
