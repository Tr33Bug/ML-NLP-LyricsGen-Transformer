Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never never never trust
Hoohoohoohoohoo
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye while Im sticking like glue
Fling skin grin while them plotting for you true
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do  Me a tell you dem nuh know 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do  Fi be real them nuh have a clue 
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose its those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition they do
Oh
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Why every Indian wanna be the chief
Feed a man till he full and he still want beef
Give me grief try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase I must decrease
If I treat you kindly does it mean that Im weak
You hear me speak and think I wont take it to the streets
I know enough cats that dont turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you cant list them
How you gon idolize the missing To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming gunning I stand position
Ls known the mission since conception
Lets free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto uhh


Like Cain and Abel Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas backstabbers do this
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves to themselves
A friend once said and I found to be true
That everyday people they lie to God too
So what makes you think that they wont lie to you
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do  Forgive them forgive them 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do  Forgive them forgive them 
Gwan like dem love you while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and leff you fi dead
Dem a yuh friend who you depend pon from way back when
to grace 
But if you gi dem yuh back then you must meet yuh end
Dem nuh know what dem do do
Whos gonna be the one 
Dem nuh know what dem do do
Gotta be the one to say 
Dem nuh know dem nuh know dem nuh know dem nuh know
Dem nuh know what dem do do
Oh yeah oh 
Forgive them Father forgive them Father
