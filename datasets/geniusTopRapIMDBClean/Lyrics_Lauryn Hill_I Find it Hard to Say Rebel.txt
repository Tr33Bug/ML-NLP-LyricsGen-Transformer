I Find it Hard to Say  Rebel  Lyrics
I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Dont look at me that way
Like everything is alright
Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says
His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel
It cant go down this way
Choose well choose well choose well
Choose well choose well choose well
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing and no one can replace it
No no no no no no no no no no no no
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
Is rebel  rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Repent the day is far too spent  rebel rebel
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up and rebel
We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up you might as well
Oh are you oh are you satisfied
Oh are you satisfied Rebel ohhh rebel
Why dont you rebel
Why dont you rebel
Why dont you rebel
Im fading myself down now
