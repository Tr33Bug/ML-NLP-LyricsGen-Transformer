I get out Ill get out of all your boxes
I get out you cant hold me in these chains
Ill get out Father free me from this bondage
Knowin my condition is the reason I must change
Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom maintaining your pollution
I wont support your lie no more
I wont even try no more
If I have to die oh Lord thats how I choose to live
I wont be compromised no more
I cant be victimized no more
I just dont sympathize no more cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say love then abuse me
You never thought youd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin is for certain
You thought Id stay here hurtin
Your guilt trips just not workin repressin me to death
Cause now Im choosin life yo
Ill take the sacrifice yo
If everything must go then go thats how I choose to live
Heh hehehehehe
Ok we gettin there
At least I had a chunk
Aight okay its how I choose to live
Hehehe awww
No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave
But I get out oh I get out of all your boxes
Ill get out oh you cant hold me in these chains
I get out oh I want out of social bondage
Knowin my condition oh is the reason I must change
See what you see is what you get
Oh and you aint seen nothin yet
Oh I dont care if youre upset
I could care less if youre upset
See it dont change the truth
And your hurt feelings no excuse
To keep me in this box
Psychological locks
Repressin true expression
Cementin this repression
Promotin mass deception
So that no one can be healed
I dont respect your system
I wont protect your system
When you talk I dont listen
Oh let my Fathers will be done
And just get out oh just get out of all these bondage
Just get out oh you cant hold me in these chains
Just get out all these traditions killin freedom
Knowin my condition is the reason I must change
Ive just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know
Is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh youd have everyone believe
That youre the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face realitythe system is a joke
Oh youd be smart to save your soul
Oh and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh are you sure where is the passion in this living
Are you sure its God you serving
Obligated to a system
Getting less then youre deserving
Who made up these schools I say
Who made up these rules I say
Animal conditioning
Oh just to keep us as a slave
Oh just get out of this social purgatory
Just get out all these traditions are a lie
Just get out superstition killin freedom
Knowin my condition is the reason I must die
Just get out just get out just get out
Lets get out lets get out
Knowin my condition is the reason I must die
Just get out
