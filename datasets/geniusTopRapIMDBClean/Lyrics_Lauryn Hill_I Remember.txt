I remember
When you look into my eyes
You saw right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed
Just like a child
All of my heart
You hold it in your hands
Im yours to command
Im yours to demand
I I feel so humble
With you in my life
With you in my life
I remember
When I looked into your eyes
I saw a reflection of myself
And I could not lie
Out of control
Too weak to deny
All of myself
Is naked before you
But what can I do
There is nothing I can do
I feel so beautiful
With you in my life
With you in my life
I remember
I remember
I remember
I ohh ohh ohh
With you in my life
With you in my life
