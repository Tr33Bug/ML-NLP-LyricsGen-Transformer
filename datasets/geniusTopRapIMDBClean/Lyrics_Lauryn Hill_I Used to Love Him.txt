Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
As I look at what Ive done
The type of life that Ive lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I chose the road of passion and pain  passion and pain 
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited debated
For something to happen that just wasnt fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont


Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish mans wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See my soul was weary but now its replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man whos lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold see I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his the life which was his to begin with
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
Now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
I used to love him but now I dont
See I used to love him
