I tell you there are no big shots in reality yall
Were all in the same boat dealing with the same issues same problems same stuff Dont even buy it All the perpetration you know all this We dont have problems Thats a lie Thats a lie I know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that hes doing to everybody else I just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation See we always thought it was retreat you know run away And Im telling you you got to confront it
This is a strange song because this song  when this song was written this is when everything sort of stopped It was written a long time ago but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything And because I didnt understand Initially it was written  Id written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation when it first happened And I went to the studio and I laid it down And it was like strong for the first day And then it just regressed everyday after that And I said Whats going on Whats happening
And at the end of it there was a word that i used rebel And I guess was afraid It was such a hot time in the city at that point I was afraid that if I
Put the record out people would misunderstand what I meant by rebel and theyd just take it to the streets So I was very intimidated and afraid And before I knew it a whole host of things happened Everything stopped after that And the creativity stopped Everything stopped Thats when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about And I had to be you know a living example
Its real crazy because I dont know what the press is saying because I dont listen to the press too much But I know the view is that Im emotionally unstable which is reality Like you arent
Im laughing because what Ive realized Ive become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first you see to make sure that they work And thats when you know OK look I got something that works You know what Im saying Im not gonna give you something that I havent tested for myself And you go through and youre learning by way of experience and youre making mistakes and youre getting up
A friend of mine once said to me he said Look if we werent supposed to turn around why does a car have a steering wheel Are we just supposed to crash into the wall No were supposed to say Listen I was going the wrong way Reverse
In this particular song now I realize that this song is about freedom You see We could look at one human being but its about the spirit of freedom being taken out and how its taken out in all of us
The song is called I Find It Hard to Say Bear with me a little bit
