You all doin alrightYou okay
claps
Im not screamin at ya Im just askin you a question Yall givin me a clap
A yes is fine  laughing  okay
voice from audience I love that song 
Thank you Praise God
I tell you I know everybodys in the same mess Im telling you
We all are
I I I know that you know
and Im just you know Ill be the first to tell you you know
Im a mess and God is dealing with me everyday And everyday Im trying you know how I can be less of a mess Cuz you know he showed me Look Lauryn you know Youre the problem okay Im going to show you how youre causing the problem and now I want you to be the solution And thats what all of these songs are about just problem cause and solution Free your mind
Its like we all think that the gospel is join and church building and thats deception you know
The real gospel is Repent which means let go of all that crap thats killin you
Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience not this torment you know
And when I realized that I was tormenting myself it was about my lust
It wasnt about things that I needed it was just you know all these security blankets I mean the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner I mean you know forty people on staff and you cant do nothing and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know youre supporting and carryin and you know its not good You know everybody
a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on its own bottom you know And in that respect we all get to do what our passion is
See  thats what praisin God is all about is doing your passion
You know its not useless worthless ritual you know monotonous ritual where we just show up and cant wait to see the game you know Its doing your passion and fulfilling your passion You know
Thats how were thankful Thats how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive
And Im just glad that I you know I dont have to slave anymore You know cuz I music was my love and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden It just got stolen from me I said What is this How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate
And so now you know I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasnt reality It wasnt the standard at all you know T
heres a scripture in the Bible that we what does it say it says We compare ourselves amongst ourselves you know Thats not the standard You already are the standard What are you trying to fit into a standard for We were each created to be individual standards you know And were trying to fit into a standard It doesnt make any sense you know
So now Im just you know after all that Im just ready to be me And its a lot to work through you know because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about And its because we didnt understand you know because theres all this social doctrine that says you know that
The infinite God with all this expression
who created every single one of us
absolutely different
On purpose
wants everybody to fit into the same suit
But like you know thats deception
Thats deception
Talking to someone offstage  Okay let me just I think this is the wrong one  laughing  I dont think this is the right one
We tookwe were in um Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world and um you know we were going they gave us a tour They escorted us through the back And when they escorted us through the back we got to see how you know there all these people workin all hard and it was like real dirty back there and of course in the front it was all immaculately clean
And I said I said you know People need to see the reality they need to see you know how these people slave to maintain this illusion
And it felt like my life I said If people only knew what it was
Its like you know a bunch of musicians listen bustin their mm workin all hard to make it look easy Whats the point You know Oh uh I just threw this together uh audience laughs 
You know its like you know what Im sayin
I mean you know
Slaving
Slaving to act like you know I wake up like this And none of us do you know none of us do
None of us do
And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale let your belly out you know and chill You know But people get mad at me when I say Look lets stop frontin And Im saying you know thats the blessing
Now we can go around and look at each other and say Oh you got one too
And be free
And we want to defend the curse Ill tell ya that was not fun Did it for a long time
Too long
offstage  You didnt find it Its another white one But you seein my purse Or the the other bag Or the green one Ghetto You know its reality okay  laughing 
One time it came to me you know I was just told very concretely
You know it was like that voice the right one said to me
he said Lauryn You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else
I just want you to know that
Because we always thought we could get you know we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin the face and you know lookin hard in the video But you know Reality isits like Ive always told to my husband its like look you know we look at Bob Marley you know and we say Okay lets just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content You see what Im saying
You cant get it from the outside in Truth is from the inside out
You know and the way weve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical surface superficial temporary solution And Im telling you true healing is from the inside out You know weve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying  offstage  Oh this is the one
Boy Ill tell ya God made him for me Im something to put up with And to endure that is amazing Ill be the first to tell you trust me Yall could clap cuz thats some real work  more clapping  I was in there in the room you know before we came out here and he said to me I said Ro should I change And he said Yeah So I looked at him I said Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable man But I asked him the question So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like I feel like an idiot So I pulled out all these clothes and Im sayin ok Ro you know Pack the bag neatly you know Could you put the clothes back in And hes like Alright So hes trying to do this but then Im like No Now take this out Now put that back and take that out Put that back hold that take that put The orange shoe The orange shoe So Im like And then after awhile I just said Ro baby could you leave Please get out the room And I just put back on the clothes I came in Okay I was likeIm just not there anymore Nah Im telling you Its like uh  laughing  Hey you know hes learned Because before we used to just beef and now hes like OkayIm out Its real God gave us a brand new relationship man I mean one in truth you know
Its like we date people like lets say you know were interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again You understand what Im sayin Its likeAnd thats why so many marriages end up in divorce Its because people wake up next to a stranger
They say Who the hell are you What are you doing in this bed
Wheres that man that used to do du dua and du
And Im sayin lets give them reality from the door because youre going to attract love
and the one that really loves you And then you dont have to pretend and falsify and you know keep that posture
You know you know I cant Im just likeIll never forget when I first met him I said to him it was like he saw me eating in front of him and he told me he was like You eat like a man you must not like me You know because women usually they keep that posture And I said Nah I said its not even that you know Its but this is reality This is you know and thats it man I mean Im just telling you its so wonderful to finally find
And trust me its a work in progress its not something that happens overnight
We all have to be introduced to each other
Im telling you I know that Im up here and you see Lauryn Hill you came to see Lauryn Hill
But this is the first time yall meet me You see what Im saying Dont think you met me before okay And as I grow youre going to meet me a little bit more Youre gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know My mother my father Listen yall never knew me I want to introduce you to me Im just getting to know me And you know what anything thats not growin is dead so we better be changing
You know people would say to me they would hold me hostage And they seriously emotionally hostage and theyd say Uh shes changing The moneys changing her And Id say Listen the moneys not changing me Gods changing me Im changing because thats a natural part of life Were all supposed to change Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that Nobody is Let the experience teach you and be real man
And umtheres gonna be warfare involved Because theres some people who prefer deceptions see They say uh I dont like this new expression and I say what you want twothirds of me to stay outside Im a whole person You cant say you know twothirds of Lauryn come in here Only twothirds is acceptable Im a whole person You know And thats everybody
You always talk about spiritual warfare and we didnt realize that it was in relationships Its emotional warfare Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves And when they say Hey that doesnt fit into our box for you we say well I aint in no box Dont try to put me in one
Im going to play a little bit of guitar with this one but I might stop its cuz I really want you to listen to the words so if I stop you understand why I want you to really hear the words
