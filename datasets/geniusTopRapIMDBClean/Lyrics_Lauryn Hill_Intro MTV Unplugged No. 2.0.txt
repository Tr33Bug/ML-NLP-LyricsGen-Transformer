Intro  MTV Unplugged No 20  LyricsOh no Not you What are you doing here Oh boy its gonna be hard now Can we put him in the back Robin Robin Robin
I used to get dressed for yall now I dont do that no more Im sorry Its a new day I dont have the energy
Anybody got a joke
Ok so these are brand new songs that very few people have heard very much about you know what Ive been going trough and what Ive been learning  a lot of wonderful life lessons you know that arent easy to come by but youre very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you had to go trough
Its just very important that you really listen to the words you know and if you have a hard time to hear what Im saying please just raise your hand you know or something object You guys ready in there  All set  Ok
And you know its real interesting because I used to be a performer and I really dont consider myself a performer so much anymore Im really just Im sharing you know more or less the music that Ive been given But if I stop if I start if I you know feel like saying Baby baby baby for eighteen bars  whatever you know I just I do that
So You guys are cool  Ok Im talking to people in my head too Its alright though Lets just warm up a little bit Im just gonna finish sucking on my lozenger
Okay so this particular song is called Mr Intentional Well see We all tuned up now Lets just warm up a little bit
