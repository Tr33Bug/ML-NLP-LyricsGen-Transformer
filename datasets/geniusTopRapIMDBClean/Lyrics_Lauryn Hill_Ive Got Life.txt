I aint got no home aint got no shoes
Aint got no money aint got no class
Aint got no friends aint got no schooling
Aint got no hurt aint got no job
Aint got no money no place to stay
Aint got no
Programmed inequity its in the nervous system
Listen watch the words how they twist em
Two thirds of the world turned victim
Subtle energy they capture and block chi
The unseen violence behind the democracy
Some call it hypocrisy turn freeman into property
And logically justify not treatin em properly
Invisible ink in the constitution
Meant to preserve the institution unequal distribution
Of wealth goods and services
Revolvin door no floor just anxiety and nervousness
Trapped in circuses
Herds of us not understandin our purposes
When appetites and psychological types
Get caught in the hype its tight from morning til night
Im demanding my rights
Womens suffrage then black suffrage
Or Jim Crow the KKK
American terrorism
Murders and beatings on television
Its in the cells now you thought that was yesterday
But the compression stays trauma still got most afraid
Stuck in the memory fear gives birth to lethargy
Generations of children in jeopardy
History written in jealousy scribes full of heresy
Full of barbarians chchcheck out my melody
Musical therapy reprogram
Africa full of coltan
Coltrane was a cold man
Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man
Heal the homeland
Past time for our own land
Where a grown man can be a grown man
The system has benefit for robbery is robbery
You cant run from it God is a natural monopoly
Divine creator stuck in monotony
Bureaucracy psyche on poverty
Selfesteem broken like pottery
No more not me codename anomaly
Cause theres just no match for the prodigy
Sovereignty the god in me
Walking university living cosmology
Without apology
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
OK
The more you suppress life the stronger it gets
With death life the longer it gets
I know its hard to admit
That you follow some bullshit
Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill
Repression oppression same thing  same thing 
Fear the shadow thats the main thing  main thing 
They keep running from
Every action yields an equal and opposite one
Yes that means the consequence comes
Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor
Cant be healed with just a cummerbund
I was homecoming queen call me number one
Yep thats another one now give the drummer some
Tell every mothers son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns
See my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off
Now dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov
Street sweeper my words are my keeper
Its in the ether now what you trynna tell these preachers Its done
Its done let loose your tongue
Gifted black and young
Watch these devils run
They knew a change was gonna come
Sinner man  looking for a place to run
Tell the truth in tongues enemy reduced by ones
Thousands 2 can put 10000 in flight
Speak truth to power every 24 hours


Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
Ay let me tell you 
Imperialism is a form of Jihad
They killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion in the name of God
The children of mammon called it spiritual famine
Can we examine how they stole bauxite rubber labor diamonds and platinum
The building blocks of society and economy broke humanity to build the colonies
Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality
No more human tragedy no more misrecognition no more addiction
Lets accurately diagnose our condition
Listen
400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion
Dont give me another persons prescription
I need what I need my deeds are my deeds
As a man thinketh so is he Mezanmi
Take the land back every child woman and man back
Reevaluate history expeditiously
Cant live my life in apostasy
Emulate the apostrophe hang with S you can rock with me
I come in love and truth  truth 
Look at what I went through
Now its time to acknowledge just what I give you Life
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
Theres a whole lotta wrong to be righted I get excited
Ima kick this shit off like Im on Manchester United  my attention is undivided so you cant divide and conquer me
Im sitting comfortably in a SUV up in my SUV taking artistic liberties
Making musical history a lil acupuncture structural integration my meditation liberating a generation  beyond that Im taking the bomb back Im splitting atoms for freedom America needs more FREED men able to talk right not prone to GREED men  Its just not what you need man 
Let your words and deeds line up master the mind young king man put your signs up intelligent designs up plant your seeds keep your dimes up cuz no man knows when the times up
Its elemental like Solomon in the temple Ark of the Covenant accountable to a higher government
Im looking for love  in all the wrong places 
Somebody tell me where them brothas went reclaim your wealth no more giving the enemy help no more sympathy for the devil letem hang himself
Get all the billion Black people out of these bottles suffer while grown people get coddled you know the novel
Ive got life
Ive got laughs
Ive got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you you you
