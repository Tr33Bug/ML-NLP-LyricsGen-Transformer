Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pools of fascination in my sleep
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Warming up my cold within his heat
Bouncing down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me to complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears
Its just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Its just like the water the water
I aint felt this way in years
Coursing through my senses hes prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me I find my insides sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you
Its just like the water
I aint felt this way in years in years
Its just like the water the water
I aint felt this way in years
Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on the mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination oh no
Hes pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning Im so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land
Its just like the water
I aint felt this way in years in years
Its just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Cleaning me hes purging me
And moving me around
Hes bathing and hes cleaning me
And moving me around
Around and around and around and around
Washing me cleaning me
Moving me around
Hes purging me hes been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around
And around
Around
And around
Moving me around
