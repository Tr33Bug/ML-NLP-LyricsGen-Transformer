I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldnt hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that aint me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it
I was lost but now Im foundfoundfound
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings underground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I have found
Im not used to being lonely
I dont like the way it sounds
Youre the only one I knowyeah
Who dont turn my upsidedown


I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
