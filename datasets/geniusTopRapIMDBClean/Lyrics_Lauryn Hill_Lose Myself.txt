I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
Couldnt tell me I was loved when I needed it
When all I ever wanted was love
Shoulda told me just because
Im worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
Theres something awesome about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldnt love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said
So I could love you better
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
BSec
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldnt stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my selfworth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way
Bridge
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby its not an excuse I give
And Id do it all again because for you I live
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did
Hey baby its not an excuse I give
And Id do it all again because for you I live
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way
And that was just the way it is
