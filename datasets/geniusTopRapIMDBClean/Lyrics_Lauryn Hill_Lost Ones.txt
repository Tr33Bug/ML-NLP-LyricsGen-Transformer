Its funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation dont fit your equation
I was on the humble you on every station
Some wan play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan run
Now understand LBoogie nonviolent
But if a thing test me run for mi gun
Cant take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon scrimmage like you the champion
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
Now now how come your talk turn cold
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin to grab hold of what you cant control
Now youre all floss what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless now Im on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like hes exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Cant slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movements similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight how your whole style bent
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you dont wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you dont change then the rain soon come
See you might win some but you just lost one


You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one its so silly how come
When its all done did you really gain from  Gain from 
What you done done Its so silly how come
You done how come 
You just lost one
Now dont you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard
You cant hold Gods people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasnt made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some dont know what they have til its gone
Now even when youre gone you can still be reborn
And from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that theyve reached perfection
If you look closely youll see what youve become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one its so silly how come
When its all done did you really gain from
What you done done Its so silly how come
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one its so silly how come
When its all done did you really gain from
What you done done Its so silly how come
You just lost one
You just lost one you just lost one
You just lost one you just lost one
How come you lost one Its so dumb 
You just lost one you just lost one
You just lost one
What a bambam hehehe
