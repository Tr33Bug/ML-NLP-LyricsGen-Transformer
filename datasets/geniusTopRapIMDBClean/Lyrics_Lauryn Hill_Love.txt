Your love is like the ocean and I am like the sand
Responding to your power a safe place for you to stand
But when the undercurrents come and pull you out to sea
Im left with shells and slippery rocks where you used to be
And when the sun comes beating down and burns my body dry
Its hard to wait until the tide to quench my thirst so I cry I cry
Cry cry and then at last the sun goes down
And leads into your sea
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me all over me
I dream of you when I know I shouldnt shouldnt
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldnt
You promised me you wouldnt you wouldnt
I said Id be with you and I know I couldnt
And I knew I couldnt
Oh I oh I Indeed indeed indeed
So moves like that
This is how we bust rhymes on a phat track
Me and Kahlee female refugees we get down like that
I dont know what to sing so my artistry brings
Things from off the top of my head
I bust freestyles instead
Of memories of the time when we were free
