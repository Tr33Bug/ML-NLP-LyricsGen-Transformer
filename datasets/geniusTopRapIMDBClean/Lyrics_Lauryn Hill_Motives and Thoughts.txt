Rotating bodies confusion of sound
Negative imagery holding us down
Social delusion clearly constructed
Human condition morals corrupted
Trapped in reaction lawlessness war
Dissatisfaction from bowels to core
Devils technology strategy for
Human mythologies urban folklore
Sick of psychology counterfeit cure
Wicked theology robbing the poor
Scheme demonology mislead the pure
Strictly strategically studying war
Light shown in darkness image exposed
Few can see through the new emperors clothes
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes
When the blind lead the blind just more trouble and woes
Its the mind that they chose
Its designed to stay closed
Standard of jokers court jester logic
Sick looking cosmics from schoolyards to college
Primitive man with civilized knowledge
System collapse and he still wont acknowledge
God is the saviour studies behavior
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya
Stiffnecked scholars on prescription meds
Wishing their problems were all in their heads
Moral dilemma pride is the root
Misguided from youth heart divided from truth
Egyptians and Grecians spiritually dead
Imperially led by the gods in their heads
Motives and thoughts
Industrial wealth
Global economy in it for self
Heart full of madness covered with kind
Pleasure designed to take over your mind
Furnished in godliness painted in good
This tainted priesthood got real saints misunderstood
While classes in government set up the veil
And cultivate minds for more mythical tales
Typical Hollywood follies good girl
While vice and corruption take over the world
Motives and thoughts
Check your motives and thoughts
Blind with the wickedness deep in your heart
Modern day wickedness is all youve been taught
Lied to your neighbors so you get ahead
Modern day trickery is all youve been fed
Motives and thoughts
Check your motives and thoughts
