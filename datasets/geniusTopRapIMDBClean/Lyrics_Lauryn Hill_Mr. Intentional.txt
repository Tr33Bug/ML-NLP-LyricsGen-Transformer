Mr Intentional LyricsYeah yeah
See the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Cant you tell the way they have to mention
How they helped you out
Youre such a hopeless victim
Please dont do me any favors Mr Intentional
All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk commanding your affection
They need to be needed deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why theyre so important is without explanation
Please dont patronize me Mr Intentional
Oh oh oh
We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial to admit were immature
Validating lies Mr Intentional
Open up yours eyes Mr Intentional
Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because thats just the way it was
Please dont justify me Mr Intentional
Oh onedimensional
Mr Intentional
Oh oh dont you do me any favors
Oh oh oh oh
Wake up youve been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh its nobody elses fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Dont worship my hurt feelings Mr Intentional


See I know you cant help me Mr Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that Im not available
Please dont entertain me Mr Intentional
Oh I dont need your sympathy Mr Intentional
Stay away from me Mr Intentional
So onedimensional
Mr Promotional
Mr Emotional
Mr Intentional
