Neurotic Society  Compulsory Mix  Lyrics
Were living in a joke time metaphorical coke time
Commerce and girl men
Run the whole world men
Bold drunken debauchery
Old world brutality
Cold world killed softly
Whole world run savagely
Greedy men and pride fiends
Program TV screens
Quick scam and drag queens
Real lifes been blasphemed
Think twice its past dream
Crime if you ask clean
Quick fast the poison has entered the blood stream
Psychological massacre
Consequences are tragedy
Mythological characters
Men and women as parody
Superficial the vanity
Borderline the insanity
Out of order humanity
Crime committed so passivelyrandomly
Desperados and casualties
Corporations want batteries
Explanations and strategies
Domination and mastery
Owned jonesing and bankrupt
Grown people so corrupt
Vice lords and yellow men junkies of popularity
Culture so in dependence
Vultures scavenge reality
Past feeling depravity
Decaying social cavity
Preying on human ignorance
Popular immorality
Symptoms of diseased head
Population misled
Self indulgent past dead
Absence of the God head
Pimps pushers and harlotry
Nepotism no artistry
Despotism and piracy
Desperation dishonesty
Business decision policy
More money lesser quality
Inflated global ego imitating reality
Pseudo psycho new Pharaoh
Poisonous bows and arrows
Hypo critics on salary
Idle hands devils agency
Predisposed to complacency
Jealousy and audacity
Contagious social gluttony
Stages of mass malignancy
Epidemic deception
Generation in atrophy
Glam life in debt
Scam life and editors
Bi products of neglect
Children hiding from creditors
Absence of self respect
Phony scared of competitors
Lifestyle of luxury
At someones expense
Sensitive children used up as sacrifice
Blinded to consequence
Smoked up in dope pipes
Ecstasy fast life recklessly pass life
Narcotics and cash fight this neurotic society
Benefactors turned actors
Addictions crippled captives
Experience manufactured
In this neurotic toxic society
Its like post war theyre looking for the communists or who the Marxist is
10000 pictures on Facebook
Thats like the pot calling the kettle narcissist
Come on really
Saying the devil but youre the chief arsonist
Hypocrites cant even see their own part in this
No reflection
Vampire paradigm
No introspection
This star that star rants has a breakdown
3 months before pure obsession picture cant take down
Children its a shake down
Theyre just looking for a sacrifice
Theyve been doing this since before Bobby Darrin sang Mack the Knife
Before James Deans car did a jack knife
Perhaps because they lack life or lack guts
Never confuse the head with the butt
Opinions are like assholes and most of them stink
I was told by a woman so rethink
Dont ever let them to lead you to drink
Lead you to doubt
Lead you to fall
Get up stand up
And  cast Lucifer out
Shake it up baby
Watch them twist and then shout
Insecure assholes just looking for a ticket
To ride on somebody
Like the Pick It
Its fucking wicked
Shame on a nuh
This neurotic toxic society
Sick psycho psychology
In desperate need of psychiatry
Exorcisms sobriety
Forcing
Social lobotomies
People stuck in dichotomies
Pseudo sicko anxieties
Serial criminals dressed in variety
Social transvestism
Subliminal dressed up as piety
Transference projections
Like Cartesian images
Robbing innocence
Stealing inheritance
Quiet victims with no defense
Betrayed over dollars and cents
Maladjusted and ignorant
Mal addiction and dissonance
Too much addiction no consciousness
Dont trust it
This cosmologys busted broken
And returns to the dust
It stinks of corruption
Oppression deceit
Abuse in repeat
They dont feel complete
Unless theyre misleadingrobbing the sheep
Man is not a product if you call him that then stop it
In this Neurotic dominant society
