Whoa ooh umm yeah yeah
Whoa ooh whoa ow yeah
Yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh
Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
Cause nothing even matters at all
See nothing even matters
See nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
See I dont need no alcohol
Your love make me feel ten feet tall  Yeah 
Without it Id go through withdrawal
Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still theres no place Id rather be
Cause nothing even matters to me
See nothing even matters  Yeah 
See nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Youre part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously  Baby baby 
Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Said it dont matter baby baby
Dont matter
Now you wont find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you its never eitheror
Cause nothing even matters no more
See nothing it dont matter
See nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
Cause nothing even matters no more
No more no more no more 
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
No no more
To me to me to me to me
To me to me to me to me to me to me
FREESTYLE SINGING TO END
