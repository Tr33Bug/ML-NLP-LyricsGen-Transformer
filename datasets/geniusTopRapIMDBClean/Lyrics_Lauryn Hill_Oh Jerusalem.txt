Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Realizing that theres no place else to go
And theres nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I cant see because the worlds on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect cause Im morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing Im alive when Im still dead
Limited to earth unable to find out my worth
Cause I cant see past my own vanity
If Im not included then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor that Ive only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see its me in the way
What a paradox having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending that Im actually defending
God through my facade dont need material
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating were in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesnt understand
Bringing up those things we dont want to discuss
Why still do evil we dont know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us whats going on will be alright
Oh so repressed so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride Im hiding is whats stopping me
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine ye are the branches he that lives in me
And I in him the same bring forth much fruit
Without me you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem youre traditions have deceived you
Ive chosen you you havent chosen me
Do whatsoever you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die Oh Jerusalem please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
Its not the talkers but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Oh Jerusalem
