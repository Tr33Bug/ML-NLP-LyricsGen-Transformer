Old pirates yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption song
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Yes some say its just a part of it
But weve got to fulfill the book
Wont you help to sing
Another song of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption song
Redemption song
Redemption songs
Yeah L Boogie
Yo if they can stop this fruit
They would pop this route
Chop this fruit
Treat us like a prostitute
Knock this youth
See me in my cocky suit
Gods recruit
From fallin even Gods salute
Tribal truth
Ja people cant be mute
Share my youth to Babylon cant regroup
Sing to Babylon cant regroup
Sing to Babylon cant regroup


Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say its just a part of it
Weve got to fulfill the book
Wont you help to sing
Another song of freedom yeah
Cause all I ever have
Redemption song
Redemption song  Haha 
Redemption song  Yeah 
Redemption song  Hey 
Redemption song
