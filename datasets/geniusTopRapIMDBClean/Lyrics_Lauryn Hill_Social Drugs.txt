These social drugs 
Verse 1 
Afraid to address the reality before me
To proud to confess that Im addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feeling
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I have died
But Ive been taught to numb it
Sedated dont confront it
I hate it when I find out
That I cant get what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip
To hide this condemnation
Ill find a combination
Of manmade stimulation
To deny my situation
Now this unreality
Is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security
So in my imagination
I must find a recreation
Desperately in search of ways
To alter my sensation
Theres no equilibrium
Inebriated till Im numb
Intoxicated until Im dumb
To avoid confrontation
These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These social drugs
Telling me Im fine
Verse 2 
Now this chemical analogy
Is our emotional reality
These political traditional
And ethnical stimulants
And social etiquette
Wont let us be too upset
With the way things really are
Youre told to camouflage regret
In a religious structure
Tells us God wants us to suffer
To support a situation we all know is obligation

And if you shun the complication
Theyll just gun your reputation
Like mob intimidation
To enforce participation
See they need to keep us fiends
To their lies and broken schemes
And if you find another means
Youre told youre being too extreme
And if you wanted to get clean
Theyll just pull those social strings
Holding up their social nose
Defying noble things
Now were all stuck in tradition
Unable to state opposition
Too afraid to contradict
The expectations of the system
Oh and the harsh reality
Is they made grace for you and me
Instead of saving you and me
Theyre just enslaving you and me
These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
Know what I mean
Know what I mean
These social drugs
These social drugs 
Know what I mean
These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These
Telling me Im fine
These
Messing with my head
These social drugs
Wanting me dead
Know what I mean
