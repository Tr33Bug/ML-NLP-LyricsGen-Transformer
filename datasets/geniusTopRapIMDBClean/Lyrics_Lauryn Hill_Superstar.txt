Say what Hiphop started out in the heart
Yo now everybody tryin to chart
Cmon now baby cmon now baby cmon now baby cmon uhh
Cmon now baby cmon now baby cmon now baby cmon
Cmon baby light my fire  Come on 
Everything you drop is so tired  Everything 
Music is supposed to inspire  Music is supposed to inspire 
How come we aint gettin no higher  How come how come 
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality
Now who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because  Just because just because 
Theres always someone there wholl applaud
Cmon baby light my fire  Come on 
Everything you drop is so tired  Everything you drop is so tired 
Music is supposed to inspire  What are we here for what are we here for 
How come we aint gettin no higher  Gettin no higher 
I know you think that youve got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think youre unable to fall
But when you do who you gonna call
See what you give is just what you get  What you give is just what you get 
I know it hasnt hit you yet  I know it hasnt hit you yet 
Now I dont mean to get you upset  Get upset get upset 
But every cause has an effect uhhuh
Cmon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired  Yeah 
Music is supposed to inspire  Music is supposed to inspire 
How come we aint gettin no higher  We aint no higher we aint no higher 
I cross sands in distant lands made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak Uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker they fired me I fronted
Or I quitted now I spit it however do you want it
Now you get it
Writing rhymes in the Range with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented  Lauryn Hill 
And if your lines sound like mine Im taking a percentage  kaching 
Unprecedented and still respected when its vintage
Im serious Im takin over areas in Aquarius
Runnin red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar you stupid star
Theyll hail you then nail you no matter who you are
Theyll make you now then take you down and make you face it
If you slit the bag open put your pinky in it and taste it
Cmon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired  Everything you drop everything you drop 
Music is supposed to inspire  Oh yeah 
How come we aint gettin no higher  We aint getting no higher getting no higher 
Cmon baby light my fire  Cmon baby light my fire 
Everything you drop is so tired  Everything you drop is so tired 
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we aint gettin no higher  How come we aint gettin no higher 
Cmon baby light my fire  Come on baby 
Everything you drop is so tired  Everything you drop is so tired 
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we aint gettin no higher  We aint no higher
