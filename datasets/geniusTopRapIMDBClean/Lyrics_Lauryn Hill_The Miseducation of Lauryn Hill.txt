My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I cant breathe
And every time Ive tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up I wasnt able to achieve
But deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny  And deep in my heart 
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
