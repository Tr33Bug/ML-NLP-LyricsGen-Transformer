Its the mystery of iniquity
Said its the misery of Inequity
Said its the history of Inequity
When it all all falls down
Telling you all it all falls down
Children eat your bread
Little children eat your bread
Cause it all all falls down
Telling you all it all falls down
Yo Yall cant handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors witness despised
Crooked lawyers false indictments publicized
Its entertainment the arraignments the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon blackrobe crookedbalance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that In God We Trust
Crossexamined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judges favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status gratis apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution political prostitution
The more money you pay the further away solution
Legal actors Babylons benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants morally noncompliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isnt making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing hes being used
To discredit edit headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness  the paid authority 
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers dodging duty for years
Hating the process waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct Properly serve and protect
Materially corrupt spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind guilty never defined
Filthy as swine a generation purin its own mind
Legal extortion blown out of proportion
In vein deceit the truth is obsolete
Only two positions victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the American Corona
The Revolving Door insanity every floor
Skyscraping paper chasing what are we working for
Empty traditions reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief brethren can we candidly speak
Woe to the men trusted in the chariots dem
Leaning on horses they run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first angelic being cast to the earth
Its time for rebirth burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed let him who stole no longer steal
Oh its real surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh selfinterest Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be retaught
Youll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die
Loving a lie not realizing in Adam all die


Its the mystery of iniquity
Said its the history of Inequity
Said its the misery of Inequity
When it all all falls down yeah
Im telling you all it all falls down
