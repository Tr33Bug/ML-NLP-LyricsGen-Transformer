The unexpected
Multidimensional
Unexpected sound of the Refugee AllStars
The sweetest thing Ive ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk your style of dress
I wish I didnt get so weak
Oooh baby just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much youre in love with me
See like the queen upon her throne
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing Ive known
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing Ive known
I get mad when you walk away  dont walk away 
So I tell you leave when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious precious precious precious precious baby dark skin tone
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing Ive known
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing Ive known
It was the
Ah
I tried to explain
Ahbut baby its in vain
Speaking on my mothers phone
The touching makes me think Im grown  you aint grown 
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armaretto
Intoxicating  Intoxicationg 
Oh so intoxicating  Intoxicating 
How sad  so sad  how sad that all things come to an end


But then again  again  Im Im not alone
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing Ive known
Ah
I sometimes watch you in your sleep
Ah
Excuse me if I get to deep  Ha
