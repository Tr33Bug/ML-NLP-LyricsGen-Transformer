One day youre gonna understand
Zion
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a manchild would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
Lauryn baby use your head
But instead I chose to use my heart
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion  Zion Zion 
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion  Zion uhh Zion 
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zions door
Ive never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And Im reminded every time I see your face
That the joy  Joy 
Of my world  World 
Is in Zion  Is in Zion 
Is in Zion  Is in Zion 
Now the joy  Joy 
Of my world  World 
Is in Zion  Is in Zion is in Zion 
Now the joy  Joy 
Of my world  World 
Is in Zion  Is in Zion is in Zion 
Now the joy  Joy 
Of my world  World 
Is in Zion  Is in Zion is in Zion

Willingness to do everything for that person
Okay everything like what Explain Let him talk cmon If I asked him to talk about a fancy car hed be right on point But we wanna talk about love You can do it  To another pupil  What do you think You said you love somebody you should know why you love them right
The way they act
Uhhuh
The way they carry themselves stuff like that
Okay
The way that they hang with they boys and they just stand out Its like sometimes it dont even matter like what they wear or what they look like Its like that way you know
Yeah
Its like you know you want to talk to him because he stands out its like he got a glow or something
Thats deep
Thats what Im talking about
I thought that was a beautiful point Anyone else want to deal with that
Its sometimes like when they try to act funny in front of they boys like when they get around say they love you They cant love you Cause lovelovelove wouldnt do that
Love is not phony
