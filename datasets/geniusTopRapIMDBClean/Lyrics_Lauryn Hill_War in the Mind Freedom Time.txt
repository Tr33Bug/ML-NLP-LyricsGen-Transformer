War in the Mind  Freedom Time  Lyrics
Everybody knows that they guilty
Everybody knows that theyve lied
Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Time to get free or give yourselves up now
Its freedom said its freedom time
Yo theres a war in the mind over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms keepin us in forms of religion
Conformin our vision
To the world churchs decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin our tape recorders
From hearin like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
Whats got em drunk off the spirits
Truth comes we cant hear it
When youve been programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin in indescision
Apallin callin religious
Some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of AntiChrist the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin
The head or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin doctrines of Baal
Causin people to fail
Keepin the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin desperation to get the best of me
Punishment til there was nothing left of me
Realizin the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine supernatural circumcision
Inwardly only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity shapen in
Theres no escapin when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a mans heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow makin love with a whore
Achin in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where theres no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
Whats goin on whats a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasnt a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned let them with ears understand
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom said its freedom time now
Its freedom Imma be who I am
Its freedom time said its freedom time
Everybody knows that theyve lied
Everybody knows that theyve perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they guilty yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free be who youre supposed to be
Freedom said its freedom time now
Freedom said its freedom time
Freedom freedom time now
