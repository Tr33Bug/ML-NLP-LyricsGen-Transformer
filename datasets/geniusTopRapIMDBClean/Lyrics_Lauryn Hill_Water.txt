Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat
Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears
Hes just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Hes just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Coursing through my senses hes prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you
Hes just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Hes just like the water the water
I aint felt this way in years
Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination No no
Hes pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning Im so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land
Hes just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Hes just like the water
I aint felt this way in years
Cleaning me
Hes purging me
And moving me around
Hes bathing me
And hes claiming me
And moving me around
Around and around and around
And around
Watching me claiming me
Moving me around
Hes purging me
Hes been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around
And around
Around
Around
Moving me around
