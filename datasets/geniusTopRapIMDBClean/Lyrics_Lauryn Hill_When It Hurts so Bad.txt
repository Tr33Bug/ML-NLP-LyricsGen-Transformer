When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
Whys it feel so good  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
I loved real real hard once
But the love wasnt returned
Found out the man Id die for
He wasnt even concerned
I tried and I tried and I tried
To keep him in my life  to keep him in my life 
I cried and I cried and I cried
But I couldnt make it right
But I I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then youd understand
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it
If you dont catch it if you dont catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it  if you just let it 
If you just let it  if you just let it 
See I thought this feeling it was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad  gave up my power 
Gave up my power I existed for you
But whoever knew the voodoo youd do
But I I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then youd understand


That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it  if you dont catch it 
if you dont catch it 
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it  if you just let it 
If you just let it  if you just let it 
See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it  if you dont catch it 
if you dont catch it 
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it  if you just let it 
If you just let it  if you just let it 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
Whys it feel so good  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
Whys it feel so good  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad  when it hurts so bad 
So bad  when it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
When it hurts so bad 
You aint said nothin
Why you aint say somethin to me
Boy 1 
I feel like love right now is like confusion
Its like people think they love somebody
When they dont really love somebody
Like I thought I was in love with this girl but I really wasnt
Its like now I dont feel about her
Laughter 
Ok Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin to do with
Why people are always confused about love
Girl 1 
Yes 
Why
Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music
And it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you 
We need to put you on a bullhorn
Let you ride around Newark
