My Aunt Dot
Left a Glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up then she hit the streets
Even though Im her niece she copped me a piece
Wackass caliber nickelplated with the silencer
What She dont know I like my guns pretty
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twinglizzies
I heard a knock at the door knock knock knock knock knock
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you
Whattup Im Shanice dont remember me
She called me by my government name Kimberly
Who sent you
My mom sent me her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
Hmmph she was cute and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack with the hat to match
Bvlgari hiking boots with the mink bubblegoose
And I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
Then she handed me the note
Here read this
I just stared her up and down
Cause I couldnt believe this then I opened it
It said Bitches is out to get you
Your socalled friends put a bomb in your Benz
Im on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
They know where you live so evacuate the crib
And oh the little girl thats your cousin Shanice
Since I cant be with her I need you to babysit her
Besides she looks up to you youre her idol
And tomorrow is her first violin recital
And she would be more than happy if you could take her
Peace my numbers on the back of the paper hit me later
Damn what went wrong
Cant we all just get along and make hit songs
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show yall hoes would get gonged
Cause if its on then its on bring it on
What the fuck you waitin for Cmon lets get it on
What Whats takin you so long I got plans for the future
To bring back your head like Medusa
Girls be actin stink and mad funny
Yall bitches bleed like me on the monthly
Cant stand the pain then pop a Humphrey
I know it hurts  Im killin yall 
Girls be actin stink and mad funny
Yall bitches bleed like me on the monthly

Uhh we in the Range in this fucked up weather
Its snowin and Im tryin to put the whole shit together
How Laverne she always wanted to be like me
And dress like me and look like me
And Nicole its like she lived in my house
Askin me for money day in  day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all come to find out her name is Keisha
Cmon Shanice Im takin you to my house in Alpine
I wanna go with you  Uhh be quiet and well get along fine
Cmon please I wanna be just like you
600 Mercedes and 380s in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barrettes and
Hclass rocks inside my Baby G Shock
Fuck Barney and Lambchops I dont love them hoes
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes XandOs
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil Nique and Jus then take em to ToysRUs
Make em spend they cheese then kick em out and take the bus
Im the StheHtheAtheNtheItheCtheE
But all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what I like the green know what I mean
Ever seen The Professional  uhhuh  Well I can clean
You know what I like you little big person
But rule number one no cursin
Anyway what you know about that
You too young for that when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone to call my Aunt Dot
So she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm nineoneseven eightfiveeight twoonetwotwo
Hello Yo whats the deal
Why these bitches buggin out
I mean whats this all about
See its sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They dont want you to win no more
Soul Train they dont want you to attend no more
And I guess thats why they aint your friends no more
The other day when I was comin out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door
For real Yup then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat
Then I dumped her on a deadend street
The other two Yeah they still linger
But dont you lift a finger Ima get em
So just pray I come home
And when we hang up get rid of your phone
Whoo When Aunt Dot comes oh brother
Its like five Bloody Marys one after another
Hmmph she have you stressed no wearin white no sex
And when she get vexed you guess what happens next
Cause them other two girls thats still on the menu
Is the reason why the story is to be continued


Girls be actin stink and mad funny
Yall bitches bleed like me on the monthly
Cant stand the pain then pop a Humphrey
I know it hurts  Im killin yall
