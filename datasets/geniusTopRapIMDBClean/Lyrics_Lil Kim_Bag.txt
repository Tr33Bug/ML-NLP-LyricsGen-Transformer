People looking at me different people looking at me funny
Had to put some distance had to keep these stank niggas from me
Ive been gone for a minute cause I was getting to the money
Came from the gutter like a bum boy
Fuck niggas get money still thats the protocol
Yes sir Im still hardcore
Numero uno but you know a bitchll still draw for her
My fans want an encore
Beach house overseas thats the meaning of a north shore
I used to move that white boy Justin Bieber
You a atheist Ill make you a believer
Mink dragging on the floor Im sayin fuck PETA like Tara and Amina
I know people wanna see me fall
So I dont fuck with anyone at all
Moneyll run from you if you chase it
Just sit back and have some patience
I be dodging them shots like the Matrix
Queen of diamonds sippin aces
Got the money in a chokehold blue faces
And some more mills comin I can taste it yeah
Give me that bag give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag give me that bag
Im only here for the bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me
Im a bad gyal so you know I move in silence
Im a humble crook I get your ass booked
And still scream Stop the Violence
Most hated but I love that
Most underrated but Im so above that
Cut you with the same knife you put in my back
Try me if you want youll be missing more than a hubcap
Now run and tell that to TMZ
Its the principle dont try to lean on me
And what the fuck is twenty Gs
I get more than that to sip Ros in VIP
I keep the bag on me like Im Santa Claus
He feeling on my titties like Diana Ross
Im so A1 dont really need the sauce
These yellow diamonds really piss a nigga off
Bezel so cold I gotta thaw it out
Kim put that work and never call out
Dope girls more than bass in these speakers
Shoebox money aint no space for the sneakers
I aint stressing comments on the internet
Im just adding commas to a bigger check
Im just adding diamonds to a new Patek
I keep these haters sick get them Mucinex


Give me that bag give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag give me that bag
Im only here for the bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me
You know I keep the bag on me
Every day I be getting to the money
All my life I been getting to the money  Oh 
Bitches hating cause Im getting to the money  Oh 
I be getting to the money  Oh 
All of these ones all over the floor let em go  Oh 
All to the door all to the door  Let em go 
Give me that bag give me that bag
All I want is that bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
I came back for the bag
Give me that bag give me that bag
Im only here for the bag
Give me the bag give me that bag
You know I keep the bag on me
