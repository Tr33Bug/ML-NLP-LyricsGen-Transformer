Big Momma Thang  Remix  LyricsI used to be scared of the dick
Now I throw lips to the shit handle it like a real bitch
Heather Hunter Janet Jacme
Take it in the butt  yes yes what
I got land in the Switzerland even got sand in the Marylands
Bahamas in the spring baby its a big momma thing
Cant you tell by the diamonds in my rings
Thats how many times I wanna cum twentyone
And another one and another one and another one
24 carats nigga thats when Im fuckin wit the average nigga
Work the shaft brothers be battin me and oh
Dont ya like the way I roll and play wit my bushy
Tell me whats on your mind when your tongues in the pussy
Is it marriage 
Baby carriage 
Shit no on a dime shit is mine got to keep em comin all the time
Why Lil Ceas
Chorus repeat 2X
Killahs be quiet my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk tough walk that shit is tired
You wanna be this queen B but ya cant be
Thats why youre mad at me
Verse Two
Hoes think Im foul call me the bitch shitter
The lyrical gonna take a miracle
Like Deniece Williams bitches get ill by the 6 shoota
Gunz we got a lotta you cant see me notalot
Want it raw dog well you best to see Poppa
Get your tits licked wouldnt it be glourous
If you you give head to Notorious then say my crew

Just a dick suckin ready for some ass fuckin
Let me stress the tattoo on your breast
BIG your rockin my property PYP play your position

Plus I give head better than you
Pussy get wetter than you fuck better than you
I dedicate this song to ya ass
Like R Kelly and that twin Pac up in your belly

Chorus
Verse Three
Saw a nigga whwh pussy greases up
Stack da skeeza keep em knees up

Geneva diva yeah I throws it down
Lay around clown the clock steps for no one
Never 68 and owe 1 takes one to know one
Better of wit da Playboy magazines uh fuckin wit da Don
Pussy tease heres three for takes
Yeah I ride crate state to state
Lieutenant then it takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you day dreamin wine I just keep gettin mine

Yall our strategy misses still planin wettins
Mafio also deadins all that bullshit
Any type of threatens to pull shit

Maybe next time keep your head up
Chorus
