Its funny cause you know weve been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean clearly youve been having this thing with Kim
And I dont know just thinking about you and where you were from and that youre a rapper
And Im thinking sure I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming
Even though you say its not specifically about her that Romans Revenge is for Kim
Umm you know she just really jumped out the window and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And thats what Ive learned in this business you just never know
Shut the fuck up
Who the fuck want war
FedEx beef straight to your front door
Itll be a murder scene
Im turnin Pink Friday to Friday the 13th
Aight you Lil Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery the shit stops now
Time for you to lay down Im sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last names what got you your job
Yous a put together gimmick somethin like a collage
Since you puttin on a show you gon get the applause
Clap clap lift your frame like a fucking garage yeah
This hood shit you and Drake aint built for
This the shit the other bitch almost got killed for
Im still countin what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keep spinnin like its syndicated
Corny broad Ill leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch should have been deflated
This aint a championship fight Ive been the greatest
See the fact is what you doing I did it
Lames tryna clone my style and run with it
Thats cool I was the first one with it
Yous a Lil Kim wanna be you just hate to admit it
Im the blueprint you aint nothin brand new
Check your posters and videos youll always be number two
I seen em come I seen em go still I remain
Sweetie you goin on your fourteenth minute of fame
Im over ten years strong still running the game
Cut the comparisons Im in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot child please Im solidified
With my hands tied you couldnt beat me if you bitches tried
Either youre high or sippin that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado brainstorm
I drop bombs Flex napalms
Black and yellow well pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppes when I step out posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink like my kitty sayin Hello
If I whistle theyll pistol whip you in all five boroughs
Im from Brooklyn I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me
Youre the type to run your mouth and then run from me
Im poppin off in your hood with no company
Come on Queens aint showin you no love
I was there the other night poppin bottles with the thugs
Youre like Washington heffer Im Benji
You got a buzz right now I had a frenzy
Oh yeah welcome to the fam Fendi
You need to stop youre not hot youre a burnin match
That means the end is near soon copy that
Oh I see they really got you gassed like Im a thing of the past
Better slow down dummy you bout to crash
Stank pussy ho Im givin you a bath
Thermometer in hand and Im comin for your ass ha
Who you think you gettin past
I see right through you your whole shit is made of glass
I draw back Im a Brooklyn thorough bitch rep for my borough bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team all I see is a bunch of weirdos
Yous an airhead bitch scarecrow
Ha aint nothin old but my money bitch
Ha this is grown liquid assets
Benjamins my daddy you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh taught by the great
So on my next move Im yellin Checkmate
I smell a massacre
Charles Manson you dont stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin like lunch to me
Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
Youre hilarious thanks for all the laughs
Youre garbage so Im takin out the trash
You shit on me Come on baby girl
Aint enough ass shots in the world
Youre a nuisance youd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me so chuck it up deuces
All around the world I ball like a ball team
I stack chips call me Mrs Rothstein
Tricks is for kids silly rabbit youre my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring


I mean I know I know you guys asked me if Romans Revenge was about Kim
And no I its not about Kim
Actually if Kim thought it was about her Im so sorry
Im so sorry I apologize Kim
I dont know I just had temporary insanity I lost my teeth and my mind
