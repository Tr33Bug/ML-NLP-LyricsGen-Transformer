You say What is it that you want
Youve got everything that a woman could ever need in life
I got a closet full of minks chinchillas
I got a bureau full of diamonds I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin to eat lobster and drink champagne now you know that aint your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread baby
Now you know if anybody know I know
But since you feel like that this evening sit down and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none
But you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as Lil Kim the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole Gotti family stay up
This time around I aint takin no shit
This time around Ill never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the Pits and put Rotts by the do
This time around it aint like befo
This time around Im gon crack ya jaw
The feds is watchin me so I cant do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
Im back on the scene my favorite color is green
Im buildin a empire got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me
Musics my first love a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you


I came back for you
All incarcerated Scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybodys waitin on me all these hoes is hatin on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin
Its the real hiphop mami check the facts
Im sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tryna go against the queen is you out of your mind
Even bein number two your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam he shouldve made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
Its enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick  Uh 
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
Im gettin money dont think I just be lettin shit slide
Im very concerned with fashion aint my fault yall dont know how to
Rock this Hollyhood thang yall need to let me style you
Come back to the light ma I started the shit
How soon we forget Im the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as Im around you gon bow down
I came back for you
All incarcerated Scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybodys waitin on me all these hoes is hatin on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin
This time around either you in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
Cause Im the best that ever done it the best that lived it
I aint no overnight success goddamn it I was born with it
The Prada mama the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The blue Hpnotiq martini mimosasippin
Yall better team or get it together
Or you you and her can get it whenever

If the shoe was on the other foot youd probably try to stomp me

This Bed Stuy fly girl came back for Brooklyn  Brooklyn
