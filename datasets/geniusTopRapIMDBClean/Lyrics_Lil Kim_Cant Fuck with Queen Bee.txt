Its a new day
And all you gossipin backstabbin habitual haters
Youre all history  hisssstory 
So you can hate or hail the Queen  all hail the Queen 
But it dont matter  but it dont matter 
Cause you aint got nuttin for us  you aint got nothin for us 
So as long as you live remember this
You cant fuck with Queen Bee Queen Bee Queen Bee
All you haters will see see see
Dont be mad I cant put this  money in a casket
I cant put these  cars in a box with the ashes
I cant take these diamonds with me when I die
I cant build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you hate dyin  but you gon die a hater
I got a vision I think for the future baby pah
Yall nearsighted lotta yall cant see that far
Rocks like the street light  baby watch em glow
Red yellow and green  dont know whether to stop or go
Im a chameleon I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time
From Hardcore to Notorious you studied my flow
And still
Governor ad libs
Whether ya slingin the rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Or just a fiend for this Queen Bitch of hiphop
Kimmie bag dudes from the barbershop to the car show
The industry down to Wall Street
They ask


What is she like what does she need
What is her type I wanna give it to her tell her please
Be my girl Ill give her anything
Whatever her heart desires in this whole world
Just cause you aint a millionaire dont mean you cant compete
You aint gotta be filthy rich but you cant be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind straight out the streets
He gotta have security power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck
Governor 
You can get with Queen Bee  yall can get with Queen Bee 
Queen Bee  yeah ye yeah  Queen Bee  awww 
Take you to ecstasy  she gon take yall to ecstasy 
Ecstasy  do it to em Queen Bee  Ecstasy
Yeah its yo time baby its yo time girl 
Aint nuttin gon change my name gon get bigger
Its in the cards for Lil Kim to get richer and richer
So like it or not I am who I am
When I die hold my body in the Brooklyn Museum
Now take it to the bridge
