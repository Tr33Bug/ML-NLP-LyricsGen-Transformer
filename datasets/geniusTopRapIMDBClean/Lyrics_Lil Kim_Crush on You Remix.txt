Crush on You  Remix  Lyrics
Undeas
Lil Ceaser
Queen B
Thats Me
Lil Kim
Yo I be buyin em Vs so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage dyin to get pleased
You got me I rock thee Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards thats invalid
I get clothes custom made from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get callus
Take you on a natural high like a pilot
It be all good toss your clothes like a salad
When its all over put your vote in my ballot
Its my diner Im Mel and youre Alice
Spend a night in Lil Cease palace
It be all good as long as you dont act childish
While you standin there with the Crist in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush uhh
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
Ayo shorty wont you go get a bag of the lethal
Ill be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin Ima cheat you
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets I got my own baguettes
And Ill be doin things that you wont regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee so you best take heed
Shall I proceed  Yes indeed 
Ima throw shade if I cant get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchygitchyyaya with the marmalade
Who me Not you oh yes whos he
I even dig yo mans style but I love yo profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But dont blush just keep this on the hush
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze Im in the PVs
All chrome D3s decked out TVs
CDs with crazy bass keep my lady laced
Dont be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan thats to rise to the top
I told you before when I first pursued
I want a interlude in the nude
You know I love the way you feela sip my tequila
Works from the dealers fulllength chinchilla
Heat up the clutch sevenfifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch breakin trees in the dutch
Im not the one you sleep wit to eat quick
Want a cheap trick better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick in my six with my Christian LaCroix
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video  true 
I know you heard me on the radio  true 
But you still dont pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
Hes a slut hes a ho hes a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
Its cool not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
