See some niggas dont know how to act
So Im about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin down niggas cribs
When we met I cant front I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin hard to get
Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didnt take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin sprees and puttin money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heartshaped lockets
And my girls knew you wasnt no good
They told me bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl
Memories is all it brings when I look at my rings
And Heartbreaker is the song I sing  cmon cmon 
Heartbreaker dream maker

Breakfast in Paris dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach yeah we had it goin on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years and now you wanna dump me
And just to think I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin one too
You wrong Nigga dead wrong you know the song
Dont know what youve got til its gone
After the fight the other night and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up I was Waiting to Exhale
Thats right
