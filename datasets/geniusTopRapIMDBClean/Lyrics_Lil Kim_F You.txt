Nine shots greet ya greet ya hang with Lil Ceaseah
But dont sling pizza pizza
The gat carryin rap barbarian
Ninetysix Blake Carrington
I brings the most dangerous diseases
Trife please MCs of all types
Homosexuals dykes intellectuals like my flow my charm
Wifey on the arm and stay fucking other bitches
Style never switches
Inhale exhale bail Nino Brown out
For shootin up a townhouse in Hempstead kids fled
Rumors was dead no beef with no cliques
Niggas dont want shit Trife impresses
Lexus GSs chicks in iceberg dresses
Who the best is MAFIA
But faggot niggas wanna spoil it
Stop me from having marble faucets and gold toilets
I force it down your throat like sodomy mama proud of me
Cause I stopped killing niggas for free
Uhh uhh
The Anne Klein sportin coke snortin niggas lovely
I keep my pussy Fresh like Doug E watch the show
As my flow bubble over like Mos and Cristals
Aint scared to bust my pistal sippin hard on Cristal
Dream accounts large amounts
Cause Frank dont play with lye money get high money
Ready to die Grady no ifs ands or maybes
Im not your average lady put that on my 380
Me and my bitch catch flights to Texas
Niggas call us Crystal and Alexis
Bump into some hoes that be in Houston boostin
Trunk full of Donna Karan in the rental LeBaron
Uh who us
We just swervin in the dark blue Suburban
Drinking Bourbon with Heinekens for the chaser
Policell never chase us we too fly for that
Processed and fingerprinted we too dime for that
I be flirtin for certain wearing short skirts and
But aint no dicks insertin see thats the difference
Between me and other bitches they fuck to get they riches
I fuck to bust a nut Lil Kim not a slut
I gotta reputation to look out for
Plus my boss is a outlaw


Uhhh motherfuckers think they tough guys
Motherfuckers better hold hands stepping up
Faggot ass motherfuckers
They really aint no true players
Death comes to those that oppose the clique
Dickriders get off the dick
Cause Larceny got guns for yall
And if I get bagged my lawyers got tons of ones for yall
Catching cases niggas pull they macs out
Niggas getting mad cause I dug they backs out
Then I blacks out start shooting kids
Cribs is vicious making my escape jumping bridges
Malicious sometimes the danger taste delicious
Rule number three dont take love from no bitches
You know what makes me much stronger than you
I can take pain much longer than you
So what you gon do when I run up in that asscrease
How you wanna spit a grease
