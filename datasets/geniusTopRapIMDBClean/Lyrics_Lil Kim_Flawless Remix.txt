Flawless  Remix  Lyrics
Dumdadeda
Do do do do do do
Coming down dripping candy on the groun 
Its that Yonc your Yonc
In that lingerie on that chardonnay
Scorin touchdowns on your runway
Im Texas forever like Bun B
And Im redboned yo
Im really rit like Donjae
Im camo in here yo
These thots cant clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy you know I look good as fuck
You wish I was your babymomma
Want me to come around and give you good karma but no
We escalate up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When its a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When its a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha ha God damn God damn God damn 
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine  Im flawless 
You wake up flawless
Post up flawless
Ridin round in it flawless
Flossin on that flawless
This diamond flawless
My diamond flawless
This rock flawless
My Roc flawless
I woke up like this I woke up like this
We flawless ladies tell em
I woke up like this I woke up like this
We flawless ladies tell em
Say I look so good tonight
God damn God damn
Say I look so good tonight
God damn God damn God damn
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldnt change it if I could
If I could if I if I could 
And you can say what you want
Im the shit  what you want Im the shit 
Im the shit Im the shit Im the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn God damn God damn
Onika

Dior lipstick with the mascara
Kissin myself in the rearview mirror
Head game so presidential spit on a dick like an instrumental
