Heavenly father Creator of all things
I humble myself As I bow to the throne
I pray for love joy peace and happiness
I pray for love I pray for love
I pray for love joy peace and happiness
They say the closest ones to ya
Be the ones that sneak up behind ya and stick the knife through ya
Thats why now I keep my friends to a minimum
Check for the ones wit the venom on they tongue
Cuz niggas is snakes they hugs be fake
Steal from they best friend at his own wake
I did all I can do and I took all I can take
This is it crossin me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20 of what I make
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake
Aint enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out keepin a roof over our head
Enough is enough I wash my hands Im done wit it
I aint playin wit u motherfuckers come wit it
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
But shit aint been the same since BI died
I pray for love I pray for love
I pray for love joy peace and happiness 
Every day every night
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
I pray for love I pray for love
I pray for love joy peace and happiness 
Every day and every night
Shit aint been the same since BI died
Lil Kim the first rap bitch to shake up the charts

When the money is gone  So is ya friends 
When the gas runs out  there goes ya Benz 
They just dont make my breed no more
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more
I dont deal wit the nonsense Im keepin it real
Wanna do business wit me Get in touch wit Hill
Thats right any questions No you cant ask me
Put ya name and ya number on a letterhead and fax me

Imma remain loyal while yall crumble like the foil
Its tradition to rock diamonds in my crown Im royal
Niggas aint believe in me they thought it was over
Baby girl risin up like the early mornin sun
Yall think yall know but yall have no idea

Im sayin I just wanna be happy thats all I dont ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile you know what Im sayin

Nobody lives by the code of the street no more 
Id sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me
You see thats just how I am
Cuz Im a rider  Keep the fam together god knows I tried 
What good is it to have everything
If you cant share it with the one you love
If you cant be wit the ones you love then love the ones you wit
Dont take nobody for granted
You aint promised tomorrow
Karmas a motherfucker
Im appreciative  Paybacks a motherfucker put that on the Stuy
