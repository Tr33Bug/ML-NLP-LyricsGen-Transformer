Oh how it hurts like childbirth
The wounds heal slow you just dont know
At times I dont know what to say
And all I do is pray day to day
But still I feel my strength might die
Like right now Im tryin hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes I still see it
Damn I just dont believe it
The bad times I buried like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin off of one mans death
Dont you worry BI Ima ride to my last breath
You killas caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin hate you excuse my frustration
But just when Im about to quit God tells me to just
Dont you give up be strong
Hold on hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times they aint last so long
Hold on hold on
If you believe they will get better
Frank White the man with the money and the fame
Passed away now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No ones no Vs we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that aint patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote em in my will
And Ima make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do or who I got to kill
Shit is real baby there aint no appeal
If Im fucked up imagine how Mrs Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies dont think I havent walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin to you righ
Heres my shoulder you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me I know exactly what youre going through
Dont you give up be strong
Hold on hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times they aint last so long
Hold on hold on
If you believe they will get better
I got your back
So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed stressed dont know whos my real friends
One things for sure I can count on my mens
DRoc Money L Lil Cease and PD
My whole BI family remind me of you
We miss you so much I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We aint happy but we fakin
And to New York thanks for the support
And all our real fans Im shoutin out the whole land
This is somethin young kids just wont understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on but a song can only be so long
Its been hard but I told God that I put up a fight
So heres a Long Kiss Goodnight Frank White
