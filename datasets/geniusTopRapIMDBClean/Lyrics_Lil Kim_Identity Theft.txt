I get a feeling theres gonna be a riot
Uh its looking like Im headed back behind bars again
Cause bitches wanna start with Kim and I aint with the arguing
Im jet chartering fresh cardigan
Getting my Martha in while these broke hoes borrowing
I guess its back to stashing guns in the bra again
Pulling bitches out they car again
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look
Pop shit on Twitter and apologize on Facebook
And now they wanna send me requests
Telling me that Im simply the best
I wont stop till I see my enemies rest
They probably get locked up for identity theft
I aint got time for bum bitches the gun get it
I come with it anything you tryna do I done did it
Ill let you live for a while but Im dying with the crown
The queens back bitches come get it
What yall want huh
What yall want huh Huh huh
Be careful what yall wish for 
Cause now shes pissed off 
And yall gon feel her reign 
This what yall want huh
This what yall want huh Huh huh
Yall got just what yall wished for 
Cause now shes pissed off 
And yall gon feel her reign 
Since you resist on running your jibbs off
After I drop these flowers for BIG off
Imma come and blow your lid off like Adolf
Rolling up the tints then peel off
Better wear your crosses and roseries read the Quran
Pray to Allah for you think about approaching me
Uh all I rock with is gutter niggas
Cut all affiliations with sucka niggas
I got bitches thatll gunbutt a nigga like Tameka and Tammy uh
I gave birth to your style watch how you speak to ya mammy
Your team cant fuck with my family
And I aint talking Internal Revenue
Im talking IRS the Goodfella crew
Uh you was never hard check my repertoire
Fuck cash my name is a black card


What yall want huh
What yall want huh Huh huh
Be careful what yall wish for 
Cause now shes pissed off 
And yall gon feel her reign 
This what yall want huh
This what yall want huh Huh huh
Yall got just what yall wished for 
Cause now shes pissed off 
And yall gon feel her reign 
I get a feeling theres gonna be a riot
