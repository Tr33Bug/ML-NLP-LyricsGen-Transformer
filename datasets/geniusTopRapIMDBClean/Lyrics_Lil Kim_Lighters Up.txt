I come from BedStuy
Where niggas either do or they gon die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack weed and powder
Fiends come through every hour
Its all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle
The strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
Its the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after
Now put your lighters up  BedStuy 
Put your lighters up  New York 
Put your lighters up  DC 
Keep putting your lighters up  Philadelphia 
Put your lighters up  Detroit 
Put your lighters up  ChiTown 
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from put your lighters up
Now let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you dont do
Where its not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Dont come through if niggas dont know you
Cause people is talking
The streets is watching
The Ds is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn dont run we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We dont play that
Out in BK not at all
Gor a pound leave your face on the wall
RIP in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn
Now put your lighters up  LA 
Put your lighters up  VA 
Put your lighters up  Texas 
Keep putting your lighters up  New Orleans 
Put your lighters up  St Louis 
Put your lighters up  ATL 
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from put your lighters up
Damn homie Im so tore
And I dont think Im ever gone smoke no more
And I dont think Im ever gone drink no more
But fuck it bartender you can give me one more
We in the club like 
Damn homie Im so tore
Lighting the dutch like 
And I dont think Im ever gone smoke no more
Passing the bub like 
And I dont think Im ever gone drink no more
Back at the bar like 
Fuck it bartender you can give me one more
See BIG done told you
Im the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you dont understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la seorita ms linda del barrios
Y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So Imma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12yearolds prostituting
Hitmen hired for execution
Theres no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you dont know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn
Now put your lighters up  New Jersey 
Put your lighters up  Boston 
Put your lighters up  Bmore 
Keep putting your lighters up  Miami 
Put your lighters up  Puerto Rico 
Put your lighters up  Kingston Jamaica 
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from put your lighters up
