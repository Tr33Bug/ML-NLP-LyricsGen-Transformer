MAFIA Land Lyrics
Yeah uhh
In the MAFIAs land yall
Where loyalty is everything
The MAFIA forgives but never forgets
Heh let me tell you
In the MAFIAs land where theres one boss and one clan
Yes mans they surround us like steaks in pans
All em wanna be the man right hands wash the left hands
Loyaltys priority in this fam
Where lifes initiated aint no givin it back
Once you in it like Bennett youll soon be lieutenant
Like me the Don Juan thats Yvonne
The sweata the money getter
Coppin mad cheddar
Stevie was Wondering how I got in this position
One day Frank was fishin for competition expedition
Number one his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano 96 stickshift cross the Verrazano
I lay gently in the Bentley through binoculars he seemed popular
Givenchy socks Cartier coolats
Hclass rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like leukemians receding hairlines
Watch how genuine this gold mine recline
When Frank pops the wine I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped they clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit
Tried to play Big Poppa dont worry
Minutes before I drop her the blow blow blow
Like a parolee the bitch violated
So how you like it coffins or cremated
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
Street murderers thug parasites
We official no fake gators
Coppin firearms with dud missles
We leavin scar tissues
That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga what threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle knuckles
Damn How could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence
And throw our whole shit off balance
But still they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside the Devils triangle
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One crosseyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with Black
The third nigga had missin teeth and tattoo teardrops
Long hair chest felt like a bag of rocks
Before this chops
I grabbed the keys to locks the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box et cetera et cetera and it dont stop
I got away with everything the cash and the stash
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
So now Im titled mission accomplished
My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin I know this niggas thinkin
Damn She too little too pretty too quiet
The bitch is hired mobs wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife contracts on your life
We increase the price uhh
So guess who the bitch is
But for now I be the mistress
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
It aint a day of my life that rolls by
That I dont get high sit back and wan cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now its just me and my niggas
