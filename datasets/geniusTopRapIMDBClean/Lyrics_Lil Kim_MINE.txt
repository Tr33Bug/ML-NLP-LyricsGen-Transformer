Dont get mad if she aint looking back at you nigga
Dont mind you looking cause she mine girl she for me

Firearm we roll around in the streets
When I get home its going down in the sheets

And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I dont mind cause Ima grinder

Like the roof on the Wraith
Eat my pussy with his breakfast

He said that I stay on his mind

They all fantasize being with Kim

Chanel bag in Chanel weather

Dont mind you looking cause she mine girl she for me
Fall off she gon hold it down please believe
Firearm we roll around in the streets
When I get home its going down in the sheets
Dont mind you looking cause shes mine girl she a big fine girl
Every time she whine she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I dont mind cause Ima grinder
