Not Tonight  Ladies Night Remix  Lyrics
Uh yeah
Uhh heres another one and another one
Yeah
Lil Kim the Queen Bee
Its ladies night what
It must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar got the spice
Roll the Ls tight keep the rhymes right
Yo I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh Im the rookie on this allstar team
Me and Kim is gettin cream like Thelma and Louise but on chrome
Never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say its on then its on
Bang this in your whips
Platinumcoated Rollie with the chips in the wrists
Heres a French kiss
I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the fourfifth
Make you dance ow
I stay focused in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it yall just hopeless
And toke this I aint lyin
Niggas trying to knock me off keep tryin
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass like a soundtrack New Jack Citay
Set It Off with the eightfitay
Yall missin the buck with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the truck and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest
Its the rap Mae West the QB
And I got all my sisters with me
Oh this is ladies night and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Oh this is ladies night and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Uhh never the one packin a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that lay dat ass flat
I be the one chokin ya paragraphs with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Aint no stoppin me ladies from club hoppin gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin with the glass in my left one
Righthand sayin stepson
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp aint havin that shit
If you aint got the cash to stash suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin
To the top and it dont stop
Oh this is ladies night and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Oh this is ladies night and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Yall see how these bogus niggas
Try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin with good intentions
But focusin on they riches
If its too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks stay lifted when they thinkin of me
Cause the rhythm I kick puzzle em like arithematic
Fillin em with sluggers off the nine milli luger clip
Bitches bust we just keep kickin up dust
And you can spread rumors
Shit is makin me sicker than head tumors
Humor me by huggin me sayin you lovin me
Bet ya phony niggas be buggin I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo of deez VVs and M3s
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Roleys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the Windy City woman still comin and gunnin
Straight from the Chi
Tonights the night for all the ladies lets get high
Oh this is ladies night and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Oh this is ladies night and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night oh what a night  oh what a night 
Ayo Kim heh heh yaknowhatImsayin
I aint even gon leave without sayin sunun on this track
You aint gonna use me to just be singin hooks
What I look like
Patti LaBelle or somebody nigga Heh heh
Check it out uh huh yeah
Oh what a night
You should be like Missy stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin bikes
Me and Lil Kim got the rhymes to incite
I gotta catch a flight uh heh heh around threeish
Niggas cant see us from Elektra to Undeas
Ow niggas wanna be us
Heh Im out hehe
Ladies night
Ladies night
Ladies night
Ladies night
