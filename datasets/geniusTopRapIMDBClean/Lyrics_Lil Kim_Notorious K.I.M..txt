Notorious KIM Lyrics
What
Heres another one
What
Uhhuh uh 
What Uh
Heres another one
Uhhuh 
Uh Uh
Live from NYC its QB
The heavyweight champ female MC
Girls say they different but uh see
In all actuality they wanna be me
This chick running around with this stink ass gap
And them fake ass raps having panic attacks
You aint a star
And your record company know that
How you make all this money get this far and blow it
Im a businesswoman now so Im not concerned
Id bet on Lil Cease before you and your Firm
If this was back in the days I wouldve been snatched you
Im getting money now
Them bitches in the hood they can have you
Stop paying these niggas to write yall shit
For the right cream Id write a hot sixteen
Better be careful what you say to me
That same shit you shit
Ima make you sniff
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Uh uhhuh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh
Everybody wanna Shyne off of BIG
Get it Shyne tryna sound like him when they rhyme
You aint a murderer
Nigga please come off that
Im next up to bat motherfuckers get their jaws tapped
Bum ass nigga dont even know how to bust a gun ass nigga
You dumb ass nigga
Rappers acting out the late Frank Whites path
Once they get in jail they get fucked in the ass
Never snitch never send a nigga to jail
Id rather find him by a boat doing the deadmans float
We gangsters
Real gangsters b
Gun in the green room up at BET
We gangsters
Real gangsters nigga
Kill you and cut the head off your babysitter
We gangsters
We gangsters bitch
Even more dangerous now were filthy rich


Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Uh uhhuh uh uh
Uh uh uh
The moral of the story is this
You aint queen bitch
And you aint BIG dick
Now Im pissed niggas on some 10 Dis
Well shit Ima break it down like this
Lot of rappers in this game
Thats cool but uh
Only one of us could rule
You see its sort of like being in school
Im valedictorian yall in the audience
And Ive got nine hundred and ninetynine votes
You got nine hundred and ninetynine nopes
You local bitch Im worldwide
Cant you see Open your eyes
I got you by a landslide
Yall mad cause niggas love my style
Colgate smile Im a bad bitch child
Cats be frontin like they one tough cookie
All my real gs do the gangsta boogie
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Its the NOTORIO
US you just lay down slow
Uh uhhuh uh uh
