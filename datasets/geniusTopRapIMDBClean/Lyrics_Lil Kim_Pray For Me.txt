You gotta hustle with your head  Hustle with your head

You gotta mean what you say  What you say

Return of the Coogi sweaters and gold Jesus pieces
Light up the backwoods  What you start 
Uh  What you start 
What you start  Maybach Music 
Wake up in Versace boxers at the Ritz
Fell asleep gold Rolex on my wrist uh
Who ever thought that I would grow and to be rich
All these niggas tried to hit me but these niggas missed  Huh 
My brothers with your bomb please send em my salam  Lord 
That brand new SEL across my mothers lawn  Ah 
I swear I come in peace but my lil homies arent
Hear them gunshots that go from Brooklyn down here to Bronx  Bang 
Bulletproof the Bimmer now Im battle ready  Boss 
Me and Kimmy til I die forever adversaries  Woo 
Im talkin money pussy nigga Tyler Perry  Woo 
Goin back to Cali so Im riding ready  Huh 
Coogi sweaters Jesus pieces gotta do it big  Uh 
Run up on you and I really let you live
It aint trafficking unless its 20 mil
I wack a nigga and Im down to do the bid  Boss 
Coogi sweaters Jesus pieces gotta do it big  Uh 
Fab said you need a Kim if you gon do it big
Niggas want the smoke I hop out with the cig
Ill wack a nigga then buy a flight to Madrid
I did the bid now I do the most
Whole team burnin bread lets make a toast
I aint the type to brag I let that paper boast
Then I wash the dirty money in that ivory coast
Rich milli half a million
My shit slap silly yeah
Quarter milli this year on shoes
Give a broke bitch the blues
Ran off with a couple mil in high heel Jimmy Choos
Im a bad bitch from every angle
Jess hang around your neck like the noose
May the Bishop pray for you cause you know I got the juice
We bet it big at the crap table seven eleven
Open like we 711 workin all night 247
Fuck the FBI I only confess to the reverend
Put that on my bredrin
Let this be a lesson when you disrespect the legend
Ross the boss Kim the Queen is you stupid
Ride the beat like a Wraith
But this is MayMayMayMayMaybach Music
Pray for me  Pray for me oh
