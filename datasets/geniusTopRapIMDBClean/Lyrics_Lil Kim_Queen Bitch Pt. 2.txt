Queen Bitch Pt 2 Lyrics
Everything you heard yo thats my word
You play the herb and repeat every word
It get on your nerves to see how we swerve
Watches that shine dimes with his and her furs
Straight from the curb to the suburb
In the black suburb plucking birds getting served
Yall aint never learned how this world turn
Thought it was over huh Now we return
To whom it may concern when you hot you burn
Maybe it wasnt meant to be or it just aint your turn
The rules are so stern nigga get what you earn
And we still move in silence nigga ya heard
Yall know who you are wanna battle Bet a car
Notes and all that shit You legit Spit a bar
What See I run the show got the illest flow
Finding loads of bankrolls in my underclothes
Its the original and everybody knows
I rock diamonds thats red white and indigo
Im undroppable untoppable
You cant hold me down dont you know Im unstoppable
Niggas wanna run up in my pussy like a Pap smear
Ima tell you now just like I told you last year
Niggas aint sticking unless they lick the kitten
Huh Too many bitches just be lickin the dick and
Im a picky one I like my dicks rock hard
Not the sticky ones that taste like slaw
Oh  something missing the showerpissing
All up in your mouth what You think Im kidding
Cause everything we do we got a right to
You criticize me We despise you
If what they say is true we the baddest crew
Im far from broke so why should I be mad at you
Pardon my French but uh sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like
Lyrics I call em like I see em G

You must be out your mind or you must be high
Fucking with the Teflon bitch from the Stuy
Nowhere near shy see I make you cry
The way I rock you to sleep like a lullaby
Oh yeah and by the way you got one more day
Or you got to pay boo you got something to say 
Yeah bring it on bitch you aint strong bitch
Thought youd be around long Wrong bitch
Got nothing but love  but when push comes to shove 
We turn to thugs  and we put on them gloves 
Commence to lickin slugs you aint gettin up
More bags zippin up graves dug nigga what
Pardon my French but uh sometimes I get kinda
Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like
Lyrics I call em like I see em G

Peeved at these weak emcees
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now youre half of me

Peeved at these weak emcees
With these supreme baller like

You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now youre half of me
