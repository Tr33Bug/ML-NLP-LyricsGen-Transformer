If Peter Piper pecked em I bet you Biggie bust em
He probably tried to fuck him I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledgehammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler queen bitch supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch murder scene bitch
Clean bitch diseasefree bitch check it
I write a rhyme melt in your mouth like MMs
Roll with the MAFIA remember them
Tell em when I used to mess with gentlemen straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure how you figure
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep til noon rap Pam Griers here
Baby drinkers beware mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive we pick which Benz to drive
The MAFIA you wanna be em
Most of yall niggas cant eat without per diem
Im rich Ima stay that bitch
Uhh who you loving Who you wanna be hugging
Roll with niggas that be thugging bugging
In the Tunnel  Essos
Sipping espresso Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
Cnote after Cnote Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer you think you greater uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick kick it bitch Uhh
Check my pitch authentic persona
And Ill still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock a goodass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdales for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shits straight like 915 ynahmean
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
Im rich Ima stay that bitch
