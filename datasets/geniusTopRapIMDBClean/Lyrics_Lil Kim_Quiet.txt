When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin they wont run they mouth
When them shells start poppin bodies start droppin
Its so quiet you can hear a rat pissin on cotton 
Do you see what I see can you hear what I hear
All these studio gangsters year after year
With these gimicks I cant take it they aint real so they fakin it
How did they make it in this game for so long
I know whats right from whats wrong I know whats soft from whats hard
I know a federal case from a publicity charge
Man I fought tooth and nail to keep them punks out of jail
But hoes wanna go to court til I pay them for their nails
Who you tryin to be Man it couldnt be me
My man spent guap and bought me my Continental T
You spent your advance on your Continental T
I know you sick when you clean your rims you still see a Bee
And we see you a liar tryna deny her
Jackie O proved you far from a fighter
Comin at me bitch you playin with fire
I aint gon come back at you Im comin at your ghostwriters
When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin they wont run they mouth
When them shells start poppin bodies start droppin
Its so quiet you can hear a rat pissin on cotton 
I hear em talkin like they gangster material
But I dont see it man their gangsters invisible
The hot irons what them gangsters put into you
Til you laid up and your gangsters on critical
Shots get into you bleedin like my menestraul
And if I dont like you then I wont pretend to
Its the ones that befriend you that turn up against you
In the court of law and drop a dime like Sprint do
Supposed to be tough huh Til them boys touch ya
Chump muhfuckers start confessin like Usher
I cut you off cause I knew I couldnt trust ya
Lame ass busters backwardsass hustlers
You fake phony you always was lil homey
Big lil son baby boy like Jody
I put you under my wing bought you your first Roley
Nigga I helped raised you why would I play you
When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin they wont run they mouth
When them shells start poppin bodies start droppin
Its so quiet you can hear a rat pissin on cotton 
You see it always be them ones talkin this and that
How they knife game ill and they gun go clap
Them niggas rats they run and they trap
Til they run in a trap and theres no comin back
It be the same ones talkin bout the guns they sparkin
The dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin
A whole lotta growlin til the wolves start howlin
They pitbull shit man them niggas straight cowards
Got em scared to death pissin in they trousers
Always was a bitch thats why I sent his ass flowers
Thanks to the queen he can share em with his team
You can run top speed but you cant dodge the
Got a clean 16 and my spit game mean
Dont be fooled and deceived everythin aint what it seems
You act like you dont know what side of town this realer
Niggas softer than chinchillas but on wax they killers
When the sun goes down and them guns come out
Them niggas that was talkin they wont run they mouth
When them shells start poppin bodies start droppin
Its so quiet you can hear a rat pissin on cotton
