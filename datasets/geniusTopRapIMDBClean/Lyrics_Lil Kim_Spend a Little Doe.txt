Mmm baby I missed ya
I missed you too
I waited a long time for this
So why you aint come see me no commissary or nothin
I aint wanna see my bird in no cage
But Im ready to take care of you now
Now after three years
Three motherfuckin years nigga You know what
Hasta la vista byebye kiss your kids
Its the gangstresses
What you think this is nigga
Calm yourself its just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty starvin me
Call me Sunshine pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous miraculous
I practice this for a livin like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina love aint got shit to do with me and you
Or the 44 under the pillow
Put in the dildo I like to play while Im workin
And thats for certain
Keep jerkin I aint done with you
Lights cameras curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh they wouldnt believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink cucarachas I bought his life for 3 Gs
Then some watches then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin goin on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Marks car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin in they Morays sippin Dom Ps and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from police we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya I cried for ya
You know this downass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you but now forget you
Id rather dead you and wet you like I never met you


It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
And I remember how you said you loved me
With the passion
High fashion
Who you askin
To keep the tum numb from index to thumb
Push the Vs with the coke from the DTs
Dope take the titties from city to city
I aint see a G off none of them kis
At ease when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didnt snitch youd make a shorty rich bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin on the Peter Pan to Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didnt appeal no more
Gats I couldnt feel no more
And now Im the shit
Go by the name of Lil Kim the Queen Bitch
And MAFIAs lieutenant
Instead of playin Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It dont pay to be nice but its nice to pay
And if you die before you wake may your soul God take
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
