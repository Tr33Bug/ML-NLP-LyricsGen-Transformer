We took us a break but we back now
Aint nothin gon throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin on us
And the bitter bitches got em mad now
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Countin on 20s 50s and these 100s baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Landin jets at the border
Rolls Royce is my taxi to the hotels on the water
Quarter mill when Im layin nigga
Killin em slow thats torture
Rented out the whole top floor penthouse just for my daughter
You broke bitches outta order
Im a bad bitch with some ol money
Yeah Im ballin but I want some mo money
Pop the Lamborghini in the living room
Elevated to the master room
My rooftop got a rooftop
Bomb pussy thats a boombox
Buscemi this Givenchy that
Spent a rack on some Gucci tube socks
In Dubai Im skiin in the summer
Surfin waves in the winter time
They callin me the young gunner
The way I body these jeans is such a crime
They got a lovehate typea thang for me
When it come to Kim theres no thinner line
Got bigger fish to fry
Eat you so called sharks at dinner time
We took us a break but we back now
Aint nothin gon throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin on us
And the bitter bitches got em mad now
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Countin on 20s 50s and these 100s baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
One zero zero zero bitch then a comma
Zero zero zero zero bitch
We took us a break but we back now
Bitter bitches got em mad now
Sour niggas stay hatin on me
Cause Im hangin clothes from these racks now
I was raised in the school of hard knocks
These bitches is class clowns
Givin yall my old clothes
My old flows like handmedowns
I see yall watchin my Snap
Tryna see what else you could jack
100 grand with the cheese in the trap
Better catch me a rat
All this weight I need a lap band
Pussy nigga give a lap dance
Black and yellow Rari thats a beehive
Eat up the Ghost like Pac Man
Man I love them twoseaters
Killin shit like the Reaper
Buyin shit for no reason
Its always Lil Kim season
We took us a break but we back now
Aint nothin gon throw off this cash cow
I pull up and skrrt in that foreign thang
All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin on us
And the bitter bitches got em mad now
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Countin on 20s 50s and these 100s baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
Aint nothin more important than this money baby
