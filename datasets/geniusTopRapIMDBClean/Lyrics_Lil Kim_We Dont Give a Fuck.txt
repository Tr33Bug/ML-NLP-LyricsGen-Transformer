Take that nigga chain we dont give a fuck
Hit that nigga up we dont give a fuck
Jack that nigga truck we dont give a fuck

I Brooklyn Bounce nigga in Dirty South down to the ATL
Rep BIG to death betta watch what come out ya breath
We thuggin thuggin we thuggin
Honey girl Queen B double EE
Im heatin up in oven no bitch is comin like me
We get by we get crunk we spit fire we got pumps
We get high we get drunk we got heat for yall punks
Cant find you layin my fam is not playin
Gotta get that money that money that money money
You dont want no problems man none if you get outta lane
We comin like the Taliban poppin like a collar man
Cowards want to violate then we got to demonstrate
You faggot niggas tellin when we see you we be yellin
Bitch I been trill ever since the day I came out my mommas cock
Come on down to that Dirty South you gon see I got it locked
I can go on any block and on any hood and on any town
Runnin deep with money and jewelery and holdin myself down
Connected to every heavy nigga across the US
My cocaine is the whitest and my diamonds are the bluest
My city is the trillest and my niggas are the truest
Got everything to gain and nothing to lose so lets do this
We load em up cock em back let em go we knock em off
Cut off all his cake rocks and eggs this nigga block em off
Its BUN for UGK straight up out that BAT
Holdin it down for KIM reppin for Pimp C lets see em bitch
Big cars big trucks big nuts when it comin up off the dust
Think its funny til he comin up out the club
Gonna getcha money when Im comin up out the cut
If I catch a nigga slippin Imma tell a nigga know that shit
Then I snatch that chain
When he leave his friends Imma get him out his ends
And his Benz make him cash that train
Come out the dark and get the lights on
Turn together get it up
Take his watch take his bracelet take his dust take his truck
I cant help it to get itchy if I see the nigga ballin
Nigga yes yall then I gotta get a piece of that
Steady figure with the Jacob in the bezel with charm
Well come over hear I got a little heat for that
AK47 and the Desert Eagle with a sawedoff pump
Got a what an E95 with leather grip
And a Mac11 comin out the trunk
Got what a black ski mask and leather gloves
And duct tape I can get what I want
Got what when the Queen and the Twist ride on them bitches
We dont give a fuck
