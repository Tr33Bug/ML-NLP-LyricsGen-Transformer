My niggas pull triggers stack figures whoa whoa whoa
Snitch niggas broke niggas not my niggas no no no
In the club we sippin Dom P sittin lovely oh whoa whoa
Sexy ladies goin crazy cause the beats like whoa whoa whoa
Fresh out the federal building
To Bentley Coupes with the convertible ceilings
Its the black widow call me Miss White
I done been through it all shootouts and fistfights
Brooklyn bitch you go wrong I get right
Back with a classic now gimme six mics
Cant reach me on the phone then send a bitch a kite
Man I dos it in heels or a pair of crisp Nikes
Stand behind Martin Luther King but Im more like Malcolm X
Guerillas beatin on they chest get it right on Malcolm X
Just keep the peace cause if cowards show me disrespect
My niggas put his soul to rest and I dont wanna see you stressed
Champagne at my campaign Kim for mayor
Told you Im the same bitch from the escalator
And I aint trippin off you rats and investigators
Get your envelopes time to address the haters
My niggas pull triggers stack figures whoa whoa whoa
Snitch niggas broke niggas not my niggas no no no
In the club we sippin Dom P sittin lovely oh whoa whoa
Sexy ladies goin crazy cause the beats like whoa whoa whoa
Me and my team we tryin to own casinos
So we can all cop dreams like Pacinos
Come through in the ohsix Benzitos
The feds tryin to shut us down like Nino
We keep it goin man we keep it goin man
Wont stop cant gotta keep it goin man
See I do it for the fans theyll never understand
While they goin off course me Im stickin to the plan
Feel the movement its a whole new crew
FUCK Junior MAFIA that chapter is through
Them faggots done did somethin that they caint undo
Whoever ridin with em they can get one too
Coulda copped to a one to three do
Still took it to trial even though I blew
Brooklyn style thats how we do it
Ill gangsters and aint got to prove it
My niggas pull triggers stack figures whoa whoa whoa
Snitch niggas broke niggas not my niggas no no no
In the club we sippin Dom P sittin lovely oh whoa whoa
Sexy ladies goin crazy cause the beats like whoa whoa whoa


Now a party aint a party til the Queen come through
You know where I go man the team come too
Pull up in the Phantom or the V12
Lil Kims that girl even got her own shoe
In the club with my clique though glass full of Cristal
In the jail jumpsuit still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world aint just made for rich folk
Getcha little dance up BK stand up
Straight to the dancefloor everybody hands up
Throw it up get down fellas hold your pants up
Ladies throw it right back tell that nigga man up
My niggas pull triggers stack figures whoa whoa whoa
Snitch niggas broke niggas not my niggas no no no
In the club we sippin Dom P sittin lovely oh whoa whoa
Sexy ladies goin crazy cause the beats like whoa whoa whoa
