Yeah I put my shades on
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money Im an hour past paid
Ugh gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah I put it down like my hands hurting
Im on a natural high but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers most of yall haters
But I put up a wall and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me I stay hatefree
They say we learn from mistakes why thats why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders to me its like feathers
All hail Weezy call it bad weather
I stick to the script I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that Ive seen too many times
Youre on the outside looking in close the blinds
And they say never say never but fuck it nevermind
Ive been gone too long true or false right or wrong

Life is a choice and death is a decision
Times have changed but fuck it get a new watch

Young Moneys eating the label getting fatter
And yea the tables turned but Im still sitting at em

Everybody selling dreams Im too cheap to buy one
Man when that cookie crumble everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down hummingbird dont hum
Yea big money big money deep pockets
Money talks and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods you could call it blood clotting
