You cannot break down what cant be broken
Out of all the rankless I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what cant be broken
They can do all they can do but they cant break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice I hope it make em puke Im breakin loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce
In 1982 my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now Im raising you and aint no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors food
And be afraid of who I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute bulletproof I gave em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw twisted like tornadoes too
Man Ima need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what Im breaking through
Her nails she gone break a few
You can never break me down and I cant hit the brakes for you
errr 
You cannot break down what cant be broken
Out of all the rankless I was chosen  Yeah 
When all of the lights they get low  Low 
And all of the curtains they close  They close 
You cannot break down  You cant  what cant be broken  Uh 
Gcode Gcode we cant break the Gcode
We bros  Cant be broken 
Yeah we bros we bros we cant break for these hoes
Gcode  Cant be broken 
I aint finna break or fix the brakes you emulate
Im laughing in your face now fix your face I cant disintegrate
Cause I facilitate a mil a day for like a million days
At least the bills are paid the children safe want to get away
No Im here to stay Im really great but dont discriminate
Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin out your chest your titties fake
Dont make me pick your fate
Im pickin out a mate she get replaced
The heart was built to break
Im smoking icky watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight lets do some QA
You saw the news today got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say they want to get Lil Tune to break
Its worth the wait commercial break


You cannot break down what cant be broken  Gcode 
Out of all the rankless I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what cant be broken  Uh 
Gcode Gcode we cant break the Gcode
We bros  Cant be broken 
Yeah we bros we bros we cant break for these hoes
Gcode  Cant be broken
