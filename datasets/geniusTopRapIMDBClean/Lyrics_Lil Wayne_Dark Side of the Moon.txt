As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
Shes not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon Ima miss it
The sky is falling down I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but Im under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when Im in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars the eclipse is eclipsin
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted full of lipstick
Planet of the aches and she is my prescription
We out of this world baby we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling intergalactical intergalactical love
And Ill be waiting for you for you for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said Ill be waiting Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I dont see it Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Open up the curtains
Windowwatchin people killin robbin
The sky is fallin fallin down
I turn into news and this is the apocalypse
People livin on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me will I see you soon
Meet you on the moon
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling falling down
Ill be waiting for you for you for you
On the dark side of the moon
Ill be waiting Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I dont see it Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Said Ill be waiting Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I dont see it Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling intergalactic intergalactical love
And Ill be waiting for you  for you for you 
On the dark side of the moon
Said Ill be waiting Ill be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
