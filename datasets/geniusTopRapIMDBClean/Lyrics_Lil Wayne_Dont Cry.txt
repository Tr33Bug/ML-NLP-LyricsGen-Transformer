Dont cry  Oh  dont go
Wont lie I fuckin love you woah
Why yall staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin down
I see death around the corner
And the Uturn signs lookin like a smile
What do I do now Who gon find me how
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one its true
Im number 92782
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate aint my favorite food
But Im hungry so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads Dont cry stay tuned
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heavens as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise
Dont cry  Dont cry dont cry  dont go  Why oh why 
Wont lie I fuckin love you woah
Dont cry  Dont cry dont cry dont cry 
Dont go  Why oh why oh why oh why 
Wont lie  Dont cry dont cry 
I fuckin love you woah  Dont cry dont cry 
Talent is Godgiven be grateful
Fame is not a given be humble
And conceit is selfdriven drive carefully
Stay in your own lane seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns rumbumbumbum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like Dundundundundun
Dont call it a comeback
It was dark now the sun back
Hit me hard but I punched back
The wheels fell off I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or its do or die
Its newer days and its bluer skies
I told myself Its just you and I
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who Im there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew Id find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Cant control the tears let em drop and roll  Let em drop and roll 


Dont cry  Dont cry dont cry 
Dont go  Why oh why oh why 
Wont lie  Dont cry  I fuckin love you woah
Triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife rest in paradise 
Dont cry  Dont cry dont cry 
Dont go  Why oh why oh why 
Wont lie I fuckin love you woah  Dont cry 
Dont cry stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise
