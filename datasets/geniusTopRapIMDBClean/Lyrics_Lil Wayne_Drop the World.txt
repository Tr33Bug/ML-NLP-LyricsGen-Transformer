I got ice in my veins blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain days are the same
You keep the sunshine save me the rain
I search but never find hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but Im cursed so never mind
And its worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on mafucker
Cause all this bullshit just made me strong mafucker
So I pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah
Bitch Ima pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
Im gone motherfucker Im gone
Uh
I know what they dont wanna tell you
Just hope youre heavensent and youre hellproof
I I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they cant wipe off
Huh my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise
Served to survive murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Haha yeah
Bitch Ima pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
Im gone motherfucker Im gone
Im gone
It hurts but I never show
This pain youll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit Ive become
My backs against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream Fuck em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin in this roof is cavin in
Oops time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got em cookin boy
This crooked mind of mine got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and buttfucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame that aint what
I came to claim but the game aint gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another Ima make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God wont spare the rod
Im a man of my word so your fuckin heads better nod
Or Ima fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your headll lie
Permanently bitch its beddybye
This world is my Easter egg yeah prepare to die
My head is swole my confidence is up this stage is my pedestal
Im unstoppable Incredible Hulk
Youre trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin headll spin dog
Ill split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives Ill fuckin
Pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah
Bitch Ima pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
Im gone motherfucker Im gone
Im gone
