Glory 
Woo this that shit they didnt want me on
Im bout to act a badonkadonk shamone shamone
Dont need sugar I need cream Im dark and strong
The garbage man puttin on cologne aroma wrong
Im on Im on this that shit they didnt want
I act a ass and shit a skunk I will I wont
Black your eye like william you Willy Wonka
Thats me in the Lamb Im disappearin like Jimmy Hoffa
AK47 my business partner business is swell
French kiss a bitch she dont speak French cant kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin well then wish him well
Sippin syrup like ginger ale but Im the quickest snail
From here to Hell I hear them hail I give them hell
Im spittin hail Im Clinton well I did inhale
These niggas frail they Chip and Dale they little gals
Watch me act a donkey then pin a tail spit out your nails
Uh glory hallelujah
Holy shit Im the holy shit Im Gods manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep Im inside your room wit a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool its like cockadoodle
Im awkward cuckoo I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate YooHoo
Im hotter than Honolulu glory unto you  Glory 
Glory
Im awkward cuckoo I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate YooHoo
Im hotter than Honolulu my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a booboo since gaga googoo and Dada FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boohoo I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral shock the future like Dr Luther
Im not a chooser your mom a cougar Ill sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga I like bazookas
Im high as lunar Im wilder than tigers Nikes Pumas
Woo this that shit you didnt want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers I said Surprise but couldnt party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin board
But all this fuckin artist drawin is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block leave it a waterpark broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce you want it hard or raw huh


Uh glory hallelujah
Holy shit Im the shit PortaPotty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin Im goin Tony Stewart
Im on the fluid Im ruined Im cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shooshoo and whos who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view til I find a mirror start talkin to it
It told me the truth it said Im the shit and you party poopin
Lord oh Lord
Am I talkin crazy Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated my boys are faded my cars the latest
My bars the greatest they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies she barfed the babies they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the 80s that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty Im warm as Haiti
Im armed and lazy Im sprayin until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental Im higher than Continental
Went from flyin cockroaches to flyin without credentials
Thats private tell the pilot Be quiet we need our privacy
Throw you off this bitch if you wired justifiably
Hustle wit a motive you know this Im wit my whoadies
No snakes no rodents no adlibs no chorus
No stress no worries hook you to a respiratory
Its selfexplanatory the glory is mandatory glory
Uh glory hallelujah
Holy shit I cant hold this shit my bowels looser
My towels newer my powder room is for powderusers
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit snot and mucus
My tires Lucas my drivers cruisin my partners ruthless
My flowers rootless my pockets roofless she poppin roofies
Im not a student Im not assumin Im not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music you got em Tunechi
You got em Tunechi I got em
Glory hallelujah  I got em 
Glory 
I got em
I got em 
I got em
