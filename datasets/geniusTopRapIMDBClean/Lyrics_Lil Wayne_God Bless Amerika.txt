TranslationsFrançaisGod Bless Amerika Lyrics
Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin', yeahh
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let 'em die

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away
Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed, yeahh
Now let it breathe, yeah

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of command, I'm the missing link

This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?62Embed
