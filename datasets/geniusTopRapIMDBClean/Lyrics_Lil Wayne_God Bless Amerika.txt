TranslationsFranais
Uh my minds filled with mine fields
The ashes fall the wine spills
The world stops drops and rolls
Its Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yeah I pour out my heart have a drink
They say the drunk never lie they aint never lyin yeahh
My country tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die
God bless Amerika
This ole godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow aint promised today
The end of time is like a hour away
Damn military minded lost and cant find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin for me Ima hide by a broad
Shootin stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
Im wired out the socket but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If theres food for thought then Im guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want  I took heed yeahh
Now let it breathe yeah
Back to life back to reality
Been eating my girl and shes so sweet got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But whats appealing to me is under banana trees love
I go so hard I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Aint that a bitch Im just a nut tryna bust a nut in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police now I say fuck jail
Same shit different air freshener
I dont play boy I aint Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head pop Peace of mind
I be in the cloud cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
Its a cold world I put on a mink
Theres a chain of command Im the missing link
God bless Amerika
This ole godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow aint promised today
And Im smoking on them flowers catch the bouquet
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin for me Ima hide by a broad
Shootin stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
Im wired out the socket but still shockin
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today
