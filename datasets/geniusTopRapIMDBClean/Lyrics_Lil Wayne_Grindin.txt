Grindin’ Lyrics
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’

I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’ I promise
I fuck her until I get tired, retire and then come out retirement
My girl like it rough she said “find me a diamond”
Her body be grindin’
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic
That make us believe, when we lyin’, we honest, I love you
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors
Are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga
It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
'Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
'Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
'Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit
Nigga, I'm grindin'

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

Yeah
I got a new vision for all my shit (for all my)
I don’t know what to call that shit (don’t know what to call it)
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit (don’t need it)
I’m a different breed with this shit (yeah)
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch (yeah)
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch (woo!)
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they’re hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" (might be scared of me now)
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin'
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(Grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
'Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’
