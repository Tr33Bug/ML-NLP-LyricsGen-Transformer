She owes me everything and she knows it
Ive seen all the scenes in this movie and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me cause she knows that Im a friend
But I cant keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend man fuck him
Girl I was the one that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and dont crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring moving on to better things
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools
Im not good enough for you I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
And I dont love them hoes
But dont fuck up with Wayne cause when it Waynes it pours
No really Im on my fuck that bitch shit
You used to be the shit but now you aint shit bitch
I had a red bone but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds she was pigeon toed
She used to always say fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail she fucked my niggas
Well I guess Im single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad then you caught me
But this shit explains that youre the one that taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring moving on to better things
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools
Im not good enough for you I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget bitch I already forgot
Im over the bitch and she over the top
They say love is the key somebody changed the lock
Well and I wish I never met ya
And I heard youre doing you and you heard Im doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four but not forever damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime I was working doubles
I wish you the best good luck boo
Weezy F for Fuck you
No aint nothing going on
Girl Im moving on just take your ass home
Get away from here girl Im so glad youre gone
This is the last song Im writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I dont want you round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Dont even text my phone when it hit ya cause girl you done taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring moving on to better things
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools
Im not good enough for you I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
