I am sittin on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin touch football on Marijuana Street
Or in a marijuana field you are so beneath my cleats
Get high so high

Down in a cigar roll me up and smoke me

Swimmin laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
Im at the top of the top but still I climb
And if I should ever fall the ground will then turn to wine
Pop pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then  I feel like dying 
Only once the drugs are done  Yeah yeah yeah 
Do I feel like dying I feel like dying  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Only once the drugs are done  Hahaha 
Do I feel like dying I feel like dying  Psst 
I can mingle with the stars and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue roses are red
Daisies are yellow the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer dont have no more
Then  I feel like dying  yeah
Only once the drugs are done  Yeah yeah yeah 
Do I feel like dying I feel like dying  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Only once the drugs are done  Hahaha 
Do I feel like dying I feel like dying
