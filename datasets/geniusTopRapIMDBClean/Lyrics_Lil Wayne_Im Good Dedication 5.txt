TranslationsEspaolIm Good  Dedication 5  Lyrics
Everything I said Id do I did
Im good Im good
Everything I said Id do I did
But baby lets face it Im not into dating
I havent been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic this life Ive been chasing
These hearts Ive been breaking
And these girls I been tasting dont never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck em from behind
Fuck em with their clothes on put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get em wet let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals got dreams got a hotelcrib
Got niggas thatll die for the prince
Got my city on lock XO til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet
Im good Im not living like I did before
Im good Im good I said Im good
Everything I said Id do I did
Im good said Im good
Oh I been good
Ive been out there puttin down that work
Im good said Im good I said Im good
Everything I said Id do I did
Im good motherfucker Im good
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember dont you remember
I been good we good
