You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When youre chained in the dark all alone
Im real as they come I follow the rules
Im still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money I dont fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air Im pushin the gears
Love turned into hate hate turned into fear
If it aint right I dont sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch I got time to kill
Gasoline propane
Aint no salary cap in the dope game
Aint no collective bargainin on cocaine
So in other words nigga do your thing
Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother hes just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry Young Money got the munchies
Faded fuckin faded aw yeah Im fuckin faded
They tellin lies about me aw yeah I mustve made it
Rikers Island on this flow eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin in that shit hole
Three visits later I went and did it major
So fuck the judge and the jury and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came they let my nigga out
Uh stop playin I aint with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches Sheneneh oh my goodness
This is Waynes world and yall are just some tourists
Give me three wishes I wish I wish I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40s nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin in the money Ima need some fuckin goggles
Its better to give but we dont give a fuck about em
I just came home shit done got real ho
Lil Weezyana the boot nigga steel toe
I aint workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down kick the motherfuckin field goal
Talkin bout baby money I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch get that howmuchyouloveyourlady money
I know you fake nigga press your brakes nigga
Ill take you out thats a date nigga
Im a grownass Blood stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin
I think you pussy cat ha Hello Kitty
I just throw the alleyoop to Drake Griffin
I lay em down Tempurpedic
This shits a game of chess you niggas think its cleavage
Its Young Money yeah tis the season
I give you the business bitch this a business meetin
My niggas hungry my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder Dear Mr Ouija
Nigga Im straight my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel poppoppotato salad
