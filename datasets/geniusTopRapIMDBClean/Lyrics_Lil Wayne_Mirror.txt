Uh with everything happening today
You dont know whether youre coming or going but
You think that ya on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Woah look at me when Im talking to you
You looking at me but Im looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see youre not satisfied
And I dont see nobody else
I see myself Im looking at the
Mirror on the wall  Woah 
Here we are again  Yeah 
Through my rise and fall  Uh 
Youve been my only friend  Yeah 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again
Uh I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But Im with you when youre all alone
And you correct me when Im looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne Im lookin at the
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again  Yeah 
Through my rise and fall  Uhhuh 
Youve been my only friend  My only friend 
You told me that they cant
Understand the man I am  They cant understand 
So why are we here  Misunderstood 
Talking to each other again  Woah 
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up thats smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile thats a blessing
I see the change I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So Im starting with the man in the
Mirror on the wall  MJ taught me that 
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall  Uh

You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
