I got a story to tell you know that I cherish these
Hope it aint too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch stunting popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really dont know much about her
Then she let us in we take all of your shit
And when you wake up she help you try to find it I love it
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her Get him she say I got you
I say No bitch I said get him  Ha 
And they so pretty and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word we come through with AKs
Its a stickup she scream like a victim now you
Feeling so silly I smoke color purple
Im up in here feeling like Celie ooh
Nappyass dreads whats that you say
Watch your mouth Milli Vanilli ooh
You can get snaked you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling cause you
Thought that she was an angel that bitch aint no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee and you
Telling your business she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling to you
She lie through her teeth cavities fillings
She know where you hide it tell me where its hidden
She know when you gone tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him
So she dont get blamed we dont snatch chains
We find out addresses and we dont leave messes
Youll only know that its gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say Whats wrong He say Nothing keep resting
She say Whats missingHow you know something missing
He scratched his head she say Get back in bed
Then she gave him some head boy you cant trust them bitches
And then she say Ooh
I see niggas in this bitch stunting popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
Thats with the niggas we following
Get them on the line stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes Dont be so obvious
Mona Lisa long hair dont care
She handle the business and dont ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell em Ooh daddy lets go to your place
And if he say yeah  then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She dont want love she just want her share I
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people and they already know it
And then I call Liz and she say he coming over
I say Good girl just remember what I told you
She gave me the salute I say Girl youre a soldier
We waiting outside watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knocked
She open the door naked she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didnt see moi
And then she let him in they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off put the gun to his frown
Nigga turn around I aint here to fuck around
I aint here to fuck around caught you with your pants down
You know what it is put your fucking hands up

Youll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy she bout to be a bastard oh

Mona Lisa

Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie

Ima call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and Im all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
