Mr Carter Lyrics
Yo yo Drew and Inf
Thisthis this right here is crazy
Yo I I feel big you know what I mean
Like not not big in the sense of weight
You know what I mean Like gainin weight or nothin like that
Like colossal
Like you know what I mean like  sighs 
I heard you were lookin for me
Hey Mr Carter  Hello 
Tell me where have you been  Haha you know hehe 
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Theyve been wondering why  I know haha 
Hey Mr Carter  Hey hello 
Tell me where have you been  Shit you know 
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Theyve been wondering why  Hahahah 
Yeah to you forever from me to you
I heard somebody say Church Ima need a suit
Ima need a coupe I wont need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
I got the flow Im tryin to see the roof
Didnt wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do
But Ima leave it to God not Beaver neither you
Cause Ima murder Y kill O and even U
Man I got summer hatin on me cause Im hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin on me cause I aint never sprung
Winter hatin on me cause Im colder than yall
And I will never I will never I will never fall
Im being hated by the seasons
So fuck yall who hatin for no reason


Hey Mr Carter  I am him 
Tell me where have you been
Around the world and Im back again
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Whos been askin about me
Theyve been wondering why  In case you wonderin hah 
Hey Mr Carter  I am him 
Tell me where have you been
Around the world now Im back again
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Whos been askin about me
Theyve been wondering why  In case you wonderin hah 
Yeah I been in and out the bank bitch
While yall asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear Wayne quit
Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call em April babies cause they fools
And when they snooze we up
Feet up like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic I parallel park
In that redandyellow thing old school Atlanta Hawk
Like Im from College Park but Im from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream Soowoo and Dadadoe
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy fuck a pussy leave it there
Long hair dont even care
Hey Mr Carter  Young I am him 
Tell me where have you been
Around the world now Im back again
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Whos been askin about me
Theyve been wondering why  In case you wonderin 
Hey Mr Carter  I am him 
Tell me where have you been
Around the world now Im back again
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Whos been askin about me
Theyve been wondering why  In case you wonderin chyeah 
Im right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter go farther go further go harder
Is that not why we came And if not then why bother
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
Im far from bein the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my names been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey got me a molotovcocktail flow
Even if you box well cant stop the blows
Kaboom The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also Im so fly Im on auto
Pilot while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros thats right plural
I took so much change from this rap game its your go
Hey Mr Carter  Young
Its my go yeah And Ima go so opposite of soft
Off the richter Hector Camacho Man Randy Savage
Far from average above statusquo flow so pro
I know I ride slow and when I pass
They say What up killa Man stop bringin up my past
And next time you mention Pac Biggie or JayZ
Dont forget Weezy Baby
Hey Mr Carter  Amen 
Tell me where have you been  Yeah 
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Theyve been wondering why  Haha 
Hey Mr Carter  Amen 
Tell me where have you been  Hova 
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching  Weezy 
Theyve been wondering why  Baby 
Hey Mr Carter  Hahaha 
Tell me where have you been  I been hustlin 
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching  Hustlin hard 
Theyve been wondering why  Chyeah 
Hey Mr Carter
Tell me where have you been
Cause theyve been asking theyve been searching
Theyve been wondering why
And I swear to everything when I leave this Earth
Its gonna be on both feet never knees in the dirt
And you can try me fucker but when I squeeze it hurt
Fine well lose two lives yours and mine
Give me any amount of time dont let Ms Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time dont let Ms Carter grieve
