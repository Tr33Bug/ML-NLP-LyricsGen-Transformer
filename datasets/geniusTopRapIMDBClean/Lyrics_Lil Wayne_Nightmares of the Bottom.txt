Sleeping at the top nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat em
But who am I to talk I aint shittin roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now Im looking in my rear view I see the world in it
I try to slow down and I get rearended
Pause like a red light Im dead right
Highway to Heaven God do you see my headlights
They say you dont know what youre doing til you stop doing it
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters Im a shooting star
Life is a course and Ima shoot for par
Searching for today instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back man Ill see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR Blood like a scar
Weezy F Baby and the F aint for Flaw
Uh uh
Yep yep
Yep yep
Its like I have it all but I dont have to worry
Married to the money a true love story
Only God can judge me I dont need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothings my security
Back to my journey that bullshit dont concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me nigga then I hope you toss and turnin
Im so cold Im hypothermic ask your bitch she will confirm it yeah
Now what we doin with it
Keep opening your grill Im barbecuin with it
I know my shit already tight so I aint screwin with it
Some say this game is a joke well I hope they get it
Okay Im walking on needles sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking Im familiar with the voice
Im a gangsta by choice I hope my sons choose wiser
And dont call me Sir call me Survivor
Uh yeah
Uh haha
And they go yep yep
Yep yep


Uh call me Killer cause I make a killin
I got this shit wrapped up bow and a ribbon
Thats them twin Glocks you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel better hope I keep dribblin
I touch the sky get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be cause you know how the stingll feel
Know how to whip that white girl I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track train derail
Know how to roll never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts I pop pain pills
Uh all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the F is for Fuck yourself
Uhh yeah
And I aint doing nothing but getting my share breathin this air
And Mack moms told me she gon keep me in her prayers
So Im feeling alright Im tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip then Ima meet you there
To my niggas in the game keep the game fair
Players play coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer
Im trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F Baby and the F aint for Fear uh
