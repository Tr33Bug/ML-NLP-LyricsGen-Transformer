God bless america
Carter are you prepared to take the constitutional oath
I am
Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me I
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
Sitting on the world I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love dont live here and it dont even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas aint satisfied until they mama missin
Niggas aint satisfied until they mama miss em
Uh Im a monster exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics mechanisms
Uh detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
Im beneficial Ive been official
I say you rappers sweet tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Aint no motherfucker harder than
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
Nobody gives you a chance you gotta take chances
Your family tree I will break branches
Cause I dont give a fuck I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then its ashes to ashes
The future is born put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga Im a bastard
Uh appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried the days of our lives
When shit get deep Im never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until Im buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
Amen so now instead of pledge we pray yeah
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
President Carter PrePresident Carter
Ya dead to me brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch brown bag nigga
Realitys a bitch and Imma dance with her
140 pounds 56 from the ground
Bitch Im in the building you aint even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldnt even get aroused
I aint looking for the beef but I aint seen it in a while
Uh and we all want world peace
Murder show I give your ass good seats
Shit Im much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth 
Thank you thank you all I am President Carter
