Sexual healing I can be her religion
And now shes kneeling praying to the ceiling

More than her mom time will tell that Im the nigga that

And I know I be with cavemen but never mind them

Maybe five like the Jacksons or John Paxson
Just dont let em fuck up the mansion
And Daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like womans soap and shampoo
And lotion and perfume and candles
And Ima run through that pussy like a vandal yes
Im nasty as a Scorpio but Im a lucky Libra
Got her wet like shes sweating out a feverwow
Leave her to me and shell be smiling every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated panties are debated
Einstein Her head is the greatest

Licking it like an envelope mailing it sealing it read it
