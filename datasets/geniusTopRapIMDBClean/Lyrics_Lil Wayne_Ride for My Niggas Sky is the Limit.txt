Ride for My Niggas  Sky is the Limit  Lyrics
Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3 ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Lets go
You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me Dont get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em Im a hustler and Id rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it if she steal it Ima kill her
I bulletproof the ride now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital  Young Money we the illest
And I aint gotta lie when I tell you Im the illest
My flow is nasty like CYphilis
Selfmade G and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap but in the kitchen Im a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Aint got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil intervention
And them birds dont fly without my permission
Im probably in the sky flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean swimming with the pigeons
See my world is different like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble bitch I want the same thing
And you know that Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
Dont worry bout mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high youll see that Im gon be in it
The sky is the limit  Errrrrrrr 
Buckten in the coupe and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch Dont talk to me
And if youre talking to them niggas dont talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say Talk is cheap
Cause Im the type that let money talk for me yeah
My flow is art  unique yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is Eat
By any means and you just sardines
I got the 40cal tucked in my PRPs
What do you expect Im from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brandnew map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it itll still be ours
And Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
Dont worry bout mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And Ima tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high youll see that Im gon be in it
Cause the sky is the limit
And you dont want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or Ill take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone thats sitting
On the living room sofa  thats fucked up haha
And you dont want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or Ill take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha now thats fucked up
And Im a G
And you aint got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the streets
So you know that Ima ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely Ima die with my finger on the trigger
Dont worry bout mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Dont worry about mine Ima grind til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high youll see that Im gon be in it
Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me Dont get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em Im a hustler and Id rather make a killing
Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you dont remember nothing man the sky is the limit
