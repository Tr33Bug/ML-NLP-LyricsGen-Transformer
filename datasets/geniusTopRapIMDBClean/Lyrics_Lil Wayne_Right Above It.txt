Kane is in the building
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
Im with Marley Gs bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose I dont get shit confused
I got a small circle Im not with different crews
We walk the same path but got on different shoes
Live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Dont like my women single I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that its time to go
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on its Young Money motherfucker
If you aint running with it run from it motherfucker
Alright now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my Bs with me like some honey in this bitch you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I dont bust back because I shoot first
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes Im in the building you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck XGames
Guns turn you boys into pussies sex change
And I smoke til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A get my advance in advance amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach Im just playing in the sand
Uh wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas cant see me but never overlook me
Im on a paper trail and aint no telling where it took me
Yeah and I aint a killer but dont push me


Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on its Young Money motherfucker
If you aint running with it run from it motherfucker
Alright now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my Bs with me like some honey in this bitch you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I dont bust back because I shoot first
How do you say whats never said
Beautiful black woman I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin Birdman Junior 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense check the paw prints
We in the building you niggas in apartments
Uh now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you aint gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
HipHop Im the heart of that
Nigga nothing short of that
President Carter Young Money Democrat
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on its Young Money motherfucker
If you aint running with it run from it motherfucker
Alright now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my bs with me like some honey in this bitch you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I dont bust back because I shoot first
