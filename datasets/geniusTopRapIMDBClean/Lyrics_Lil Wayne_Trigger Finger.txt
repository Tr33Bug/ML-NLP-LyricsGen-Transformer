I aint lookin back nigga
Im a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers Im bout to make a fist
Everybody die gon bury me alive
Grab life by the horns put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
Im at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life aint shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven Im taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me Im a sensei
And I got fat pockets you niggas in shape
Tools on deck tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch Ill make her your ex
Better turn to God fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker its on Im just rubbing em wrong
Put a bug in my ear but not in my phone
Ill have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone
And put 
One in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
Empty stomach full clip
Im gon get it gon get it
Empty stomach full clip
Im gon get it gon get it
My trigger finger itchin my trigger finger itchin
My trigger finger itchin my trigger finger itchin
My trigger finger itching nigga
I dont like to dream about gettin paid
You aint gon hurt nobody like Kid n Play
Aint nothin sweet but the codeine nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in em
I was gettin that pussy I was gettin that money
Long hair dont care Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath too high to take a step
Two rights dont make a wrong three rights make a left
The cops on my dick the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it got legs on my words
If she dont suck dick I dont give her that dick
Got the world in my hands Imma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
Im a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money now you dead on arrival
I dont fuck with these niggas too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
Im laced up like two shoes Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet nigga
Trigger finger itchin Ill scratch it nigga
Blow your fuckin brains out in traffic nigga
Got green New Orleans St Patrick nigga
One bitch in the whip one on the phone
The one on the phone is in front of your home
She bout to run in your home and put 


One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
One in ya dome one in ya dome
Empty stomach full clip
Im gon get it gon get it
Empty stomach full clip
Im gon get it gon get it
My trigger finger itchin my trigger finger itchin
My trigger finger itchin my trigger finger itchin
My trigger finger itchin
Nigga
Rest in peace to the game cause Im fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game tell them kill they self
Make your death wish cause Im too fresh
Cause Im fresh to death cause Im fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game cause I killed it
Im fresh to death Im fresh to death
What you talkin I came out a coffin
Yeah
I just cant see myself
Living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a doubleR
Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I ammunition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt camo the shorts
Your girl is a freak your man is a narc
With your son in your arms
Ill put 
One in your dome
Tunechi
