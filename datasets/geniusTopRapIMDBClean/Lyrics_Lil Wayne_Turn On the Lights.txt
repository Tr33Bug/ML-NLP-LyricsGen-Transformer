Remix
We fall asleep naked we wake up naked
You know what that means pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it Im a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep thats that itis
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit Im the owner
I make her moan call her Mona
Id have a threesome if they cloned her
And me Im purple kush forever
Im purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I aint thinking bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And Imma change your life
And dont sit on top of this dick if youre scared of heights
And shawty be like
This pussy for you
I ask her is it true And she say like a horseshoe
She got that nigga name covered thats a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like vroom
Then I turn on the lights yeah
And look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight
You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus first aid
They ask me whats her race and I say first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon ride this dick I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want I give her Santa Clause face
We gon turn up tonight
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she dont ever ask about her
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered thats a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid she a plus first aid
I put her in her place and thats first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I aint got no worries no Frank Ocean Im straight
Tunechi tell em Im straight
Tunechi
