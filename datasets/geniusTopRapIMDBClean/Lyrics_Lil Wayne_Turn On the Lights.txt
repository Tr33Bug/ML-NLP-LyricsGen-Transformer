Turn On the Lights Lyrics
Remix
We fall asleep naked, we wake up naked
You know what that means, pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it, I'm a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep, that's that "itis"
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit, I'm the owner
I make her moan, call her Mona
I'd have a threesome if they cloned her
And me I'm purple kush forever
I'm purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I ain't thinking 'bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And I'mma change your life
And don't sit on top of this dick if you're scared of heights
And shawty be like
This pussy for you
I ask her is it true? And she say like a horseshoe
She got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like "vroom"
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
And look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight
You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus, first aid
They ask me whatâ€™s her race and I say first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight

That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her
You might also like
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi, tell 'em I'm straight
Tunechi
