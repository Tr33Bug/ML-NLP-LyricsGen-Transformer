My niggas been stuntin since way back when
CNN I got news for you haters
Im a nasty ass nigga ask your bitch I aint lying
69 thats a favor for a favor
Them hoes bitin they lip cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front from the side from the back I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like Im just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow but she like to taste
Dingdingdingdingding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly too many flights to take
Enough with the small talk my girl pussy is a waterpark
Every little thing I do turn her on thats autostart
I kiss every single body part her body is a work of art
Im way too high her skirt too short
I think I love her it was just a THOT
I pop up in that coupe bout to go back to the future
And she said Tune not in my mouth damn you shouldve said it sooner
I be shittin on these niggas like Im sippin Metamucil
And we smokin on that gas pass it like excuse you
And its 662s Piru all day my nigga
Before these niggas play with us theyll play dead my nigga
And if you lookin for me Ill be on these bitches mind
These niggas chicken and Ive never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin at me about nothin
Aint no tellin what shed do if I replace her
Like bae Im straight theres plenty fish and Im bait
We cant even have a decent conversation
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like See you gon drink your life away
Bitch its my life my life my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too they write down license plates
I hope that ho dont call sayin her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop but I need tighter brakes
And dont run from this dick girl I dont like to chase
I wax that ass she make that Mr Miyagi face
And she aint all that pretty but I like her shape
They say numbers dont lie she shaped like a 8
She say she aint no dyke but she gon dyke today
Its curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes
We turnt up niggas burnt up stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life but thats the price we pay
Im hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5 whattup 5
Ay Tune I gotta turn up on the D5 man
Hustle Gang bang green mean anybody get it
Anything well do for the paper
And we live this shit talk slick get killt
Got nothin but a tool for a hater  Spent 100K on my wrist nigga 
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way  I know it do 
Your ho be on me know you feel some type of way  I take your ho 
The car Im drivin make you feel some type of way  They cant afford this nigga 
The cash I gettin make you feel some type of way  BankrollsRUs 
This type of way know you feel some type of way  Hustle Gang my nigga 
That shit aint hot we out here poppin thats all I can say  GDOD 
My only problem is tryin to decide what Imma drive today  Hustle Gang my nigga 
We shine all in they face I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multimillion dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth like they some type of gay
You know me dog so watch what you say  You better watch your mouth 
We aint playing no games with your lame ass nigga fuckboy you can die today  I swear you can 
I keep a chopper in my backseat actually its my Glock partner  My Glock partner 
Play crazy if you want to fuck around and get shot partner  Get shot partner 
I dont like these niggas and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want when you see me you wont touch me nigga  Wont touch me niggas 
Ball all around in my flip flop you think TIP soft Well then why dont you try me
If you really gon be dramatic we gon to need some music they queuein the violin
Im talking slow singing flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing and you chest thing and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way  I know it do 
Your ho be on me know you feel some type of way  I take your ho 
The car Im driving make you feel some type of way  They cant afford this nigga 
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way  BankrollsRUs
