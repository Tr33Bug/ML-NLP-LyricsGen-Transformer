Dedication 5
Since 05
Know that
You feel like KoolAid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad no dressing take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They dont ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and Im the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And Ima buy a summer house with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I dont
I wont say I wont eat it if you chef it
Fuck it Ill hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me great and powerful Ossie
Whos behind the man behind the curtain Foxy coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin oh wait it wasnt
Oh and I forgot Ill take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh isnt that sweet
You feel like KoolAid in a wine glass
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see Im lying through my teeth
And now Im flying on my PJ looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack lemme get back on track
You say I act like I dont miss you thats because I dont act
But anyway we can roleplay or get straight to it
Sorry my mind in the gutterbetter yet sewer
And when you say I love you I stutter II love you too
Its Waynes world she say What is this world coming to
And she know me and whoever together she hope we comin loose
She told me that if she aint the one she gon throw up the deuce
I laughed at her we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
What if you and I were just letters
Thatd be unfortunate wed have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay thats a dead subject you bring it up thats a zombie
You remind me of my memory aint what it used to be
She said she aint trippin I know because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
Ill be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
II love you too


This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song this is a you song
I just happen to love you
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count
Are you counting
I loved the pictures
I needed that I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You dont believe me I know
D5 what up 5
II love you tooI do
