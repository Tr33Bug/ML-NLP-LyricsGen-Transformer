Tonys Home
Yo Banks I told these niggas man
Yall done fucked up now 
Aint No click like the one Im wit
If the drama gets thick its the guns I get  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from then sit  Down 
We gettin dough everywhere we go
And its killin em slow just to hear me blow  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from sit down
By now I know you done seen me
On your stadium or TV with 380 on the EV
I skeet babies on ya breezy
And I aint stoppin
Only jake or Jacob could freeze me
Squeeze me and its bye bye gone
We got guns like Popeyes arm
I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin
Cause theres one on all of mine Im the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for murder on every Who Kid
Kay Slay and Big Mike admit it the kid tight
And you aint even put up a fight so its back to the amateurs
Wrappin your sandwiches Im hot now so the rats want to stand wit us
They hop in the van wit us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs now Im back tourin Canadas
Amongst weed smokers and crapfloor gamblers
Aint No click like the one Im wit
If the drama gets thick its the guns I get  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from then sit  Down 
We gettin dough everywhere we go
And its killin em slow just to hear me blow  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from sit down
Make sure the birds dont get brought to him
I watched Kobe go from the basketball court to the courtroom
Go head try to do me harm soldier
And youll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And Ill be damn if I cosign a old snitch
That was gangbangin when Jaws was a Goldfish
Ive been named New Yorks screamin on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin on the beat
Im well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin on a freak fan base leanin on the jeep
They walkin wit the fire
So if you say banks in you verse Then you better be talkin bout Tyra
From PA to LA Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis my buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow but hit the gas on a silly hoe
Bounce like ass in my video
Aint No click like the one Im wit
If the drama gets thick its the guns I get  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from then sit  Down 
We gettin dough everywhere we go
And its killin em slow just to hear me blow  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from sit down
Ey yo
Uno dos tres cuatro
My click eat like the Twelve Holy Apostles
We bust down models and plush out Tahoes
Jewels froze  look like we hit the lotto
P89 my clip filled wit hollows
Stunt in the club  get hit wit yellow bottles
Dont speak ma if ya neck dont swallow
Cause 50 push Bentleys and Dre push Diablos
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Scrooge McDuck stays swimmin in my cash flow
Yay rap is crack and I got the best blow  best flow
Banks put me in the booth lets go
Think like Cestro the games in a lasso
Jump in the Benz without snaps on the petro
God gave me this flow so I am special
In 16 bars nigga Im finished finito
Aint No click like the one Im wit
If the drama gets thick its the guns I get  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from then sit  Down 
We gettin dough everywhere we go
And its killin em slow just to hear me blow  Now 
GUnit niggas is runnin this shit  Now 
If you aint reppin where you from sit down
