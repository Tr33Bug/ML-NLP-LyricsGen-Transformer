Weed all morning and then it dawned on em
The niggas that call him the best I moonwalk on em
Dont add gasoline Ill put the torch on em
They gon keep wavin the bull until these horns on em
You fall on morning before it start stormin
Aint really no competition I rip apart all em
Go call em I serve niggas till they get boring
Midnight midday morning ugh
This song is for errbody I make it look simple Gs
I wipe the floor with MCs stack triple cheese  Uhhuh 
Me Fif and Yay just coppednow thats triple Beams
My PLK ring hold weight I cripple knees  Knees 
Traitors get betrayed tramps get to lick on these
I light the room bright as lamps nigga pick a sleeve
You know you cant get with the camp lucky you get to breathe
Please dont ask me how Im living when I lift my keys  Yeah 
Brandnewspankin Franklins

Words with the struggling Black man bars hard as Obama job  Ugh 
Fuck my enemies  Yeah  I tell they momma slob
Drop my bag tie niggas up like Amistad

Leap and the drama frog sleep from the karma start  Woo 
Suppose I lose it these old niggas entrees

Hop out shoot the dice pause for the blue and whites  Ugh 
And my new Lous they lucky if I do em twice
About to catch my flight to Nice cause Im nice
Dime after dime Im the man yeah
Her ass spillin over the damn chair  Ugh 
Her titties stand up like Pam Grier  Uhhuh 
I give em wide walls and damp hair
Slow fellatio in the Lam yeah lets camp here  Ha 
See nine times out of ten Im kinda rocky
Im dressed up so I pose for the paparazzi
Furs by the row extreme shopper hobby
Twenty thirty racks on that cream Maserati  Woo

Your boy back rappin his ass off a brick to glass jaws

Black leather tint on the fast horse the last Porsche
Ball like mad sports passports Im back forth
One man attack force
The 9th wonder eight other planets past ross
You wore a badge boss
Headed on a crash course  My hearts ice
Future brighter than my last thoughts  Youre all mice
On air wouldnt fall off the floordrop
I melt mics Im shit out the mall hot And everything that youre not
Warlock  Back block Sureshock
Keep your mouth shut and your door locked
Cause speakers go home in a long box
Its all lies hes gonna call the cops
You aint a MC you a fat bitch I get you Swiss cheese for Mac clips
Nose dives takin oneknees and backflips  All over rap shit
End a whole crew at the same time
Im calm alleyoop when its game time  And I aint even in my prime
My waistlines a grey Nine thatll make your ass
Run like a great dane  Chasin dollar bills
Dont chase fame  These niggas really bummy and fake chains
If there wasnt so many Id name names but brigade aim
Hungry like a nigga with no fridge
Strange I aint grow up like most kids
Pains bulletholes and broke ribs
Stains over clothes and close deaths
Denials heavens clouds and no stress
The games full of fouls and no refs
Complaints from the crowds and no love
We bring the guns out when they go club
Bottles and Bud  Thick models and drugs
Six Hollow the Subs you dipped out with a thug
Dicked down on the rug I skipped town with her love
Blind who  Take these big diamonds and blood
