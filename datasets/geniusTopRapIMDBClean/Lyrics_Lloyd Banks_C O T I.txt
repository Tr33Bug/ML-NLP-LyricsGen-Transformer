The spread of infection 
Uh
The streets dont show love and gettin to it dont make you a boss
Theres no remorse the turns of the inevitable course
Dont follow nobody elses figure out which path is yours
Cause lights go off and I pray to God I never get lost
They always watchin pretendin they want you winnin of course
They want the torch the turns of the inevitable course
All I got is my word and principles that I never cross
Cant get knocked off the turns of the invitable course  Yo uh 
Rare that I spak on yall rather I not be mentioned either
You runnin the internet with your issues youre an attentionseeker
Never laid shit down for me covered expenses either
Thats where Blue came in showin loves an expensive teacher
Money involved peoplell flipflop on you Gucci style
You shit all on me keep that same energy when the truth comes out
You flawed yourself who put you in a position where you can vouch
Do losers count I brung you round time to pack up and move the house
Losin the best friends a feeling nobody else can help
Just look at me all these years later still out here by myself
Lured from the fakest material things disguised as wealth
Thinkin Im vulnerable Im not weapon concealed behind the belt
And half this doubt out here since before you heard of me love it
Minimize him behind doors switchin it up in public
You lookin for light got a little bit off my name and loved it
Grownass man dick ridin for pictures Im disgusted  Uh 
The streets dont show love and gettin to it dont make you a boss
Theres no remorse the turns of the inevitable course
Dont follow nobody elses figure out which path is yours
Cause lights go off and I pray to God I never get lost
They always watchin pretendin they want you winnin of course
They want the torch the turns of the inevitable course
All I got is my word and principles that I never cross
Cant get knocked off the turns of the inevitable course  Uh 


Take a walk through my catalog that nobody helped me design
Just when you thought you finally clipped my wings you were helpin me fly
Maybe my dark auras reversed maybe I fell from the sky
Cant let no playbothsiders blot out my vision eyeforaneye
They want the truth intact force me to shoot it back left me a boobytrap
How cruel is that Got me out in the corners where it get spooky at
Believe nothin what you hear fuckin dummy for just assumin that
Half of what you may see common sense is rare and you losin that
AR1 with the doofy strap thisll supply the fiends
New improved version of super crack cruisin back in the Beem
I was destined to have a king since the pharaoh get moved to Queens
Crabs tryna stop each other hard to be happy if one of us leaves
These suckers dont get to slap five point Ive severed my rap ties
Deaths a permanent black eye rest in peace Wise and Fat Shy
Pockets fat as your last lie allegedly Im the bad guy
Probably dont like me anyway lucky to see me pass by  Uh 
The streets dont show love and gettin to it dont make you a boss
Theres no remorse the turns of the inevitable course
Dont follow nobody elses figure out which path is yours
Cause lights go off and I pray to God I never get lost
They always watchin pretendin they want you winnin of course
They want the torch the turns of the inevitable course
All I got is my word and principles that I never cross
Cant get knocked off the turns of the inevitable course
