Celebrity  Remix  Lyrics
I just touched down  Ferraritoconcrete
I aint even home when theyre talking about me
Fuck out my ear if you talking about free
Nigga free dont pay the bills
Im ballin allout B
These rappers dont know me
Nah I aint your homey
If your name aint Em Ferrari or Tony
I like my wheel chromey
My Bentley my Rolly
My Magnum my phonie
South Jamaica shawty
These slugs I took in the gut yo
The works still here Im just cooking it up slow
Clear my mind and whipping the truck low
Youre looking for trouble
I pop death
Youre looking to a sun dawg
If rap aint work I be pimpin on some ho
Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow
Im back like crack over the drum roll
You know  wherever I go the gun go
We on the grind
All the time
Aint bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper
Cause Im a celebrity
Ghettocelebrity
Aint nothing changed nigga
The media will test ya popularity is pressure
Porche Panamera platinum hammer through the metal
Wreck a booth up Im too tough
That innercity grammar step your jewels up
They bruised up Ill sparkle for the camera
Harsh realitys what pulls them
And holding them back from opening
Verbal attack all over these niggas
Push the herd to the back
Im the kind that they prey on
Spending half of they day on
Lay on niggas for days the shots spray on
My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac
6 4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that aint here
Two tone two door grey top blue floor
Green guap galore in and out of new hall
That bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash
Im tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass


We on the grind
All the time
Aint bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper
Cause Im a celebrity
Ghettocelebrity
Aint nothing changed nigga
There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing
So dont get me going dont dare start
Youll never see me again Amelia Earhart
Im popping a wheelie off to a really unfair start
Im past grinding for me  guess I just be grounded up
Like Ground Round or a pound of chuck
Tightlywound as fuck
Til the Fire Marshalls come shut
Fire Marshall down and up
I suggest you better shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck
I aint playing this time I told you Im out for blood
So to say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
And blow on your dick cock Is she up to screwing Down to fuck
Its a mans world and Im trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
Running through a house of mutts
In other words Im shutting every one of you bitches mouths up
And Im watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt
And aint shit changed my shit still dont stink player
My farts may have gotten staler ever since
I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster child for white trash
Im a Garbage Pail Kid sailor yeah
See me Im all up on your bitch means Ima rape her
All I got for these hoes is dick duct tape and a stapler
So bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape up
I dont subscribe to the News or the Free Press
But homie I get the paper
Fucking stupid
