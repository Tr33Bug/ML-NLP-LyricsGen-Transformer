Uh I never wanted to be center stage
Thats out of character bonuses of my inner rage
As I mix things up me and my chemist ways
Caught in my prime where Im stuck all while my demo plays
Inebriated off returning my revenge is certain
Potent power green purple my expensive smoking
Waking your tired ass up dont got a dream to sell
Dont put your hand out you dont mean me well
A couple of other dreamers take my spot
Number one with a bullet save my CD shell
Hard as a storm weather Im never worried
Im a never be over dead and buried
I got a date with destiny my head is hurried
My maker made my recipe cant take it from me
You making enemies you making money
Haters looking for love haters hate they love me
I put my count before a dollar sign
It aint about no money I can count on mine
Mind your business keep your shit in line
Anything its going to take aint no quitting time
Leave the games out there we dont play
Aint nobody going to care out here thats no days
Fronting on us aint a good idea go pray
Those that say dont know and those that know dont say
Its a betrayal every day
You fucking with the wrong MC looking for love
Im connected to a line of Gs
Born with the look book in the plug
Sun coming all night dumb and whooping in the club
Miss me if you shady couldnt find a brighter bulb
They think Im digging them think about the studio
Dummies love the gossip patience shrinking as the rumors grow
Im popping penguins thats the usual
Dont plot on him cause thats your funeral
Vultures waiting every hit you drop
Im elevating couldnt get the spot
Im revving on them smelling like Pirelli
War zone never seen a viking worried
Tough skin stepping out Italian made
What you describe as a fire at its hottest grade
Still dont give a fuck and shit not trying to change
I look at you a sucker you aligned with lames
I put my count before a dollar sign
It aint about no money I can count on mine
Mind your business keep your shit in line
Anything its going to take aint no quitting time
Leave the games out there we dont play
Aint nobody going to care out here thats no days
Fronting on us aint a good idea go pray
Those that say dont know and those that know dont say
Its a betrayal every day
Fools blind rhyming with no purpose
New lines out of my old verses
You aint lay it that aint your RollRoyces
Niggas out here acting until you close curtains
Sixteens is getting me licked clean
Whip dreams big bodies split screens
Hot throne you couldnt sit beside it
This is what you get if I should simplify it
How many soldiers seen a man sell
Understand hell and the goal is to keep it real Cant tell
They stepping up as if the champ fell
Baby momma numbers and my tramp cell
I put my count before a dollar sign
It aint about no money I can count on mine
Mind your business keep your shit in line
Anything its going to take aint no quitting time
Leave the games out there we dont play
Aint nobody going to care out here thats no days
Fronting on us aint a good idea go pray
Those that say dont know and those that know dont say
Its a betrayal every day
