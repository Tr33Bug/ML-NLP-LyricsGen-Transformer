Yeah
Mothafuckas know what time it is man
This is The Course of the Inevitable
Yo the audacity it takes to rank me with the style I invented
Wear my credentials like its jewelry they gave my flowers cemented
To hell with honorable mentions artists are comical temptin
Horrible albums new ventin three pounds of vomit who sent em
Stereo blood or laughing they heliumd up your last king
Cant muzzle me up with no coffin wont hit me with no vaccine
Goons in the black Beem turn your crew to a track team
Highly viewed on the rap scene sly maneuvers and cash streams
Flee from the copper sound racist coppers they chop us down
Ounces of 14K you RIP boxes with rocks around
None of yall profit bound crypt the equipment out the sockers now
Get with the art or drown rubber bands stackin up dollar pounds
Revenge is on its job karmall sneak a gun in softly
Been callin up to God startin to think He hung up on me
Number orgy figured you need some incentive to come support me
One or two flips Im out of here hit the work with a somersault we on
I can still hear the money calling I done been out the way too long
Nothing out here is more important put in the spot where I belong
Gotta know how to take a loss give me that curse when I was born
The last nigga that go to sleep will be the first to be put on
Live all your days like its your last cause in a blink you could be gone
You rather love or will respect Showin that lovell get you harmed
Wont be no empathy cause you going through it gotta be strong  Yeah 
Its always easier for you to do wrong  Big Rabbit Gang yeah 
Went on a yacht got seasick cant fuck on the boat no more
A key of wap mixed with that cut guess I dont sell dope no more
Synthetics mafia methods like Im in the Cosa No
Get rich and charge it all to a bitch thats how this shit posed to go
My geekers wanna damn near OD they want that got em dead
Kitchen full of powder I turn my bitch to a powderhead
Niggas takin deals thats the only way you get out the feds
Castrated dick in his fuckin mouth when they found him dead  Yo slow down Fred 
These scammers aint no hustlers they computer thots
This Harlem nigga sent some shooters at me got his shooter shot  Oops 
Uh this shit I be spittin so real make niggas pull they Google out
My Vette orange groovin like I grew up on the Hoover block
I move it in the UHaul my Spanish niggas gon get me right
Freddie Chicharito fuck Spanish bitches up in the Heights
Bussin with this TEC I got jacked and I tried to smoke a hike
Nine shots turned into Superman when he smoked the pipe
Yeah you heard him right


I can still hear the money calling I done been out the way too long
Nothing out here is more important put in the spot where I belong
Gotta know how to take a loss give me that curse when I was born
The last nigga that go to sleep will be the first to be put on
Live all your days like its your last cause in a blink you could be gone
You rather love or will respect Showin that lovell get you harmed
Wont be no empathy cause you going through it gotta be strong
Its always easier for you to do wrong  Uh 
From here on out its independent now fuck what the labels offerin
Sick and tired of awkward grins back slammin coupe doors again
Studios Ive been torturing Ima dedicate this to all the less fortunate
Theres a lack of real niggas fucked up the war percent
Victory is a gorgeous sin bought the Benz so you all can vent
More content with a fortune spent no disrespect from talks exempt
Mackin gave me a freezin chest always thirty degrees or less
Destined for me to be the best out of QU two Es NS
Vegetable state for being fake EMS to a vegan death
Poverty leaves you breathin stressed legal mess on the freedom steps
Celebrity never made me my sentiments made me crazy
187s the consequence 718s the AC
Troubled to say the least pray the heavenly gates embrace thee
Theres finally notoriety thats gon come with a late fee
Performance style is a 40 cal back out movin the army now
Far away from the corny crowd dying you call me out now
I can still hear the money calling I done been out the way too long
Nothing out here is more important put in the spot where I belong
Gotta know how to take a loss give me that curse when I was born
The last nigga that go to sleep will be the first to be put on
Live all your days like its your last cause in a blink you could be gone
You rather love or will respect Showin that lovell get you harmed
Wont be no empathy cause you going through it gotta be strong
Its always easier for you to do wrong
