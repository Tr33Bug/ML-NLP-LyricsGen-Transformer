I wasnt gone if you missed me
Put em up
Put em up put em up put em up
Put em up
Put em up put em up put em up
Hands up Shorty when you party with me
We goin way past quarter to three
I say hands up  Im good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
I say hands up  You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
I say hands up  Everything aint cool as the fame
And this shit aint as sweet as it looks  I say hands up 
You know Im puttin something on me
Right before I leave outta the car  We came to party 
You go tough talkin at me
You gon leave out the club wit a scar  We came to party 
We pop bottles like its all free
Fore I leave Ima buy out the bar  We came to party 
You gon order whatchu want its on me
Im a G take a look at a star  We came to party 
It feels so good to live sucka free
Im soakin it all up while your girls suckin me
It mean the world to her its nuttin but a nut to me
Look miss get a grip or let a mothafucker be
Im a rap star who posed to be ridin around in that car
Two in the front in the back got the plasma
This aint a free ride you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldnt buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And Im busy so I move a bit faster
You cant tell me yes if I dont ask ya huh
Im a bastard damn near chauvinist hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And thats it lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with
Hands up Shorty when you party with me
We goin way past quarter to three
I say hands up  Im good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
I say hands up  You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
I say hands up  Everything aint cool as the fame
And this shit aint as sweet as it looks  I say hands up 
You know Im puttin something on me
Right before I leave outta the car  We came to party 
You go tough talkin at me
You gon leave out the club wit a scar  We came to party 
We pop bottles like its all free
Fore I leave Ima buy out the bar  We came to party 
You gon order whatchu want its on me
Im a G take a look at a star  We came to party 
Yea
I cruise through the strip 22s on the whip new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped nigga move or get hit
I dont care whos on the strip
It aint only the Ferrari now the jewels got em sick
Now its 2006 I need a new bottom miss
Its aight they can talk Im amused by the pricks
Im the news out the bricks nigga whos hot as this
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got em pissed
I aint a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas icegrill but it aint the same
They dont see the faces they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get em they dont know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular shit the everyday mentality
They charged up dont make me put in the battery
Hands up Shorty when you party with me
We goin way past quarter to three
I say hands up  Im good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
I say hands up  You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
I say hands up  Everything aint cool as the fame
And this shit aint as sweet as it looks  I say hands up 
You know Im puttin something on me
Right before I leave outta the car  We came to party 
You go tough talkin at me
You gon leave out the club wit a scar  We came to party 
We pop bottles like its all free
Fore I leave Ima buy out the bar  We came to party 
You gon order whatchu want its on me
