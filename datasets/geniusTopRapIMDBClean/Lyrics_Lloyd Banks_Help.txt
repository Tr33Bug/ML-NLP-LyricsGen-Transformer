GUnit  Uh A one two a one two
Uh A one two a one two
Yeah  Uh A one two a one two
Ooooohhh  Uh
Excuse me miss you must be some kind of a model
Enough to make a shopper run out of the column
Enough to make a weak nigga go mano y mano
Guess what you strong as rum out of the bottle
God bless you when he made me
I mean he blessed me when he made you I got a little game to
They know me everywhere I go thats what fame do
Where we can keep it on the low whats your name boo
You stuck in your ways but I know how to change you
Arrange you tell you things like your my angel
Theres no rules when it comes to this write down your number miss
They call me Banks my government is Chris
They feel me in the burbs love me in the bricks
Four inch whips on a buggy six
First class trips and the bubblys Cris
I work so hard to live like this
My past made me so weak but you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down now Im right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me shock me all over my body
I think Im losin my cool so Im doin things I dont do
Yeah I got her she hop in the ride so I could holla
My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I aint gon say you a dream I dont gotta
You could walk around in the street with no collar
I pick up all the G that he speaks so dont bother
The innocent role aint workin work harder
I aint tryin to lock you down Im no father
But maybe we can go further if you just listen
Its hard as hell for a man in my position
To pick a good girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if its even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance
And Im have to look hard to find a better one
Cause yo sex is a 187 hon
You get a nigga doin shit I aint never done
So now even when Im on tour I let her come
My past made me so weak but you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down now Im right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me shock me all over my body
I think Im losin my cool so Im doin things I dont do
Lloyd Banks 
Your not the ones like Im used to I see us happy in our future
Im givin you all I have my heart my soul my laugh
Cause you are the only thing I need
I could give ya everything and more give you the feelin you cant ignore 
Whoa oooh oh
My past made me so weak but you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down now Im right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me shock me all over my body
I think Im losin my cool so Im doin things I dont do
