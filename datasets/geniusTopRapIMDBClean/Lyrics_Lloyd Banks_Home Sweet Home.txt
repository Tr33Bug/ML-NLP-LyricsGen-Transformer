Yeah twenty miles an hour in my long Bentley
Shame on you hater this what the Lord sent me
Shit lately Ive been practicing my gas face
Cause thats what Ima give em when they land in last place
Hand right by the hammer aint too many seein Santa
So they wanna take my gifts but I wrap em with the fif
My regular scent is piff currency and Cashmere
You done drove your bitch away I told her she can crash here
Yeah Im counting paper like the cashier
Living like Im limited breathing like its my last air
My boy in and out the box super stupid soldier
Told me if he could do it again hed do it over
Povertys king cobra squeeze your life out
Cause its the fatalities and causalities I should write bout
These rappers aint iced out they just fooling niggas
Running round town fakers zirconian cubic niggas
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
You motherfuckers can rap til you blue in the face
Youll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they thrown shots at the greats
But I shoot back the Lord aint designed me for hate
Ive never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole world watching me turn the other cheek
Never so theres one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happen to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then them near misses was Gods kisses
True Hollywood Story ghetto Todd Bridges
Diffrent Strokes that nigga broke this nigga rich
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the hoes that I dabble with
Balcony views like a postcard imagine this
White stones black steel cold chrome
This citys my doormat bitch Im home sweet home
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
Niggas see me where you see me shit Im always seen
Off the Queens magazines pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds hunger screams pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living Henny payment for the body
Crosses for the power ghetto bitches for the smiley
Pitbull I bit my way out the cage whats happening
Competition got me on the Rampage Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me rat tat kiss the ring beat respect out them
Bloody heads turn Timberlands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now thats how you do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playing rider music
Aint no question of my resume I gotta prove it
Lifes a bitch and I get blowjobs reclinin through it
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
