Three SixtyFive Im four five sixing
To out pole Richmond my sound so different
Im Dow Jones dipping round crown whipping
Dirty south system riding through your system
450 engine Im here to bring them Ms
Word to my emblem the top dog and some
I got to have it in the worse ways
Seen through haters since the first grade learn how to surf waves
Around here they coming like tsunamis
They all by me thats why I keep the thing by me
Green Maserati with the Hercules body
They want your boy locked like Gotti
Shawty dont want me she wants what I can give her
10 bedrooms swimming pool and a river
Shed have all three if I was a weak nigga
But unfortunately for you Im Blue
Call me what you want but dont call me for shit
Im slinging hard dick all you can get my phone ringing
Which you aint the only chick my stones blinging
Im riding the chromey whip I dont string em
Along thats when shit go wrong
Clap her all night long shell be schizo gone
You know in the mind not the physical form
Yeah Im single but not the individual form
I got to mingle fuck having handcuffs on
I aint into banging I aint marital sworn
I aint stack up all this bread to have it withdrawn
Get the chick get the uh get the math Im gone
Makes no sense to commit with what I knew would past
I like my chicks like my cars new and fast
You cant pawn fake jewelry review the cash
I spent more than what they get on you on gas
Airbags I could fuck around and crash
Totaled the V walk out without a scratch
I got a style thats like slick without his patch
Pops is loud gator with the platinum latch
Black and wild dont know how to act
They back you down so watch what all your violent rap
I leave the club with a 25 thousand stack
And make it rain where the public housing at
If you see me it was probably in and out the stores
In the F700 with the open doors
I aint a come up I come and go bro
I aint regular nigga I run the show
Get back dont push dont crowd em
They love to talk about it when you hit rock bottom
They want a problem but I know how to solve em
Slip a rope around they throat watch em choke like Saddam
Hussein you lames better take it easy
Before I push the red button put you suckas on TV
Gotta feed mama she like to wear Prada and she wont fly commercial so Im paying for charter
You see a shotta if you touch one dollar
I love my nina so much I wrote a song about her
Rolling up that white widow marijuana
It looks I dropped it in a bag of baby powder
Censorship cant censor me it made me louder
Gun shots dont stop me they bring me power
Man they talking sour till you put em in the shower
Make it rain lead on em every other hour
Aye Flex do I look scared  Scured 
I know the Alphabet thats just another word
Banks aint biased everybody gets served
And my ears aint broken everybody gets heard
Big trapper little trapper really dont matter
Grammy winning artist or a silly broke rapper
Gun packer I aint worried bout a jacker
What you think I got a firecracker
These little boys silly bow to a woolly
Man they me in my city like Philly love Beanie
Bring the Macmilly cause they wanna grill me
And they still home hanging off they mamma titty
Trend setter from my hat to my sweater
I switch whips according to the weather
Banks aint a cuffer I clap it then forget her
Let her find somebody thatll treat her better
MOB forever
