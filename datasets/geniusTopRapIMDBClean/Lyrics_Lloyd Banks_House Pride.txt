Before my time goes they going to raise a niggas jersey in the sky
Treat a nigga right been dreaming on my life
Shorty want to get some air I go and get her when I fly
Taking off on these niggas I retire the minute I catch fire
I smoked them all before just revisiting the high
Ima get it until they gun me aint no giving up an eye
And we aint never shared a level dawg it couldnt be a tie
See me when you talking cause they eyes dont lie
Rather leave this bitch early than watch time go by
Bitch you better have the light not I
I feel an Emmy when a rivals by
I know God feel me give a fuck about who loves me
Its funny everyone gathers when its about some money
Money into making everything alright or ugly
Im in line with the stars boulevard scared hungry
This life aint pretty shit should be ugly how were dying
You better know them girls dont really love you they by lying
Probably fed my hunger ever hunt me Im a lion
Cooler than my jewels boy touch em and youre frying
Spitter of the city what the fuck are you providing
My style is going everywhere you ducking and you hiding
Im going to reign again put that on a couple of medallions
We dont care about nothing and we wilin
You riding with your nigga aint your nigga
He dont get it when it rain
I came in to deliver Im going to come up with a name
I got the title to my city with key around my chain
Im a keeper to the books when I leave going to be the same
Twenty years later Im a king 
Course so Hallelujah See my cross show
Holding on a horror Stephen King on a song though
Lifes short dawg heavens huge we can all go
The people that you shit on your way up
Shit right back on you on your way down
Not to mention niggas dumb for no reason
Never cared then fuck you think it matters what they say now
Ive been on my only shit sorry you dont see me bruh
Shades all they show me so I bother with the media
I pray for the money to come something told me itd be easier
Voices lied to me turned a humble nigga greedy uh
I dont need no back up shit My back against the wall
Keep your words small never know whos tapping in your call
For the long haul better off you strapping when you ball
Jelly cause you jig hacking with the saw splatters on the floor
Scatter from the law spill the pen out with the liquor
Get a diamond for you try me from the gate I been that nigga
Bet you think its fun and fame Entertainment made me sicker
That chick just want a bubble back then I had to Cris her
Break through any weather living right just makes you richer
My times make you tougher my minds in the upper
Echelon no respect for the comp repetition stomp
Bitch get out of line check her prompt in my S Laurent
Pick a cloud start a fire with the pilot
Dont matter how you built you never did no one a solid
Everybody got to say they opinions getting crowded
This for any motherfucker that ever doubt it  Southside
Put em by me Im a outshine
One in a million Im the house pride
Came into the building with a cyclone
Making a killing off my bright poems
This drug has helped me spend my nights gone
Lights out shocked eyes
Get my anger while I climb skies
Came famous from my line drives
Give me big praise and high cries
Let the hate fall while I rise
The fuck these niggas talking about Top 5
