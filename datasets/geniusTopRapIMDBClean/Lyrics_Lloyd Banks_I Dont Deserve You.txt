Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Ooh
I think I love you
But dont let me get in the way  Get in the way 
Dont let me stop you girl
From doing your thing  Doing your thing 
Cause I dont deserve you no
I dont want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles yeah
Dont let me get in your way  Get in your way 
It aint even the puss I got your mind
Its usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn and yeah youre fingerlicking fine
In due time Im sure that I can please you squeeze you weak knees you
Need you like you need me and dont mislead you
Loves free but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee that bitch gon leave with half your life
Man believe me I aint gon feed you bad advice
Look its easy so dont forget to strap up tight
Ride Id be selfish if I kept you so  So 
I love you enough to let you go  Go 
Cause on the other hand I couldnt take it if I
Put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but its harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast heres your heart before I break it take it
I think I love you
Dont let me get in the way  Get in the way 
Dont let me stop you girl
From doing your thing  Doing your thing 
Cause I dont deserve you no
I dont want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Dont let me get in your way  Get in your way 


What type of nigga would I be to hold you up
You need someone to hold you down
And recognize your lifes fucked up
I got to shake you out my system
Cause with the fucking and kissing
And all your emotions mixed in puts me in a tough position
Baby what am I supposed to do
I cant control my actions when Im close to you
We been away too long girl were overdue
I guess the cake aint enough you want to eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
Im like an addict for your scream your fully loaded toast
Automatic with the beam the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green your swag is more than most
I got a sex drive that wont allow me to lax
Bring on the next five look how they grind on my lap
Booty breast thighs keep your boy relaxed in back
And you deserve way more than that Ill just fall back
I think I love you
Dont let me get in the way  Get in the way 
Dont let me stop you girl
From doing your thing  Doing your thing 
Cause I dont deserve you no no
I dont want to hurt you
Play with your mind  Play with your mind 
Have you running in circles
Dont let me get in your way  Get in your way 
Ive been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it I dont deserve it
Ive been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it I dont deserve it no
I dont deserve it I dont deserve it
I dont deserve it I dont deserve it
I dont deserve it I dont deserve it
I dont deserve it I dont deserve it
