Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Im so high Im on point
And I could tell that youre jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I dont care GUnits going straight to the top this year
Nigga Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Uh Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The Sig will melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she aint concerned cause hes a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb
Cause them girls over here dont got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya thats why ya llamas in ya bed
Fuck a rare Chinchilla buy some armor for ya head
Where the block Im from
Niggas be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggas baby mamas is pregnant and still fucking
Its either cause they boyfriends a scrub like Brillo
Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown for my niggas that got locked up and deported
And now they gotta go back home
Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Im so high Im on point
And I could tell that youre jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I dont care GUnits going straight to the top this year
Nigga Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Dont confuse me with these suckers
Cause when I spit Youll hear more ohs
Than a skip to my Lou move at the Rucker
Thank God for giving Banks the gift
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
But all I see is a handkerchief
Nigga theres no one out the click that freezes
Believe that cause I aint scared of shit but Jesus
Look dog I dont run with the poodles
Difference is Im eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya boy is corrupt kid
Banksll send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps cant afford these homes
Look around I got forty clones
Now Look down thats forty stones
And thats only in the necklace
Im bony and Im reckless
Its Tony in a Lexus
Im fresh out the gutter scrap what ya man thought
Im in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport
Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Im so high Im on point
And I could tell that youre jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I dont care GUnits going straight to the top this year
Nigga Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
When I travel I know Im gon get stuck
Cause they harass us in the airport
Like Im the one thats blowing shit up
I got the patience of a high school teacher
And a bright future
Why the fuck would I have a bomb on my sneaker
All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost is
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rats coffin
Im blowing Os of that black coughing
Blow on the road then Im back flossing
No one knows how much thats costing
Fuck ass only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
So if you plotting on popping off then scheme smoothly
Or get a little red splatter on ya cream Coogi
My name ring each state
So you aint gotta go all the way to LA to get ya MC ate
Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
Im so high Im on point
And I could tell that youre jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I dont care GUnits going straight to the top this year
Nigga Im so fly I got money
So thats a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
