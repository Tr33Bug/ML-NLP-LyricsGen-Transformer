Fast drops in my backdrop chilling
Letting niggas see me I dont pass blocks spilling  Mm 
Roll up like a smoker with a bagchopped ceiling
Spending is my hobby Im balling sorry
Lately Ive been having dreams of crushing everybody
Ima see you motherfuckers at the top
Im coming and my minds on nothing but the guap
They thought this shit was done but the grind dont stop
Im running through them one after one cause Im hot
Ima hit ya hun like the drum make it drop
Then Im looking for another one to taker her spot jackpot
Spending is my hobby
