Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
I am the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried but Im alright
Im able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride Im down for a one night stand
Ill accept it any way that I can cause I aint your man
Ill try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah yeah
I cant keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
Your kinds rarer than a flyin saucer
And thats why I can offer similarities in our characters
Havent you heard the word round town How I get down
They gon whistle everybody part is official
And that ass wit you got my dick as hard as a missile
Dont hop on top cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over Ill be out of town with an issue
If you was mine Id introduce you to mama girl
Youre stylin in your boots and Gabbana Im so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston its hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin like a fool when I hollered
Tryin to squeeze in but you wouldnt bothered
Now I aint neither soon as I realized that I aint need her
She in a rush to get close to me but I aint eager
Shiit
I am the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried but Im alright
Im able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride Im down for a one night stand
Ill accept it any way that I can cause I aint your man
Ill try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah yeah


Look I dont mean to bother you
But your sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in park with you
There aint no tellin the kind of things Imma start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast
I could tell you feel the same cause when I asked you laughed
So Imma leave it at that take a hint and put in my math
I imagine you probably look twice as good in the bath
And Im buggin cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
Im never stable cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit Ive been the type to hit and split
But you cant blame me for the females that I been gettin with
Cause most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit
To the eager shit and learned to be satisfied with the dick
And if you aint worth it thats all you get
I aint gon blame you Im gon blame all you tricks cause
I am the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried but Im alright
Im able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride Im down for a one night stand
Ill accept it any way that I can cause I aint your man
Ill try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah yeah
It seems like your attitude only appears when Im mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When Im gone too long ridin through them avenues
As soon as I get home theres rumors and scattered news
You know my fantasies am I feelin things or can this be
Your girlfriend tryin to sandwich me
My hearts colder than sandwich meat
Cause I come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast with a switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin your body like this
Gon make me blow like a bottle of Crist
Man I dont know no one hotter than Twist
You got my temperature risin
From your hips and your thighs and
And that glare in your eyesll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally I dont bribe em
Its as easy as one two three and I slide in
I am the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried but Im alright
Im able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride Im down for a one night stand
Ill accept it any way that I can cause I aint your man
Ill try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah yeah
I am the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried but Im alright
Im able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride Im down for a one night stand
Ill accept it any way that I can cause I aint your man
Ill try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
Ooh ooh ooh aw yeah
