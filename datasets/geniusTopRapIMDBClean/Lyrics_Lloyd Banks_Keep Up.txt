You know the rules
Dont trust em dont love em
And dont let em fool you
Knahmean
Aye Know your role
Get anything out me No you wont
I hope my player stole your hope
Anymore game Ima overdose
Jerry Tarkanian Im supposed to coach
Money train on my poster ho
Way too cool cant push a button
Banks around you got no control
Relax and let it go
That girl want be bad dont let her yo
You still want to keep that Incredible
Thats negative feedback forever bro
Im chasing greenbacks and envelopes
You only care about status
Probably see zeroes in the bed with her
High maintenance with no standards damn
Its a shame youre so regular
Dont hog the lane on my cellular
Dont be difficult we aint dating
Better stay in line with the editor
Hawaii 5 trips ahead of ya
Oh Youre on cloud nine
She say jump you ask how high
Weekend fuck to a nigga like me
PIMP til the day that I die
You buying the boots and Im taking them off
Keeping her hair then Im fucking it up
Turning her out as shes spilling the guts
Wont lead her on the feelings too much
She thinks Im the one but there cant be no us
I met you a stray there cant be no trust
The lifestyle fills up your panties with lust
Spare me the amateur stuff
Look you happy now
Your homegirl found a way to track me down
Telling all your problems to grimy ears
Playing for the crowd is exactly how
Shes 10 times more nasty now
Caught in a walk with her ass all out
Then youll be here all alone
The nigga all the bad ones ask about
All black cruising my casket route
In my throwback full classic bout
Short on time I smash then count
Them whores aint mine I pass them out
You aint even got to ask me
My game catchy no free rides here better get a taxi
You dont think I know how this shit going to go
Chasing a musician end up with an athlete
Shit Im both
Got em on a track meet
Ran all day made love on a bad knee
Fixing with her ass in the avi
Victims from the pad to the valley
Fiction once if she ever had me
Listen let my only speak once
I had teams since the nineties
Switch rosters every three months
Im the one they cant figure out
Youre the one that they chump chump
You paying the bills and got another nigga in the house
She dont know what she want yup
You fucked around and got tricked by a criminal
I gotta skip to the front
You dont turn your back
She probably looking a nigga now
Tell them hoes keep up
Tell them hoes keep up
