Anybody can control a womans body see
But the key is to control her mind
Uhh bein yourself is bein different baby
Shit I feel like Im the man how a bitch gon play me
She could be everything same time skitzo maybe
Rubbers pop aint no jumpin up on the dick all crazy
Fish come by the boat and the whole ship is shady
Im trustin none them hoes you niggas pimpin lazy
Now check it  get your shit and head out the exit man
Im mackin harder then Goldie bet you a Roley that Im connected
None of you bitches own me so I should only be respected
She gon Set It Off like Stoney the moment I get her naked
Shorty fuck around with him and cant swim she gon drown
Cars fly in the winter as I begin to spin the town
Now I aint gon put you down but I aint gon put you on either
Cause Ima look like a clown if I should pick the wrong diva
Them bitches stretched you out and I aint clippin my reefer
Now close your messy mouth the more I listen I see ya
Im seein everything you about like you inside out
Them birds still comin in when all your friends fly South
I know she only chasin me cause Im on TV
I been caught with one of her friends she let me off easy
Greasy You should know they dont like you they like your lifestyle
Tryin to figure out ways to get in your light now
She say she love me and Im like wow
Laughin as Im bustin her ass somebody wife foul
Now open your ear and pick up the game
Learn the ways of a bitch and put your click on to the same
Boy you aint supposed to be slippin let her trip and keep your cool
Gotta stay on your feet man how did you get so fool
Boy you turning green  greener then a go light
Shapin a newer vick settlin for the old type
Ida been fuckin all night Im on brown on white
Thick chick porn type thicker bitch on ice
Im nice
You know the rules of the game
I mean your bitch just chose me
Now we can settle this like you got some class
Or we can get into some gangsta shit
