Too much thinking on top of that Im getting high and drinking
Im floating on cloud 9 watching these niggas sinking
No blinking you blink too much you lose your turn
Sleep is the cousin of death you might as well pick your urn
I been talking my intentions now its time to go and do it
Take you were I come from that influence on my music
Aint no Uturns on this path think before you choose it
Hold this autograph come get your cash and try to use it
I came here unexpected Imma leave a legend
Brought up in this hell how Im breathing heaven
I swear I fear I hear my niggas laughing while Im balling
Woke up this morning the weed and alcohol calling
Living that life of a Mac kicking them hoes out often
Ask em when they coming back knowing that they done lost em
Hit them bitches from the back I aint want all the talking
Dont be blowing up my jack flat line on that cat
Lets get this money then lets make it stack
Then lets make history cause they cant take that back
Back to balling and spending running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie take a look how Im living
And do you know what it took I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work no contract in my soul
I dont ball up and die I bomb back on them hoes
Im tryna buy my soul from Satan I cant keep up with payments
Strange writings on the wall got me feeling like a cavemen
Call that shit the Days Inn life is so degrading
But to my last statement I keep praying til its Amen
Top is where Im aiming left the way I came in
Ima keep on raving til them islands is the Caymens
And my bitch from Mexico she dont know she next to go
Suit yourself then screw yourself Shoot yourself Plaxico
Bang bang Thought you were a giant
Couldnt hear the mournings but I bet you hear them sirens
First I close my eyelids then everything is quiet
I could go out in silence but I would prefer the riot
I catch the first star with my fist raised Versace shades my french braids
Had sick chains since 6th grade safe to say weve been slaved
These niggas tryna shoot me These crackers tryna sue me
Wake up to your favourite actresses my life is like a movie boy
Lets get this money then lets make it stack
Then lets make history cause they cant take that back
Back to balling and spending running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie take a look how Im living
And do you know what it took I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work no contract in my soul
I dont ball up and die I bomb back on them hoes
Heat up in the winter so Im cooler come the summer
We out here gambling Aruba money sucka
PYT all the way up to cougar Imma crush her
And I always been a rebel never been a cuffer
You just talk it you dont does it so all those who suffer
You so humble out in public computer make you tougher
I got Ros by the bottle bitches by the carload
6 or 7 new ones Im switching up the tomorrow
Bitch I sleep in the Apollo Im always on stage
I should take my show to broadway cause that hallway like a grave
Cant no bitch get in my mind so I know its physical
I kick out the dimes I think Im invincible
I climbed to the top now Im pissing off the pinnacle
I pray to God that I get rich getting money spiritual
Diamond in my physicals thats why Imma stand out
You dont got your hand in you just got you hand out son
Lets get this money then lets make it stack
Then lets make history cause they cant take that back
Back to balling and spending running up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie take a look how Im living
And do you know what it took I take you back down the road
Before the riches and bitches and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work no contract in my soul
I dont ball up and die I bomb back on them hoes
