Hand full of haters
Know when I stop em survivor of close calls though Im feelin like deaths knockin
Insides numb
Thank God for music my heads rockin
Wasnt for that Id be lost now racin against the clock
And I can see it in your smile you dont mean it livin foul is your secret
Want me down on the cement talent found Imma keep it
My brothers keeper
Keepin my head above the water
Lifes a bitch beggin but I got nothin for her
Slaughter bitches outta order from my ora
I need my angel to come when I call her and save the baller
Rock sporter gimme floor space Imma need a stupid flip
Theres money cars bitches and jewels to get lets do this shit
Look how my music hits I got that loud on
Sour diesel in a cloud gone get ya style torn
Heart crosses for body losses
Stay in a better place probably bosses w ferrari horses
Im just as nice as anyone that wore the crown
Livin my dream keep what you think dont spoil it now
I can sense the hate before the frown ya born a clown
Droppin all em bricks off toilet bound n watered down
I got the anger to set it off ya feather soft
In and out the b tracks intercourse through metaphors
The mac bridge she get across I met her jaws
5 star flaws and better tours and chedda toss
My work bodies like a shotty let off in the party
Pardon my partner he pumped and ready to hurt somebody
You send ya bitch to line me you gon lose ya Bonnie
He noknow rude awakening you find me with the ruger round me
RIP my nigga ima see ya wen I see ya
Im holdin it down here n niggas still tryna be ya but
But theyll never be another crew like us
Bottles in the air gettin high all I do is crush
And till the day Im dust
Theyll be no love
No love
No love
They aint no more left
Damn pops I miss you Ill see you wen I get there
Wish I can tell you you were right cuz you aint missin shit here
Fans turned on me never thought itd be this weird
Guess they thought I wouldnt keep up look how I switch gears
Swung the last ten Imma kill em the next 6 years
Tryna block the pain with the liquor my nigga sick scared
RIP to Roster salute with the chopper
Remember us young boys too loose of the vodka
Smokin like I smoke now now its part of my intro
Same shit that we used to brush off hard on my mental
Beast mode they led me to snap target my pencil
They been borrowin a while now countin the years I lent you
I got the block poppin big ass rock coppin
G throwin and top droppin just know when the cops watchin
These niggas will not stop him struggle to find a way
From birds eye jockin Im puffin a dime a day
