And like that we gone
Failures no option
You know you know I got to get it
And my hearts still cold beware the blizzard
We born to get money so we living
New calls to my phone Im like who is it
Look round stay down the streetsll grab you
You came and you went good not to have you
Youre gone and moved on dont remember  Banks 
Same song stay strong  Dram  aint no surrender
Uh feels like Im in a dream
Check my Rollie few times a day
Skys the limit live it
Go tell niggas I found a way
Deep watersll drown the prey down you lay
Then up my name goes
Accept my trophy same pose
Bank always open cant close
Who wanna play
Them bloggers got your ego tree high
You fucked some bitches sold some records
Now you think youre me huh
Sincerely be Ive given all of you
Im sketching now hope my doubters see my memorial
Over powering audio storm showering all of you
By my lonelys my audible slaughter through you recorder
Employer handle your order
Wanted man every corner
You came and went with the wind
Since when did you get that aura
Been getting money cant no money change me
They love me round the world
Them boys aint went nowhere but crazy
Party spinning spitting on the one you call your lady
Every other day they on you
Youve been rolling lately uh
You know you know we got to get it
And my hearts still cold beware the blizzard
We born to get money so we living
New calls to my phone Im like who is it
Look round stay down the streetsll grab you
You came and you went good not to have you
Youre gone and moved on dont remember
Same song stay strong aint no surrender
Uh you wanna get to know me but these records done mess your views up
Running from what youre used to you came to a nigga bruised up
Like you aint know that I was sharp must want a new cut
Manage to keep a bandage so the plan is
Leave your love where your man is
Be above all the cameras youre caught up in the high
And gon be double damage the partying leads to bullshit
Why you club with them hammers
Money cant buy you love you aint got it then minds you manners
Honor is all that matters how you do how the fam is
You skipped the penitentiary hallelujahs and cannons
Pardon the rumors they ram us
No opinion matters more than yours believe in you
They hungers scary this is for those that gotta sleep it through
Through all the ups and downs you stuck around
Til this day my cold flow fucks up the town
Get green deuce up the crowd
I go to bed with my Nina bood up and proud
Purple and green in my stream shoot up with loud
You know you know we got to get it
And my hearts still cold beware the blizzard  my hearts so cold 
We born to get money so we living  yeah yeah 
New calls to my phone Im like who is it  Yeah yeah 
Look round stay down the streetsll grab you  stay down 
You came and you went good not to have you  not to have you 
Youre gone and moved on dont remember  dont remember 
Same song stay strong aint no surrender
