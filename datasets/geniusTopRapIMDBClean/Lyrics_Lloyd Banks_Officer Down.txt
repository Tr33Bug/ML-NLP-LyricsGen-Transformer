Too easy man cant a motherfucker round you see me
Youd need a AK and a genie a whole POUND of wheaties
My heart so freezy 3d birdie to the click you claim
Victorys my valentine Im in a different lane
Strong as cocaine
Long as Im sane I wont be took for games
I can guarantee when its over you wont look the same
Drownin in shame callin my names like callin Candy Man
Suicide on a platter splatter your brain he banned
Understand this aint a obstacle its comical
The shades you wear been blindin you
Everyone knows what Imma do
Everyone knows Im lava fool
Bet he come more phenomenal
Deadly ready for drama
Whoever want it can climb in too
Broken egos I promise you desert eagles and llamas threw
Wwhy would you ffuck wit me sstupid move
Ccome around get fffound beat up and bruised
You need support a couple crews
Beef out here aint nothin new Ill make you sleep uncomfortable
Nightmares of PO punchin you flatline
Doctor pumpin you the blind could see the punk in you
Girl in you bitch in you I will kick thru all of you
Football wit you soccer when we see him DDT him
Leave him bleedin well be even
Even thru coppin and pleading
He been talkin bout the weight he push
Use to punch the clock in jail drove his mama car round
Now he got whatchu want for sale
See it I bought it its official if I flaunt it
If ya diamond really real then put the diamond tester on it
He dont want it
Ill run up on his shadow hit him proper
He bout real as a 4 dollar bill Carol City Copper
Chop em down one by one two by two this what I do
If you knew what I knew then youll be cool youll be thru
He makin money Well we makin money too whoopee doo
Well be here long after he disappear this is proof
151 in the booth so slipperyson is the truth
Come get me Im in the coupe
4fizzy Im in the loop wit Biggie piece of fruit CAKE
They dont want no problems watch they boots SHAKE
Tremble terrified now its too LATE
Theres no stoppin till I see empires crumble beside me
Entire families divided diggin ya hole is my hobby
Ya sorry probably the weakest shit to try me
I be everywhere the guap be and ya fat musty and sloppy
Freeway Ricky Ross copy and the real ones comin home
Peace to him fuckyou
Click Pop pop pop Im gone
Im too strong you been warned
Quiet storm when I perform
When I get on Im like BIG Pac L reborn
Word to mama word is bond
Long kiss goodnight the pistol tight my clip too tight
You superthug Im kryptonite
Sleep wit me ya bitch just might
Same promotion different fight
Still ballin poppin bottles my wrist is white
Drive the cars that bitches like this is like
Practice pay ya taxes
Fore you spit my name out backwards
Aaask around Im in brackets with legendary rappers
Rrratchets as we taxi ask me if I give a fuck ffuckem ALL
Makaveli when I bomb I hit em up
Ggget buck cut stuck look
Wont make much a difference this is childs play
Lllyrical battery yall way
Pretty ladies in my Mercedes product of the 80s
40s 50s blickies wit me hit me they call me crazy
High and hazy shady grimey slimy in every way
30 cities 30 shooters were like the NBA
Blaze when you want me stop tough plot
Big macs for every one you can eat pound for every pound you got
Call me loyal honored armored in bullet catchin garment
Getcha Versace piranhad mangled and left retarded
Im on another planet fuck made him pick me to spar wit
We 2 different niggas that makes you a special target
In this market they let impersonators walk round
50 bodied you I just laid the chalk down
