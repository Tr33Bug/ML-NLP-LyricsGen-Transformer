Uh Im backtracking gripping up again
Aint no luck in these bitches only trust my pen
I drop them off dont tuck they gems
Whats up with spin
My tin cutting wind in a custom rim
Im here now took long sue me Im all Louie
Wrecking shit yeah Yours truly a bomb movie
Im a trip yeah Tour smoothly Im bored usually
Yall bars border mine thats up they going to choose me
Im clapping rapping like a drawn Uzi
Im backing traffic matching all jewelry
You dirty bastard dont you go and screw me
Nothing but Gs down here dawg my floor is Gucci
Nonsucker telly and a five star supper
Black diamond your skully my mind suffer
Guess you a lucky muhfucka
You survived to 21 and aint at least one touched ya
Its a struggle to stay alive
You dont think Im going to make it
I can tell it all in your eyes
Im going to make them drop their faces and tell em to pick em up
Im a show up all these places with cases getting drunk
I cant wait to see you hoes with the vapors
What you want
I want every fucking thing in this world
Fast cars diamond and girls
You suitin up to lose dont play
The green paper make the shit go away
Uh pain variety in my society
Death to the government I know they lie to me
No apology through this odyssey
King gotta be change ya sound rap pottery
No one hot as me all honesty
Through this design I provide Im all kind of flee
You about free as your ancestors
How you going to get the answers
You dont understand the questions
Can you hear me out there  Im alone
At times I feel like Im trapped inside the zone
Mind lapse while I get home sidetrack get ya the throne
Southsides on my back this is the dome
We RIP pictures of shown
Fuck em out of show love they showing hate
Real nigga in my way  no surrender no mistake
You make it out this hell hole its nothing but luck
Same forces hand newspaper print the cover up


Its a struggle to stay alive
You dont think Im going to make it
I can tell it all in your eyes
Im going to make them drop their faces and tell em to pick em up
Im a show up all these places with cases getting drunk
I cant wait to see you hoes with the vapors
What you want
I want every fucking thing in this world
Fast cars diamond and girls
You suitin up to lose dont play
The green paper make the shit go away
