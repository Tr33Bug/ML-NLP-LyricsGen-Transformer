Shes something like a porno star
Shes something like a super freak
I never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
My kinda girl
Porno star
Shes something like a super freak
Never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
Around the Carolina hood see most niggas called her ho and diss her
Cuz shes slowly growing up to be like her older sister
She got a bad reputation so you dont hold and kiss her
And after one conversation youd probly fold in twister
It aint hard to tell that honeys dumb
Shes 18 goin on 21
Mama dont know where she get her money from
Hoppin in the naughty cars
Stuffed in the backseat
Lookin to score big
Cuz she fucks all the athletes
Somethin like a princess gon wrong
Used to be a ballerina
Now she performs to The Thong Song
Happily had plans to enroll in college
Now youd rather slide down metal poles for dollas
Your fingernails and your toes is polished
But your brains on freeze
In other words frozen knowledge
All your plans and your goals  demolished
You grew up in Southside
Why niggas know you a ho in Hollis huh
I still remember how it all started
School  cuttin from class
Every boy you knew touching yo ass
Headed no where fast
I aint gon lie
Shorty I used to laugh
Cuz you was the main topic on math
I seen her in the mall shoppin
Im contemplating bout stoppin
Cuz she could get me off like Cochran
Now that dinner was poppin
Spoiled her daddy was pumpin
He probly thought shed grow up to get married or somethin
But little did he know
His little princess was a city ho
Pretty ooh the face
Tight from the video
Damn this bitch is thick
She on the Lil Kim shit
See her hair match the color of her lipstick
Now this chick claimed to love jewelry like Slick Rick
And had a walk on her that would leave you with a stiff dick
Jeans had a sick fit
To make a long story short
This aint the type a bitch you wanna stick with
