Yeah
Banks
COTI
Yo
Hundred dollar bills for situp drills my benji reps
Ignorant and I dont give two fucks with Fendi Fs
Learning by habit consistency made the memory stretch
Turn you to an addict your ladyll kiss the Bentley chest
Dig your way out the ground or spend a century stressed
I get you stomped off seniority shouldnt tempt the vets
Uh playa haters make my temper flex
Twenty years of pushing this pen an instrumental threat
Death to haters cant even be hre in spirit
Kill a nigga set up his GoFundMe and stal it
Designer chronic pockets reeking out the air vent
I can show you where to buy this shit cant teach you how to wear it
Its a waste going back and forth success will really kill em
Balling like Russell Westbrook Bill or Wilson
Give me rappers Ima kill some mumblers on my jacket
Drop the remains in traffic club him like Im barbaric
Star addicts
Nothing is the same
These niggas dont deserve to rock run em out the game
They love it when we serve the block this is cocaine
The temperature is falling and this shit aint gon change
Nigga drive safely swerving out of lane
The pain is strong enough to make a nigga go insane
We just want the money yall can have the fame
Promise Ill remain put it my chain propane  Uh 
Dumb is justification is this working does a cubic flash
Everybody just cant be hating my nigga you just trash
Ass kissers dropping to knees you need the Ewing pads
I aint seen you niggas since teens still hope you doing bad
Country of the serpent yall all in bed with the snake
Black fitted reads When was America great
In the bootleg era left competition dead on a tape
Kryptonite to super save a ho infrared on your cape
Shit Im lying Get me amputated cradled to the casket homie
Nothing bout me animated I only use the cash emoji
Everybody make mistakes let nothing out the past control me
Married to the motherfucking game frozen matrimony
Hate when they compare me to niggas never been even son
Hammer to a hand grenade cannon to a BB gun
Pussy talking slick about me who you think was feeding them
I pull up on you all four quarters let the meter run
Nothing is the same
These niggas dont deserve to rock run em out the game
They love it when we serve the block this is cocaine
The temperature is falling and this shit aint gon change
Nigga drive safely swerving out of lane
The pain is strong enough to make a nigga go insane
We just want the money yall can have the fame
Promise Ill remain put it my chain propane
