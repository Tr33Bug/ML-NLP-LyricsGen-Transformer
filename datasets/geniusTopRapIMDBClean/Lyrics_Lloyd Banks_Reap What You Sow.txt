Uh king climb from adolescence
Meantime back to finessing guess youre guessing
And PMSin in the wrong direction
The BM stretchin for so long perfecting
Tweaking my engine dreaming my crown on peaking the legend
Heavens cadences Im famous for
God sends halos Im hanging more rookies will die for nothing
Only remember kin names in war
Social beefing is weak so dont anticipate a post or a tweet
I dont even like to speak
Aint no competition breathing hard luck
I handicap your squad up
Im panty stacking broads up your favorite rapper bar struck
Writers collision cooked in a psychos kitchen
Juxs now the titles missing hooked the recitals listen
If I told you I was tired would you judge me
Would you criticize my counter disappearances youre lucky
I dont flip and target anyone they consider above me
Start picking them off one by one that would be lovely and ugly
They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh
Yeah peace be placed to purity more chances for the wicked
Made my darker days be full moons where all the goons can kick it uh
My lifes explicit killer style few shrooms and mix it
Perfect elixir addict with two tools terrific
I own a ticket pen my verse twitching
You timeline scrolling and Im soul searching me and my coal coaching
Blue dont fuck with them niggas great em in third person
Freedom and no purping 3D and gold version
Knee deep in flows curtain shade out the snoopers
Sniper range from what the truth is
Kongo with strong caduceus
Pile up the losers no time for choosing
When I get stupid bowels are moving
A hundred miles and cruising nigga
Im more than real dont bring the king hypothetical things
I push the button metal rings like a vending machine
Grew to be limitless few know what the business is
Beat odds with my regiment hesitance wont get you this


They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh
Uh sweeter life from here on out subtracted bitter faces
Minor disappointments stem from lack of expectations
Mediocre flows sick tracks infected basements
Bullets dropping knowledge power casings and down faces
This is what I get for living
My mental splitting back and forthing with my other side still two tempers clicking
Top fiver of all the forefathers who mentions different
Jotting punches down on blank blue bills new pens for tripping uh
Im downing Henny sets two clip Glock for semi threats
Time for many cheques too hiphop for skinny sweats
Feel my memory stretch do flip flops and deadly sex
Resemble MCs out the old days W Chevy Lex
An active rider fogging up the plaza as I
Float off the ramp and throw dab like Desiigner
Platinum juana psychopath and smoke
Cash out the commas my personas like the Ave would hope
Fast ride provider
They say you gon reap what you sow
There aint no love here in this place that I call home
No one to lean on I been out here on my own
Dont need no haters round me fuckin up my zone
Youre well protected aint no better way to roam
Hand on my heater cause you never really know
Separate yourself they aint gon let you grow
I wanna win dont think the hood gon let me go oh
