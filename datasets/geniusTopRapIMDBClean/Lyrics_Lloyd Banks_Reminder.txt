Wont be giving up
In this world where everything aint enough
And everything is a must I remind you all
Its easy to get caught in the rush
You weak shitll blind you dawg
Too many trying to fit in
Still Id rather stand out
No better way of living
Rocky lucky link on my neck cant letem see you sweat
The illest shit aint thinking to me dawg I aint even slept
All nonbelievers check
King round for round the crown aint leave me yet
Been cropped the sound look at my CD set
A set of Cubans on my leather spooning
Settle down  some shit Im never doing
Drop and find eleven new ones
Compliments of better schooling
Im skipping continents for better viewing
Came into prominence forever ruling
You knew the life I live youd judge your own
Roaming like I left something still the man when Im home
I hope Heaven got a club
I done climbed into all kind of pussy never fell in love
Success no better drug and the pressure just a plus
Moving on you never take the life in us
Nigga take a loss where every mistake will cost
Color stain the floors
Aint not sympathy this pain is yours
Lets toast to this paper  new toast for the haters
Im bred to be what you want Game dead giving it hope
Realest nigga the more I think about it
My head high I keep a mink around
Throw a nigga off even they even think you doubt it
All I got is fire  Need an 8 alarm attire
Easy to admire sixteen will take an overnighter
Take advantage nothing is needed  All is forgiven
Too long pretending then smoke what you call driven
Im drunk to where you see double
Been around hear the street crumble
Chain still swing like free couples
Fear being fucked up frustrated trying to function
The ghetto took all my close friends
Somebody owes us something for real
They cant catch the God wrecking in my repertoire
Extra fog aint no body close Im ghost
My anxiety over flows  Flow with a cold steal
Leaving a trail of road kill and still wont chill  ill
