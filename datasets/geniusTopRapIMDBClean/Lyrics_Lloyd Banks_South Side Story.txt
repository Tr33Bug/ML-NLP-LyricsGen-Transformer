Who gone hold they own whos not
Who gone change spots

When I was ten years old I seen a nigga take three in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed awake cause my nightmares was seein em dead
Smelled the burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stared at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin fingers shakin spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud another ditch to be dug
There I stood stiffer than wood
See homey used to buy me candy
Now hes gone who gone provide his family
My ear ringing shoulda been runnin
I never thought Id be that sick
Damn I wasnt posed to see that shit
Thats when I thought
It was more than three shots
He coulda been aimin for me maybe he circled around the block
I turned around at my pops he like what happened
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin
I can still hear him laughin
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty

It was a regular day in South Side sprinklers and kids runnin
All of a sudden heads turnin somebody did somethin
This nigga name I forgot fuck it he lived around the block
Regular gettin money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walked across the park stuntin frontin
Diamonds in his ear diamond watch on
Eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty grabbin her waist
She pushed him away so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected shorty couldnt accept it
Called him a pussy told him shed be back in a second
But he aint pay her no mind
Called her a bitch about four times
Stayed in the park wit no niggas wit em and no nine
And them in no time older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat left his face all crack
Told him Take all that
Hit him again popped his chain wit a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

Now all my days go by blowin that sticky icky
California made me picky
Chicken head tried to stick me wit a hickey
If we blow up quickly stickly somewhere tipsy
The location dont matter Im South Side until they hit me
Ill be DEAD
If looks can kill Im from the ghetto boys
But I dont know Scarface or Bushwick Bill
My heart spills
For the kids that aint got nothin aint got it still
And for my cousin I lost
Humped over the steerin wheel
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
