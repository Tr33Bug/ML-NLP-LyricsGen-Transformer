2wo4our  You crazy man 
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You aint the same as when you came
Well probably never be the same
Leave it to you I get the blame
I guess that Im the one that changed quite strange
If I aint there to have your back Im either dead or Im sick
When youre fucked up behavior turns irregular quick
Sometims the pressure ovrwhelms when youre the head of the clique
But dont get ahead of yourself I aint bending for shit
Nobody sees your vision until youre successful
To become a success will validate that you are special
There aint a pain reliever strong enough life is stressful
Learn to put your faith in God thats who gon protect you
Dont ever bite the hand that feeds you thats disrespectful
But if whats in the hand deceives you now youre regretful
I brought integrity though every area the jet flew
Its like I see a stranger nothing like when I met you
At this point I dont care to keep a friend again
When you get on they checking in that aint genuine
Changed my whole perception now that Im rememberin
Got a big safe of favors that Ill never lend nothings forever
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You aint the same as when you came
Well probably never be the same
Leave it to you I get the blame
I guess that Im the one that changed quite strange
Your favorites nowhere near me when Im dedicated
Always humble usually disciplined and never hated
Call me quiet call me lazy talent never faded
Its frustrating when your grindin aint appreciated
Should have been dead in my twenties shit at least I made it
Guess I gotta prove myself again increase your payment
Get shits together then the devil comes to rearrange it
The Lord blessed me with a shorty I could leave my name with
Fuck all the complainin cause Ima see the top again
Sunshine or rain dont matter when youre bout to win
Question how Im livin lucky you get oxygen
Play around the crib AKll chop you in
Hoping for good cant help but notice the stranger things
Fuck looking for love what about the pain it brings
Claiming youre a angel they gon have to take your wings
But where you wind up while I accept the climb up and everything it brings
You lift me up and shoot me down
It looks painful for you to smile
I feel a space between your hug
I hate the way you show me love
You aint the same as when you came
Well probably never be the same
Leave it to you I get the blame
I guess that Im the one that changed quite strange
I hate the way you show me love
