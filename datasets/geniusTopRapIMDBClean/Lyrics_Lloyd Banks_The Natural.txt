No originality take a ride with the natural
I aint blow up yet
Fear the greatest bomb in the Apple
Tackles broke to pieces
The streets are scorching trying to over ease ya
A firm believer I wore the crown on my Caesar
Freezer count me up
This test an alley thump just made the tally jump
Wild around me catch a smiley cut let out the alley up
Writers block cant get my mind to stop
Most days I island hop
Karmas a bitch I found a spot
Wandering trips around the clock
Charming your chick from down the block
Flow got her she found a shark
My fins showin two tens throwing a pound a spark
Uh So many washing up Im edged in stone though
You fool pit browse
My testers slam the lomo exit solo
Big tests for soso need us extra promo
No runner ups can catch the pros
So slice the pie like Lexus logo
Bet my cadence alarms impostors
Problems just hanging strange fruit
Hs and orange boxes
Big faces in all the watches
Roses Aces and Knockers
Hoes embrace their show stoppers
Hundred papers more options
With hunger pain theres no nonsense
Rumble game Im all offense
Launching confidence here
And I know these powers wont feel me
Theyll be over your shit in no time
And no you aint getting no cosign
Im fully equipped to go
Im in solid gold at the goal line
Powder rope through my smoke climb higher
Cant pick my code ma
Over matter fact whos badder
Aint no rapper here or after
Back in my zone at night
These new niggas is over hyped
Steep look into a soldiers life
Three or four minutes of poltergeist
Sweet beginningsIm ultra nice
Come kill a God he multiples
Open eyes hit critics
Visits from broken wives
Through the impossible
The fuck is you doing with oxygen
These bums done brung up my name in vein
Wondering when you hit your compliments
My conscience vents
Henny and mobster tints
Hell out the audience
Stand up guy bet he wont hop a fence
If any a consequence
Stepped in good been stomping since
Different kind maybe common sense
Calm me down with the capital
Built the crown and no avenue
Boring niggas will challenge you
Slaughtering since 2002
Porno vids in my memory
Foreign trips out to Kennedy
Hoing tricks out for energy
Told a bitch I wouldnt let it be
Every week with another head
Chcheck out my symmetry
My maniac rhyme
More amazing than all your favorites combined
Im killing ya maaan
Hit the fire on these bitches one time
I sunshine I cook the area
Burn up your front line
Turn up my new shit product of DJ Dram
Sour out the nose and bottle cliques
Urban model chicks
Lifes a room a dollar should
Slide in a Ferragamo slip
Top of the metropolis
Looking down on your confidence
Hooking up with your confidant
Cooling feels like the comp is gone
Uh hoes in my sweaters
Hoes be over zealous
Hold it down dirty as hell
When we roll to town
Whats up with all these clowns
I gave you years how dare you doubt me
Even when I aint here you hear about me
