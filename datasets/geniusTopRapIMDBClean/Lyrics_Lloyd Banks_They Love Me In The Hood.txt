Cold since my man died over that a damn lie
Boy you smoking dust
Got these niggas by a landslide
Uhh I got them niggas by a rocket ship
Hit the afterburner Ike Turner how I drop a bitch
Im so far ahead Im already dead
Getting at you from the future
Thats why Im used to what you said
Wait until you see the new superhead
She got the turbo wop hot karma sutra in the bed
I got your yard on my card back to future wit the bread
I pull your card you a fraud hope they shot you in your head
Boy your pockets in the red you fronting and ya style phony
Every day a trending topic keep the pound on me
Exotic women heavy leaning thats how Im living
The punch line king on the run from Robin Givens
Every week a nigga leak a bunch of robbings killings
Fuck a hater make a million let survival feed him
Still stand where I stood they love me the hood
Them bitches talking about me thats how Im doing good
Understood Im good they love me in the hood
Understood Im good they love me in the hood
Im in love with money I dont love these hoes
I love to get paper and spend it on these clothes
Do you hear me
Understood Im good they love me in the hood
Be in here with the weapons on blink get your necklace torn
Hef the don fucking on your sister like Escobar
Escalade eyes bloody red like Ive been pepper sprayed
Sex for exercise bitches screaming when I step on stage
I get busy dough from here to Quebec Im paid
Fuckin since a kid then grab weed borret soon braids
I know the neighbors hate my guts I be recking them
My seconds make a twirler stay for months fuck the wrestling
Protects ya neck again like Rae and Meth and em
Im excellent you full of estrogen with a freshman pen
You couldnt cloud my intelligence with elegance
Ill never flinch whip game like they threw the elephants
Im heaven sent living vicariously through these presidents
Done worked my whole life to get two ive been spending ever since
Og kush bags couldnt find a better stench
Fly like D Wilkins and Kemp shootin the bench


Big city to country all the pretty bitches wants me
Toe tags for trying to jump me gun smoking like a junkie
Frying pan man turn your head into a Gumby
When Im hungry aint a a humble bum picture a nigga summy
Sunny everywhere shocked they let you in scummy every year
Pick a spot Im heavy there liquor poppin everywhere
Fucking dimes or something my hora got the telly scared
All problems aborted sons and daughter on your belly smeared
Rapped in fire black attire shes the appetizer
Humming on my trail all day ima clap her after china
Mr no good hood is ever acid rhymer
Shorty fly as hell about 11 levels past Cubana
Im honored loaded lama niggas hate ya honor
Donna Karen Sharen Chanel in my hotel
All the snickering
Im running through this money till the trip is done
I made it out the bottom with my niggas son
