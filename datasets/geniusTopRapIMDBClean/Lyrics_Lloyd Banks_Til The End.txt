alarm clock goes off door opens kids playing
sounds of traffic gun being loaded shots fired
Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke
They probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last nights pussy the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin from a nightmare mind on a Cnote
You leave the door with intentions of fulfillin your visions
Constantly sidetracked thinkin bout whos your man or who isnt
Maybe its necessary  maybe youre overreactin
Maybe your actual downfall is that ho that youre clappin
Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin the actions
Maybe your homey overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corner cause death is promised
You done seen some niggas go before ya the threats are honest
And with that lingerin in the back of your head
You know its possible that you wont make it back in your bed
The confusion and jealousy and dishonorll spin ya
But then none come worse than when that gunpowders in ya
If you my nigga you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill fuck a bitch fuck a Benz
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
If you my nigga you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
The smell of marijuana reeks off me
I raise hell fore I speak softly caught in the mix
Put at least a hungred grand on one hand bought him a 6
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix
We aint never left the hood so we camcorded the trips
I done watched the nigga go from BET to the Bricks shit
The slanted eyes what the chocolate thai gave me
Im a bachelor nigga you aint knockin my lady
A lot of these niggas been jockin mine lately
And I hope you catch this long nap rockabye baby
We two brothers pitched outta different mommas
Close enough to conflict and put the shit behind us
Your baby boy meet the daytime
Oldest watchin and these niggas tryin to get mine
Remember back then the lines in your flat top
Hopin your moms aint the momma on crack rock
If you my nigga you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill fuck a bitch fuck a Benz
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
If you my nigga you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
Keep my mind on my money and my head to the sky
I never really smile much if you was here youd know why
Theres frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin me up right hookin my high
Niggas hated on us fore the game took us inside
Then they opened they arms wide took the whoopin and cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin on the wall of my crib
And handsomes one of the things they been callin the kid
They watch you close when you coppin all the VS stones
If you aint tryin to get it poppin leave the BS home
I got a saditty broad that gives the best dome
And Im blowin on some of the finest weed thats grown homes
You wont know when they gon dump a slug
But you can tell Im gettin money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up you cant compare the dough
And if its only one bitch then we gon share the ho
If you my nigga you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill fuck a bitch fuck a Benz
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
If you my nigga you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo
Lets toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky  la da da
If you my nigga you my nigga til the end my friend 
sounds of children playing la da da
If you my nigga you my nigga til we go my niggarole 
la da da
sounds of door opening alarm clock going off harmonica playing
