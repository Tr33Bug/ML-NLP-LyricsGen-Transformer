Keep claiming Im changin but youre trippin
Kickin that stupid shit so long I start feelin dumb when I listen
I had to get out of that position
I aint got nothin but real shit on my mind and youre just fishin
Youre diluting your purpose the more you mix in
Guess well always be complaining just work hard through the bitchin
Lie right in your eye with a smirk they support the vision
Collision and the system is designed to keep your mind in a prison
If you look a while youll find the wisdom
Its not in the media infatuation with the television
Wheres the love You done left all your principles in the club
Life hittin you several times guess its hard to feel the pinch through the drugs
Is there exception for a thug
Caught in the trap but in creation perfect morning end up catchin a slug
Most of them sinkin tryin to make it out the mud
Duckin trouble 247 and their only vacation is dusk
Fake love gossip and hate thats all they givin
Gotta make it out this muhfuckin maze cause that aint livin
Aint no names out anybodys for pickin
Dont get caught up in the same route runnin ya mouth and out here slippin
The ghetto talkin you dont listen
Get your act together or therell be somebodys nigga missin
Heres to makin the transition
Money over everything you see the vision
Somewhere praying on your downfall like it works
Get in the core convert the energy before I write the verse
Thinkin of ways to shade a nigga spite rehearse
What is you waiting for You find it hard to cross me ice it first
Ive been gone so long look back I see dust
Went took the trust banned from the circle here forever last time youll be discussed
In this paper chase you wont pass mine dyin to rush
Turned on the lineage youre linked to bet your family members lie in disgust
Should have been ballin but your team jumpin
Put in the category of niggas that check for you when you need somethin
Lookin out for your broke ego youre greed drunk and
Dont nobody want you around really relieved from it
Let it slide it gets worse call him out on this shit he sorry
Usually his clique first wont be joining your pitty party
Patience cant be found now pushed it up to the limit probably
Waitin in the wing still shaky movin forgivin hardly


Fake love gossip and hate thats all they givin
Gotta make it out this muhfuckin maze cause that aint livin
Aint no names out anybodys for pickin
Dont get caught up in the same route runnin ya mouth and out here slippin
The ghetto talkin you dont listen nah
Get your act together or therell be somebodys nigga missin
Heres to makin the transition
Money over everything you see the vision
Used to have voices in my head thats cool
Cause the boy still here well fed thats true
Mean that since truths all that I had gotta carry that
When nothin you propose or alter it gotta marry that
How we interpret that merge is all relative
I stand behind every word like we all relatives
Less made men over a decade in
Im from the days when lil niggas got they chest caved in  talk about it 
See I left home and sleepin in parks was like a meltin pot
Aint DM an ex it was dark baby and hell is hot
Black MPV was parked used to yell it ock
Drive by circle the block check if he fell or not
Full of smokers in my Polo pullover
The day a nigga scared to be dolo and pulled over
Cause they gats go ratatatatata
Since I remember it all Im wantin a flashback
Rest in peace Grandpa I see him tilting his flask back
Our times kinda the same its tough to grasp that
No code of honor and they conduct
Alarmin because seein grievin mommas somber even Dalai Lama
Wish music was my escape
I was still naive it was beautiful when this maze crucial to how we behaved
Just like concussion is brutal the way we slave
They dont tutor you to what itll do to you at this stage listen
Fact sharing Im seein no matter the scenes
tween a rock and a heart places are bad pairin
Im paranoid plenty buy a couple feet and shit
Gettin money is easy the struggles keepin it
To all the hustlers in the world whatever your muse is
Hustlin music or hustlin excuses live
Some think too small they cant vision it
Dont even bother hittin my line Im transitionin
Fake love gossip and hate thats all they givin
Gotta make it out this muhfuckin maze cause that aint livin
Aint no names out anybodys for pickin
Dont get caught up in the same route runnin ya mouth and out here slippin
The ghetto talkin you dont listen
Get your act together or therell be somebodys nigga missin
Heres to makin the transition
Money over everything you see the vision
Knahmean
Just some real nigga gossipin Joey
Banks WHAT UP
Think too small they cant vision it
Dont even bother hittin my line Im transitionin
