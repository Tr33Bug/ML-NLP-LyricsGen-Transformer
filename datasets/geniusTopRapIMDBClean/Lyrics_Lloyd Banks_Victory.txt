gunshot
One one two
Nonstop 
Yo check me out right here yo
Yo yo we cant stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
Im high as ever more holes and more cheddar
GUnit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yea faggot if I want it Im gon have it
Regardless if its handed to me or I gotta grab it
Dont make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
Im cocky raps rocky nigga you sloppy
You know that Im 8 levels above you nigga
Ill club you nigga I never heard of you nigga ugly nigga
Im the wrong one to provoke
You rattin on niggas is only gon leave you smoke
So the only thing left now is tools for these cowards
I got no friends fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars they lay around flowers
I got a industry gangstress that argues and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus with Prada on the chuckus
So the spring break hoes home from college wanna fuck us
I aint here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckas cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this whole lot of zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul out a hero
Ima break before I lay floor buried
Besides every rapper aint a star and every plad aint Burberry
You cant tame Lloyd smokin by the big screen
Changin the channel looks like Im playin the Game Boy
I know the watch botherin ya vision
But reach and Ill put a dot on ya head like its part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon
Im blowin a 10 cause Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
Im in the Gucci vest with the green and red straps
Im the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every mornings a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed cause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run move startin a wave
Or leave with 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
Im the young pimp pardon my age
I dont got long hair but if I did she be partin my braids
Niggas find what club they at
Take em with us and run a train on em like a subway map
Your advance is grey Acura
See these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
Im goin down in history nigga next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean text polished in the drawer
Cameras by the hamper that mine into the floor
By now you probably heard of me
Fresh outta surgery flashy as a fuck you gon have to murder me
Burglary Im leavin with your Nikes burgundy white tee burgundy
You match now back down
Niggas love to hate you but love you when you disappear
Catch me on the boat with weed smoke and fishin gear
Heavy when I toke Cnotes from different years
Bezzy and the rope remotes and liftin chairs
You aint rich but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like Im a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys lookin for a coupe to drive
You aint gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
Its a damn shame yall still local
Im in a million dollar studio layin my vocals nigga


Still in the projects nigga you aint goin nowhere
You gon fuckin be there for the rest of your muthafuckin life
And your momma sayin Im supposed to tell you somethin
To encourage you somethin positive aight
Well I aint gon lie to you muthafucka he aint goin nowhere
Get yourself a beer and get on the fuckin curb gunshot
You fuckin dirt bag gunshot
