Warrior PtÂ 2 Lyrics
Woo Yeah Remix  50 Cent Ha Ha 
Lloyd Banks  Lloyd Banks Uh Huh  Ha Ha
Its like a throne that he dont even own
He wont sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
Its like a joke hes like a king but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the room he dont want the loot hes in it for the sport
Running circles round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he aint begging for it
And you can love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it
You cant be that ignorant though you can try to sell him short
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if Im fronting man you better come confront me for it
This is the story of a warrior I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It aint healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I dont need my boys
Im doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Dont give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money power and respect in this rap game
Hes straight outta a neighborhood where niggas hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomachs ache while hes lounging in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay
Houses with a bigger gate hounding hims a big mistake
He wont surrender hell rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldnt lend a helping hand
Till he was sitting on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussing the illest players thats in the game
And hes riding with Em 50 Cent Doc and em
GUnit Records aint a motherfucker stopping them
This is the story of a warrior I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It aint healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I dont need my boys
Im doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Dont give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money power and respect in this rap game
Hes no magician man the kid does something out of nothing
So that niggas from his hood act like he owes him something
They talk crazy till they send niggas to where to buck him
Ask him if its a problem and hell say nah its nothing
He was gonna help em out but since they fronted fuck em
He dont care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thugging
Hes rich now he aint changed so niggas think he bugging
He bulletproof everything cause niggas try and buck him
Keeps two pistols on his hip Ill show you where he tuck em
Niggas say they gon get at him but they cant touch him
Try to catch him slipping they creep in and he start bussing
This is the story of a warrior I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It aint healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I dont need my boys
Im doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Dont give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money power and respect in this rap game
I can give you niggas something you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You aint no G you a fucking clown
I can take your girl and tuturn her out
Dont hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckers something to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth
