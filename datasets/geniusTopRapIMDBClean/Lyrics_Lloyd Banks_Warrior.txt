Im a Warrior
Aw man I never run never snitch
Im a grown man dog I aint no bitch
A Warrior 
Wont change cause hes rich
Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch
A Warrior 
Wont fold under pressure
He got a shell waiting in the hole if they test ya
A warrior 
Ill sacrifice it all if he has ta
React and think about it after  I am warrior 
Uh You heard right motherfucker
My grandmama daughter aint raised no sucker
Heart full of pride and a head full of anger
Attitude of a winner infrared for the danger
Even the paranoia of a femalell change ya
Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger
Im on the move smooth with one eye out for the snakes
Who cant stand hearing your name all throughout the states
Tune into BET and watching your video
Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really know
So if thats your man warn him
Cause theres enough bullets in here
To hit every NBA patch on him
Nigga ride til I die the song I sing
You aint ready for the war I bring
You aint gonna do a goddamn thing
And I aint ever scared Im a warrior
Im a Warrior
Aw man I never run never snitch
Im a grown man dog I aint no bitch
A Warrior 
Wont change cause hes rich
Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch
A Warrior 
Wont fold under pressure
He got a shell waiting in the hole if they test ya
A warrior 
Ill sacrifice it all if he has ta
React and think about it after
I am warrior 


Goddamn ho here I go again
The Double LOYD
Here put on an IV
Tryin ta try me
The new age I lead
The black CIG
Resides beside me
Im smooth as an Isley
Sometimes I surprise me
Cant even ID
As low as my eyes be
I roll with the gangstas dont get foul with your mouth
The wrong punchlinell have niggas inside of your house
Nigga Im doing good I made it out of the hood
I own Beverly Hills no more bottles or wood
Thats a zipper thats sticky
California should whip me
I done made it this far cant be mad if they hit me  shhiit 
Nigga ride til I die the song I sing
You aint ready for the war I bring
You aint gonna do a goddamn thing
And I aint ever scared Im a warrior
Im a Warrior
Aw man I never run never snitch
Im a grown man dog I aint no bitch
A Warrior 
Wont change cause hes rich
Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch
A Warrior 
Wont fold under pressure
He got a shell waiting in the hole if they test ya
A warrior 
Ill sacrifice it all if he has ta
