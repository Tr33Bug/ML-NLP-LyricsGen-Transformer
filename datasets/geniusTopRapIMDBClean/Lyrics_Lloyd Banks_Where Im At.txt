Yeah you got me
Im up now its your loss
Must suck to be you
History is like a quarternote delay
It keeps repeating itself and what else can I say
You wondering why I act this way
I never shouldve gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now eh
There mustve been a gust of wind
Cause you change your mind every time it blows
And you just changed it amotherfuckingain
You just said you just wanted some dick fore I stuck it in
I wouldnt have been such a prick to you fuckin men
You say you dont trust em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin
Some shit is goin down
You mustve just not been truthful from the start
See for me itd be nothin to say you never had my heart
But Id be lyin
Fuckin see why they call this bullshit a relationship ships sink
And you know its love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fuckin do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me six weeks
Have went by and we only spoke twice
Im sittin in your driveway callin you from the car suffice
I think its safe to say youre not at home
Im callin your cell phone
You answer but I can tell though that youre not alone
How was I to know
It shouldve been time to go a long time ago
I kept holdin on its comical
When I think back now why I couldnt get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwin I wasnt catchin your drift
But theres a cold breeze blowin over me Im over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin all over the unsober you
And I hope they play this in every club that youre goin to
Im hauntin you bitch everywhere you turn Im followin you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me you know its true
Its killin you now yeah I hope the ho dies slow in you
Its cause of you now I dont trust em at all fuck em
Middle finger up Im gon just keep grabbin my balls cup em
Ill never fall again I trip on stairs I fall up em
So buttercup dont try to come back knockin on my door all dolled up
Cause Im movin on dont worry about me
Cause Im gon be just fine without you youll see
There aint no one on this Earth right now Id much rather be
Cause goddamn it Im glad that Im me
I said if you could be where Im at  bye bye 
Youd wanna be you too  Ima be good without you 
If you felt the way I feel I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where Im at  bye bye 
Youd wanna be you too  Ima be good without you 
If you felt the way I feel I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont cause you just feel like you
Uh Ive had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Your options are leave or put out granted your ass fine
Fine just aint gon cut it
Drama is what youre in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately Im feelin smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives I gotta rise above it
You thinkin about whos lovin me Im thinkin about who doesnt
Doesnt really matter what you say sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon be splittin you dont think I mean it
Left you with everything I got fuck you Aint no secret
No apologies you keep it
Now that Im doin my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy who needs it
Every rumor you hear you go believe it
Point out the times youve seen it
You stabbed me should have leaned it
Revenge is mine I need it need a way out
Its my fuckin life let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought Id break it aint that easy
Bet you thought Id need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Aint no freebies get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio moneyhungry hopeless ho
You fuckin with my focus so
Go back to that chump that played the role befo
Love is like a cancer when you dont let go
Ima blow fo sho
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I dont need you sinkin us hope you float
Lyin through my teeth I hope you dont
Drown drown  Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met proud that we broke
Let them girls crowdin me go
If they got somethin to show let em show me
I dont love em never lonely never even left a scar
You fell hard Im laughin ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car nothin is what we are
No beginnin no tomorrow
Cause Im movin on dont worry about me
Cause Im gon be aight without you youll see
There aint no one on this Earth right now Id much rather be
Cause goddamn it Im glad that Im me
I said if you could be where Im at  bye bye 
Youd wanna be you too  Ima be good without you 
If you felt the way I feel
I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where Im at  bye bye 
Youd wanna be you too  Ima be good without you 
If you felt the way I feel
I bet youd be in as good a mood as I am
But you dont cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where Im at  bye bye
