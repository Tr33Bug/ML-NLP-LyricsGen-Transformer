Im gon ride Im gon ride
They gon ride we all gon ride
Ive come from the heart of South Side
Holdin it down for my niggas that died
I gotta busy bird on my side
Pop shit and get your whole mouth wired
Baby had tried to steal off the payroll
Ill have niggas scrappin the skin off yo face
With the same shit they peel the potatoes
I thank the Lord for my blessings and Im glad he gave us
The willpower and reflexes of Larry Davis
You dont wanna see my block formin
Thats a hundred and one doggs
And I dont mean the ones with the spots on em
Were respected highly
Cause you dont need to practice gymnastics to catch a body
Me and moneys like Whitney next to Bobby
If I bring all my niggas Ill need an extra lobby
As soon as you aint around jake
You get your ass whipped for chips
Now thats the real definition of poundcake
I got the crown snake and you can tell when Im shopping
Cause when the mall stampedin you feel the ground shake
I got a car I only drive on Thursdays
Im a stunna Banks blows more cake than birthdays
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
You know how I gets down this pound holds six rounds
I told ya Id be back bitch talk that shit now
You hear that fofif sound duck when I spit rounds
Cause this aint Beverly Hills you in the bricks now
We aint got shit down here but dope and guns for sale
You get your head cracked and niggas dont run and tell
Its like we sell crack get caught head back to jail
We on that fuck the police shit we livin in hell
You better guard your grill homey and stand your ground
These bullets burn they hit whoevers standin around
I never learn even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some BandAids and bought a couple Glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12gauge thats when the trouble stops
If its beef then Im ready to ride
Just come to Cashville you can find me on the South Side
Motherfucker
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
Now I aint from Michigan but Im in the Fab Five
You know Yayo and 50 Buck and Game you know my fuckin name
Whether the truck or train my minds stuck on the grind
Cause somewhere down the line a lot of suckers came
Yeah aint talkin shit but we can all tell he ass
Jabs will black his eyes like the R Kelly mask
You gotta blast me yo cause the Louisville
Will have yo head lookin like the top of a pistachio
The young gunner with a raspy flow
Got every boyfriend thinkin their girlfriends a nasty ho
My heart laughin its small
Maybe its cause my grandpop dropped right after the ball
Banks hops out bulletproof this bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel when you hot they hawk you
I got the hood on my shoulder
Chain big as a boulder
The 357 tucker
Motherfucker
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
Yeeuh haha
Motherfucker
Im here yeeuh
