Tell me you love me now tell the world you love me louder
The most beautifullest things come with ugly power
For now its bubbly hour were celebrating right
Big dreamer a taste for heights
One of the greatest teachers takes advice
One of the peace MCs takes your life
Cold ass world I had to break the ice
Know that girl youre about to make a wife
Nights like this you need the pipe white six
Flip TVs to play your highlight clips
Thought Id be done taking the mob path
Man plan God laughs
Somewhere between my evens and odd clash
You give your life to the ghetto get nothing from it
The shorties run when they see me
I give em hundreds most wanted
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something
Came from nothing went to far to look back
Cant even have my style niggas took that
Get where youre going wish they could black
Rather they shoot you down another reason to fly
Reason Im never coming down again
Aint shit here for me you see me highhigh
Lifes a bitch since when you know me sweat her
I is the only letter tend to outshine
Find me the golden era
Naw I cant stop I owe that to my grandpop
The glow that made the hand hot
Beat too much soldiers in the sandbox
I got the hoes hiking dont know a flow like him
Feels like Ive been here before
Ironic Im ghost writing
Chronic and gold lightening
Illuminate Im hype when
I lose them playing them twice then
Them rules thatll cage your life in
Been feeling its my time again
Spill my survival gems
The rap game in question and Im young Iverson
My dawg in a jam and I got to ride with him
Its all out of hand when they let the rivals in
To the sky with them uh
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something
Came from nothing went to far to look back
Cant even have my style niggas took that
Get where youre going wish they could black
Rather they shoot you down another reason to fly
Reason Im never coming down again
Aint shit here for me you see me highhigh
Uh the furthest thing born perfect and I deserve it
Ran out of my mommas worth it
One of a kind design of grimy surface
They leave you a body does seem like the churches
Okay to get high just dont get out your purpose  worthless
Mad man I feel like its working
Lay down my shit then leave the studio hurting
Killing in two leagues Im Julius Erving
A star was born in April
Thats what Im shooting for when
Back to the future boy
Im in the booth Im super Lloyd
Cnotes sing your hearts serenade
Samples of separation foulest shit they ever made
I spot my people the same corner we laugh pain
Said I aint lose a step knew me since half days hey
Broke my way out of the trap
Looking for change Good I got that exact
My time is now Ill die for something
Came from nothing went to far to look back
Cant even have my style niggas took that
Get where youre going wish they could black
Rather they shoot you down another reason to fly
Reason Im never coming down again
Aint shit here for me you see me highhigh
