Big Bada boom Ludas in this bitch
Pussy niggas clear the room
I came through the door I said it before
Im the truth in this booth and you niggas all hoes
Counterfeit rappers say Im stealing their flows
But I cant steal what you never made up bitch
Yall some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes  put on your makeup bitch
Let me explain nothings been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But whats the same that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game 11 years and still counting
And yall get a couple hit records make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Whos gassing em they blowing smoke up your ass you fired up but Im just puff puff passing em
Until they roaches buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow better pray like its your last day
You lying to yourself just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you aint invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
Thats disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants
See Im ya past Im ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum 6 number 1 peaks
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
Yous weak softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Dont make me expose the truth yous a ho boy
Dont make me get on that Stomp shit and get back at it
You rappers aint even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes sometimes
But my fans know the difference because My Chick Bad went platinum
Still winning motherfucker
The nerve of you niggas man
You aint got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation yall outta line
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
So the next time you gnats got a real problem
Dont be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit
Nigga say it to my face
