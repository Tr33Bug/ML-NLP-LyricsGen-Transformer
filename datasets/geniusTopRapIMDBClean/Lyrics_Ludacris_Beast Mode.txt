Uh mic check 12  Go get em 
Listen close nigga yeah
Uh if rappers want it they can get it
Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin in a Civic
My flows are unimaginable Hannibal Lecter shit
Eatin emcees for breakfast bitch
Since I was born to touch the micThe First Time its been a problem
Your life was a mistake your pops shouldve wore a condom
You niggas think you hard I think you better come harder  Go hard 
I leave rappers confused like williams barber
Ah fuckin with Ludas not a great look
A versell make your fans unfriend you on Facebook
Click my styles are goin into labor
So if stars won a war Im their daddy like Darth Vader
And since Im always high its kind of hard to overlook me
For over a hundred stacks its kind of hard to overbook me
And a whole nother house for my cars is on my checklist
Cause to fit em in one garage is like a nigga playin Tetris
But they say patience is a virtue cause I got your bitch stayin out way past her curfew
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words
Slangin chickens out my whip like I been playin Angry Birds
In a black Rolls Royce Dark Knight like Batman
Everywhere you turn the Ghost follows like PacMan
And I sleep with the John Dillinger
And always keep an eye halfopen like Forest Whitaker
No you boys aint ready for combat
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract
What path is he on Opponents I laugh and be gone
They handin in the towels like they work in Bed Bath  Beyond
But in the midst of all the melee yall niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
Your rap styles are phony your lines are just dead
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played
Guess Im tryin to say Im advanced you intermediate
You wouldnt know the real me if your bitch Wikipediad it
Just know that I never tried to be hard
Probably cause Mr Glock 40s my security guard
Youll get chopped like judo
Gangs in my hood make you reverse
And change your color like the blocks playin Uno
And yes some of my friends is still sellin them drugs
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud
They show me love
Thats why Ill always stay reppin until the death of me
Rappers talk shit but aint nobody ever stepped to me
I hereby command all my fans to inject it
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
wake up 
Yeah my mind is sharper than a guillotine
All the nines extended from the knuckles of Wolverine
Not a XMan but man I got that X
Some of my artists switch labels but I still get a check
The more albums they sell the more we all win
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin
Or watchin CBS in a Cadillac DTS
I plan to reach the world man your plan is MetroPCS
can you hear me now 
I changed my music up cause I was gettin bored
You may not like the way I shoot but my points go on the board
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas albums
Peace fuck out of here rewind that shit
Hahaha Luda aint shit changed
