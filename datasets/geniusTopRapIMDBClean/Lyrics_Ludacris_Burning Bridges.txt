When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you dont need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense I did all I could do
You just took me for granted you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I dont know you no more fuck it I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb the less weight Im trying to carry
Dem niggas holdin on for dear life bringin me drama
But Im only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga yous a grown man get yourself together
Forget about the past nows a better time than never
Matter of fact Its time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out and stop burning Cris bridges
You little bitches
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
Yeah this industrys full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship
Cos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when Im around yall
But soon as I leave niggas be prayin on my down fall
Is it cause youll never sell as many records
My bitches always look better you fail at business endeavours
Or that people thought you were clever but now they know you stupid
And misery loves company now that youre going through it
Somebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis
So get out of here you dont want no part of this shit Dewey
I see them drugs got yall trippin too soon
Thats why you find me in the club every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
Ill be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then trillion
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
For you to know its not the money its the principle
So I cant expect you to know what Im talkin bout
Our issues are deep within we cant just talk em out
Niggas is fighting inside we cant just walk em out
These bridges burning so fast we cant just stomp em out
As if you know what Im talkin bout
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges cant be crossed
Lord wont you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
