Yeah
Can I ever really find a way to let go of you
I been thinking about it every time that Im in a booth
Try to put together everything that we do
Every step we take is away from the truth
Whats the point of a relationship
If every other day we gotta save that shit
Its gotta be love thought we found it
Ship has been sinking we both have been drowning
All the hatred that we been allowing
All the alcohol that we been downing
Afraid to commit but afraid to let go Im alone I can feel all the demons surrounding
Been a while since I recognized
Who I see when I look in my eyes
Trying to breathe but the more that I try
More that I suffocate dying inside
Tried to be different we both tried to listen Im sorry that I had to leave you behind
All of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind
Locked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine
Made the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine  faith of divine faith of divine 
All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive
Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me but it wasnt our time
Still Ill love you till the day that I die  day that I die day that I die 

Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong
We can pretend that what we both know aint true
I dont mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth
I wish I could stay here to be your protection
Loving myself is what I been neglecting
The most difficult part is the patience
While taking in all of these changes
I dont mean to be acting evasive
Im pretending I dont wanna face this
I get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now Im anxious
All I got left is a picture of us
All because we had broken the trust
Been working on gaining it back for a year but the spark has been missing it turned into dust
Miss the high that I got from your touch
Both of us felt an adrenaline rush
Codependent treated you like a crutch
My heart was stolen  brutally crushed
Question is will I ever know
What we we could have been if I let you go
If I need to walk this path alone
All on my own cause I need to grow
Fuck Im sick of this
Feeling like a mother fucking hypocrite
Made a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it
Find a way to let it go and be indifferent
Quit talking  quit talking quit talking 
All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive
Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me but it wasnt our time
Still Ill love you till the day that I die  day that I die day that I die 
Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong
We can pretend that what we both know aint true
I dont mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth
