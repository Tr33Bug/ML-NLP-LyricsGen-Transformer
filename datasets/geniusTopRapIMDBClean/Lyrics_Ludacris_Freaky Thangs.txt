The models that swallow willin up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh Im fresh and fruity
Ya dutys to figure the bootys gettin slapped up
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs and push em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
