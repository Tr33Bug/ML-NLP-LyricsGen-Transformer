The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes
Come up out yo negligee freak em on a regular day
Cum six times but its seven today

Makin you stutter from the bbody butters and backrubs
Its killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh Im fresh and fruity
Ya dutys to figure the bootys gettin slapped up
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs and push em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist
But after we do what we gon do get ya purse and get together
Because now you gots to ride out bitch
Oh Cris can you do it again thats what they askin me
Hit skins causin catastrophes
Get pinned by me and my family
Sip gin fulfillin your fantasies
In your condition Im wishin youll take a lickin

Finger lickin never get sick and tired just take a look in her eyes
And you can tell shes a figure five so we love that cccc
