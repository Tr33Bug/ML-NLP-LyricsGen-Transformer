The birthplace of Martin Luther King

And the chrome on the Chevys when Im choppin in the trap

RIP Camoflauge out in Savannah  Georgia 
Now you might come for vacation leave on probation
Home of the strip club known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup
For the thick chick in the thong with the big butt
