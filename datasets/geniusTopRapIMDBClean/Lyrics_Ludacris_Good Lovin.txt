I keep dwellin on the past babe
Know what I need yeah
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
Its better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldnt be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies
Some on the fence some befriended me
But when we see each other its gon be some weird energy
Im sorry that we couldnt make it work
Believe in your heart I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking bout thats supposed to be you girl
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But whats a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without em
Need solutions less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain feel the pain inside em
Kinda lost need someone to guide em
Its nothin worse than feelin alone
But Ill admit to feelin better when Im hearing this song it goes
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
So I dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat baby
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
