Yeah
Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap and starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybodys after all of my ends
Get yo hand out my pocket 
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays Im losing all of my friends let the story begin
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Yeah
Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When Im at the crib Im mad Im not at the club lit
When Im at the club Im mad Im not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes Id rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name  Luda 
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what Im really saying is


The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Yeah
Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade  Give me my Ac 
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin I wasnt underground
Got underground start trippin I need hits  We outta here 
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbors fertilizer is fake  Dont let it fool ya 
We always searching for what we never had
Always ignoring whats in front of our face
Weve been conditioned to think
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
