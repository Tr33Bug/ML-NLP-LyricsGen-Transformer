Okay I remember the days
High rights low lefts even stevens and fades
Troops Lottos and BKs those was the days
Hitec boots spray painted witcha names
Tshirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain one gold with yo initial
Harris Photos group shots can you remember
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didnt lie shot hisself in the head with the 45
When she disobeyed had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo the invasions of haters man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin old school  old school 
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And thats how it went
When we were kids
In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers GI Joes and Thundercats
We was lovin that
Before they started jackin jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware Wayne Williams was out there but we aint care
Kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass thats a bet
Want your KoolAid and sugar smack your hands and say sweat
Its mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss cut da whole Disturbin Tha Peace
Wit no conscience broke niggas call em non cents
No comments its Lil Fate payin homage to College Park
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And thats how it went
When we were kids
I had a Long John but no Silver no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin over barbed wire clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin of Cadillacs wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise man
repeat 2X
