Hi my names Ludacris and Im high as giraffe pussy
And Im close to the edge so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin a fool from the traps to the burbs
My filthy mouth it wont fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
Its the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin
But no pork on my fork I dont even speak pig Latin
I go fishin on my lake with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs but I dont gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka clean out yo rap lockers
Im as stiff as a board yall more shook than maracas
But my trix aint for kids if you digum youll get smacked
Ill clock ya Ill spring forward you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
Thats cause Im a shot caller yall fools is Crank Yankers
Aint a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland Oregon to Portland Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee Im on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys Im a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell em I want a fullcourt press  Ow 
So momma toast your glass while Im countin my cash
Cause every single is a smash Im hot as a camels ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo car to a crap game no one rolls witchu
One of MiniMes shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record aint spinnin
Im in the strip club smokin with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me  Me 
Ill be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerators taller than Shaq  Yeah 
So yippie kay yay yippie yie yie yo  Yo 
If you cant swim dont smoke my hydro  Dro 
Ive been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of yall are mo stuck up than tampons  Woo 
So wash all your sins away and stop playin  Yeah 
If Gods line is busy you might have to twoway him  Mhm 
Then catch me in your backyard playin croquet
And when Im drunk tell them kids Drugs are bad mmmkay
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoes off Pico
Got seven cars get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think Im bad they say Ooh hes so evil
Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people  Ow 
But my albums out the store yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot so yall keep to yourself
Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that yall talkin yall can pop it to them
Cause Ludacrisll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
Im the man I got money far as the eyes can see
And Im in a group I split dough with me me and me
So much money in my jewelry that Im damn near sorry
So Ima trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari  Woo 
I buy cars with straight cash have meetings with Donald Trump
Yall meet with Honda no payments for twelve months  Uhhuh 
Take a look at yo life and no wonder you so sad
Yall put up with more shit than a colostomy bag  Fool
