I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper heart screams with emotion
Its my daily devotion the verses stay deeper than the ocean
So hiphop you owe me a promotion
Yeah I do a little boastin and braggin
Whats all the commotion and naggin about Cause Im still the champ in the South
Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out
Well theyre fired and these pink slips Im handin em out
Cause this is Theater of the Mind consider it a sign
Of whats to come next my moneys just fine
Bank filled with dumb checks terrorist threat flow
Proceed to drop bombs like Mr Funk Flex
But I dont do it for the money I do it from the heart
I do it with the beat box I did it from the start
I do it for the dee jays I do it for the charts
The Van Gogh flow Luda do it cause its art
I do it for the fans I do it on command
I do it for the front row I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood I do it for the block
And since nine years old I did it for hiphop so
I dont do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
And I dont it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
Uhh uhh uh
They say Im so low key Im socially awkward
Only niggas who really know me who I talk with
They smile in the light hate in the dark
You call it beef to me its just a fuckin walk in the park
Cause you are who you are when nobodys lookin
Thats who you are so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow dont be askin to borrow
Ski mask it hard like the way you rap in your bars
I can ride on you and whoever devise new endeavors
Im as live as a hive full of predators
Twenty thousand different species of bees
Some have poisonous stings some just pollinate leaves
Its like rap some just buzz some will attack
Compromise their own life in fact
Sixteen years since my first sixteen
Pardon the rest of my niggas but Im the best whos ever did it
I dont do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh I do it for hiphop
Yeah I do it for hiphop
Uh I do it for hiphop
And I dont do for the chains and the flashin rocks
Why we do it kid I do it for hiphop
Yeah I do it for hiphop
Uh I do it for hiphop
Hiphop started out in the park
We used to do it to avoid the Narcs
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark
Can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
To pass the time while I was gettin it in
Just so happens Im so illegal with the pen
They aint want me doin anything illegal again
I lost a lot of dogs to these streets
I got Grammy Awards on these beats
Thank God for Kool Herc
Without your shit I probably wouldve got murked
Shout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz
And even Jaz bumass
Hiphop helped me wash my rocks
These other rappers couldnt wash my socks
Thats why I took the number one slot
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
Lord knows when I was on my clock
I prolly never woulda stopped thank God for hiphop
I dont do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
And I dont do for the chains and the flashin rocks
Come on I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
DJ scratches and Ludacris adlibs until 456
I dont do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
And I dont it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
I do it for hiphop
