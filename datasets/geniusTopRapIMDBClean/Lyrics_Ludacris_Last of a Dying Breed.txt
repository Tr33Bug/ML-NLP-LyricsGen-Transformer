Oww

I done killed so many niggas in the booth I sell rappers on eBay  Hey 
Cause every one of my verses been instant like replays  Hey 
Speakers get blown like candles on your Bday  Hey 
Cause Ludas catalog got more records than the DJ  Woo 
The bank yells Mayday cause every days a payday
I put it on tape and then I sell it like Ray J  Ahh 
But not out the store  Nope  straight to the buyer
Cause I slung em out my trunk like the DC Sniper
And six albums later youll deposit every word
Til your memory bank gives me the credit I deserve
Top five damn right But really it just hit me
That three of yo top fives too scared to fuck with me  Woo 
So how can I advance if you dont give me no opponents  Yeah 
How can you see the future if you living for the moment  Yeah 
Hiphop couldnt die I never offered my condolence
But Ill offer yall a day of atonement
Cause Im a lyricist to the death so I got what you need
Ludacris Im the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct so Im saying it loud
Say it with me MC means move the crowd
Say it with me MC means move the crowd
Say it with me MC means move the crowd
MMMC means movem  I got it baby 
And Im an MC I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea I wear red like roses
Go against me and youll be dead like roses
Spitting at your head for the bread like toasters
Never had a holster I keep it on my lap
And hiphop aint dead it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumping yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Little Carter or Little Cardiac
Precious like an artifact valuable like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack throwback like a Starter hat
Now how did he thought of that I mean how did he think of that
I mean how did I think of that Now like a rental bring it back
I mean how did I think of that I surprise myself sometimes
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme
Every time I do it I do it dirty like swine
For the Dirty and Five hiphopIm alive


Im a lyricist to the death so I got what you need
Weezy F the last of a dying breed
And we almost extinct so Im saying it loud
Say it with me MC means move the crowd
Say it with me MC means move the crowd

Controversial lyrics like Im crying for help  Hoo 
Very talented but I should be ashamed of myself  Woo 
But this is my art  Art  this is my music  Hey 
Im speaking from the heart hit Record and Ill lose it
Bite my tongue for no one  No  Ill put you on blast  Blast 
So all the news channels yall could kiss my ass
And if I dish it I could take it  Yeah  fix it if you break it  Yeah 
Could hit rock bottom and Im still gon make it  Why 
Cause Im a born hustler natural survivor
Seed of a gangsta I put that on my father
YouTube or Google me turn it up and play it  Hey 
Cause many people think it I just had the balls to say it  What 
And risk losing everything I stand for the weak
Plus I live for my freedom of speech cause
