And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends as
You want to but I really want you

You want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame
And I  just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke breaststroke stroke of a genius
