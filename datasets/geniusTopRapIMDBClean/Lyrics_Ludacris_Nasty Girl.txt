Yeah I met this girl named Keisha she was so sweet  yup 
Nails stay manicured pretty little feet  woo 
Shoes so sexy body so hot
Hair lookin like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth clothes so tight
Style so sexy makeup just right

Black lace bra Vickie Secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent smile so bright
Works in the mornin but shell party all night
All for her man all cause she bout it
All cause she crazy in love and dont doubt it
Product of her birthplace know about the streets
Clean in the workplace dirty in the sheets
Keeps her own toaster makes her own bread
Lady in the STREET but a freak in the bed cause
Okay okay haha
I got a college girl who go to church ery Sunday
Had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me
But shes so innocent when she ridin mami
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry
Favorite chore of mine its my lil bunny
Bowlegged and classy such a real woman
Sex all night go to work ery mornin
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her Me too mami
When you get off work daddy gon punish
You my nasty girl forever I promise
I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me Come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat all white heels
And nothin underneath so its an all night deal
Im her number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D
But wait I got a lawyer girl thats so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
Said she needs some evidence and to show her the PROOF
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause Im hung like a jury  jury 
Judge Luda preside over your body and Im never in a hurry
You may proceed let the games begin
And if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again
