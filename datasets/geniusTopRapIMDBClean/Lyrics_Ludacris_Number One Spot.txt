Some would rather run down and get one cow  Nah 
I think Id rather walk down and get em allyou know what Im talking bout right  You know whats up right 
Look
Im never going nowhere so dont try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivyoh they grimy
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly Hi Mr OReilly
Hope all is wellkiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a rivers what they cry me
Im on the rise so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me  Surprise 
Its a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes  Bow 
Explorer like Dorathese Swipers cant swipe me
My whole auras so mean in my white tee
Nobody lightskinneded repping harder since IceT
You disagree take the Tyson approach and bite me
Whoa Dont slip up or get got  Why not man 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Alright woo 
Rappers swearing they on top  Nuhuh uhuh 
But Im coming for they numberone spot  Alright man 
Schemescheme plotplot  Say what 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Woo Hey 
Keep it goingit wont stop  What you doing man 
Im coming for that numberone spot
Yes indeed Ludacris Im hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught bailout popoI tell em Holla
In court I never show up like Austin Powers fazha
Father father and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records Ive sold
Jacuzzis hot Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that Ive rolled
A pig in a blanket a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later til these women cant stand straight
The Ludameister got em feeling so randy
Im doubleXL so I call em my eye candy
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
Cause Im worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars
Whoa Dont slip up or get got  Why not man 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Alright woo 
Rappers swearing they on top  Nuhuh uhuh 
But Im coming for they numberone spot  Alright man 
Schemescheme plotplot  Say what 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Woo Hey 
Keep it goingit wont stop  What you doing man 
Im coming for that numberone spot
Causing lyrical disasters its the master
Make music for MiniMes models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me Get in my belly
Stay on the track hit the ground running like FloJo
Sent back in time and Ive never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world
Whoa Dont slip up or get got  Why not man 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Alright woo 
Rappers swearing they on top  Nuhuh uhuh 
But Im coming for they numberone spot  Alright man 
Schemescheme plotplot  Say what 
Im coming for that numberone spot  Woo Hey 
Keep it goingit wont stop  What you doing man 
Im coming for that numberone spot
