Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazz Fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest ay

While the ladies all beggin me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now its all happy endings on my lap in Japan hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago

Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Can we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air
Now ladies look around with me
Lets see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it aint no way that all these niggas could be pimpin
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga Put your hands down
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say Put your hands down
If your spinnin rims spin counter clockwise you are not pimpin
If you are dancin on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what You guessed it  you are not pimpin
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
Thats because you didnt order Vodka buddy
Thats why its three dollars a glass aput your hands down
Now look down look down
I need I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay you see the nigga with the white socks Not pimpin
Sorry unless you part of the Beat It entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on em youre not pimpin
