You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that Im feeling a little pressure
When youre telling me I better come get it
But Im the man for the job
Cant nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
Ima stand right by you
While you saying
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
Yeah alright alright alright hey 
It turns me on to know I turn you on

Yeah alright alright alright hey 
Sit in the front row and watch me perform

Then Ima hit every single one of your spots
And really you dont need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What Im asking if its mine
Cause Imma be your motivation
Just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine
Im so attracted to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure

But behind closed doors youre a fucking soldier

Ill take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though its not that many
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning
My mind and body are gone
That jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine
You make me wanna call the crib
And say Im never coming home Luda
