If you live for somethin youre not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter a toast to life
Luda
They say what dont kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tiptoe through life to arrive safely at death
Im on a journey yeah Im on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that Im about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules
Thats somewhere to go but the world is movin slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke a lesson I cant afford
But for what its worth Im ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh oh oh
Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey
For the rest of my life
If I got one life to live Ima party til Im dead
What the hell is a life worth livin if its not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance Im twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say Women Weed and Alcohol
Thats somewhere to go but the world is movin slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke a lesson I cant afford
But for what its worth Im ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh oh oh


Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey oh
Na na na hey
If you live for somethin youre not alone my friend
So fill up your cup  fill up your cup 
Lift your lighters a toast to life
Im stuck in this moment freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when Im out of my mind
And you can call me crazy but I like to roll the dice
So Im willin to bet that Ima be crazy for the rest of
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
