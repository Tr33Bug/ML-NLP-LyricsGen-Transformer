Rollout  My Business  Lyrics
Rollout rollout
Rollout rollout
Rollout rollout
Rollout rollout
Rollout  I got my twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Rollout  Twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Now whered you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it
Whered you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin through
Man I aint got nothin to prove I paid my dues breakin the rules I shake fools while Im takin a cruise
Tell me whos your weed man and how do you smoke so good
Yous a superstar boy why you still up in the hood
What in the world is in that bag What you got in that bag
A couple of cans of whoop ass you did a goodass job of just eyein me spyin me
Rollout  I got my twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Rollout  Twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Man that car dont come out until next year where in the fuck did you get it
Thats eighty thousand bucks gone where in the fuck did you spend it
You must have eyes on your back cause you got money to the ceilin
And the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin the better Im feelin the more that Im chillin winnin drillin and killin the feelin
Now whos that bucked naked cook fixin three course meals
Gettin goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room what you got in that room
A couple of gats a couple of knives a couple of raps a couple of wives now its time to choose


Rollout  I got my twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Rollout  Twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Are you custom made custom paid or you just custom fitted
PlayStation 2 up in the ride is that Lorenzokitted
Is that your wife your girlfriend or just your main bitch
You take a pick while Im rubbin the hips touchin lips to the top of the dick and then Whew
Now tell me whos your housekeeper and what you keep in your house
What about diamonds and gold is that what you keep in your mouth
What in the world is in that case what you got in that case
Get up out my face you couldnt relate wait to take place at a similar pace so shake shake it
Rollout  I got my twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
Rollout  Twin Glock forties  Rollout  cocked back
Rollout  Me and my homies  Rollout  so drop that
Rollout  We rollin on twenties  Rollout  with the top back
Rollout  So much money  Rollout  you cant stop that
