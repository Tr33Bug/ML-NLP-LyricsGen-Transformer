Now little Lisas only nine years old
Shes tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why shes all alone and they never met her family
Mommas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobodyll listen
Mommas on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her mommas knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma dont believe her
Lisas stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says shes bout to run away and never come back  Like this 
Runaway love  love love  runaway love  love love 
Runaway love  love love  runaway love  love love 
Little Nicole is only ten years old
Shes steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions shes makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside cryin on the out
Its only one girl really knows what shes about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that theyll always be tight til the end
Until one day lil Stacy gets shot
A driveby bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicoles stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says shes bout to run away and NEVER come back
Runaway love  love love  runaway love  love love 
Runaway love  love love  runaway love  love love 


Little Erica is eleven years old
Shes steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus shes havin sex with her boy whos sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks shes in love
So theres no protection hes usin no glove
Never thinkin bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he aint ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she bout to run away and NEVER come back ah
Runaway love  love love  runaway love  love love
