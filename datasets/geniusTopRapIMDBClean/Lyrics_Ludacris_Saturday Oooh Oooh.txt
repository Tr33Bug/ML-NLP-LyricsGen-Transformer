Saturday  Oooh Oooh  Lyrics
OoohOooh
OoohOooh
OoohOooh
OoohOooh
Sleepy Brown 
I gotta big weed stash pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky
Sticky icky icky icky
System on blast cops just passed
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Sticky icky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Grease dont pop on the stove no more
Moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out  WHAT THE FUCK 
Act like my rims aint clean
How you gonna act like my neck dont bling
Haters get sprayed like AfroSheen
But they dont ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane cane sugar man Luda dont go
And I stop at a light pulled up so slow
But Im out for the night so pass that dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome  Cadillac brome 
Now dont it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms then bend them curves
Chop chop chunk it up fat man herb
Sleepy Brown 
I gotta big weed stash pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky
Sticky icky icky icky
System on blast cops just passed
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Sticky icky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Its illegal but the plants in my backyard grow
Thats my bud
Smoke til ya drop out thats my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club
In the back door  NIGGA WHAT 
Act like I dont make clouds
How you gonna act like I dont get loud
How you gonna act like I dont rock crowds
And leave a lot of people with a gaptooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you dont really know dont hurt
With a vest and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block man they got that work  They got that work 
Dont it smell so good
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest they up to no good
And come through flossin they wish yall would
Sleepy Brown 
I gotta big weed stash pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky
Sticky icky icky icky
System on blast cops just passed
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Sticky icky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip
Get rid of evidence move that brick
Keep a DEagle with an extra clip
Think it aint so  SUCK A DICK 
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just aint strapped
How you gon act like I dont push Lacs
Black ElDorado fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger trigger man Luda dont squeeze
With a mac with a Glock Imma make em say please
In the back on the block so the cops say freeze
And Im so high I think I got a nose bleed  You got a nose bleed 
Dont it smell so sweet
In Decatur where we pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night creep creep
Ill see you later when we in them streets
Sleepy Brown 
I gotta big weed stash pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky
Sticky icky icky icky
System on blast cops just passed
Just seen a big ol ass  Its Saturday 
Sticky icky icky  OoohOooh 
Sticky icky icky icky  OoohOooh
