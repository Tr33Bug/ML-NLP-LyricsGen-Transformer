Hey before I eat an MC I say my grace
Leave you dead without a trace
Got a problem with me Say it to my face  to my face 
To my face  to my face  To my face  to my face 
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place
Didnt your bosses ever tell you niggas you could be replaced
To the fans yous a disgrace
Got a problem with me say it to my face to my face 
To my face  to my face  To my face  to my face 
Put a pussy ass nigga all in his place
Got a chopper kinda like a helicopter
For any nigga that thinks its sweet
And you better call the doctor have you shakin like a maraca
Drippin like this beat blood spillin like a faulty faucet
Plug his ass before you end up in a hearse
Put the gear in reverse then you better hit the fucking
Gas tires screech
You broke n now you bitter
But how the hell is a nigga gonna start beef with me
On his fucking twitter  for real 
You know where I be
You know where I stay I aint that hard to find
All up on my D when the DTP boy
You sweeter than a valen tine
How can you call yourself a man boy  man boy 
Yous Ludacris number one fan boy  fan boy 
Then you left and youre gone goodbye lazy
I dont miss you
Then you signed to a nigga who signed to a nigga
Who signed to another nigga  what the fuck 
Smart move boy you dumb as hell
You should take your soul and have a end of the summer sale
But all your records are my theme song  why 
Cuz Im still shopping off your ringtone


Hey before I eat an MC I say my grace

Niggas thinkin this a game til them shots hit his body
Bend his ass like limbo

Nigga like what you say
Catch you night time and then brighten your day
Shots at your head they dont like what you say
Coroners comin ta wipe you away
Think you a G get hit right with the K
Wherever you standing thats right where you lay  blah 
Yall niggas run yall mouth just like a bunch of bitches
Pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches
Lord be my witness I ask for forgiveness
But if these pussy niggas keep runnin they mouth
Imma give them the business
Heard you pussy ass niggas talkin bout me
When Im not around
Told another nigga so he told another nigga
And it got around  got around 
So I told the other nigga
Go tell the other nigga move outta town  outta town 
Cuz my dawg playin hardball with the sawn off
Like you out of bounds BOOM
