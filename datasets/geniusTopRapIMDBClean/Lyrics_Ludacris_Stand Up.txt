How you aint gon fuck Bitch Im me
Im the goddamn reason you in VIP
CEO you dont have to see ID
Im young wild and strapped like ChiAli
BLAOW we aint got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking smelling feeling like a million bucks ahh
Pass the bottles the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech  Chong
Whats wrong The club and the moon is full
And Im looking for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

Go on with your big ass let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
Im lit and I dont care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks
My people outside and they cant get in
We gon rush the back door  break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right some looking a mess
Thats why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh come on we gon party tonight
Yall use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Dont be scared show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system the harder the fight
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
Hell yeah hey DJ bring that back
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that

Damn right the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow aint promised today
Work with me lets become one with the beat
And dont worry about me stepping all over your feet
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
Hell yeah hey DJ bring that back
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
When I move you move just like that
