Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Two step and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion

Man Im like a needle in a haystack so face that
Go back to the drawing board connect dots but cant trace that
Matter fact erase that cause on this great track
Get your face slapped and Im straight so dont take that
Try somethin different and shit so listen and shit
Speakin about what hiphop is missin and shit
Im about to fill a void Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta tote hammer since I was a little boy
Aint nobody like me so they wanna bite me
Fight me step to me now but it aint likely
People swear they sight me just cause hes lightskinned
With braids in his hair dont mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right livin in the limelight
So picture what theyll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Bar bar hardyhar
Tell yo momma Im a ghetto superstar
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Twostep and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Two step and lay back still wilin shit

Only standin five eight but still a big shot plus I got a big
Clean everyday stay fresher than whats in a Ziploc
Tell your man to kick rocks when I make my pitstops
Im in then its hard to get me out like Im a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer but Id like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man and Im sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
Bigger booty small waist put em in a small place
And if it aint no ass where Im at then Im in the wrong place
Bail like a bondsman but keep em dancin
Got pop potential stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car
Tell yo momma Im a ghetto superstar
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Twostep and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Two step and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
And jump down turn around pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy pick a bale of hay
Jump down turn around pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy pick a bale of hay
Still working like a slave learning tricks of the trade
In a ghetto state of mind say Im rich and Im paid
Pickin records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till Im spoiled and Im rotten in a sinister way
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
Either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
Digest that and theres really nothin missin to say but
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Twostep and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil buddy what you want Some violent shit
Two step and lay back still wilin shit
Whattup Hey baby I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
