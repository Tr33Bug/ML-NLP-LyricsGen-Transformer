Back to put rappers on one knee like they bout to run 100 meter dash
Bow down to greatness

Women on my nuts like Where the Titanic go

With million dollar whips that I ship from overseas
Got a pocket full of Gs  and the inconvenient truth
Is that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin all the trees
The globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt
And put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts
What you want from me  what  I got pistols for the haters
Your famll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders
And your music isnt favored  and DJs they NEVER bring it back
Like when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors
Like a cup full of sugar a rope full of salt
The name of my car insurance is YO FUCKIN FAULT

And have you stripped of yo metals like Marion Jones nigga

So put ya fist up  even the Statue of Liberty
Lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up
You cant compete with me  I got em stuck
Like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me
And then I broke free  Ill let em loose
When Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drugfree
Im the baddest mothershutit like Shaft was
Leavin rappers with headaches like bad drugs

By the Heat but ehh well just say we Alonzo Mournd ya
So call the coroner  hey
