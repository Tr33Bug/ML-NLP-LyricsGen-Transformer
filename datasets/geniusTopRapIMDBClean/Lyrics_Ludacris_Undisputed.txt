Whats up Luda
Its your trainer Money Mayweather
Tell them other MCs to put their motherfuckin mics down
Cause you the truth its round one
Dedication hard work prayers and belief
And a good team ding ding
Yeah back up on that ass  yeah 
Back to put rappers on one knee like they bout to run 100 meter dash
Bow down to greatness
Before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers
Covered all my bases straight no chasers
Diamonds on my chain look like my necks full of glaciers
Titanic flow  what  Titanic dough  what 
Women on my nuts like Where the Titanic go
I been scourin the Earth  yeah 
Makin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church
And the fat ladys singin  its over for you rappers

And I got the women screamin  AHHH 
They could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my names Willie Beamen
Or LL Cool  so if your boyfriend
Thinks you loyal to his ass then hes a motherfuckin fool
Got jewels on my pinky jewels on my wrist  hey 
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris
Bitch please You messin with some real OGs
With million dollar whips that I ship from overseas
Got a pocket full of Gs  and the inconvenient truth
Is that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin all the trees
The globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt
And put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts
What you want from me  what  I got pistols for the haters
Your famll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders
And your music isnt favored  and DJs they NEVER bring it back
Like when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors
Like a cup full of sugar a rope full of salt
The name of my car insurance is YO FUCKIN FAULT
And if you sittin on chrome  Ill call up my boys
And have you stripped of yo metals like Marion Jones nigga
Ludacris

Barrel stay hotter than
A fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits
Atisket atasket a custommade casket

And acrobatics Im superstar status
The mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards
The international traveler
And I may not be much to you but Im the SHIT out in Africa
So put ya fist up  even the Statue of Liberty
Lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up
You cant compete with me  I got em stuck
Like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me
And then I broke free  Ill let em loose
When Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drugfree
Im the baddest mothershutit like Shaft was
Leavin rappers with headaches like bad drugs
They shoulda warned ya  you got defeated
By the Heat but ehh well just say we Alonzo Mournd ya
So call the coroner  hey 
Ill show up to yo funeral with some gators like Im FRESH outta Florida
Call me The Swamp Thang  yall headed in the wrong direction
Like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train
So dont fuck with it  Im sendin lyrical bullets
Right at yo dome fuck niggas better duck with it  duck wit it 
Or else you stuck with it  youll get stomped so bad
Youll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Bucks did it
