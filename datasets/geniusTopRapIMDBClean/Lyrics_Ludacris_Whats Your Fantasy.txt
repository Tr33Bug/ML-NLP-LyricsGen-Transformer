I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the VIP
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top lick it dont stop
Keep the door locked dont knock while the boat rock
We gobots and robots so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man named Ludacris  woo  in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it loverlover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast em and I passed em
Get a tight grip and I grasp em
I flash em and outlast em
And if it aint good then I trash em
While you stash em Ill let em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy


I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit you give it up til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
Cause you know it got sold out
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream you cant hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when its hot or when its cold out
How about in the library on top of books
But you cant be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
Whats my name whats my name whats my name
A sauna jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruit sweep your woman right off her feet
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
Thats the way you like to fuck
Clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown thats the way that I like it twerk
Legs jerk overworked
Underpaid but dont be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories or one hundred spokes
What about up in the candy store
That chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help Play my game
Dracula man Ill get my fangs
Horseback and Ill get my reins
School teacher let me get my brains
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
I wanna lilililick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo
Then I wanna Ahh ahh you make it so good I dont wanna leave
But I gotta knknknknow whatwhats your fantatasy
