And for your homies talkin fly slicks
If we was locked up together Id have made em MY Trick
Cause I know yall pranksters
Yall suckas still Fakin Like Gangsters Rough Time
Its about time for me to tear the roof off the mother
I grab the gat to make you all Your Punk run for cover
You can fool a groupie but you cant fool a gangsta
1985 you used to be a prankster
Down with Alonzo and the World Wreckin Cru
Turnin off the lights and dressin like women too
Everybody on Death Row must be a joke
I put a level to the chair and watch you punks smoke
Real Gangstas dont follow punks down here
I guess your Boy Snoopie Dogg must be a queer
So who the hell you gonna blast here in Miami
Step with me and Ill kill your whole family
And I do mean ho you think Im playin son
I got my Glock to your head now where you gonna run
Before you diss my homie Luke you better think twice
Ill pull a trigger Punk and turn off your life

When you was sittin on them album covers you Singin  Back In The day Now  with the Lip gloss and them sequins outfits on With Sweet Perfume Yo Dre you know what I want you to do for me
Right now music stops
Take off that gstring baby
And you gon be my girl  maybe 
Yo Mike Fresh lets just take these Suckas beat
The opening of the instrumental track from Dre Day
Yeah Suckas this is how we do we take Suckas beat
Yo better yet I Wanna hear On It

Yo Mike Fresh Bring That Back To The Real Gangstas Beats
The Cowards track comes back on
