Yo this is a record about stars fakin like gangstas
Gangstas trying to be stars
Stars wanting to be ganstas but they really pranksters
So I had to get my man JT cause we the only true two excons on staff
And so we could kick it to you straight and not fake
Aiyyo JT kick it
Picture a nigga as raw as me the motherfuckin J to the T
Tired of niggas saying how bad they are
Fronting like ganstas but I call them Gangstars
Stars that want to be gangsters
But Im from the real side not like Jeckyll and Hyde
Bad boys on stage fuck niggas on the street
You see that aint me
Example  niggas go to concerts fucked up
The next thing you know the niggas gettin chumped up
And they dont look so tough to me
I guess niggas aint the same on and off TV
But not me I grab the mike and shoot game
And on the streets its the same motherfucking thang
See I pop no bullshit
If you offended wear it if the motherfucking shoe fits
But dont have two left feet
Fuck around get your ass split to the white meat
Cause yall aint nothing but pranksters
Fuck niggas be faking like gangstas
I cant stand a nigga talking about being a gangsta
Nigga aint nothing but a motherfuckin pranksta
Nigga aint never been to jail
Nigga aint never put a cap in a nigga
Nigga just talking about dropping a nigga
Cause he saw another nigga drop a nigga on TV
Aye yo JT kick example 2
Example two the neighborhood chump
Andy Gump came across a sawed off pump
I guess the niggas now longer a punk
Cause now he talks shit and quick to pop the trunk
Young nigga turned bad over night
Maybe that dumb shit got his ass hype
Walking around with a unit in the place
Hanging with the big boys smoking lace
But his wall aint up to date
And I hate fuck niggas who perpetrate
Like niggas makin love songs first
Next time you see em all they do is curse
Talkin bout all the niggas they killed
First they was lovers now they trying be real
And for the other nigga talkin thisandthat
About kids hearin all this on the rap
And for the ones talking bout the white man
Ever told your fans whos your boss man
I guess that makes yall prankstas
Fuck niggas be fakin like gangstas


Fuck niggas you got me worried yes you got a nigga worried
Because first of all yall talkin this black shit black this black that
The whitemans still collecting yall money
You aint told yo motherfucking fans that huh
Its a whole different tale about niggas who getting it like this
Real niggas Faking like gangstas
Real niggas Faking like gangstas
You guys know who Im talking toOhhh  NWA 
None of them fuck niggas ever did time
But while its on my mind
We got up 4 in the morning for cold eggs and grits
Jim Jones and doodoo on a stick
Niggas had to eat this shit everyday
And one nigga got shanked over a tray
And you gotta have your set up to date
While niggas be scrapping for a place
And nobody snitches
Cause snitches get stiches for talking like bitches
They wouldnt last cause they prankstas
Cunt niggas faking like gangstas
