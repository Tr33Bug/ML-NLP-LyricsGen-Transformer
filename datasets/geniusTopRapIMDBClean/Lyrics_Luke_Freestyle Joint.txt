Verse 1  Clayvosie
Vosie gettin busy in motherfuckin 93
Freakin all the hoes and gettin plenty pussy
So when it comes to hoes you call me Mr Peepin Tom
When youre home alone you might wanna gimme some
Then here I go creepin in your window
Bend that ass over and Ima fuck you like a dirty hoe
You know Im pimpin all hoes in the 90s
The only place I want a bitch to stand is behind me
Cause Im cool like that with my bigass gat
And my sawedoff pump in the back
For any nigga with beef in their fuckin teeth
Wanna be like a player but you cant compete
So I be fuckin hoes and fuckin up niggas
And still gettin paid so watch me get bigger
Brand new on the scene with my nigga Luke
From the bottom niggas so what you wanna do
Chorus 4x 
Verse 2  Fresh Kid Ice
Out of Chinatown bitches on the dick
And Im just rappin to a Kid Ice flick
From a plate of rice to a pot of gumbo
Ill eat ya ass up cause its time to rumble
Cause your bitch is on the dick cause of who I am
The Fresh Kid Ice the Chinaman
Comin from the bottom straight to the top
Comin clean and housin your spot
Hoes they love me cause they say Im crazy
Since Im runnin round town pluckin them daisies
Whip ya whole ass when I fuck her
Cause Id rather a bitch wholl kneel down and pucker
Luke put me down and I come off
Since I fucked your hoe Ima piss you off
Fuck with Chinaman and you die
When my black bag open gunshots run wild

Chorus

Once again Im here to buck the fate talk game
Magazines get picked like shirt to bloodstains
