Pussy Ass Kid and Hoe Ass Play  Payback is a Mutha Fucker   Lyrics
Yo its a fuckedup thing
I gotta bring Kid N Play on this motherfuckin album here
Two pussy punkass niggas
Yo check this out what Imma do
Is Imma go get last years rookie of the year
JT Money of Poison Clan
This years rookie of the year Bustdown
Yo Bustdown kick some of that West Bank shit on these fuck niggas
Well Im first up as a rhyme conveyor
Luke Records in the house for the payback player
Kid N Play can suck a dick
Get me a mic and a 40 and let a real nigga wreck shit
To me youre walking on a tightrope
Instead of tryin to be real youre steady sweatin them white folks
Keep runnin your big mouth
But if you come to my hood youll get your asshole ripped out
Then Imma play you to the back seat
Cause Im runnin more game than a track meet athlete
As if you didnt know huh
Youre dealing with a West Bank dicksman ho
But anyway I got a rhyme to deliver
Get your draws out your ass quit frontin my nigga
Cause if you dont well youll keep gettin dissed on
And if I see you at a show and youre slippin
Youre gettin pissed on
What about Kid N Play
Wickwickwack 
Now for starters with kids I dont play
Cause yall some fuckass punkass coochie niggas anyway
JT I the house niggas check it
Tryin to diss my nigga Luke to sell your wack record
Let me talk about the Kid
I remember some ol coochienigga shit you did
When we was up in New York
You was followin Luke talkin bout We gotta talk
On that mans dick
Got your ass wide open and youre talkin that bullshit
Both movies I boo em
Cause you had hoes but you wasnt stickin pipe to em
Thought they was fantastic
But through the whole fuckin movie Kid was gettin his ass kicked
And bout that other nigga Play
He needs to get dissed cause hes a punk nigga anyway
Be round here kissin hoes while Im dissin hoes
And stabbin em with fishin poles
You need to try to lay pipe in em
Oh I forgot  punks dont like women
Got the nerve to try and diss somebody
At Jack the Rapper you was hangin round Lukes party
Now youre outta gas
With two motherfuckin punkhaters on yo ass
JT and Bustdown
Now lets see you ho niggas get tough now
Get the rubbers out your ass dicksuckers
And fuck them pussy motherfuckers
What about Kid N Play
Wickwickwack 
Now let me put my boy Kid in his place
With them wickwack rhymes soundin like Rob Base
Cause if I have to come tag that ass
Imma max wax tax and drag that ass
I get sharp like a ice pick
Im on a hype tip hold the mic tight as a vice grip
You couldnt deal with the concept
Im collected and calm but on the mike Im a bomb threat
So motherfuckers get real
I got a heart like gold and a dick like steel
You wanna diss punk Please
You got a flat top thicker than commodity cheese
Luke left it up to me and JT
To take it from the bottom to the TOP
I saw your second House Party it figures
Two house parties for two houseass niggas
Two house motherfuckin niggas
Do yall niggas know what a house nigga is
A house nigga is a nigga who works in the house
Who cleans the masters ass who cleans behind the master
Who wash the masters ass
Yall house niggas Im a field niggas
We field niggas here in Miami
Thats why yall niggas cant understand us
Yall fuckniggas talkin too much shit
Yall niggas better watch what you sayin
Cause yall fuck niggas yall dont know
Yall get fucked up here Yo check this out
Miami is closed to yall niggas Yall barred
Yall cant come here no more fuckniggas
Yall cant sell no more records here
And if all real niggas in the world is real like us
Yall dont buy them fuckniggas shit no more
Cause they aint shit pussy punk fuck niggas
