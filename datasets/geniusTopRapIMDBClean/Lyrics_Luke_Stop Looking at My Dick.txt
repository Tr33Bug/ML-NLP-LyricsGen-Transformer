Uncle Red
Haha!
Uncle Luke
Uncle Luke
Uncle Luke
Boy, I tell you, boy- see, that’s why I don’t like to show my dick. Because when I show my dick, everybody just goes to panicking!
 Is my dick small? Hmm?
 Every time I see Luke he trying to get somebody to suck his dick
 Is my dick small?
 Every time I see him
 Last time I saw him…
 Is my dick- my dick small? Huh?
 No, the dick is not small-
 Ok, Thank you
 Luke does not have a small dick. The dick is- nice
 Ok- good I’ll take that
 It’s nice
 I’ll accept that can you run the track “The dick is nice”
