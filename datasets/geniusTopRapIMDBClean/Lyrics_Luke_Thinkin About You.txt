 hook 
Im thinking about you all the time
Thats why I made this rhyme
You always be in my mind
And I know thats fine
We can go any where you wanna go
I dont even know
Too escape  this snow
We will take a flight to Morocco
I really sware
I think about you anyware
I dont really care
I think your really rare
I think your the only one for me
I think you really key
When im with you I feel so free
I can be what ever you need
I know thats fine
I know thats cool
We could just hit my house at the pool
We could read a book
We could just chill
Thats what im tryna do
Im flying you across the world
Thats where im goin
Thats where im flowin
You already know it
Im just trna get it
You already did it
No you wanna know where im at
Im a legend on the map
hook 
Im thinking about you all the time
Thats why I made this rhyme
You always be in my mind
And I know thats fine

Just you and me
We can be so free
Maybey even beyond the sea
Aye
Thinkin about you every night
I dont wanna fight
We could just go
We could just live
We could just take a flight
We can go to mexico
Party where the lights are low
You already know
I got lots of hope
Fly away on
A tidal wave
I dont know where we gunna fly today
I dont know where the hell we gunna go
Its ok when you with me
