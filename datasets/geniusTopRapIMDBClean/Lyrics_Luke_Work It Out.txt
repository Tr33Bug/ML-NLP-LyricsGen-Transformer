Aint enough hours in the day
It sure does feel like all work and no play
Honey I know that the grass aint mown
The car aint washed and the leaves aint blown
Im a get it just soon as I can
Lord its hard to be an everyday man
But darlin if youre willin when I get home
Ill put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can
Work it out
Why dont we start right now
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl its gonna be workin
Lets work it out
This ole world is so tough
Sometimes I think that I had enough
Back still hurtin bills keep comin
Boss still yellin truck quit runnin
Aint no tellin whatd happen next
Try not to break while I drive and text
But darlin if youre willin when I get home
Ill put the kids to bed and get you all alone
And we can
Work it out
Why dont we start right now
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl its gonna be workin
Lets work it out
Baby its true all I need is you
Just unplug the phone
Let me get you all alone
And work it out
Why dont we start right now
Whatever gets you next to me
No doubt girl its gonna be workin
Ill put the kids to bed  We gotta work it
Well unplug the phone  Baby work it
Come on baby  Lets work it out
Let me get ya all alone
