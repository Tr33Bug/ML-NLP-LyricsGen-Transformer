You Dont Know
You dont know me
I change every night
She leaves me dont want to fight
My diamonds in the sun they shine bright
You dont know me
All the other rappers like baloney
They really fucking phony
Abs like iron like my name is tony
Yeah she bad
Yeah she fine
Already  know that  Im doing alright
Stacking up this paper like my name is Dwight
You dont know me
I change every night
She leaves me dont want to fight
My diamonds in the sun they shine bright
Im balling on th court
Like Wii sports
Yeah the countr is quartz
Double g on my shorts
We could go to Montego bay
Or we could go anyway
Candlelit dinner
Blood is thinner
No limit on the card
She thought it was a golf course that was my yard
You Dont know me
I got my g ducky
Pull up on you with a bucky
1 percent must be lucky

You dont know me
I change every night
She leaves me dont want to fight
My diamonds in the sun they shine bright
Every bag I spend I make it back
Made about 40 racks
My tv looking like Imax
Every bar I spit is a fax
Dont know me but she on my pickle
Got a billion nickels
Pull up with a sickle
You know I got the bag
In my PJ getting jet lag
Got an extended mag
