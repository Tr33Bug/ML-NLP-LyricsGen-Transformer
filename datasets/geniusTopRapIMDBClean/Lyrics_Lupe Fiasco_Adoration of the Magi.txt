Youre so smart youre like a contemporary museum of art
That farts thats harsh narcissism on narcotics
On sharp objects in large pockets
At dark you aint gotta hide it keep it Metal Gear Solid
Lead the leaders thats how you file it then clobber it
Low on energy find peach cobbler then gobble it yeah
Its food in them drums and boxes
If you beat em up then theyll drop it
And theyll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens til they isnt here
And thats da da da da da da da da da da
Just to be back in reincarnated exact twin
Exact ten exact twelve
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  Exact self 
Do I really gotta say it Didnt we all play it
Dojo Abobo over shoulder throw polo
Billy Jimmy even on the low low
Why you ready to die You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky you just a baby
Quit chasing money never mind you just a baby
These Magi adore you Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets You just a baby
Now lets vogue  Vogue  mountain pose  Pose

Lets try it again with clothes and closer enclosure exposures
Quiet is kept like Rosicrucian meet Cosa Nostras on Oprahs sofa
With both controllers watchin Gazans and Ashkenazis ride roller coasters
Say yeah yeah lots of options now up is down two player
Now A is jump and B is punch you seein somethin that wasnt there
To find friendliness in a nemesis its a old test
Three buttons see somethin thats emphasis on Genesis oh yeah
Why you ready to die You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky you just a baby
Quit chasing money never mind you just a baby
These Magi adore you Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets You just a baby
Cant be eyes closed when you side scroll
You not the first person
The first person from your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version
That refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse whos really me
In the third person but prefers the first one
Thats me again
Master cleanse in a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers
Even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss
Meet it with a swing its so south yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club watching the women just do them handstands
Like you a mans man
Thats washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers
Shes two weeks pregnant
Didnt even know hes dancing with her damn
Why you ready to die You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky you just a baby
Quit chasing money never mind you just a baby
These Magi adore you Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets You just a baby
