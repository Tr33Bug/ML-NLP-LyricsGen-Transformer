Sometimes you just gotta
Go
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh and we aint get exploited
White man aint fear it so he did not destroy it
We aint work for free see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by WEB Du Bois
Were no reconstructions civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill OReilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh and it aint no projects
Keepin it real is not an understood concept
Yeah complexions not a contest
Cause racism has no context
Hiphop aint got a section called Conscious
Everybody rappin like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him
And thats what really rose up out of Michigan
The sounding white rapper by the name of 50 Cent
Hah 
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
Uh and I know its just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why cant it be
Now we cant do nothing about the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we cant see between
We just close our eyes til its all black everything
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything
All black everything
Yeah
All black everything
Yeah
