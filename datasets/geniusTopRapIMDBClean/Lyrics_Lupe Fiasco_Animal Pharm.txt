Quiet as a kitten
Reply as silent as a Raphaelgiven instrument for stickin
Or maybe riot as a lion
Would he tie in tiger for attention
Tiggers and Poohs niggas and jews
Mr Opulent Christopher Robinson too
Reversal like
When that predetermined term expires on a turtles knife
What of Korea are you scared
Or is something not there like a Welsh rabbit full of hares
Animal farms and imaginary bears
The body is a house like a kangaroo pouch
Or an oysterhoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky
Platoons of coons stand ready for the driveby
Steady as the medley booms from the Akai
Affirm as in Aye aye
Like it the second
Like a junior like a third like a eye
Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy
Who let these Gs out the PISTY
Seems they taking cues from The Wire
Okay decorum and keeping you from wanting to buy it
But you still buy it like you never left its sight
And like a slow gunfighter gun unfired
Cow dung walls hermit crabs in the mall sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws
These are
Hey hey just cause I got thumbs that dont mean everybody is dumb huh huh
Just cause I got one that dont mean that they not dumb what what
Quiet as a mouse in the House of God
In the jaws like tyrants in the mouths of mobs
Ripping it to pieces like a picture and a preacher
If a cricket was a speaker its its own chicken bones on the garbage can top
Ugly mother freakers is predator opposite on top of it to make it fox
So if similar appeal administer the seal to make it real
Elephantine but never mind
Halfton gorillas in a midst theyll never find
Hungry as a hippopotamus gobble it til your bottom and your body is as wobbly as Skrillex
Eeyores and Piglets blind bats nailing tails to a riblet
Time only limited ed  if you make it
Blind rats nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves
Out is out so they only seeing thy shells
Ghost Dog
Oh lawd
These are
Hey they not dumb
I aint smart just cause I got thumbs what say what
Hey hey just cause I got one
That dont mean Im better cause they got none say what say what say what
The butcher says to the bovines
Youre all just pastrami when its showtime
Cowboy cosigns attack the cat samples
Own worst enemies
Chop down the trees we need the axe handles
Like a heel in a sandal saying hell no
Or you trapped like the yells of a nail in the shelltoe
Clever as a fishbowl on a sailboat
Landlocked as a ham hock on a railroad
Sandbox by the swimming pool
Two times as clever as a fishing school
Pills for the pressure
Broken seals on the pills for the pleasure
If you feeling ill whatever
Animal farm youre all dumb
Tickle em with your articulated thumb
A tapeworm will never play the drums but um
These are
These are
Hey hey just cause I got one
That dont mean Im smart cause they got none
Wwhat wwhat
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs
That dont make me smart cause they got none say what
Wwhat wwhat
Here we come
Am I not an animal cause I got thumbs say what
Say what say what
