God is great
Ghettos America US to the izzay
Killa in the citywide sprizzay
Where theres sunshine in the shizzade
Judge wont pull him out the pen like a grenade
For acting out their fears like a charade
Til they blacking out their tears like its lights out
Bring em out the black like a lighthouse
And wave to em before they wiped out
Lifesaver threw em hope they catch it
But its so Titanic to be iced out
Thats just scratching the surface like Triple Axels
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles
In addition to the chain
Thats just to take the attention from the pain
Or is it the mission of the man
Audubon Ballroom Motel Lorraine
Now white people you cant say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people were not niggas
Cause God made us better than that
No break all wake
Little mayhem for your AllState nay ham all steak
Get a good ball great like a golf grade
Make the ball break
Just one swing no putting
Thats how I try n does things always
Especially when your past is
Martin Baldwin Audubon Ballroom
Turn the glass ceiling to a glass floor
Make a trampoline out of trapdoor
On that gasoline when I was back poor
Loudly crafted out my dream underneath a tap floor
Backpack battlecat underground rap lore
Anonymous but dominant  whats a Mac to a hacker
In other words we lyrical Zuckerbergs
Pimp you may move a mouse but whats a rat to a cat store
Its like a gig to an app store
I rap Black history you can only see my past if you fast forward


Now white people you cant say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people were not niggas
Cause God made us better than that
Black Panthers black anthems black blues
With black answers for black stanzas Langston Hughes
Breaking rules aint it cool
Took it old and made it new
Black painters musical black anger
Black mothers beautiful black anchors
So lets hear it for em Lets hear it for em
Lets hear it for em Lets hear it for em
Black America Trap America
80s Babies Crack America
Rap America Bad as Erykah
From the era of family tearing up
But we just won big cant be undid
Form a whole culture in just one kid
Miami dope boys Oakland militants
Harlem Renaissance its our deliverance
Now white people you cant say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people were not niggas
Cause God made us better than that
