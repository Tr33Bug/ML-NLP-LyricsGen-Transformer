Beautiful Lasers  2 Ways  Lyrics
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Youre way too late youll be trapped here
Forever
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Ones through the door
The others through me
Ugh sometimes living in a world like this
Its pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you dont comply
Pretty easy if you dont complain
Stand there like you dont feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend til the end that you dont fear change
Dont admit that your faith is weak
Dont say that you feel like dying
Lifes hard and it feels like diamonds
Your homes just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Cant understand what Im saying
Cant figure out what Im implying
If you feel you dont wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
Im on the dark side
And you cant come find him
How when its light all around you
Yeah but its dark all inside him
No winners when its me against me
One of us just aint gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Youre way too late youll be trapped here
Forever
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Ones through the door
The others through me
This world is such a fucked up place
My minds such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe whats up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things yeah you really like summer
You really like music you really like reading
Love I cant win if its me against me
One of us aint gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Youre way too late youll be trapped here
Forever
Theres only two ways out
Of here
Ones through the door
The others through me
