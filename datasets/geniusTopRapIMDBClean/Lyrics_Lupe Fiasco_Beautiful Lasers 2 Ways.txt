Beautiful Lasers (2 Ways) Lyrics
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

Ugh, sometimes, living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend 'til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard, and it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying?
Can't figure out what I'm implying?
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How, when it's light all around you?
Yeah, but it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Your's been the one keepin' me alive
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

This world is such a fucked up place
My mind's such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well, all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yeah, you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive

There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me18Embed
