Yeah I say bitch bad
Woman good lady better
Hey hey hey hey
Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
Now I aint trying to make it too complex
But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch
Somethin thats far above average
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin here
First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama comma
And because shes relatin to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
Uh tell em bitch bad
Woman good lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood
Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches
Now lets say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
Reality check Im not trippin
They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
I say I say I say I say I say I say
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using bitch as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
Sho enough in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house hot mess like that
Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him bitch dont play a part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre
Tell em bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
I say I say I say I say I say I say
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Youre misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better greatest motherhood
Im killin these bitches
