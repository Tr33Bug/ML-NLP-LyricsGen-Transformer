From the floating death to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands
Take time to learn me like courtappointed attorneys
Restore the order we either join or adjourning
Less you join Im up performing the journey
In all earnest I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight I aint late on states
Im just sternly stating
How what I do with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My returnings like Blockbuster with a tape
And I aint kind but I dont hit
So you starting at the end thats the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying Boy youre a jerk
But its cool though know we gotta rule yo
Get it in then we win and do it all again ho
From the floating death to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands
And it really means Im number one and youre a fan
Well thats cool cause I think youre number one too
Yeah thats cool cause I think youre number one too
Yeah thats cool cause I think youre number one
Now me and words we made a deal that Im gon keep em real
And they show me their secrets I can even cop a feel
Victorious
Cant match wit with warriors
I match wig with wits
Similarly cant mix matchsticks with forests
Only you can prevent what I do
Only dew can prevent whats my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames nigga get in the gang ahh
From the floating death to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands
And it really means Im number one and youre a fan
Well thats cool cause I think youre number one too
Yeah thats cool cause I think youre number one too yeah
Well thats for me heh yeah I think youre number one too
Its road rage without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like No way but Im a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox molding
Go ahead
Dont stop go ahead
Sitting in your car just listening to the bars
And theres traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that Im spewing out enough to calm it down
Fore you know youre out your car with your briefcase walkin round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas  yeah 
So dont start that walk through Echo Park
When lifes a oneonone and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan
From the floating death to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands
And it really means Im number one and youre a fan
Well thats cool cause I think youre number one too
Yeah thats cool cause I think youre number one too yeah
Well thats for me heh cause I think youre number one too
Yeah I think youre number one too
