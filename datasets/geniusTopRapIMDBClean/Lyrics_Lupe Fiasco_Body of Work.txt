Body of Work Lyrics
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

(I've always loved you)
Uhh, quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He revolved, jumped the wall of the fort with the horses
This was foretold, Bojangles was tappin' in Morse code
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold
(All of you)
From the guts of the mother
Campbell should move her undercover
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill, she done
(they will never love you)
Pills celebrating, "We won"
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
(None of you)
Cocaine and new high tech ways, smuggle whole things
(I've always loved you)
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
(All of you)
To park 84' Jags on gold chains
Developing nicks from a whole name
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)

(Tell me what to do)
Limo to the limit, fill it 'til the brim get in it
You can't get it, if you gotta ask
(Make me pretty) In that case I want two masks
Bottom class, dollar cast, poppin' tags, droppin' trash
In shopping bags 'til Akeem take our pocket cash
(Am I beautiful?)
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights (trust me)
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva, viva la coup!
(Love you) If the government get it, I'm a fool
You might also like
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)

Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book
Don't leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night, am I black, am I light?
Have I been this?
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks, motherfucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
(Will you cry for me?)
Sky burial, let the wind carry you, farther
Than I could (live forever)
An anatomy, not of me, knotting me to it, nodding me to it
Eyes of the I and others, watching me do it
Adapt in each rubric
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones, skulls to the top of tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
You're so thin you see the sins through it
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)
