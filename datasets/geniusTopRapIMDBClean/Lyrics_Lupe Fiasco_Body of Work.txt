Closet full of bones just dont try to put em back together
Try to put em back together 
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
Wear it like a scarlet letter 
Ive always loved you 
Uhh quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He revolved jumped the wall of the fort with the horses
This was foretold Bojangles was tappin in Morse code
At least to the mad man genius tap top secrets and more gold
All of you 
From the guts of the mother
Campbell should move her undercover
With a 3000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill she done
they will never love you 
Pills celebrating We won
In the system of the women never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
None of you 
Cocaine and new high tech ways smuggle whole things
Ive always loved you 
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
All of you 
To park 84 Jags on gold chains
Developing nicks from a whole name
God is great but its snakes on my soul plane
Closet full of bones just dont try to put em back together
Try to put em back together 
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
Wear it like a scarlet letter 
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin  thats just my anatomy
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin 
Tell me what to do 
Limo to the limit fill it til the brim get in it
You cant get it if you gotta ask
Make me pretty  In that case I want two masks
Bottom class dollar cast poppin tags droppin trash
In shopping bags til Akeem take our pocket cash
Am I beautiful 
Write it in lights molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights  trust me 
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva viva la coup
Love you  If the government get it Im a fool
Closet full of bones just dont try to put em back together
Try to put em back together 
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
Wear it like a scarlet letter 
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin  thats just my anatomy
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin 
Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book
Dont leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet to bet to bed to death flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night am I black am I light
Have I been this
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks motherfucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
Will you cry for me 
Sky burial let the wind carry you farther
Than I could  live forever 
An anatomy not of me knotting me to it nodding me to it
Eyes of the I and others watching me do it
Adapt in each rubric
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones skulls to the top of tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
Youre so thin you see the sins through it
Closet full of bones just dont try to put em back together
Try to put em back together 
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
Wear it like a scarlet letter 
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin  thats just my anatomy
Anatomy  skin  will be the death of me
Anatomy  skin
