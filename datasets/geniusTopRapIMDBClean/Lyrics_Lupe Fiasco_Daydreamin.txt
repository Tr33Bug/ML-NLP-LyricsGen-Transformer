Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
As I spy from behind my giant robots eyes
I keep him happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot cause I cant drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they cant ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders but thats way too high
Lets try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now theres hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
Theres crooked police thats stationed at the knees
And they do drivebys like up and down the thighs
And theres a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest Im sitting in my room
As Im looking out the face something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House
Just a
Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day


Now come on everybody lets make cocaine cool
We need a few more halfnaked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC10 thats all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s
And wheres the champagne We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain slowmotion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the babys sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tiptoe round creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldnt see had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But Id like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
I was
Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
What a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
Daydream
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day
