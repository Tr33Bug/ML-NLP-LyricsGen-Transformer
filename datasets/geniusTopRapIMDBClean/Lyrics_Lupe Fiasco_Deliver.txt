Deliver Lyrics
(Pow)
30-something shots from the ghetto gun
All in the ears of the ghetto young
Some ghetto girls, some ghetto sons
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wondered where the ghetto from
Cause I'm from the ghetto, the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won
That's how they do the ghetto, that's how the ghetto done
They keep it, they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick, make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick, make the ghetto dumb
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems get ghetto sums
That's why the...
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

Is it cause they're selling nicks out there all day
Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway
Little Caesar's never sending pizza out y'all way
Papa Johns never get delivered where y'all stayed
The ghetto was a physical manifestation
Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your  place is the basement
White people in the attic
Niggas selling dope, White people is the addicts
White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic
All that dope to China, you don't call that trappin'?
Breaking Bad, learned that from a TV
So don't say it's politics when you see me
When you gon' apologize for your CD
Nigga, that don't match red and black to a GD

Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more
Deliver, deliver, deliver

Yeah, uh, can I get delivered from the sin?
Get a little slice of Heaven, I can enter in again
Or maybe just imagine that I'm living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and then make it into friends
You don't even need a salad, that don't make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
That's a deep dish, Chicago town, get the peace stick
Home run hitter, I be drilling on the weak pitch
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face
I'm a man, never biting on the hands that I eat with, yeah
No Giordano or DiGiorno
Homemade Bull City bring it to him like a toro
Throwing dough up in the air-bottom to the top and shredder
Full of cheese smarter than a purple ninja turtle, nigga
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too much dope, too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed, niggas don't wanna starve
But "Niggas ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
Pizza man don't come here no more (here no more)
Deliver, deliver, deliver

So sad cause the pizza man don't fuck wit us no more
No, no, no, no, no, no81Embed
