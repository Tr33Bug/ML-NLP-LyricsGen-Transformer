Pow 
30something shots from the ghetto gun
All in the ears of the ghetto young
Some ghetto girls some ghetto sons
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wondered where the ghetto from
Cause Im from the ghetto the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose that mean a ghetto won
Thats how they do the ghetto thats how the ghetto done
They keep it they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick make the ghetto dumb
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems get ghetto sums
Thats why the
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too much dope too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man dont approach  no no no 
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too many niggas on the block too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man dont stop  pow pow pow 
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed niggas dont wanna starve
But Niggas aint got no jobs blah blah blah
Pizza man dont come here no more
Deliver deliver deliver
Is it cause theyre selling nicks out there all day
Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway
Little Caesars never sending pizza out yall way
Papa Johns never get delivered where yall stayed
The ghetto was a physical manifestation
Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your  place is the basement
White people in the attic
Niggas selling dope White people is the addicts
White folks act like they aint show us how to traffic
All that dope to China you dont call that trappin
Breaking Bad learned that from a TV
So dont say its politics when you see me
When you gon apologize for your CD
Nigga that dont match red and black to a GD
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too much dope too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man dont approach  no no no 
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too many niggas on the block too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man dont stop  pow pow pow 
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too many niggas getting robbed niggas dont wanna starve
But Niggas aint got no jobs blah blah blah
Pizza man dont come here no more
Deliver deliver deliver
Yeah uh can I get delivered from the sin
Get a little slice of Heaven I can enter in again
Or maybe just imagine that Im living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and then make it into friends
You dont even need a salad that dont make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
Thats a deep dish Chicago town get the peace stick
Home run hitter I be drilling on the weak pitch
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face
Im a man never biting on the hands that I eat with yeah
No Giordano or DiGiorno
Homemade Bull City bring it to him like a toro
Throwing dough up in the airbottom to the top and shredder
Full of cheese smarter than a purple ninja turtle nigga
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too much dope too many niggas on the porch
So the pizza man dont approach  no no no 
Pizza man dont come here no more
Too many niggas on the block too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man dont stop  pow pow pow
