You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
With a platinum plaque its like Robbin George and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide but Im here on the blind side
Hanging up til the line dies then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe tribe unlawful jux when you climb skies
Thats Robin Hood arrows of the richll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight I step by step let it escalate
Til you get it will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we dont fidget
Xzibit Pimp My Ride exquisite
We Gs coach us back if we die in business my Lord is my chemist
My sword is from Khemet Egyptian fonts and ankhs
Scottish writes with Montblancs let us stomp
I walk as my father walk master builder is what I thought
You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
Where the golden means so the overseer gets overseen
And the over heres are the older things
Can see the bell but dont know the rings
The rings are not sounds but circles wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel til its all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And its dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity
You look just like how Ima be

In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
You look just like how Ima be

In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
The applause of patrons at the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
Thats bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
UnderChristian its unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told its the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The souls gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask then youre reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half
You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
You look just like how Ima be
Sacred geometry
In a line in a line in a line in a line in a line
Three angels in kind on time go straight dont sine
