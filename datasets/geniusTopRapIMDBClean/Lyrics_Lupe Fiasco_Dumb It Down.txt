Carrera  Dumb it down 
Coolest nigga what  Dumb it down 
FNF up  Dumb it down 
Dumb it down 
Im fearless now hear this Im earless
And Im peerless that means Im eyeless
Which means Im tearless which means my iris
Resides where my ears is which means Im blinded
But Ima find it I can feel its nearness
But Ima veer so I dont come near
Like a chicken or a deer but I remember
Im not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer I really shouldnt be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere yeah Im both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war til Im resting in peace
You going over niggas heads Lu  Dumb it down 
They telling me that they dont feel you  Dumb it down 
We aint graduate from school nigga  Dumb it down 
Them big words aint cool nigga  Dumb it down 
Yeah I heard Mean and Vicious nigga  Dumb it down 
Make a song for the bitches nigga  Dumb it down 
We dont care about the weather nigga  Dumb it down 
Youll sell more records if you  Dumb it down 
And Im mouthless which means Im soundless
Now as far as the hearing Ive found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear shes fine and shes flying
I feel Im flying by em cause my minds on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Whos also Klingon to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
Im flying on Pegasus youre flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder picker of the fire flowers
Spit hot fiya like Dylan on Chappelles skit
Yeah smell it on my unicorn
Dont snort the white horse but toot my own horn
Sleep
Youve been shedding too much light Lu  Dumb it down 
Youre makin em wanna do right Lu  Dumb it down 
Theyre gettin selfesteem Lu  Dumb it down 
These girls are trying to be queens Lu  Dumb it down 
Theyre trying to graduate from school Lu  Dumb it down 
Theyre startin to think that smart is cool Lu  Dumb it down 
Theyre trying to get up out the hood Lu  Dumb it down 
Ill tell you what you should do  Dumb it down 
And Im brainless which means Im headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplayless sex is which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklaceless like a necklace theft
And I aint used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the bestfed FF jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon Westside beside em
Chesthigh and rising almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine make it rain
You make a boat I make a plane
Then I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside
You putting me to sleep nigga  Dumb it down 
Swhy you aint popping in the streets nigga  Dumb it down 
You aint winning no awards nigga  Dumb it down 
Robots and skateboards nigga  Dumb it down 
GQ Man of the Year G  Dumb it down 
Shit aint rocking over here B  Dumb it down 
Wont you talk about your cars nigga  Dumb it down 
And what the fuck is Goyard nigga  Dumb it down 
Make it rain for the chicks  Dumb it down 
Po CHAMPAGNE on a bitch  Dumb it down 
What the fuck is WRONG WITH YOU  Dumb it down

Look B heres my main my twoway
