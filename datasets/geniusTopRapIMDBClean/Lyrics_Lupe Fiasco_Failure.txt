Yeah What up ChiTown New York City
Philly Atlanta Virginia
They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me I say
Its mean soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
Its really thirtysix
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple I was over the scripts
See I could walk the walk couldnt really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now Im over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbals able
Thats the Usual
When I was po I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
Its Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please dont Interscope
Its gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With LUPEmperor
Is the foundations Ibeams and the antennas
Its so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme
This is gangsta man
Lupe to the FtotheI
TotheAtotheStotheCtotheO
From the west side of the CtotheH
TotheICAtotheGtotheO  Thats ganster man 
And them niggas aint Was nor from his regime
Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers aint drop out the vending machine
You gotta put more money in
And I shake niggas up every time I drop a bar
2 for 1 
Its horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo money them every time I cop a car
You see Im a roller right
So it might be a Rover right
But every time I drop an r
Get off the streets
Its over ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers right
She the chauffeur right
So I keep her sober
She dont get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas cant help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a s
Pick up an o
Uno put it all on one
Brace yourself like overbite
For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So Imma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
Its snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
Theres snakes in the hood
A bird a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No its not Noahs Ark Ahk
Its just a flowers start this is
Lupe to the FtotheI
TotheAtotheStotheCtotheO
From the west side of the CtotheH
TotheICAtotheGtotheO  Thats ganster man 
verachiever  Yeah 
My procedures
To proceed at all cost with no breather
Im all walk rain snow or fever
Im all coughs coming after your teacher
Im on the ball like FIFA Viva
Lupe Duce long live the leader
I remember I aint have sneakers
It was welfare
Coming up for Airs like
Whales there
Fila but now Im well here
Im Shamu with twelve pair
And niggas wanna take me back to zero like tare fare
Well my skills clear
You Sea World
Its Braille here
Im Bumpy Johnson I stick to the streets
Keep my dogs out in front of me
You see what Im saying
And I push kis wonderfully
This is gangsta man
