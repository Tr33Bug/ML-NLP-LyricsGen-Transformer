Imma just go And then well figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah thats kind of what it is
So on that note Americas most
First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I wouldve said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That wouldve been the call but naw
You cant see in ours but we can see in yours
You cant see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah just like that we just let it roll you know
Yeah and check it check it
So when that pond thaws and its no longer Gretzky
Thats when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up Lets see
Maybe see something we couldnt view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul we call that moving raw
Lions wont cross the line
Cougars wont move a paw
Chickens wont cross the road
Dogs wont roof at all
Always had flow just added a front door roof and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But thats only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just whos the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
Thats why I never really trust unless its Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now thats three mis like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horses head in your bed
Now thats what I call a good nights rest
You know You know just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go you know
And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now Im ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well dont forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But its no purple in the circle then there aint no rolling bs
Just spoken words thought provoking reeds
Hydro Im still strolling on the seeds
Eye low like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E Cheese
All without touching weed
But Im still hungry and Im having lunch for three
This is my form now what the function be
And art what I draw
And ooh what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas go to sleep
You know Its like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is it
It just be what it is you know
