Lets peruse the essentials of Cool
A brief study on the things so instrumental to Lu
That make me feel flyer than lobbies of Ws
A disclaimer just a rhymer no credentials from a school
In my Fall of Rome jeans my Head Porter wallet
My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen CLOT
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
Like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge man you cant be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics I was taking them to school
One of JayZ boys now Im skating in your pool
Not to be rude Im just hating on your rules
Like a young 50 Im on my world tour
Good morning Singapore Im bringing the sun with me
From the Robert Taylor homes to Africas slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies
Parisian sensibility so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah yeah them niggas over there its just
Yeah yeah now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my fancy broad and she foreign

Dita sunglasses Purple Murder Service samples
I like False Tshirts Dover Street is off the handle
Such a good designer Junya Watanabe god damn you

Leather Gucci belts and Guilty Brotherhood polos
I like Montblanc pens and Moleskine paper
I like Goyard bags and green Now  Laters
Monocle magazine and Japanese manga
Futura Nosferatus and HTM trainers
I love Street Fighter 2 I just really hate Zangief
Only Ken and Ryu I find it hard to beat Blanka
Keep a Wee Ninja hanging and an UNKLE album banging
If you negative in energy then stay out the vicinity of
Yeah yeah them niggas over there its just
Yeah yeah now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and shes so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
Shea fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her exman had her baggin up cocaine but she
Yeah yeah she love it over here its just
Yeah yeah she love it over here its just
Yeah yeah she love it over here its just
Yeah yeah she love it over here and its
But my most coveted thing is a high selfesteem
And a low tolerance for them telling me how to lean
See the most important parts are the ones that are unseen
The wings dont make you fly and the crown dont make you king
Now God dont like ugly aint too happy bout pretty
I am ignorances enemy so stay out the vicinity of
Yeah yeah them niggas over there its just
Yeah yeah now look at what I wear
Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and shes so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
Shea fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her exman had her baggin up cocaine but she
Yeah yeah she love it over here its just
