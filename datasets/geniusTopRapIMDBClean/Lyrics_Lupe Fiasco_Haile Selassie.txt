Haile Selassie high as the eyelids of osprey Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Im looking for my looking for my looking for my as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost tattoos all on my coast
Throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted
The indifference of those who should have known better
The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most
This has made it possible for evil to triumph
Selassie uhh
Mans limitation transfiguration
Haka dance done at the welcome to the demo
Modern man comes to the weddin in the limo
Mixin doves with the rice rain
Uncle Bens off the rails on the night train
And that storm took us to the platform pushas
Back to the bachelors backdoor unhook us
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us
And thats very old
Like Blackberry Bold but the juice
Sweeter than where the party at or
Releasing these niggas from the roofs and
Leavin these niggas on the loose or
Keepin these niggas in the coops and
Leavin these niggas on the noose free
Shamu fan got a world to see
Haile Selassie high as the eyelids of osprey Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Im looking for my looking for my looking for my as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost tattoos all on my coast
Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
That until there no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a mans skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
Selassie
To the limit the limit in the Methadone clinic
Ridin with the pack like a Peloton
Flyin with the sack in the trap like the pregnant
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon
If I triple my worth will it cripple my mom
If I simple my search will it mental my calm
Will it hurt if I give you my palm
To tell in it dont put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you a whale in it
And readin my palms like theres braille in it  braille in it 
Is it the trail or the forest  forest 
Or the forest with the trail in it
Thats a sail with a 12 in it
Water coming through from impalin it  water come through for me now 
Nothin left of the boat but my holes
Still I fill up the world and I float like Haile
Haile Selassie high as the eyelids of osprey Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Im looking for my looking for my looking for my as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost tattoos all on my coast
A qualified man with vision unmoved by daily selfish interests
Led to right decisions by his conscience
In general a man who knows from whence he comes
And where hes going will cooperate with his fellow human beings
He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties
But will inspire others by his good example
You are being watched by the nation
And you should realize that you will satisfy it if you do good
But on the contrary you do evil
It will lose its hope and confidence in you
Selassie
Hydrant open wide on the side of the colonized
Swimmin in the street fell asleep on my mama thighs
Blockin out the noise that destroys little boys
Live enjoy ships ahoy get deployed by the rockabyes
Ddddeep into the sea of my dreams
Lyin fall asleep at the feet of my queen
Hawk Ima write to the beat of your wings
Song for the Ethiopian King Haile
Haile Selassie high as the eyelids of osprey Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Im looking for my looking for my looking for my as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost tattoos all on my coast
Haile Selassie high as the eyelids of osprey Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Im looking for my looking for my looking for my as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost tattoos all on my coast
