Astaghfirullah
Yeah
Yeah
This one right here ha
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there
You dig
Uhhuh
Check it out
Now I aint trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hiphopyup because the women degraded
But Too hort made me laugh like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite I stated though I only recited half
Omitting the word bitchcursing I wouldnt say it
Me and Dog couldnt relate til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sortof liked yeah
Further ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rapbased filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac
Nass It Was Written intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions religion ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot tap the world and listen
It drop
My mom cant feed me my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money the hood dont love me
The cops wanna kill me this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village they call us killers
Took me off they welfare cant afford they health care
My teacher wont teach me my master beats me
And it hurts me soul


I had to ghetto boy bop a JayZ boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God he prayed to Gotti
Im thinking Golly God guard me from the ungodly
But by my thirtieth watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
Bout as uncomfortable as a Untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustled to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool  Cool 
I found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into
And thought What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit
Then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said Dont knock it mind your business
His business isnt mindin that nigga pimpingot it
They took my daughter we aint got no water
I cant get hired their cross on fire
We all got suspended I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign I aint got no hangtime
They talk about my sneakers poisoned our leader
My father aint seen me
Turn off my TV  Ugh yeah  cause it hurts me soul
So through the Grim Reaper sicklesharpening
Macintosh marketing oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation Islamic martyrdom  Woo 
Precise yeah laserguided targeting
Oilforfood bartering terrorist organization harboring
Sandcamouflaged army men
CCF sponsoring world conquering telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama nem
They breaking in my car again
Deforestation and overlogging and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing
Hydroponic coughing and  Woo  all the worlds ills
Sitting on chrome twentyfourinch wheels like that
They say Im infected this is why I inject it
I had it aborted we got deported
My laptop got spyware they say that I cant lie here
But I got no place to go
I cant stop eating my best friends leaving
My pastor touched me I love this country
I lost my earpiece I hope yall hear me
Cause it hurts me soul
Yeah whoaoh
Hurts me soul
It hurts me so soul
Whoaoh
Hurts me soul  Yeah 
Whoaoh
