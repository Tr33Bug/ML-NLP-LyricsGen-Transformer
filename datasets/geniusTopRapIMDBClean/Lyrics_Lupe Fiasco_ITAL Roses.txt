ITAL  Roses  Lyrics
Black panther black panther what do you see
I see a dreaming child watching over me
Back nigga yeah hey
Can we get a little break
From the cocaine and the kilos
Aiight nigga we know
Aiight nigga we know
Can we get a break
From the strippers on the pole
Aiight nigga we know
Okay nigga we know
Hey shawty aint no future in no gang bang
And aint no manhood in no bang bang
Aint no honor cleaning interstates inside a chain gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry nigga said a Camry
Watch that hoe depreciate and then youll understand me
Its called being fiscally responsible
Dont let these lying images up in hiphop here conquer you
The TVs not your father fool that videos not your mama
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And heres some kisses for the babies
Some peace humanity for the whole widewidewide world
More patience to the youth then sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar ital iyah
I know youre sayin Lupe rappin bout the same shit
Well thats cause aint shit changed bitch
And please dont excuse my language
Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent
The true expression of my anguish
And by this far I aint shocked upset or appalled
Im ashamed bitch
I cant listen if you aint sayin shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Aint buildin up they confidence we teachin em that they aint shit
If they aint got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this doubleedged sword
Instead of askin where the hoes is
Maybe maybe may we have some roses
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And heres some kisses for the babies
Some peace humanity for the whole widewidewide world
More patience to the youth then sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar ital iyah
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And heres some kisses for the babies
Some peace humanity for the whole widewidewide world
Called the president a terrorist
Corporate sponsors like how the fuck you gon embarrass us
Aint my fault I was just repeatin this
Professor Emeritus from America
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy Palestinian throwing stones
The fuck you think they call him Imma leave that all alone
Cause this the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness
Its that great American raprap ferocious
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And heres some kisses for the babies
Some peace humanity for the whole widewidewide world
More patience to the youth then sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar ital iyah
