Gold medals them my role models
Rollin old models lowered old schools flowin cold
And goin gold follows
Flower bearin call it petals to the floor
Power sharin call it devils to the door
Power power til aint no devils anymore
Flowerflowers they be droppin at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet to the beat of my drum
It was little Susie Uzi she sold crack and was a killer
Allbitch dope tip wasnt trappin with no niggas
Had a long money minor do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic crackin off the Richter yeah
Walked up to my ride asked me Could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me out here in the streets she aint have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips she said
Now heres my proposition
You just write a bunch of raps for me and Ima go and spit em
Then we take em to the radio the DJ better spin em
Then we take em to the record store
And sell a couple million woo
I already got the money already got the bitches
I see these other niggas Ima do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper trapper to a rapper
We gotta gon do it
Trapper to a rapper now nigga make it happen
Ugh told me call up Soundtrakk have him send a couple beats
Not that Superstar shit she wanted somethin for the streets
Said it might take like a month she said It better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said I saw that thing the first time you dont gotta do it twice
But I need a lil more info on exactly what I write
Some details bout a female bout your life and what you like
She said My life is like a bitch and Im just like my life
Then powpowpowpowpow Yeah them niggas started bustin
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said Nigga hit the gas went from zero to a hundred
Now we runnin from some killers I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin out the window with that thumper she was dumpin
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin
We was swervin jumped the curb and ditched the whip and started runnin
Tried to jump over a wall but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and thats how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin hard and she was sittin there smokin kush
Then we both started to glow we looked around like What is this
And then we looked up and a light
Came down and pulled us to a ship like What the fuck
I already got the money already got the bitches
I see these other niggas Ima do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper now nigga make it happen  Shit 
Well now this the shit Im talkin bout the shit that Ive been on
Yeah lightyears outer space but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches Get them intergalactic asses to clappin
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah I could never go back to trappin
And who needs Atlanta when youre on Saturn gettin a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment I could burn this shit up
Why you standin there just lookin nigga Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy let me know how it work

But I think that I can fly us stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin saucer pilot
But first things gon be first when we get back to that earth
