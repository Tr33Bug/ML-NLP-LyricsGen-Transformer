I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And Im not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And Im not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when Im alone
And so I tell myself that Ill be strong
And dreaming when theyre gone
Cause theyre calling calling calling me home
Calling calling calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when Im alone
So what are you going to stand for
Dreads in the sky I and I 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a neverbackdownfrommystance tour
Yeah touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or  wait let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and youll never touch the floor
Woah now if Noah need a rower
Ill be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubbas mothers
Take the hero out the Nino keep it real as troubletrouble huh
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them 45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know thats contradiction wants and needs in competition
But its hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert hashtag occupies
Repper til the death of me FnF whats left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestles when Im wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that dont mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how Im only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious Upfront with his realness
They wanna be fiascoes reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta kick you down a well kid
And on my last check I copped the NSX just like Pharrell did
Well did better doings to come
My only promise is Ill never ruin the young
Ill never human the sung lyrics in a spirit thats
Superhuman to some keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums plus get up out of them plus never forget
Just where you from plus make sure that youre ballin
When you come back up in them plus we dont die multiply
Every single comeup  parumpapumpum yup
