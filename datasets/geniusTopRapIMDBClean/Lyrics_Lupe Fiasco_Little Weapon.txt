Now lil Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told her Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag take the pennies out the drawer
Lil Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish black boots and black hat
He gon blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then we can get a soccer ball
Thats what my commander say
How old Well Im like ten eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I dont know much about where Im from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but Im still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If Im in your dreams then your end is near yeah
Little weapon little weapon little weapon

Theres a war if the guns are just too tall for you
Well find you something small to use
Little weapon little weapon little weapon
We need you now blaow

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson the struggles little recruits
Cute smileless heartless violent
Childhood destroyed devoid of all childish ways
Cant write their own names
Or read the words thats on they own graves
Think you gangsta Popped a few rounds
These kidsll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down its
Little weapon little weapon little weapon

Little weapon little weapon little weapon

Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim I hold right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs press pause for your moms
Make the room silent she dont approve of violent games
She leave resume activity
Scarred and blue heart of hard sharp wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the little persons murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder
Hes only seconds older than me
We playful but serious
Now keep that on mind for online experience ugh
Little weapon little weapon little weapon

Theres a war if the guns are just too tall for you
Well find you something small to use
Little weapon little weapon little weapon
We need you now
