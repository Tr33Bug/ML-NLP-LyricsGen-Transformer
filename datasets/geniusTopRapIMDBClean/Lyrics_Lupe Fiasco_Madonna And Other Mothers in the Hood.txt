Madonna  And Other Mothers in the Hood  Lyrics
Immaculate mother of the holy soul
On behalf of the overdose
We come to you uncomfortable in our ways
Please dont slam the door all in my face
Tried to go to church church aint work
Still want to kill niggas
Tried to go work but work aint work
Work aint work for the feel nigga
Really make me feel like a field nigga
Make me feel worse really tryna chill
But inside I feel like a steel mill nigga
And its hard when these niggas steal mama  what 
When you aint got got a meal still mama
Living off a meal deal mama
Cant stunt with them lil wheels mama
Need a real purse real heels mama
How dem liquors and them pills feel mama Lil mama
No man shall prosper
Lord knows if I said it its gospel lil mama
Madonna  donna donna donna donna donna donna 
No man shall prosper
Lord knows if I said it its gospel your momma
Madonna  donna donna donna donna donna donna 
No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with your momma
Madonna  donna donna donna donna donna donna 
I be just trying make it I be just trying make it
I be just trying make it I be just trying make it
They be just trying break us they be just trying break us
They be just trying break us they be just trying break us
Interlace your fingers and put your hands behind your head
White T on they shoulders what drags em off through those streets
In the whip wit they soldiers stations of the police
Trying to stick all this time to me
Trying to stick all these crimes to me
Could you just send a dime to me
Mama please send a sign to me
Whats looking like life is probation and a fine to me
Lawyer said Id be alright but I think that he lying to me
They really wanna throw those lines to me
Put me in a line put the knives to me
Put me in the sky put it to my side
Then push it inside of me
Holy mother of the blessed soul
They dont love you there they love you here
I love you like Im Mexico say yeah
Santa Maria Madre de Dios ruega por nosotros pecadores
Ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte amen


No man shall touch this
Lord said nobody can fuck with your momma
Madonna  donna donna donna donna donna donna
