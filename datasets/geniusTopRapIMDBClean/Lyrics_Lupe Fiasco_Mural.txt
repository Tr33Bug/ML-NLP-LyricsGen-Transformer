Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm
But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling
And whats the talking without the match feeling
Thats buried living And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
Faith healers exfemale drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
First part of a party that I throw in parts
One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing hearthard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay aint playing that the mans states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But Reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying Hey man
And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when youre recording
Cause thats the portion thats important
When I was reporting that I was poor but now Im more than
Its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop and the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties then it relocks then it relapse then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got like yeah
Then forge poetry like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbety
From the steel orbitings sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing a waterboarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her dont ever send her to Mally Malls
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macaulys claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Mardi Gras
The fame champagne walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen unless its dropping on Activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hackin download updates that lack religion
Or are we more
Than soil tainting disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing and foiling others royal saintings
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh Aint nothin to it but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary nothin do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary its a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin forest
As I perform a nerd storm I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like KoolAid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So thats OJ da Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves thats too snug to judge who was who drew blood
And Lupe look at all these toucans in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners dont fall off cliffs they run across
Anomalies by the colony flukes by the reservoir
Wildin pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isnt Chicano
Whos the Boss If it isnt Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi shinobi hittin Kenno in the face with all my throwin knives
Subzero Gaiden hiding Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village Leaf village wolf spirit magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filetofish ships seashepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that youve had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cubascuba couldnt take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious featherweight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot practising stillness
Real Steel til he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah
