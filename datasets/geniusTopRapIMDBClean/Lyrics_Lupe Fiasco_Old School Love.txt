Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you you wont be alone
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if hes ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And hes older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But its old school its like 03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody elses past
Wassup
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down cant be a classic if its no wood
If you dont know what then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mels IceTs and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause its hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And thats a track and if you want a  eeeeeeeh 
You have to make it like that
Now whats one turtle to a couple snails
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody elses past
Wassup
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now


Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reeltoreel when theres Pro Tool
I cant dig it at all because theres no tube
Fire when you speak but aint no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If its better with time then think in line
That youre going to be your nicest round your midlife crisis
If youre life like Christ live your midlife like its Christlike
Nigga I aint psychic
I know its all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous youre Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup
Give me your old school love right now
Im leaving it all up to you darling giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
