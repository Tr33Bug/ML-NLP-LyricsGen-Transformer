I know I know but I gotta get up outta here you know
I gotta go pay these bills I got a show to do you know
One time for your mind
Lets go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago man
Wherever I go she go
I love her and I hate to leave her lonely
Ringring went the iPhone it was my homie
He said Lets hit Japan if we can make em jam
We can make a hundred grand spend it in the south of France
Nothing further I jumped grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
Thats when I heard murder
Youre killing me youre filling me with sorrow
Sunrise goodbyes and missing you tomorrows
I turn to see my dream love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash thats faster
Than 180 on that dash shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
Yous the dame whos the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love love
Lets go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camelback across the desert sand
And take a train to Rome or home
Brazil for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes


So lets keep it real all in together Free Chill
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Dont wake me til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap they applaud they love me my God
Otsukaresama deshita or maybe au revoir
A spree on SaintHonor then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been and
Everything that I done and
Tell her that shes the one and umm
Lets go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camelback across the desert sand
And take a train to Rome or home
Brazil for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Guess whos back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams fore I went to sleep
To lala land to count them sheep
I swear youre looking prettier than ever
Its got to be a prophecy for us to stay together evermore
For better or less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure Xs on the shore
I know my world tours like war to you
But Ian said Aloha and Harley said Cheers
Julian said Bonjour Big O was like Yeah
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership all for My Tenderness
She said Pursue your interests cause even if Im ticketless
Ill be there by your side
In your heart and on your mind
So as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha who loves you bae
Now bring it back now
Lets go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camelback across the desert sand
And take a train to Rome or home
Brazil for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
