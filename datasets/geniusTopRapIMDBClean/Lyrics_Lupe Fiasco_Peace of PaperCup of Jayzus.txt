Dis nigga like hes so exclusive
Sometimes dreams peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero you see
Lu see like La Brea  Pico with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dineros a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They aint see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I aint playing but I compete I aint a player but Im complete
And thats the win win a mason mind cant sign if the pens Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams make it rain
To make em smile now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style prom nightcat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street I aint in it
Im just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
Whats a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of PaperCup of Jayzus what we writing
These aint entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds Im feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper Im Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing
Pizza Lasers Cup of Razors
What you choosing
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With whats being made or the maker
Im whats being chased
Im not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it now paper make a plane  paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain
Im fly paper on the brain
This and twoply paper just aint the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds thats Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches thats just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family thats why I throw em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay a couple beats from Ye
make Food for thought thats a restaurant in a day
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS bout it bout it
Dont let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
POP Jayzus a cup of Courage I cant cant
Thats double negative its 2 earls
They really nice but theyll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
Its not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
Lus new should be MrPure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure hes
Not that really nice That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice
You just witnessed a double a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You cant do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks but dont stop keep pouring til its a puddle
Peace of Paper Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS whats the drive
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rappers revived
Oh look whos here the greatest rappers arrived
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
Im not the greatest rapper the greatest rappers a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean Foxy  Rah the greatest rappers a girl
They said the greatest rappers a guy
Phone rang it was Ghost he said Kiss the greatest rapper Goodbye
Chris said Common Common said Kweli Talib said Im sure its Mos Definitely
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS
Smack might have the greatest but now Im just playing favorites
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded
Peace of these niggas is nice
Knees like these niggas aight
Shins like listen to them ankles like shins making sense
Feet like why you running behind these niggas
They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap dont step inside the clinch
Where da at Dont jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guys petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear
Im outta here
Drogas
Shaka Zulu
