The King
When youre king of African music youre the King
Because music is the king of all professions
NU Music 
Best laid plan make a mess made
Damnation lets play hands sans spades
Thats without a boycott and a sitout
AfroBlack pick in with a fist out
From the Welcome Home to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time hmm
Sick sick sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls finger waves closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters old boots thats a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale two Ls and some old letters
Now he doing double life while she lead a double life
Man he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead em to the same pen
And the hunger strike in em to the same tin
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere but the mirror oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I dont wanna be accepted not at all as I am
Visitor visitor prisoner prisoner land
Getting slammed from the protest no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
Yeah  I need more for the Michaels
Thats a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
Its all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
Im just looking at they feet cause Im looking for the Lord
Looking in the library looking at the law
10 years deep now Im looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty cause Im bunkin with the Moors
They degenerate they aint looking at the game
They just looking at the scores they be putting on my books
Cause Im looking at the stars trade a shank for some crank
Now Im looking at a war BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen snitches on PC
MM on a mission but COs got the prison
God got us all God set us free
God is the key but the guards got the doors
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere but the mirror oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I dont wanna be accepted not at all as I am
Visitor visitor prisoner prisoner land
Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid wasnt gon take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make em stay with it
Wicked swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT team
Thats a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop the helicopteriiiing
Man hed thought that hed fly away
Like a kite take flight like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing  but the kite was the key 
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel outta A Block
And wear gloves for the razorwired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay Thats how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When youre rehabilitated so correctly
And lets hope thats how youre living when youre set free
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere but the mirror oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I dont wanna be accepted not at all as I am

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow
Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
Hell be captured by Maya in a rubyencrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen The new Jim Crow
The new Jim Crow the new Jim Crow Crow Crow Crow Crow 
They sell they souls they sell they selves
They aint twelve they old niggas old as hell
Old as jail old as cells
Sold so much salt aint no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too you living here too
You just like us til your shift get through
You could look like us you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us you should get strike two
You should get like life you should get like woo
You should get that twice you should get refused
The open road thats no parole and no control
Over your own soul so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold
You better watch these niggas  en garde 
If it was up to me I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldnt rehabilitate man I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
Id throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
Id throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys Id throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas  en garde 
If it was up to me I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldnt rehabilitate I would just box these niggas
And throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys like the coast guard watching me
Id throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys Id throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas  en garde 
5th year with the DOC
Do you see whats the CO see
Robocop opt to his COP
Three hots and a COT
Lived in a small town his whole life
Never left like soundin like the hole right
Either working at the prison or its no lights
In the system working with the police
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down he tell us
With each beatdown he help us
Wrong one gon knock his ass out though
Its why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound
Its why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on em these niggas might spit
You better watch these niggas  en garde 
If it was up to me I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldnt rehabilitate man I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
Id throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
Id throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys Id throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas  en garde 
If it was up to me I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldnt rehabilitate I would just box these niggas
And throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys like the coast guard watching me
Id throw away the keys
Id throw away the keys Id throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas  en garde
