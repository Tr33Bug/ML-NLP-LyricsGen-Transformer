Put one in the air like the kings son
For the heir to the kingdom
That means Imma be the king once the king done
If he dont wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the kings son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringlings
Thats how I kept it on the air is like a rerun
And kept the kings comin in obscene sums
You see for me its life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
Thats why I dont play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I aint never seen none
I keep my back to the past tell it bye  bye 
Face to the future tell it hi  hi 
Everything is super so is fly  fly 
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High
Post coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo
The latest famous 80s baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if Im injured Im gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
Its Lupe and I aint from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now
Usually I stay put em on the roof with more truth for me to say
I keep my back to the past tell it bye  bye 
Face to the future tell it hi  hi 
Everything is super so is fly  fly 
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High
The laboratory happy for me cause Im back with my belongings
Ferrari bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant Don King
A glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin bout your kush you should come and hear my lawn sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alleyoop it properly
Football or volleyb hockely or sockely
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
Ill lock you in a locker b
Like Bruce Leroy locked Johnny in a locker see
Shock is the only thing that 2Pac is toppin me
Hot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava be
I keep my back to the past tell it bye  bye 
Face to the future tell it hi  hi 
Everything is super so is fly  fly 
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High
