Let me put you on game 
Let me put you on game 
Dont you know that I run this place
And Ive begun this race must I rerun this pace
Im the reason its become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
Let me put you on game 
They love my darkness I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
Ive been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
Let me put you on game 
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this but theyre fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
Im the one that they follow I am the one that they march with
Let me put you on game

Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings

I cant help it all I hear when youre crying is laughs
Im sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital little baby crack addicts had
Let me put you on game 
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfarereceiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor quench your thirst on my elixirs
Let me put you on game 
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel so I make them cool
Let me put you on game 
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleones food
If you die tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
