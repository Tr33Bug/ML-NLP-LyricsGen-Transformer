SLR  Super Lupe Rap  Lyrics
I said think of your future
You cant do that tomorrow
But you dont hear a word you see that SLR
O ye tormented souls
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles
And thats the top mang going hammer like a Glock cant
All flow and grammar no shot drank
Im so sober when I speak
I call it catching bullets with my teeth
You can feel it in your chest
Like Bruce Lee jumping on your vest
But I cant feel yours through my Superman S
Yes Im Supermandout
Rare Cartier look like Superman house
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out
My life is like Italia doin 100 miles
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles
Walk right into Philippes when I ran outta Chows
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals
The beef is all the same its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Malcolm X that Im tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that Im tryna steal his fro
Go back in time take the slaves plows shovels and the hoes
The masters get the It Was Written intro
SLR 104
SLR 104
Soundtrakk let the beat go
Soundtrakk let the beat roll
In this world Im so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you cant tell me what you gon do
Cause nigga I dont believe that
Like 911 came from Iraq
Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
Thats how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town
West side ghetto Windy City Cook Count
Black skies lookin up crack pipes lookin down
Accused of not lookin back blind nigga look around
City on my back so the CHI go errywhere Im at
Presence so shiny Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum the color of my plaque
I memorize Colors off of Yo MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopaths nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess whos sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice that aint me  tag
If you wanna be mean then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You cant understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and Im a mother lovin mirrorfull
Bein dope is all in the muscle
Its more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants and bowlin ball juggle
So dont be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out
School ya on your history I tell ya what you bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell what these niggas talkin bout
2 man Big Pun a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album JayZ a 1 nigga WuTang
Young and hungry Mos Def a conscious rappin Lil Wayne
I dont care for similarities
Cause Im a pioneer not a parody
These aint bars this is barbarity
SLR Clarity


In this world Im so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you cant tell me what you gon do
Holy Shock and awing cattle prods
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue
Of my peers I aint doin numbers like Anbesol
But Im here and Im revered
Lyric boy Based King Master Chef All City Chess moves Mickey Donny Diggy CRS fool
Carrera Era Panamera FTool Emperor Free Chilly nigga FNF RULES
Ye what these niggas talkin bout
A Jesus in the desert walking Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine Lupe to the rescue the world is fine
Words and lines of mine I feel are better than every rap in the world combined
And thats how you do it
Erything flow errything fluid
Stupid with the raps but the raps never stupid
Trakk on the music SLR ruthless
And the next whip is that Ferrari cart
Game over  body parts
In this world Im so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you cant tell me what you gon do
