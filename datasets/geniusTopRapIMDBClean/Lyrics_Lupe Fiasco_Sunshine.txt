Yeah yeah  Woo 
Ugh alright yeah alright
Ugh
Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live ya dig
Fresh uhhuhyes she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind dont play like this naw
But Im prepared for it got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I dont care for it
Dont even be looking for light like that then there go it
Yeah right over there so I prepared to pour it
Little scared my stare lowered momma said have no fear
Plus Im already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
Its nothing right
So here go it whispered in her ear
Its kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it
And she said Yeah
Youre my sunshine
Youre my sunshine 
Youre my moonlight
Youre my moonlight 
Youre the starry skies above me
Wont you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphorits hard to get
In the car we sit from the intro
She rolled down the window just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
Im calm a little more confident
Uhhuh and then we lose consciousness
She says that Ive been waiting for you
And I know youve been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle Ive been thinking of you
I told a firebreathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said See Too beautiful to let you sleep
Youre my sunshine


Youre my sunshine
Youre my sunshine 
Youre my moonlight
Youre my moonlight 
Youre the starry skies above me
Wont you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
Relationship is just thirty minutes long
Its kinda heavy maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Cant trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me out of the trillions
Of numbers thats in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Wont be long then Ill see you in the morning
Cool
Youre my sunshine
Youre my sunshine 
Youre my moonlight
Youre my moonlight 
Youre the starry skies above me
Wont you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
