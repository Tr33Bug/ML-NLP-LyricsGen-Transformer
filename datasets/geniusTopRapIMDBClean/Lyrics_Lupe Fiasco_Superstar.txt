If you are what you say you are  Yeah yeah 
A superstar  Gon say now 
Then have no fear the cameras here  Uh 
And the microphones
And they wanna know oh oh oh oh  The return 
If you are what you say you are
A superstar  Uhhuh 
Then have no fear the crowd is here  Yeah 
And the lights are on  Ha 
And they want a show oh oh oh oh yeah  Free Chilly 
Yeah uh a fresh cool young Lu
Tryna cash his microphone check twoonetwo
Wanna believe my own hype but its too untrue
The world brought me to my knees What have you brung You
Did you improve on a design Did you do something new
Well your name aint on the guest list who brung you
Youthe more famous personyou come through
And the sexy lady next to you you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me Im too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven the devil on me two tons too
Ha ha ha hahaha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear the cameras here
And the microphones
And they wanna know oh oh oh oh yeah


And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and  Pew 
Out through China nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze  Woo 
Now thats important to say
Cause even with all that most of us dont want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience aint fazed
And they aint gon clap and they aint gon praise  Uh 
They want everything back  Back  that theyve paid
Cause theyve been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha hahaha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show oh oh oh oh yeah
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause Ive been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security aint getting along and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown MMs are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror dont flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs her favorite song and mics dont feedback
All the reviewers say You need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like Ha ha hahaha
Ha ha hahaha ha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear the cameras here
And the microphones
And they wanna know oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A superstar  Superstar 
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show oh oh oh oh  Yeah 
If you are
What you say you are
Then have no fear
