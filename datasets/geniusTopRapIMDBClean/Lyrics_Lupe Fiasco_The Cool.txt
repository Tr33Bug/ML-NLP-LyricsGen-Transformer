Yeah
Yeah
The Cool
Turn me up uhhuh yeah
He came back in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes he was still freshtodeath
Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
He still had it cause they couldnt find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory he didnt mind it but
He couldnt sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Secondgrade handwriting simply read I miss ya
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin
He saw that the latch was broken he kicked his casket open
And he
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born you live then you die
Ohohohoh
If life goes passing you by
Dont cry
If youre breaking the rules making your moves  Yeah 
Paying your dues  Uhhuh  chasing the cool
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldnt dirtspit he swallowed it
Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
Except his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
Thatd got him in the box wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasnt older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
So he
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie  Yeah 
You born you live then you die
Ohohohoh
If life goes passing you by
Dont cry  Ugh 
If youre breaking the rules  Yeah  making your moves  Ugh 
Paying your dues  Ugh  chasing the cool
He begged for some change to get him on the train
Damn that nigga stank is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look wasnt shook wasnt ashamed
Matterfact only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah and gettin back in his lane
Doin his thingfirst he had to find somethin to sling
Next stop was his block it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird being on the opposite
They figured that he wasnt from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said Youre scared aint you
He said Hustler for death no heaven for a gangster
And
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie  Ugh 
You born you live then you die  Ugh 
Ohohohoh
If life goes passing you by
Dont cry
If youre breaking the rules making your moves
Paying your dues chasing the cool
Yeah
Ugh
The Cool
