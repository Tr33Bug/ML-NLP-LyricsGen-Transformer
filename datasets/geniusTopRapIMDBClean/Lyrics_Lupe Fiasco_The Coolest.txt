I love the Lord
But sometimes its like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach baby thats law
But she doesnt see therefore I spoil
I trick I fall run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein every vessel every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene an obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen I could be her king together
She would make me cool and we would both rule forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure ever again
And if the rain stops and everythings dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
Shed teach me how to fly even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe shed retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell and Ill be

And so began our reign
The Trinity Her and I Caine
No weatherman could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard umbrella whatever put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon need a sub til he does reply
And not one of Jareds you think its all arid
And everytings irie another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the UngerFelix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving upandcomers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and welltodo mommas
But not well enough to keep em from us
The ones that were fighting in class who might not pass
Rap recordpressured to laugh at a life not fast
Can you feel it Thats what I got asked
Do I love her Said I dont know
Streets got my heart game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying dishonored baby mama
Whos the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby but what about lately
Then hahahahahad right up in her face G
Theres more fish in the sea Im on my mission to be be

Come these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fasttalking on the hustle
No Heaven up above you no Hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when were not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool
Cool
