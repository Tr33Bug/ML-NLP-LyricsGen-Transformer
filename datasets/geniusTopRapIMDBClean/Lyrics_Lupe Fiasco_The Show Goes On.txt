Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back

Unaffected by they threats then get busy on they ass

Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that dont wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids thats livin in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin back that the world is theirs

Terrified of the world now Im on a world tour
I would give up everything even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys Im rappin round the world for

Say hiphop only destroy tell em look at me boy
I hope your son dont have a gun and never be a dboy
