They.Resurrect.Over.New. Lyrics
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above, velvet hands in the upper glove—touch
Like bad double dutch, and two Amsterdam's ain't enough—D.R.U.G.S. 
"Don't ruin us," God said—DROGAS—too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer, like soca, not a chain, but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures, pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder, eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades, bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak, park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening, or two feet on a Riesling (Yeah!) slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind, decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind, safe word is "Don't stop," both, or don't go no times
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N

Coolest, tulips; flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low, ignorance is that the world isn't ours—the gall!
Give them all showers, Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drownin' in power, surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder—cut—that's a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect, names don't last like Mr. X, unless you Galilee
Droppin' bowling balls on the discotheque, with a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance—it's a new year, every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal, yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy, tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold, 'fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone with a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said—
(Proceed to the next level)
Come so far, seen so much
T.R.O.N
I cannot settle for good enough
(Proceed to the next level)
So I'll sweat and I'll climb
T.R.O.N
Until I reach my prime
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
(Proceed to the next level)
In my eyes, there's a fire
And it takes me high
Uh!
Yeah

Soulo! Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you'll be among the stars (Space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (Wavy)
Ab-Solar-system—intergalactic soldier (Uh)
Lupe say I'm a stoner—I said that I'm much bolder (Yeah)
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game, yeah (Word)
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for Your honor—only God can judge us, if you're Islamic, Allah (God!)
I've had it up to my collar with these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala (Uh)
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel—Black magic (Black magic)
Matter of fact—if matter is fact? A matter-factory is in the makin', perhaps
Uh, erase your database, we race against time, no time to set a date
Tetsuo & Youth-induced, too cool for school, unloose the noose and—

Proceed to the next level
Soul!

We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
I'm ready for it, I've been waiting all my life
