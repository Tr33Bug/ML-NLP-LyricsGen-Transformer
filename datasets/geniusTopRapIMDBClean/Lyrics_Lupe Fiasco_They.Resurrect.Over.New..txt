TheyResurrectOverNew Lyrics
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above velvet hands in the upper glovetouch
Like bad double dutch and two Amsterdams aint enoughDRUGSÂ 
Dont ruin us God saidDROGAStoo much pride we electric slide
We should be closer like soca not a chain but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures pay respects in my senseis sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembes shoulder eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin on the joy like the residues of heartbreak park full of art arteries full of parkay
Beating it like new games easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening or two feet on a Riesling  Yeah  slow wind
Meditate until theres no mind decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind safe word is Dont stop both or dont go no times
Proceed to the next level
TRON
Proceed to the next level
TRON
Coolest tulips flowers fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low ignorance is that the world isnt oursthe gall
Give them all showers Tony found the fountain of youth in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain drownin in power surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowdercutthats a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect names dont last like Mr X unless you Galilee
Droppin bowling balls on the discotheque with a disco ball hanging round your neck
Danceits a new year every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone with a hand on her thigh she looked me in the eye and said
Proceed to the next level 
Come so far seen so much
TRON
I cannot settle for good enough
Proceed to the next level 
So Ill sweat and Ill climb
TRON
Until I reach my prime
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all Ill reach the end
Proceed to the next level 
In my eyes theres a fire
And it takes me high
Uh
Yeah
Soulo Shoot for the moon even if you miss youll be among the stars  Space 
Backstroke in my pool of thought but dont mind the sharks  Wavy 
AbSolarsystemintergalactic soldier  Uh 
Lupe say Im a stonerI said that Im much bolder  Yeah 
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game yeah  Word 
Scope this horror Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for Your honoronly God can judge us if youre Islamic Allah  God 
Ive had it up to my collar with these niggas castin stones like this Mancala  Uh 
Proceed to the next level dig that with a platinum shovelBlack magic  Black magic 
Matter of factif matter is fact A matterfactory is in the makin perhaps
Uh erase your database we race against time no time to set a date
