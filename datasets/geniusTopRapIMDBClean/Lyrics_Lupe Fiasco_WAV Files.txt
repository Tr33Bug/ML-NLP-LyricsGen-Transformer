Get back to our nationoh Lord
So we walkin back to Africa
And I found a detour to the seashore

To leave footsteps on the depths of the sea floor ayy

Sea salty cause it cry with us when we looked it in the eyes
Like how could you help her
Poseidon apologized and said that Im sorry were shelter
Yall can live down here forever drownin is severed
From all your lungs and the lungs of your sons
Tell your daughters the waters a treasure
Summon the forest
Talkin to trees now how could you be in the chorus
With something so horrid
You became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships
Anthropomorphic the forest returned with a match
Made from itself and said Burn us with that
Then left again and came back with a axe
We can serve you as furniture or furnace us black ayy
My bones is why the beach is white
Why the beach is white cause they bleached us light
So Im goin back home I took a leap last night

Rise with us
From out the sevens to the Heavens in the skies in us
Conversations with the constellations
While you navigate the haters black baby alligator baiters
Supposed to do greater with all of your alphas and betas
And minors and majors
You were so busy just tryin to shine
You shoulda been tryin to save us
Star said Excuse our behavior
We will be indebted to you for all of eternity
If you counseled your heart and forgave us
Remove all our favors from childrens of sailors and slavers
Repay you with acres
But here in the heavens where harvest is greater
A meager inheritance pardon our arrogance
Those with Americans guide them to places much safer ayy

Sweeten the path for you seas
All that I have for you forest
Fire and maps for you stars

Are fire and maps for you stars
Fall off the flag for you sugar
Sweeten the path for you
