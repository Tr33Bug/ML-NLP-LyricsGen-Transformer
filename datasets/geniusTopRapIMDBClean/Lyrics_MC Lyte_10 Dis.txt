Hot damn hot damn hot damn hot damn hot damn
Hot damn ho here we go again
Suckers steal a beat when you know they cant win
You stole the beatare you having fun
Now me and the Auds gonna show you how its done
You are what I label as a nerver plucker
Youre plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James killing everybody in sight
The codes threesix the name is Lyte
After this jam I really dont give a damn
Cause Imma run and tell your whole damn clan
That youre a
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Hit me why dont ya hit me why dont ya
Milks bodyguard is my bodyguard too
You wanna get hurt Well this is what you do
You put your left foot up and then your right foot next
Follow instructions dont lose the context
Thirty days a month your mood is rude
We know the cause of your bloody attitude
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Beat biter dope style taker
Tell you to your face you aint nothing but a faker
Your style is smooth even for a cheating mic
You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim soundalike
Heres a Milkbone a sign of recognition
Dont turn away I think you should listen close
Dont boast you said you wasnt bragging
You fucking liar youre chasin a chuckwagon
The only way you learn you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale then it cant be bought
When you leave the mic you claim its smoking
Unlike Rakim you are a joke
And I think you ought to stop before you get in too deep
Cause with a sister like Lyte yo I dont sleep

When Im in a jam with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue treat the girl like a punk
Now Im not trying to say that Im into static
But yo if you cause it yep we gotta have it
Cause I aint going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands better yet for the words
Cause youll be ignored and at the same time Ill be heard
Throughout the city the town and the country
The beat is funky my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme Im saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing
So sit back Jack and listen to this its 10 dis
Cause Im just about ready to fly this fist against your lips
But Ill wait for the day or night that you approach
And Imma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble a battles no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hiphop Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face but youre funny
Your beat your rhyming your timing all crummy
On the topic of rapping I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl and its definitely crooked
Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I dont create a character when Im on the microphone
I am myself no games to be played
No script to be written no scene to be made
I am the director as far as you are concerned
You dont believe me then youll have to learn
This aint as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact you aint seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
You wanna battle cause you know where I am
You dont wanna come in the 90s and see me at a jam
When a mic is handy ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic hand like a magnet
Set assure you know I dont play
When it comes down to it the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity
