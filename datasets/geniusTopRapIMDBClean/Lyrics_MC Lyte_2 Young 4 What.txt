Im the dopest female
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
Im too old  Whats with that crap
Come on now brother age is just a number
Anyway what matters is your state of mind
And if you give me some time Ill make your heart all mine
I dont like pushin and I dont like rushin
But most of all I dont like fussin
So come on now sweetie why dont ya stop frontin
Besides older folks come equipped for good lovin
Are you really serious  Age really matters
I thought telling you this you would be flattered
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still aint widdit
oh well forget it nope nope
But dont you dare touch me you said you wasnt widdit
You waited too long now Lyte is not havin it
I coulda showed you things taught you how to explore
My question is what are you too young for
I coulda shown you things that you never seen before
Took you all around on my wild world tour
But youre too young too young to have fun
oh well Im done
Im the dopest female
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
It may sound nasty and it may sound mean
But Im into little boys that are about seventeen
I dont know why but they put up a fight
And hot damn that excites the MC Lyte
Cause yo I love a young buck that give a firm fuck
But once in a while they become lovestruck
But thats okay though cause I can handle them
I love young boys on the brink of being young men
I mold em shape em make em then I break em in
They get the job done I make em get the job done
Well swell make em kiss and tell
All of their friends around the neighborhood
That Lyte is GOOD soul food GOOD
So tell me honey are you ready to score
Again Ill ask what are you too young for
Im the dopest female
Im the dopest female
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
Last but not least yo heres a description
Hard workin not one that sells prescription
So if youre in school thats okay
Get straight As and Ill be back on Friday
You wont miss me you know where to find me
And these words I will say finally
Never let age restrict you from whatcha wanna do
Whether youre young or ninetytwo
So if youre seventeen or around that age
baby come to the stage
And if I didnt change your mind Id find that odd
So when I ask this think hard
Call me the Master
Call me the Master
Swingin with Master T
