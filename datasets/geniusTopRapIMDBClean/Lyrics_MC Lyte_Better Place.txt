Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember  remember 
Theyre in a better place  in heaven 
Up there somewhere far away
And theyll be waiting for you to join them one day
I know you keep them in your heart
That special part Didnt care to share
Thought hed always be there
But he had to go It was his time to fly
Though he struggled to live
See we all gotta die
Dont question why
Its just how life goes
It just happened to be your number one homie that God chose
Your sadness shows your woes your sorrows
But keep in mind the sun will shine tomorrow
Now hes gotta halo an everlasting glow
And its painful but only God knows
Whats next on the agenda  yeah 
Either way you gotta return to sender
But while youre here you gotta keep ya head up
Moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil hes a liar and ya feed up cmon
Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember  remember 
Theyre in a better place  in heaven 
Up there somewhere far away
And theyll be waiting for you to join them one day
Release and let go the fault wasnt ours
She was called upon by a much higher power
Whats important for us all to understand
Were just little pieces in Gods big plan so
Hold on when I tell you hold on stay strong and it wont be long
Till you see your little boy again your mommy again your brother again
Your best friend
Sometimes you just wanna ball out his name
Seem like your sun dont shine the same but you gotta maintain
Remain sane know youre not to blame
But while youre here
You gotta keep your head up
Keep moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil hes a liar and ya feed up cmon
Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember  remember 
Theyre in a better place  in heaven 
Up there somewhere far away
And theyll be waiting for you to join them one day

I know its hard living life after death
Sometimes hard to see what you got left
Now youre feelin lost dont know what to do
Dont let the demons out there try to fool you
Give it all to God hell pull you through
Jehovahll make a witness out of you
You know its true but its hard to realize
That Gods still there when your best friend dies
Theyll be times when you just fall apart
Just remember to keep them always in your heart
Let the tears fall its okay to cry
Try to understand its his time to fly
Theres a time when a spirit to say peace and release
From a body thats left deceased
Youve got to know theres so much more than whats right here
Have no fear
Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember  remember 
Theyre in a better place  in heaven 
Up there somewhere far away
And theyll be waiting for you to join them one day
