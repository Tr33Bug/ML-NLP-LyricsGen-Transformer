Verse 1  India 
Now its India India I get into ya styles I got plenty a
Im bout it bout it you know my ones stay crowded
Fuck around and doubt it and get that ass louded
The future me 2003 ultra magnetic this MC  MCs MCs MCs freeze 
Im not afraid of you niggas Im ready for the masses
I keep it tight like spandex do asses
Palmers cocoa butter for the ashes while Chanel laces up my lashes
Uh oh no stop It dont get hot because I locked it
Got it give me 6 million like you gave 2Pac it
Hot forever coz thats how I plotted
chorus 
Verse 2  G Salah 
Im that R rated nigga from the films with mistique
With taste from the hamptoms but still street
Dont sleep I reach the ghetto to elite
Blessed with the vocals gifted with the feet
Pretty nigga pearly white teethe
I cant for now coz my mind says from Asia
Im unreachable fuck a portable and pager
Made nigga no time for posin leavin niggas like Moses
Front and get swollen The black italian G Salah the chosen
I beat you down with love get you stuck frozen
Coz I talk shit like caches and I backs it
Can you match this my magic
Catcy like habits digest and swallow
The G Salah tablet baby wah you beautiful
chorus 
Verse 3  MC Lyte 
I resonate like 808s but with a ill tone
Lyte the oddesy full blown
From Cali to Medina the head turner Tina
Belle Venezuela rockin Argentina
Hot like heaters swift like cheeters
From where I stand grass remains greener
Let me tell you bout a girl maybe I shouldnt
I met her in Brooklyn and her shit is always cookin 
See I be flowin yes constantly
Thats why the cabbage that I stack is deep winter green
And the way that I be hittin unlike any other sister I get into your
System man I make you listen
I give give back 10 fold Lana on the ill trio
India Gio we know its broke down so lets blow
chorus till fade
