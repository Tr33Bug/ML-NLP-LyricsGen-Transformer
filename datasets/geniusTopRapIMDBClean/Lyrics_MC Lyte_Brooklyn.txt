 Brooklyn Brooklyn Brooklyn 
I got the intro along with the cash flow
Make all the bad boys seem like nymphos
Yeah Im hard I get sexy like Veronica
I use sex as an instrument like the philharmonica
No I aint tall but Im small and Im slender
Ask him whos been in shit is like tender
If he didnt like it then return to sender
He didnt do that its too fat he remembers
Never ever have I ever said I was good lookin
Just one badass bitch from Brooklyn
Not here to steal your loot your coat your rocks
Makin niggas drop whenever we hit the block
They hear Brooklyn and we up to no good
Well here we come so there goes your neighborhood
Timbos scuffed up sess bein puffed up
Mess with the wrong one kid you get ruffed up
Peace to my people in
Brooklyn Brooklyn Brooklyn 
You know the place 
I got the rhythm thatll rip up shows
Blow down foes they kill at will to get a taste of my flow
Vocally I rock locally and worldwide
Those that got bad wish they woulda never tried
Cause when you come from where I come from
You gotta be tough
Cause niggasll call your bluff quick enough
Cause if your hood is like my hood you gotta think quick
Shit stink niggas are slick have you turnin tricks
I gotta give it up to Mr Cool J
For givin up the props to the girls around the way
It aint safe after dark to throw a jam in the park
If you wanna get naughty bring your forty to the arc
Cause we get down when it comes to a jam
Just watch your backpocket keep a eye on the man
If your town is like my town you dont wanna mess around
Wind up gettin bagged up beat down
Peace to my people in
Brooklyn Brooklyn Brooklyn 
You know the place 


Everyhwere that I step they know my rep
Cause Im sayin and doin ill shit they wont forget
Breakin down doors although I never break laws
Come to a town thats yours and I be rippin the whole tour
Comin hard for your section slow up
Live in the flesh and about to blow up
So yo come down and then get the fuck up
Looks are hooked you lucked up youre booked
You gotta be hard cause I aint with softies
Hit then you miss gotta get offa this
So come with your game cause you cant be lame
As soon as you walk Im forgettin your name
As long as you know all that enter are equal
Straight from the Lyte I send peace to my people
Yeah 
Peace to my people
Yeah 
Peace to my people
Peace to my people on the east coast
Peace to my people on the west
Peace to the people up north
Peace to the people down south
