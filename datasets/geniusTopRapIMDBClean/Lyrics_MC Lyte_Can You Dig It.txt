I got the charm and the wit of a pop hit
But Im street Catch the beat
Dont drop it just dont stop it
Dont you dare step off the topic
That I got a onetrack mind and this tracks all mind
The whole three four five six seven eight nine
In the pocket burstin in the air are rockets
Creatin lots of Lyte  get it
How many different ways can I say it
Piano Man how many ways can you play it
I spell it out the LYTE
Without a doubt Got to be funky
And it damn sho nuff is
It gotta be like that in this rough biz
Of music baby use it or lose it
Whats funky is funky you cant refuse it
I got a grip on the groove and it wont move
An inch until I pinch this party
Can you dig it	Right on	Right on  4X 
Its my style love it or lump it
Its my beat pass it or pump it
And it thumps like a heartbeat
And when it gets old it wont get weak
Itll get stronger much stronger
Long live the King but the Lyte lives longer
Its well argumented and well documented
I hold the title of the best you cant prevent it
With a ten foot pole you cant hold em
Born to be wild is what a song once told me
Was my destiny so I strive to be the best
Lo and behold
Every rhyme I write you gots to chant them
Every song I sing a national anthem
Is there a message in my music
If I can do it  you can do it
Can you dig it	Right on	Right on  8X 
The L Y T E has to make
funky funky funky hit records Constantly
So in the advent of an event
I have to invent a dope style comment
I come off with flyin colors
I keep my own identity compared to no others
Its hard to do but I pull it through
Cause Im Lyte the MC thats what I do
The body snatcher yo I gots to catch a
MC head up bring on a batch of
New ones so I can systematically do em
The old ones HUH I already been through em
Two by two I do em like Noah
Yes you know the time so lets go
The bottom line is Im funk bound
KRock and Master T lets get down
Can you dig it	Right on	Right on  8X
