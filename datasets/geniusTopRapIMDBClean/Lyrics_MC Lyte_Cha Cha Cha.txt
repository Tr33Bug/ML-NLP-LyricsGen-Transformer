You can chachacha to this Mardis Gras
Im the dopest female that youve heard thus far
And I do get better the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt  as long as you let her 
Do my thing with an 89 swing
The dopeness I write I guarantee delight
To the hiphop maniac the Uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition youll find them in the hospital
Visiting time I think its on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And Ill blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and Ill lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say come on
Ive got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time Ill eat you up with a rhyme
But Ill let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on thats suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok lets say you didnt know what you were doing
Youre new in town and youre looking around
For another name to ruin and its me that youre pursuing
Well well well Ill be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital LYTE
And its shocking Im the one youre mocking
Oh yes Ive been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back its plain to see
That youre a wannabe but you cant be what youre not
So you better start living with what you got
Yeah DJ KRock when you hear a scratch
Now its time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And youre the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the nonbeliever
That Im a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So dont ever second guess me
And if youre wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And Ill bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light Itll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night
Kick this tip
Kick this one here for me and my DJ
