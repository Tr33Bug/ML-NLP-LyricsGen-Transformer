Get it if you can if you cannot get up off the pot
You been missing pissing up the spot a lot
And Ive been waiting on the sideline give you the guideline
Get up in that pocket like a pocket light but they dont rock it right
They dont concern me cant even burn me
Not even with a lighter all them liars they aint worthy
You heard me Im a loner me myself and I
Im a powerhouse ready to collide with the greatest tide
Its like a typhoon in the making
What Im saying leave your whole city shaking broken down better start praying
I aint playing this aint hopscotch on the block or skelly up in den streets
Get jelly whenever we meet
Chic Im about my paper dudes see ya later
South side of the equator so hot gotta thank my maker
Im here flow with the best of them get low with the rest of them
Rang the alarm in 88 and Im still buzzin
Cousin they trying to hate but I just elevate
Get it straight Im Lyte as a rock and they featherweight
You said you seen it all but you aint never seen the Lyte
They talk a good game but they aint ready for this life
Im trying to give you the code let the future unfold
I had to follow them rules thats how I open them doors
I put that work in check
Hustle hard check
I paid my dues yep
I gave you hits like Ruffneck
And Im still grinding yep
Still shining yep
Im all thats left yep
Im still the best but you aint yet
Im living life to the fullest everywhere I go they ask
How you pass like a bullet speed of Lyte and that Lytro gas
Here I go there I go here I go again
I aint no fad like Michael Jack they know Im Bad
Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good
You from the hood you understood and understand just who I am
I live to be free I live for the beat I live for the biz
Thats what it is no wondering I get it in I get it done
You are the one but I am the Lyte without me youre out of sight
Im taking this entire game to a new height
Just watch me just like you do YouTube and Hulu
Lyte is back and all over this map like who knew
Rapping to you listen because I might not say it again
Find good people wave them in
Let them haters and them  aint know saving them
Its casualties in this game of life that may not seem right
So if you get it then get it get it then get it right
You said you seen it all but you aint never seen the Lyte
They talk a good game but they aint ready for this life
Im trying to give you the code let the future unfold
I had to follow them rules thats how I open them doors
I put that work in check
Hustle hard check
I paid my dues yep
I gave you hits like Ruffneck
And Im still grinding yep
Still shining yep
Im all thats left yep
Im still the best but you aint yet
