To the beat yall To the beat yall Just clap your hands just clap your hands 
To the L to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
Rock the house rock the house rock the house 
Now I cold rock a party in a bgirl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and its all good and if you understood
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard You get that booty scarred
Im a veteran which means that Ive been
In the game too long since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when Ive been putting it down
Ask your homies whos the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly sting like a bee
Spectacular over MIC
I go for broke never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme bite if you dare
I get the paper so I dont care
Fly thats me the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it aint hard to tell that I
Back off me and let my skin breathe Lyte is everlasting
Its hard to believe I shall prevail cause Im next to none
Cause Im claiming no set Dont plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where Im from
But Im resting in Studio City for the fun
If you dont understand then say you dont  nah 
And dont wait for me to explain cause I wont
You see its in my nature to be the best  say what 
West to East see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and Im live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause its crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor George
Its 96  its all about show and prove and Im about to
Make the ill type moves I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it aint hard to tell that I
Get out my shit please let me be
I dont see why you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand Im a woman in the land of hiphop
And the shit dont stop
It goes on on on on
You see the shit dont stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hiphop scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that Id like to share  yeah right 
But Id rather do Kani dont ask why 5001 my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk what theyve ever done for you
You better get down with your real crew
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it aint hard to tell that I
To the L to the Y and the T to the E
Rock the house and rock the house
