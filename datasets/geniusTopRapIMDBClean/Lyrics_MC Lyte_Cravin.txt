I wanna know
Im done waiting
Theres a passion in the air that Im craving
And I cant hold out dont wanna hold back
I cant hold out for you
I cant hold out dont wanna hold back
I cant hold out for you
Time to live life make it amazing
Been craving since the days of Days Inn
Now Im at the Four Seasons I got a reason
To celebrate something to believe in
Great times great minds think alike
You aint for doing it right then get a life
What time in this game means is bittersweet
But even my enemies know Im the centerpiece
No more waiting time to post up
Somebody yell Action  time for closeups
Ready for the blastoff dudes take your hats off
Respect diamonds on my neck  now thats boss
Good living never hurt nobody
Ladies grab your honey fellas grab your hottie
Lets make it a moment that well never forget
Like nothing ever will be better than this
Na na na na
Na na na na
Hands up if you know that youre feeling the vibe
Hands up if you know we gon get it tonight
We gon party like nobodys 
Hands up if you really bout getting your cream
Hands up if you interested in reaching your dreams
Its like yeah keep em in the air
Its bout to go down and we bout to take you there
