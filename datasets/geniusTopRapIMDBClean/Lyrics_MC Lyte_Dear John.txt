Dear John
Know this life has been filled with stress and pain
If I could I would take it all away
All away
I know you gotta feel like your back is pinned against the wall most times
But in those times you remain open
Closed minds will get you nowhere
Gotta move with no fare so dear
I salute you
Knowing everything youve been through is just a journey
Every man must take the key
For some its not to make the same mistakes
And fall victim to the chaos the world creates
In the heat of the moment
You can mistake an ally for an opponent
And wipe your own out
What a waste and an evasive hate
You discover that its too late
x2 
What you wanna do
So you wanna be ballers shot callers
Dippin in the Benz straight lawless
Or would you rather be fathers to your daughters
Even though its getting harder
A letter to the better to better the demonstration
Situation got you wishin for ventilation
Cant a nigga breathe trying to find what I believe
Its hard for a tree to grow when father figures leave
Plus I got a seed and my baby mama need
Smoke a little weed to keep my mind free
Only God can judge me so to him I plead
Fifth in my hand the myth of a man
That I should know it all and I aint supposed to fall
Getting locked up and boxed up protocol
Writings on the wall fighting for the cause
Read a letter from the world and it said Its yours
x2 
Confused with those who say they have your back
I feel your pain I know youre under attack
To be strong in all things in all ways just aint real so some stray
Lives left in hallways deaths breath is in the air
Let your thirstful life persevere
Someone once said you were chosen
Bus as you gotten older doors are now closin
Karma comes around
And all those silly things you did as a grown child are wheelin down in your direction
But not all hope is lost
Gather your thoughts for the second coming
And Im guessing youll be stronger than youve ever been
Ever

  x2
