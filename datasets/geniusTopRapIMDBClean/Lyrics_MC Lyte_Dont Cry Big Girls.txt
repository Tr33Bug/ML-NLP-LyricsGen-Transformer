This is Lyte and Im just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone
Of my voice cause yo I know Im your choice
So when I am speaking show your gratitude
While I am teaching I have no attitude
Im just here to get the job totally done
85 work 15 fun
Sometimes I admit I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme I just cant fight it
Cant stop the flow its just too persistant
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
Cant stop the flow its just too persistant
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other Ill never be beaten at a
Rap meeting in other words a battle
Cause yall Im like a farmer and yalls the cattle
Be a big girl about it dont you start cryin
Thatll mean I made you weep without even tryin
Lyte takes it like a big girl Im no jive girl
Comin direct tellin you that Im a live girl
Im positive youve heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Dont talk behind my back confront me like a big girl
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
Dont talk behind my back confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls we dont fight over men
Although theres one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again its not worth my while
And its also not a big girl style
And I know youre thinkin Wait Lyte is slim and short
While being brought up I was also taught
Take it like it comes and proceed with the flow
Lyte is the biggest of the big girls and now you know
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
This is dedicated to Milk Dee from the Audio 2
To Gizmo from the Audio 2
The whole Alliance crew
You know what Im sayin
And to all the big girls
Also the small girls
You got time to grow up to be big girls
Big girls dont cry
Big girls dont cry
