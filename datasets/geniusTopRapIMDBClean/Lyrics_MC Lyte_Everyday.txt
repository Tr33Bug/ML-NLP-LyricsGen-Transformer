Every day I need my shit done in a special way everyday
Off the top see me and want to serve
Just thinkin about what they need
Aint that some nerve now look here 24 hours and
7 whole days I demand my respect
I demand my praise everyday that I wake
I gotta have everything done with no mistakes
I take it incredibly slow dont try to rush me
No means no I never said a no that meant yes
Other women get taken for granted
I guess I got a wish list that must be fulfilled
And you gets none until I get my toes sucked
And my eyebrows plucked
I need my car waxed and floor shellac
I need my back rubbed and da bubbles in the tub
That float to the bed so that we can make love
Every day I need my shit done in a special way
Everyday Everyday
Every day I need my shit done in a special way everyday
Everyday Everyday
It aint to ask for when
I come off tour to have my truck washed
Or my body massaged all the bills paid i send home
All my dough and you being my man it just aint for show
All the lovey dovey yeah that is sweet
But honey bunny you gotta earn your keep
And my motto is its work before fun
But dont sleep cause I need a lot of shit done
And cold harded yeah check out whatever is clever
And get to stepping if you know somthing better
If not then respect whatcha got
Meanwhile I got a new ride at the lot
Pick it up and bring it back to the spot
This is how we do it this is how we do it now everyday
I need it done in a special way baby tell them how it goes
Every day I need my shit done in a special way
Everyday Everyday
Every day I need my shit done in a special way everyday
Everyday Everyday
On the real I need a man that understands me and
Realizes the reality Im in the MC industry which means
I want to live lovely I gotta make money
Listen so never ask me to give it less then what I got
If its too hot nigga then raise up out my spot
If its my trade i made up the black ace of spade
Alone in the world its me you cant fade
Its my life I do it my way
You dont like my way Then hit the highway
See Im special not because Im MC lyte but because
Im a women with the gift to bear life its done
Yes Ive rested my case now run pick up my dermalogical
For my face this is how it goes down everyday
I need it done in a special way baby
