He knows hes leaving not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week nervous and uptight
Losing sleep stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
To push in the bush but took his time
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with
Shared needles with
Wish he could go back change the direction
But now hes got the infection
I spoke to him gave him inspired words
Im sure hes heard
Live by the sword die by the sword
Whats left pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
Because the eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
I look into his eyes but hes so high
From the crack he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesnt like solving
Takes one hit and thinks the world stops revolving
19 his eyes full of tears
He hasnt smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
Robbed and killed her because of the crack pipe
Hes wanted by the law
Because hes robbed at least three grocery stores
Hes lost all control
Take a look eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
I look into her eyes shes so young
But I know where shes comin from
Ive watched her grow little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried fear in her voice
Not knowing she had a choice
Oh so sad oh so lonely
If she knew that shes not the only
One in school that didnt use the caution
Facin raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum shes goin to the GYN
To put it to an end
Shes learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
Eyes are the soul
