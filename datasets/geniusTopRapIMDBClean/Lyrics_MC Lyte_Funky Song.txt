Uhh Yeah yeah
Funky song ha ha
Cause aint nothin goin on but a funky song
Yes yes yes
KRocks is gonna rock I mean go get hype
So you people all aboard and Lyte has the light
Fresh this dope promise this too strong
And yo you cant go wrong with a funky song
I dont know the reason
For which that Ive become fanatic
For some bass drums and a few hihats
But yo please dont say microphone
Cause Ill be forced to kick whoever thinks they king off they throne
But yo people talk speakers and sneakers if you wanna
Yeah I like the cars that go boom I wont front yup
Annnd people talkin woofers and the tweeters
I like to go above ten on the volume cause yo its
Just a touch or bass  a little bit a little bit 
Now check the rhythm the rhyme yeah it fits
It steals your mind like a needle
And then holds on to it like a hostage
And amazement is shown on ALL your faces
To what MC Lyte has given
Yo Im definitely proud to say
Those that never heard the tunes well its time to vic
So cough up your dollars put your money where your mouth is
And we can surely as hell get down to business
Dont ever doubt me or what Im capable of
I have to show and prove that I am a thug
Or should I say the ultimate yeah thats perfect
Cause Im as ultimate as money can get
So get the ghetto blaster boombox whatever you call it
Grab it by the handle and start to haul it
If youre chillin in your car open up your back windows
Turn the volume up and let the sounds flow
Or pop a tape in your Benzi box
And drive ten miles per hour through every block
So they can hear the hiphop pumpin in the ride
And when youre finished press autoreverse and play the other side
When youre talkin to my deejay a talk a crossfader
His organized Technicsll leave a flavor later
Cause just like a basshead CHIN crack greater
And try his hits like Yo this sure tastes
Im in high pursuit hope I dont have to shoot
Get down or sit down with all of you
So when you call on my deejay a call him KRock
And when you thought you heard it all here comes the shock
My rhymes hotter than a danger lie
Its just like that dont ask why
But Im cool cooler than the rocks on a mountaintop
Cause yo Lyte lift the party up further yup
And if youre comin to the jam yo its like a hijack
Once you step in theres no turnin back
Its hypnotism done every time
Youre stickin out your tongue to get a taste of the rhyme
And just like I planned it satisfies your tastebuds
Its silky and milky cause your mouth to flood all over you
Dribble and drool you still remain cool
Cause thats what Im like rap is made to do
But anyway since I dont think my job is complete
Say goodnight til the next time we meet
