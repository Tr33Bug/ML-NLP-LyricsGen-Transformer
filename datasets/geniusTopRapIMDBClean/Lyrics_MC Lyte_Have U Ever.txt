Have you ever ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the Lyte
Repeat 
As I zoom with the Z down the Avenue
Who it be me less the crew
Why you talkin that whoopied doo whoo
Im makin moves thats smoother than
The cream or the sweat from a wet dream
Drippin wit Vaseline
My Mabeline left a ring on the scene
I got mad peeps down with the tag team
Listen you couldnt front it you want to
Trying to escape now Im the one that youre running to
Looking at my tag its about that time
For you to get yours for me to get mine
I got our shit poppin wheelies like a Ninja
The inner of my center keeps you warm in the winter
My placenta is on high overload my complete context
Can get so complex I might explode
On the scene like a nuclear bomb
While the children scream Im yelling Ring the alarm
Have you ever ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the Lyte
Repeat 
This is going out to all the ruffnecks
And hood rats Jermaine hit me off with the track
Yo Brat if youre wit me holla let me know where youre at
I be the stage wrecker rhyme manifester
Feel the pressure coming
Straight off Elektra the shit that be
Kicking is off the wall crazy
You cant see what I can see cause youre
Blind baby born a slave die a slave
Representing from the cradle to the grave
Cause we living in the last day coming through your TV in 3D
Its the Lyte representing for the female species
Letting em know that they cant even
Have you ever ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the Lyte
Repeat 
What do we have here an impostor
Perpetrator fake playre trying to get on the roster
I keep trying to warn em and drop it all on em
Rap my collapse when they attack
And drop the bomb on em blown to dust
Either roll with us or get rushed in in God we trust
Cause its a must that I kick it like I hear it
Speak it like I see it
Its the spirit I aint go to see it to believe it
I take the form of the rain in a storm
As I get warm like the rays of the sun
Here I come like a hurricane ready to
Be reborn let me be the first to welcome
You to the terrordome the unknown zone
A Million miles away from home
The clock is ticking time is up before the world destructs
Or the universe erupt
Ima be the one to lights this motherfucker up
Have you ever ever in your long living life
Seen a woman rock the mic
Like the one called the Lyte
Repeat
