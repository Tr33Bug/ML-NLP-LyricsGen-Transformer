I am woman hear me roar
When I grab the mic its never a bore
When Im on stage sayin a rhyme
I often wonder what ya think of mine
Is it fresh or weak or is it live or dead
Yo its got ta be somethin if youre boppin your head
To the beat can I get an amen brother
Liked that rhyme Well here goes another
Hold up hold up hold up Check it out Before we go any further we
Gotta announce who we are I am DJ KRock and this is my homegirl MC
Lyte Kick it for em
We had to pause for station identification
Now ya know my name heres some more information
Well lets see what you wanna know about me
MC LYTE
Nah thats too corny
Nah that gets the guys too horny
Now that sounds conceited
But what is true is true so it has to be repeated
The best is Lyte when Im on the mic
And MCs look straight ahead cos this pitchll make your neck tired
And I say loosen up and relax
The fiction you been livin Imma fill with facts
Right now
MC Lyte DJ KRock Name of the group is Me and My DJ Kickin it
Live in 88 Do it
I am woman hear me roar
Comin out fresher and flyer than I did before
Thats right Im well respected
Dont get stupid Im well protected
If ya wanna battle Im well prepared
Me and KRock are far from scared you know what
Were brave livin in a cave of gold
Waitin for the misbehaved to get bold
But as I look around so far so good
MCs behaving just like they should
Hands are folded no whispering or passing notes
All attention to me ya have to devote
Im like a teacher but then again not quite
Cos a teachers salary I make in a night
On the mic rhymes witty and bright
Maybe thats why the name is Lyte
Yo bust it Imma end it right here
DJ KRock you end it over there
