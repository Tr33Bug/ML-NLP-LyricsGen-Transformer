I am the Lyte	 repeated 
Examine the style used in this sequence
The rhymes the clue the records evidence
To the fact that Im hypin this episode
Cold carryin the extra wide load
The beat is fat and the rhyme is thick
All over the town you hear the sound and pick
Me the L the y the t the e
Me and if you see the Rock Im sure youll see
Me  Hey Lyte what will you be doin 
Kickin it bashin down competition
And when I drop the bomb youll listen
Boom Now that Ive got your attention
Im slammin what you wanna hear
I just thought that I should mention
89 is the Lyte year
Nows the time to roll like a rhinoceros
Step to Lyte thats preposterous
Im heavyweight though Im lightweight
My looks the hook my rhymes the bait
And when I throw the line you proceed to take
The goody the treat that I hand you
That you couldnt refuse
Damn I cram to understand you
Your love is to Lyte to lose
I think you deserve this you waited long enough
For a rhyme thats superduper extra tough
Every human is lurkin and loomin
Puba on the beat and you know the shit is boomin
Tasty like pastry fresh from the bakery
First Priority thats the way it has to be
Feel the drum I bet it makes your body numb
One for all and all for one I bet you come
Hurry hurry step right up and see the show
MC Lyte and KRock are about to throw
Get on line and purchase your ticket
Hey dont worry  Lyte is gonna kick it
Go on be happy  I put you up on the scoop
Now come and watch the party hoop
I am the Lyte and it is time for me to go
You wanna beef save that shit for the toilet bowl
I use styles styles and much many styles
I leave smiles smiles and much many smiles
On the people who come to see the Lyte perform
Word is bond 
The rhyme will kick as the brain will tick
You can tell because the recordll sell
Old styles and new styles formatted together
Bold or dull so it doesnt matter whether
Which comes first or vicea versa
It wont make a difference as long as you rehearsea
Get it down pat and come right and exact
MC Lyte is comin right and Ima say goodnight
