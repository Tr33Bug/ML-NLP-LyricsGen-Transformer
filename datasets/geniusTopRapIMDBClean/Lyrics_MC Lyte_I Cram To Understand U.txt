I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I dont know why cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldnt tell me nothin cause Sam was number one
Cause to me oh my gosh he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That hed use me for my money and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye and then he kept walkin
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what Im talkin
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam he just broke up with his girlfriend Terri
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said Hello my name is Sam I said Hi my name is Lyte
We yipped and we yapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that from sneakers to hats
He said Look Im in the mood for love
Simply because youre near me
Lets go  To my house lay back and get nice
Watch television Riunite On Ice
I said Slow down I know you wanna shake me down
But Im not one of the girls that go rippin around
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door there was a girl on the couch
I said Whos the frog the bump on the log
You chump you punk how could you do me wrong
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong
You said Wait Lyte youre confused the girl is my cousin
Your brother agreed but later she said that she wasnt
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Forgotten next month we went to the Deuce
Well I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody
Asked ya how you met em said you met em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff
I said Its not your business so shut the fuck up
They said Okay Lyte think what you wanna think
But its gon be some shit when your man becomes a fiend
I said Look to bust a move I dont even know you
To put it Lyte I really dont care to
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said We only lookin out for yo best interest
I said Thanks but no thanks in an aggravated tone
When I wanna find out I find out on my own
Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well Im clawin my thoughts I wonder who she could be
Youre spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and youre with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K
I strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin
But I just couldnt do it cause my heart kept yellin
Burning begging for affection from you Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man
But Just like a test
Jujust like a test
Jujust like a test
I cram to understand you
Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why you said Exercise tryina stay slim
I bought it even though I knew it was a lie
Cause it really didnt matter you were still lookin fly
But oh no oh no you started askin me for money
Butter me up beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10
I said I only got a 20 you said Give me that then
I said Nope Ill tell you now you better stop slobbin
Find you a job or you better start robbin
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin it I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack smoke sniff and chewin it
And as for this girl Miss C oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard Samuel
When your homeboys told me I almost went wack
That the girl you was addicted to her name was Crack
