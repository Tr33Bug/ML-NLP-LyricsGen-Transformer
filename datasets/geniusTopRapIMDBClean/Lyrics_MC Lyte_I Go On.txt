Yeah This is Lyte coming at you Shouting out to everybody in the hood up to no good The ruffneck got it going on Yeah and ima do it like this
Now kick it
You flap your tongue and talk about this and that
But all of that wrong rap is real whack
Im on a roll of my own you cant play me
So when you talk about the Lyte get it right baby
Because I think Im all that making niggas call back
They hit the cat and I refuse to call em back
It aint worth it for the moment or the minute
You was in it then you want it but no now ya done kid
Im only taking shorts if it means Im wearing em
Some of these guys yo Im only scared of them
They cant handle what I got to give and always will
Im not the run of the mill
I got skills I go on and on as ya boy K Born
But I had to kick em out before the dawn turn em on
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow ya dont stop
I go on and on and on and on
Let it flow or ya dont stop
A night owl on the prowl heres a victim
Soon as I spot em bu duh duh duh duh stick em
Now I got em where I want him
And hes all mine no crime but now hes on prime time
We hit the door did the booty in the slow mo
I like to spank em gave em bacon on the down low
But thats all thats it see ya later hops
I gave ya props but Im gonna drop ya at the bus stop
Cause you was on it like a hornet dog on it
Got me heated then ya beat it now you know just how to treat it
You kinda slow tho when it comes to brain cells
But you can go cause I came and I did it well
Sorry to hurt ya but honey Im a real one
You got to go if you aint the funky feel one
And when Im out it I hope that ya not torn
Because my brother life goes on
Now lets swing back on the topic
Brothers wanna pop it knock it and lock it
Im not having it cause I control my destiny
Im never letting a punk get the best of me
So ease up if yo you on a jealous tip
Im not about to be the victim in the news clip
Cause unlike some girls I fight back
Or get the boys double up and do a head crack
I only here for the righten night
To be hit not smack not slapped or kicked
So if you coming my way you gotta be strong
Strong enough to know that hitting a women is wrong
Cause just like you I can find others
Too brothers that do the do quicker than you
So if you looking for a straight up relationship
Keep looking cause I aint staying kid
Because Im outta and I hope that ya not torn
But never give up cause life goes on
Yeah coming at you for 1993 pumping in ya car pumping ya jeep
Just like that I like to give a shoutout to Brooklyn in the house Queens Staten Island Long Island Uptown Bronx New York is definitely in effect LA Detroit Chicago Atlanta Virgina Carolinas Cacalac Cacalac
