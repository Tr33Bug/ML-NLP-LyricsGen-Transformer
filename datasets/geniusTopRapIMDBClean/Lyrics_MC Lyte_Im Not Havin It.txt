Uhm whats up baby I been eyeing you
Time and time again I been trying to
Get a little closer but you wont let it
Well if I see something I want I just go out and get it
Im like a fluzy Im choosy and I dont fall for tricks
Cause guys be running games like the New York Nicks
But on the square dear you know your style really temps me
Dont try to gas me up on a tank that is empty
Im Positive and Im kicking the facts
Well Im Lyte and you got to kick it better than that
But Im all the way live but Im definitely not crabbing
There are just certain things Im just not having
Excuse me miss
No Im not havin it
Excuse me miss
No Im not havin it
Excuse me miss
No Im not havin it
Excuse me
You think youre all that No you think youre all of this
With your baby baby talk and your Excuse me miss
Well I smooth and hey look its only right
I thought that we could get together and maybe we can 
Yeah sounds good but guys like you just wanna hit and run
Look were not the two and Im not the one
So if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
Kill that And get a five dollar crackhead
But Im all the way live but Im definitely not crabbing
There are just certain things Im just not having
I think you try to diss me or play me like Im cooly
No matter of fact love I think that youre a cuty
Theres just certain things you dont understand baby
Every woman wants to be treated like a lady
So what You want me to kick it as if Im a doc
Listen to what Im saying and shut 
Im just tryna put it so I can make something happen
You just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
Look Im all the way live and Im definitely not crabbing
A bit of change for a woman thats what Im not having


I keep feelings inside I know who I am
Step to yourself cause I dont wanna hear it
I keep feelings inside I know who I am
Youre not getting younger youre just getting older
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Friend Im never gonna fall in love again
But getting back to the topic of convo
In my book hone you are a nono
Cmon Im clean cut and dapper you got to admit that
I dont sell drugs and I aint with the wack track
Im cool and calm my phone is mine
You dont see me snatching taste and acting wild
Excuse me miss I think you better get with this
Scan it damn cause Im simply not having it
