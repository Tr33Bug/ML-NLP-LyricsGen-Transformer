Keep On Keepin On  Remix  Lyrics
Remix check it out
Bboy where the fuck you at
I been looking for youre ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer thats when you had enougha
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
Youre getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby down this Mimosa
You better believe its time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade too bad to be played
Get vexed and Im bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whos body your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life aint all that unless youre doing it right
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Beware of the stare when I step the piece
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
Ayes I can can or why not
If I wanna yes I can can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixtynine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice sugar for my booga
Juicy like HiC or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I aint afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and Ill get rid of all company


Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didnt perform well
They gets no answer when they ringaringa my bell
Youre playing with my time trying to jerk me
Hurt me then desert me you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the LYTE
Only the strong survive only the wise excel
Once said by my borninhell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the streets
Cause that aint cool and that aint cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But its all good though you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey make your move and hop up on it
Its natural never be ashamed
Fuck the fame get the name and kick the game
All you gotta do is  Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin on
Its the remix uh
Yes baby uh
Ya dont stop
It goes on and on and ya dont stop
Just keep it on
Keep on keepin on
Uh yes yes yall
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin on
2000 uh 2000 2000 watts
Keep on keepin on
