Now I was rockin this party in the 90s Brooklyn
You know where the people get hype
ll rock a party from Friday to Saturday night
48 hours done and I still hold the mic
I try to put you down and say that Im through
But they give it back to me and say Continue
Thats the thing about Brooklyn they never get enough
Of the rap and the music and all the good stuff
That makes your life worth livin for
Respect is the crowd the crowd that I draw
Never am I dissed and never ever shall I be
Aint a MC alive that can deal with me
And if you think youre the one that can deal with this
Well you ah  best prepare for a big fat dis

Now I was chillin in Flatbush mindin my own
When a girl walked up with a chrome microphone
She said Hey MC Lyte I heard about you
So heres the microphone lets see what you can do
So I took the microphone and I threw it to the ground
Cause I need no assist when it comes to gettin down
When I start to rap she start to shake
She knew to confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the microphone off the grey concrete
And before I turned around she was down the street
Now kick this one for Brooklyn
Cha   cha   cha 
Kick this one for the 90s
Boom   chacha 
Now kick this one here for Me  My DJ
Boom   cha   boom   cha   boom 


Now when Im on the stage everyone starts starin
Is it what Im sayin or is it what Im wearin
5050 chance its what Im sayin
And at the same time what my deejay is playin
If you can get hype and sort of like loud
Yo KRock kick this one for the crowd
I been to lots of parties mostly Uptown
And one thing I noticed young people get down
So hiphoppers hiphoppers from all around
Get with the funky sound
Kick this one for Brooklyn
Cha   cha   cha 
Now kick this one for the 90s
Boom   chacha 
Now kick this one here for Me  My DJ
