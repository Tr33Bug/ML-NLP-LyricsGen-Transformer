Do you understand the metaphoric phrase Lyte as a Rock
Its explaining how heavy the young lady is
You know what Im saying King
Yes my brother but I would consider Lyte as a Rock
A simile because of the usage of the word as
And now directly from the planet of Brooklyn
MC Lyteas a Rock
Must I say it again I said it before
Move out the way when Im coming through the door
Me heavy As Lyte as a Rock
Guys watch even some of the girls clock
Step back it aint that type of party
No reply if you aint somebody
Get out my face dont wanna hear no more
If you hate rejection dont try to score
First base You aint got what it takes
You smile you wink you big fake flake
Youre so pathetic you make my stomach turn
You beg you borrow now you have to learn
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
Lyte as a Rock or I should say a boulder
Rolling down your neck pounding on your shoulders
Never shall I be an emcee called a wannabe
I am the Lyte LYTE
This is the way it is dont ever forget
Hear the rhyme by someone else and you know they bit
All in the way just little obstacles
Chew em up spit em out just like popsicles
Suckers out of my way were not on the same wavelength
I show stability potential and strength
On the other hand you are weak and unruly
Could never be a spy cause youre just a plain stoolie
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
Im a slave Im a slave Im a slave to the rhythm
Def rhymes on the microphone is what Im givin
Yes I am a Rock and you are just a pebble
Milk turn up the bass and Rock adjust the levels
If a rap can paint a thousand words then I can paint a million
Wait Lyte is capable of painting a bazillion raps
So when I say it this is what I mean
Audio Two an alliance on the scene
And Id like to say whassup to my producer King of Chill
Party people are you ready jam if you will
Never underestimate Lyte the Emcee I am a rapper who is here
To make the things the way theyre meant to be
The World Ultimate Im here to take the title
But I had a little trouble upon my arrival
But I got rid of those who tried to rock me
Lyte is here no one can stop me
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
There are HipHop leaders this you know
We also have hiphoppers that follow
By the tone of my voice you can tell I am a scholar
Im also the leader of the hiphop followers
Now get this Im at a jam and Im rockin it
Suckers like a checkerboard when black is clockin it
The grace as I ease across the stage
Bars around the audience sort of like a cage
They laugh cause they assume Im in prison
But in reality theyre locked in
Once again Ill state that I cant be stopped
Cause yo I am as Lyte as Rock
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 6X 
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
