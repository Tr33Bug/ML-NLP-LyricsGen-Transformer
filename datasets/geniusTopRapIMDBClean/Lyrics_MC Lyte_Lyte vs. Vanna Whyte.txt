Lyte vs Vanna Whyte Lyrics
Oh oh my goodness
I cant believe it um
Ill just take a Sony gold microphone
Thats what Id like
And a Yamaha REX50 digital effects processor
Yeah
And a Toshiba TX900 PCM for my DJ
And on that
computer with uh   
And a  set of JBL
JBL speakers
Oh my goodness a four channel noise gate
I want a four channel noise gate
Im dying for a four channel noise gate
And a DVX compressor limit
Oh wait a minute
Forgetjust forget it
Oh my goodness
Just give me that dress
The dress that Vannas wearing
Id like the dress that Vannas wearing
Oh just nevermind just give me the money
Take everything back I want the money
