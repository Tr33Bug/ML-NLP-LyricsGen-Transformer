I may come on strong but thats what you like
You like a female MC who can handle the mic
How do I know Because you told me so
You instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
So thats why Im here dont mean to make a case of it
This rap here well its just for the taste of it
I write the rap to make the whole world sing
And Im the type of female well I like to swing
MC Lyte likes swingin
Party people in the place since you started the case
Of a demonstration I need concentration
So you can make a full examination
Then you will agree that Im the best MC
And so is my deejay on the tables Rock
This is the best jam that you could get
The rap by Lyte and the beat by Stetsa
Beat by Stetsa   beat by Stetsa 
Never turn it down cause its what you requested
Any mic I hold you know the big man pressed it
Sole believer in the rap I say
You believe it too thats why you never walk away
You like the way I do it you like my style
Study me like a book cause you know Im worth your while
Expressions on my face show you just how I feel
Add a rap to my gestures now you know the deal
MC Lyte likes swingin
Cause yo I am the best and that Ill boast
Sit down and be the guest and Ill be the host
Its wack to those that know and those that do not
Like Coke is it I hit the spot
Like good vibrations Im like Sunkist
The rap is smooth cause its sealed with chapstick
Not gonna say that I been rappin since the day of birth
But Ive acquired the knowledge like Ms Butterworth
Ask me whats important I tell you time and effort
Ask me how I do it its Lytes special method
Yeah Lyte is good Bud Lites good for ya
Im exciting just like Toyota
