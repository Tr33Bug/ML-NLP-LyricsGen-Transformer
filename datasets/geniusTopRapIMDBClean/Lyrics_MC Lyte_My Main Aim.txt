To maintain is my main aim
Step aside while I do my dang thang
Im knowing that yall cant hang
To the best what Im doin
Aint nothin bout to change man
Im bout to school all these young cats take em to church
They still rockin the block I move the universe
With a verse I murk any kid up on my turf
Like a lady in Maiti Im shady and ready to burst
Hold up when you roll up
Dont you know the girl Lyte stay swole up
Keep it glazed like a donut
Get em hard now  Pull they card now
Get em tore up from the floor up
I gave em something to remember me 
Should have been a friend of me
Elbows I got you nursin all your injuries
They want the best of me to get next to me
Feel the realness  Then they want to question me
Whered you get that flow from
How long you been rappin and like old men can I come 
On tour with ya
Grab the mic hit the stage get raw with ya
Till I drop on the floor with ya
x2
Im much too quick for this
Your jealousy is like a sickness
I run my life like a business
This is the raw deal no time for small meals
I want a copter to fly me to the lobster
Still workin in the hood but I roll like a rockstar
And get respect like a Rasta
Nobody move nobody get hurt
If you seein my POV you understand my work
Is for the good but the skill still hot
I leave the spot shook so give it your best shot
Im out to make the best out of what I present
And you see me make a dollar out of 15 cent
I keeps the cash flow and I stash it low
They on the other side thinkin how the grass grow
So green so lean so fresh its 
Nothin left to know except Im hot to death
x2
Never burn what I earn
Come smart with the chips floss hard in the whip
And most of these cats know Im hard to get with
So before they get going Ima make em all quit  And sit
And think about a strategy to get close to me
Cause right now youre just soso to me
I keep it so bitter  So gully so wizza
So on and on know that Lytes no quitter
Like that big bunny
Im on a mission for the money
Years later and the haters still want me
Without a CD released Lytes platinum in the streets
When they face the truth they cant compete
When I grace the booth I show my steeze
I got days of proof its about me
I keep it movin like a locomotive
You want a challenge Come on lets toetotoe it
