A friend of mine  Which one  Cecilia
Yeah  has a man  so  a dealer
Which one  Born  Born Supreme
You know the type  Yeah I know what you mean 
Gold and cars  cars and gold
The more he got yo the more he sold
He told her he loved her  Huh gased her head 
Her love he bought just to warm his bed
I tried to tell her but it went out the other ear
She didnt wanna hear what I had to say
She just replied this way
Girl I love him he treats me so good
He gets much respect in my neighborhood 
I cram to understand why she wants this man
Yo he sold the crack to Sam 
I used to be in love 	
But not with a dealer
I used to be in love 
I know how it feels
I used to be in love 
You make love while he makes deals
The story gets worse they threaten her life
A guy walked on her  Yo come here  with a knife
And said  Being with Born is a big mistake
Its a shame your life I have to take
If you leave him now youll be alright
If not you wont make it through the night 
She came to me and said  Lyte what do I do 
Forget about Born or else youre through  Ahh 
She said  But but I love him  Hm I wonder
Is love worth bein six feet under
Nope  And thats on the real tip 
I think its time you skip
Town  Hey girl dont hang around
Or else youll be goin  
Miss C said  No Im stayin with my man
He stands by me so I too must stand 
Girl youre stupid youre gonna take a fall
phone rings   and then she received a call
Hello Listen baby they got a contract on me
I know because Brian warned me
Im outta here goin back to Cali
Grab your stuff and meet me in the alley 
She grabbed her stuff the gold and the cash
Headed for the door in a flash
She said  Im outta here  Now wait just a minute
You know hes a dealer his windows are tinted
Naw  He has truck jewelry and no job
So  Carries ducats in   So what 
Now hell the hell does he get these things
I dont know  The Gucci the Louis the Polo rings
Yeah  Dealers are bad news take it from Lyte
They say they kill you and they might
Youre right Lyte you tell no lie
Just let me go say goodbye 
She ran down the stairs in a minute or more
I heard a thunderous roar
shots   Born and Cecilia  killed by Uzis
See why it pays to be choosy
