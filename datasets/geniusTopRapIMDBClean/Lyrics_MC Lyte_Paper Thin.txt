When you say you love me it doesnt matter
It goes to my head as just chit chatter
You may think its egotistical or just worry free
But what you say I take none of it seriously
And even if I did I wouldnt tell you so
Id let you pretend to read me
And then youll know
Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze
In fact I despise those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over you gotta sink it
I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin word
Im not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
No thats not my strategy not the game I play
I admit I play game but its not done that way
Truly when I get involved I give it my heart
I mean my mind my soul my body I mean every part
But if it doesnt work out yo it just doesnt
It wasnt meant to be you know it just wasnt
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
What you say to me is still paper thin
In one ear and right out the other
I heard his mumbo jumbo  eeeish  lover
I dont pay attention
I dont concentrate
You aint got the bait that it takes to hook this
Ahah ahah ahah
Sucker you missed I put all feelings aside I know who I am
My name is Lyte is your name Sam
Cause if it is step off grab your coat and get lost
Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope
And hit the road Sam dont you come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Sam dont you come back no more
So now I take precaution when choosing my mate
I do not touch until the third or fourth date
Then maybe well kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time that we meet  mmmuaah  like this
Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then maybe Ill let you play with my feet
You could suck the big toe and play with the middle
Its so simple unlike a riddle
Its as easy as counting to 123
In other terms letters LYTE
Ill tell you you you and all of you
In the back and in the middle and the front
Yo thats it paper thin word up
Lyte checkin out
Special dedication to my DJ KRock in the place to be
