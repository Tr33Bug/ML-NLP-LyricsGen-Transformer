I met a guy named Tommy damn he charmed me
Met him at the mall but I knew he wouldnt harm me
We exchanged numbers hopin to meet again
We couldnt wait for the romance to begin
The relationship grew strong
I didnt wanna be right if this love was wrong
But oh no came the problems the first segment
The dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
The second segment started wheelin and dealin
Didnt give a damn about how Lyte was feelin
But then he got wise started treatin me better
Cause all of his friends said I was a gogetter
He knew he was usin me and abusin me
He also knew that soon hed be losin me
First I clocked him yeah I docked him
But I rocked him  and then I dropped him

Then there was Dave couldnt behave
So I punished him and put him in my Lyte as a Rock cave
Then he got bold tried to play insane
So Bigfoot threw him off my Paper Thin train
He tried to 10 Dis me but he pissed me off
Cause Im the boss and you know Im not havin it
Lyte is too dope and you know I aint crabbin it
Then there was Henry way too friendly

When I used to work yes I was a clerk
At the World Trade Center back in high school
This little player musta thought I was a fool

Cause he said Whats up and tried to feel my butt
I kicked him down the stairs and said What youre provin
Rolled him to his car and said Get movin
He tried to score it I wasnt goin for it
