I met him in a club hangin out one night
He said Hello Im Georgehi Lyte
Hows everything going huh How ya doin
Hope everythings fine ooh and uh umm
Can I call you sometime Can I get the digits
And the address so I can come visit
I gave him the digits that wasnt a problem
Cause if he caused any I would have to solve them
Cause George looked good MMM damn good
And if I didnt some other girl would
In my mind I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding Id give him a try
Cause Lyte needs love too and that aint no lie
Keep your ears open hope that you listenin
Cause Im about to take you on a George Porgie mission
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty without you babe
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty
I gave him the number I saw it in his eyes
She gave me the number Hmmm Im surprised
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didnt have to compete
George was mature he made sure
That he was the only man Id ever adore
Girls have you ever had a friend
That youd get with every now and then
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didnt have to be loyal like men should be
I dont care about the other girls just be good to me
But if I ever saw one that would be the end
He couldnt kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didnt care if her ass dont lie
See cause Georgie was into making young girls cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty without you babe
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is
Kissed the girls and
George was clean no drugs and such
But once in a while hed drink too much
Hangin in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend drinkin vodka
I was looking for him and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his  fucked  up hair
I told him he was messin up he wouldnt go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said Dont drive use your head
Drive while youre drunk and youll kill yourself dead
We begin to argue bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread
Ran into the car as if in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didnt care he drove off into the night
Riding for miles without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve he started smokin
Paid no attention when he started chokin
Thoughts flashed through his head there they stuck
Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now hes gone and I cant tell him nothin
Wish he was here so I could say somethin
The story is not to say that Im in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
Youll never know when theyll be layin in a coffin
Wake up its important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow
Believe that And dont think that it cant happen to you
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty without you babe
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty without you babe
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is empty without you babe
Can it be Ive stayed away too long
My world is
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
