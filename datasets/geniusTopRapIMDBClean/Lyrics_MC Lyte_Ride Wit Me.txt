Lytro yeah hm yo
Yeah fuck the rest be nobody can test me
Rich like Nestle thick like Wesley
Snipe out Im the type that be about
Crashin up in ya joint and knockin the lights out
Feelin lovely trust me Im drug free
Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
Cos you sittin on my nerves when weve already heard
That garbage playedout crap you call rap
Some chicks say they love that well Im above that
Calling me a ho wont do its two double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up and be puttin that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me been there smelt the dope and
Rollin with the shelter making niggas jail free
Like a Luger I spit thick shit
That a leave ya squad sick cos I ran up in this shit
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brotha dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brother dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Still got the little frame with the big name
Watch it change cos nah nigga we aint in the same gang
We walk different and we talk a different slang
You a sidekick and Im a four point six range
You a one roof flat Im fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up gettin a tan
Thought you knew Im overdue
And youre overrated so cats are over you
I inspired you come on now no way
that rumour the consumer wont believe it anyway
Never play with the messenger Head on Joan of Arc
When Im coming through these parts like just cut the dark
Im a trendsetter go getter bringer back
Cos Im fed up ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred vision blurred
Cos I serve these words
And pitch them bitches with a curse
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brotha dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brother dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Yo what Im sayin Ive been layin waitin for the right situation
New York hawk city playin back in the BK bomber
Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you wanna we closin after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down dont nobody move Im making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but Im running with the torch
Race got a lot a rats but I cant be caught or bought
Cos I wont sell out thats why me and the big dogs we fell out
Not with a major but Im still major league
Crash ya dome with this  then watch your nose bleed
You want it you can get it anytime
Cos I got many lines for niggas of any kind you know me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brotha dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brother dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brotha dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
Holla get crunk get live with me
Brother dont make you as fly as me
Gotta get yo ass up and vibe with me
Come on ride with me come on ride with me
