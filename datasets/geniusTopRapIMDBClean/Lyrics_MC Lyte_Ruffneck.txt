Gotta who Gotta have a what
Gotta what Yo gotta get a ruffneck
I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin timbos draggin
Frontin in his ride with his home boys braggin
Lying bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But hes a ruffneck so thats alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin noise with the boys up to no good
Clow on the down low
Cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin beef is how he spells relief
Actin like he dont care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and hell be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude the ruffneck bastard
Gotta what Yo gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what Yo gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what Yo gotta get a ruffneck
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck
I need a ruffneck
I need a man thats quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts everything is fitting large
But he dont gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and thats slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
Hes gotta smack it lick it swallow it up style
Drink a beer sittin his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin with his dick hairs
Hes a rudeboy a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it aint ruff it aint right
And if he aint ruff well then hes all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and aint nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck aint in town
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that dont snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin the end cause he knows the street
He eat sleep shit fuck eat sleep shit
Then its back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hitem wit a bit a skins then hes out of there
On the avenue girls are passin thru
Too much of ruffneck so they aint havin you
Hard boppin always grabbin his jock and braggin about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
Thats the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep hell pull the plug on the tour
Pissin in corners doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect now thats a ruffneck
