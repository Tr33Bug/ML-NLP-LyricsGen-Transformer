Shut the Eff Up  Hoe  Lyrics I think its time I start feeling bitchy
Ive been too nice too long
Yup its definitely time I get nasty 
Gon be some shit 
Hot damn ho 
Gon be some shit 
Hot damn ho 
Gon be some shit 
Hot   damn   ho 
Hot damn ho 
Gon be some shit 
Hot damn 
Before this jam starts Im simply stating
You have all waited now you can stop waiting
Shall I ease into the disses go 20 then 30
Or shall I got straight to 80 percent
Aw it doesnt matter when youre dissed youre dissed
The partys not over its just beginning
Because Lyte is winning  What are you winning 
Any battle in any competition
The Gangstress Ha youre on a wack journey
Ho  Headed for nowhere with time to spare
So Ima kick this rhyme right now and right here
Id tell your name but that would give you fame
And I aint out to give you what you dont have
So I sit back and relax cause it makes me laugh
I could diss call you names and make fun of you
Ho  But me the Lyte Im into speakin the truth
Like a watchtower hour by the hour
Lyte is rhymin perfect timin
Milk keeps the beat  I keep the beat 
With the tap of his feet  With the tap of my feet 
When he count it down  When I count it down
678  Lytell start the debate
Hot damn ho 
Shut the fuck up 
Hot damn ho 
Shut the fuck up 
Hot damn ho 
Shut the fuck up 
Here we   here we 
Gon be some shit 
Here we go again 
The first thing you ask yourself is why do I bother
When you should really ask where is the father
Where is the father  of your child arent we wild
You get around like a cab now thats too bad
Everyone has been in you isnt that sad
Bodily youre vivacious Dont make me laugh
Weight Watchers is waiting heres a free pass
You aint gettin loose you fuckin jerk
And you aint gettin paid youre just gettin laid
Sexin and suckin yeah that is your trade
Put on this earth just to distract me
Get those to write rhymes and try to attack me
You will get nowhere the Lyte is too blinding
Tell me why must I keep reminding
You to step back let the Lyte shine
Do not say shit till you write your own rhymes
Your mold is fake crayola crayon
Dont dare to sleep or even prey on
The Lyte is too wicked too worthy too strong
And the rhymes I create are made to last long
Let me wise you up rappin isnt a sport
You either have to teach yourself or you have to be taught
And being that you are not wise enough to do it on your own
The ones that write your rhymes might as well hold your microphone
Dropped a little vinyl now you think youre large
Step aside Lyte Thee MC is in charge
Dont sleep on me Im far far far from dumb
So roll correctly if you decide to come
MC sucker this is what you waited for
Im sick of the battle lets go to war
Why do you challenge me Lyte Thee MC
Did not you know that I am crazy
My screws are quite loose in fact I dont have any
But when it comes to rhymes Ive got many
Like I said and will have to say
Over and over cause you disobey
Here on this earth I reign superior
One of these days I will have to get with ya
Tear you up mentally from limb to limb
Cause I am the Lyte and you are just paperthin
I sensed it predicted it knew it would happen
You plopped off fast on the scene and start rappin
Now it is my duty to all MCs
To ask you to go elsewhere pronto please
Now I was quite polite nice I might add
But you insist on stayin that makes me mad
But then again I dont mind Ive got someone to pick on
Write rhymes to diss and even play tricks on
You aint really down you wigwearin clown
Borrowin money to buy an outfit
Not even good enough for a Sunday picnic
I ask you do you know who youre fuckin with
With those Bubblegum jeans and those 2for1 Skips
Im MC Lyte aka MC Payback
Payback is a bitch and Im givin you no slack
Unfinished Business that shit was wack
So Lyte made no attempt to strike back
But here we go again what is Lights Out
Let me ask what the bomboclut you achat about
Let me say next time that you feel pissed
I suggest that you dont try to diss
You better watch what you say to me cause I can get evil
The things that Im capable of are unbelievable
In 10 I popped your head in a microwave
Im into blenders now so you better behave
Or put you in a toaster because youre gettin toasted
Better yet an oven because youre gettin roasted
Dont listen to your rhyme writers cause yo they souped you
You aint dope you cant cope they musta dooked you
You musta had some wack crack  real wack crack 
Sent you on a mission and now youre comin back
But let me school ya Lyte is runnin this show
So yo ho I think you oughta go
Before Lyte Thee MC gets into it  into it 
But remember you forced me to do it
Yo now you know
And knowing is half the battle
Slime
