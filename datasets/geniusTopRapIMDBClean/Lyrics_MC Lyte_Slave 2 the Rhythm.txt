Why is it that your watch stopped tickin but you still keep clockin
And no matter how hard you jinx I keep rockin
Listen hoe cause Im the Lyte one
And if youre lookin for a fight you found the right one
They call me Lyte 
And Im a slave to the rhythm 
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party 
Im not a procrastinator or a instigator
But when it comes to dope rhymes on the mic Im the creator
I never look for trouble but somehow it finds me
But yo I just conquer it and leave it all behind me
The Lyte very outspoken
And when I rock a rhyme sometimes I leave you chokin
Im the MC Lyte comin live and direct
I never lose a battle cause I always come correct
In any case I win again and again
You see Lyte is at the top till the very end
And even though I may be short believe I dont take none
Try your luck and well see who will get done
I mean immediately like quick fast
Dont turn your back cause this micll be in your ass
And dont take what I say too lightly
I beat you defeat you so quietly
Sneak up and hit you like a fuckin tornado
Cause in the rap field Lytes the fuckin aka doe
The capital L the y to the e
Shit give me room and Ill slay an MC
Whether its in a crowd or on the sneak tip
I wax you and your posse watch you trip and flip
As you drop the mic cause you dont have the gift
To rip a style fast or slow
Why Lyte  Too busy hoein it sniffin up blow
Dont get mad its just a talent I was given
What Im sayin Im a slave to the rhythm
Bein that Im dissin I was reminiscin
You was at my show yo you was on a mission
Yo what you tellin me Lyte  she was asskissin
No show you hoe no work you jerk
Cool Lyte I think her feelings are hurt 
Alright Ill chill and Ill come to my senses
But next time you diss think of the consequences
Yo I am no joke Im sharp like barbwire
Try to touch me yo youre bound to catch a fire
I never lose my cool but if I do yo youre lost
I be forced to show and prove exactly whos the boss
Who gets the income  and then some
I dont diss you for the money I diss you for the fun
Dont get mad its just a talent I was given
What Im sayin Im a slave to the rhythm
It took a whole album for you to try and diss me
And hahaha slum bitch you still missed me
But yo Im off the dissin tip cause that takes no creation
Im into other things that bring me commendation
So I rap about funny things or issues that are serious
Sometimes I rap a topic that leave my people curious
And other times I diss to put one in their place
If I diss you on wax then I will diss you to your face
Some say Im foul and they dont like the way Im livin
But yo ask me if I care
Im just a slave Im just a slave Im just a slave
To the goddamn rhythm
They call me Lyte 
And Im a slave to the rhythm 
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party 
Gangstress dont make me laugh
Hahaha
And keep your eyes on this
And keep your eyes on THIS
They call me Lyte 
And Im a slave to the rhythm 
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
