So why do you persist
To be placed upon my fuckin hit list

Next time I see you Imma hit you with my Land Cruiser
Youse a poohput Lyte dont give a fuck
IU sayin he laid pipe in that butt
And in case you didnt know
I been known to fuck up a ho during a show
So now you wanna play Miss Hardrock
Dont test me I put up career roadblocks
I heard youre smokin crack lady
You just had a kid I guess that makes him a  crack  baby
Whadda ya think
The 55th nigga you fucked said your poompoom stink
Slow down youre movin too fast
The 56th said he stuck a curling iron up that ass

Youre still a loser
No joke when I see you Imma hit you with the Cruiser
Set the bitch on fire
Your fucking days are over 
Roxanne Shant is only good for steady fucking   4x 
Go go go go
From upstate New York to way Down South
I heard you do a micachecka with a dick in your mouth
Youre ready for the showdown the low down
Lyte strikes again another ho down
Fuckin to you Shanny is like a fad
Flippin coins with your mom to see who sucks dad
But wait a second I heard youre kinda funky
But then again whos heard of a clean junkie
How funky of a smell could one woman make
Yo fellas I think she need a douche break
Douche douche it out  douche break

Douche douche it out  I think you need a douche 
Tisktisk what a relief it is
Not to be not to be not to be you
Not to be not to be not to be you
Or one of those pussyeatin members of your crew
Cause if your crew was cool they woulda schooled you
But instead you let them fool you
Into talkin that bullshit you been talkin
Walkin that skank strut you been walkin
I dont play that ring around the rosie
Pocket full of posie redrum you dumb dumb
We can all be some fightin muthafuckas in here this evening
Bring your ass nigga bring it on come on 
Roxanne Shant is only good for steady fucking   4x 
Go go go go
Now lets talk about the grill  the grill 
Now lets talk about the grill  the grill 
Now lets talk about that grill  the grill 
Wed all be dead if looks could kill  ugh 
Now lets talk about your teeth
Shits aint been straight since you was 8
When you bit into a bad piece of beef
And even for a small fee
You let your uncle get one off while you bounced on his fuckin knee
Now whats my fuckin name
Left you so far behind you cant get back into the fuckin game
You must like puttin dough in my pocket
Since 86 my career skyrocket
Where ya at  Ahhahahahaha
Hoho huhuhu   Dumb ho  Hahaha 
I got this rap shit locked sewn hemmed
While youre hangin from a buddah stem
I do this and that baby pop I get residuals
Im liable to just fuck up you schedule
Youll be sittin on your fat ass another 10 years
Until the coast is clear
So next time they push a rhyme in your hand
You better fully understand who the fuck I am
At least now we know 
Dumb
Its all about Lyte 
Bitch
Roxanne Shant is only good for steady fucking 
Go go go go
