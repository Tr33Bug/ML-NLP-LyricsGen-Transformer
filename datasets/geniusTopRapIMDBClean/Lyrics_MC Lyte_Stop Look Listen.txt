Im rhymin and designin also creatin
The dope def rhyme that is always being taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me
No trait of originality
But yo I am not one to down another
So like I said before just go for yours sucker
Im gonna take the time to drop a dope line
Or maybe even two for you and your crew
So you can start shakin and movin all around
To the Lyte Thee MC and the King Of Chill sound
Its new and improved like a freshly cut diamond
Perfect timin like a gem its shinin
Or better yet a ruby somewhat like a sapphire
This jam you are forced to admire
Stop stop
Look look
Listen
Wanna battle me Now thats strange behavior
Drink and drive yeah youre probably safer
Cause when I start I never give slack
You feel like a kick me sign was pinned to your back
Yes Im the superduper with the roperdoper
Got the clean drawers on yeah I hope ya
Do because Im gonna strip you of your peace of mind
Now your piece is mine damn thats unkind
Come on admit it the Lyte is too fly
The rhymes that I say you cant deny
Because 100 is what I give it  Say what 
I haunt the house with the hiphop spirit
I tear it repair it
Like a handmedown make you wear it
Save all your crocodile tears grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers youre gonna share it
You hear me junior Cause soon youll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand bitings not part of the plan
Thats wrong I thought I taught you better than that
But thats what you get from a stabber in the back
Stop stop
Look look
Listen
MC  Master of Creativity
Rappin is the activity
Rhyme is the sport let it be taught
That Lyte Thee MC is takin no shorts
In 88 I was great but 89 is my time
Stop look and listen  to the right rhyme
KRock the DJ throws the cuts my way
Put em on the reeltoreel and let them play
Leg 1 and Leg 2 they do the jumpin
The dancin the pumpin always up to somethin
But when it comes to the rap category
MC Lyte headlines the story
Extra extra read all about it 
Comin out fresh and flier than we did before 
Listen up everybody
