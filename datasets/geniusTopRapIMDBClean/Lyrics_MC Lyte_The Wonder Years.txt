So lets lock this down like its supposed to be
Its like the wonder years you blink and I appear
From a cloud of smoke Im like a full court press and you choke
When Im near pull up a chair let me explain how I maintain the youthful glow
For you that dont know its called H2O
So stop asking when I walk by
How I look so young and stay that fly
Its elementary kick the liquor when you turn dirty thirty
The rest is a secret so I keep it for the worthy
Some of us need to be doing the bid
Spitting lyrics thats worst than Ritalin for kids
They say Lyte they aint ready for nothin you did
So we kick the same stuff as if we were stupid
Take the same beat and loop
50 times Why not that other group did
Its idiotic average and robotic
I keep it real my mental thick like a Harvard clique
I got them singing Bob Marley hits  I dont want to wait 
They dont want to wait in vain
But Im worth all the joy and the pain
Come hard when I hit goddamn you know the name Lyte
Lock this down like its supposed to be
The pioneers wonder years LYTE
Oh yeah shes back the industry need that
So pay attention to her I told yall to listen to her
Yeah Lyte shes back the female GRap been in the limelight
Baby girl get your mind right
Yeah Imma do it like this 
Pass on the insight teach a seed about Lyte
And how I was the first female to smash the mic
Yeah nigga I speak the facts of life
While a whole lot of others was crap on the mic
Still showin Mcs what cash look like
From the Jetta to the porsche to the navi Im tight
What I got its hot you can have it to
Praise god work hard all you have to do
I was born to be the Lyte to give the spark in the dark
Spread the truth to the youth the ghetto joan of ark
Its sad these kids put you at the head of thier throne
All you give them back is raps about your bone
Gettin head in your whip a studio in your home
But who cares cause you dummies all sound like clones
Its a mystery to me how you got this far
Cant read cant even count the miles on your car
Yeah You take this easy slow it up on them
I feel the animosity
Loosen up the grip when I shoot from the lip I hear it constantly
Yo Lyte kick that same shit you did in 86
I cant do that Im too evolved too big to stay small
In a world full of problems especially the US just cant solve them
My data too robust they cant feel where Im headed
How I keep the mind spirit and the body all connected
Respected by many and any that want to test
Bring them Timbos and leave home that pretty mini dress
Im a viking Im fighting until the death of me
As god blows breathe in me I leave the legacy
Lyte as a Rock
