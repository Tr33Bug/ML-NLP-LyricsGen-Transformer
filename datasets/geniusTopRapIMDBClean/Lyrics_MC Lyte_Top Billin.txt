MC am I people call me Milk
When Im bustin up a party I feel no guilt
Milk is cuttin up for the
Suckers thats down with me
The one of us thats how I feel
To be down you must appeal
To the two were rated R
Were gifted and were going far
Down the road to the bank
While Im here Id like to thank
Mom and dad they knew the time
T is scratching Lyte is rhyming
Milk is chillin Lyte is chillin
What more can I say Top billin

So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dees gonna pull the skirt

Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
Thats how it is you can ask Giz
I stole your nigga while you was in prison
Jail for MC assault
You was jealous its all your fault
Milk is chillin Lyte is chillin
What more can I say Top billin
Thats what we get got it good

Clap your hands your hands you clap
If your girls out of place its your girl I slap
And if youre dumb youll ask why

This dance is on and on and on
Dance until your breath is gone
