When in Love  3X 
When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
Itll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard Ive done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs to throwin away his ring
So if you love me love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
Im not embarassed nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past Ive been gamed
But that was then and this is now
And theres no way damn it theres no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love
When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say I must have been deranged
Im talkin like pickin your lovers nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring  that aint right
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin youd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love  2X 
When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like twoseater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens she got you strung
Guess it doesnt matter long as youre having fun
Lovell make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said Love makes things happen
Its most important to hear what Im rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of

When in Love  6X
