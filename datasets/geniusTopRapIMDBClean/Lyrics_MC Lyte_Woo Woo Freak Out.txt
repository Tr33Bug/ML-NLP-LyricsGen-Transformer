Woo Woo  Freak Out  LyricsUh yeah
Uh yeah
Verse 1MC Lyte
Naughty but you like and nasty but you want it
Im the chick that never front it
Picture that
Me wearin a pager
So you can be down my back
It aint happin jack
Am I too fine
If so I can leave
Have somewhere to go
You better believe
I keep a tight schedule
Not many are blessed
Still on a quest
Not knowin Im da best
Causin a mess wherever I go
They still want me there Im the star of the show
Your ride is sweet
My ride is much sweeter
Come take a ride with this senorita
Theres more to me that the eye cant see
But Im twice as much as youd thought Id be
When I hit da scene
All better be where cause da party dont jump till I get there
Chorus   Nicci Gilbert  
Come on
Were doin it everyday
All night is how we like to play
Feel the rhythm do what you want to do
Kick back were doin it at the woooooo
Verse 2 MC Lyte
You took to long to ask
Now I dont know
If you can hang wit my flow
Keep it on da dlow I start da fire
Watch it go down
When its time to put the flame out
I put the juice down
When you woowoo
So nasty its sick Wanna know my tricks
Studyin me like a flick
Im the girl your mama warned you about at night
Ask Ronnie Bobby Ricky and Mike
Im that candy girl
I got da suga for your sweet toothe
Comin in your crib in my birthday suit
Im that bad habit you just cant shake
What I want I take
Some a yall could relate
Got the yab yum
To get ya stuck like glue
It aint over to we all come through
When I hit the scene
All better be where cause da party dont jump til I get there
Chorus x 2
Verse 3 MC Lyte
So you wanna be da tiger roaming through my woods huh
Babe boy you gotta bring da goods
Not just any penny
Can get in my piggy
Bently or empty you just cant tip me
Lyte got just what you like
All up in your ear but Im not like Mike
Red Hot
Be the brown chili peppa
Yall know my words
Lets sing it together
Light to infinite
Like Dusk Til Dawn
When I hit da scene
All better beware cause da party dont ump da jump til I get there
Chorus repeat til fades
