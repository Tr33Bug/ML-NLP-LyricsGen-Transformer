Libra Cancer Gemini Pisces
Whats your Zodiac sign 
Aries Aquarius Taurus Sagittarius
Leo Virgo Capricorn Scorpio
Whats your Zodiac sign 
When were you born Whats your sign
One zero the month of the year
Im not a hero but I come when in despair
I float like the wind the mighty air sign
When I use my mind its not hard to find
Those who would not like to see me fly
Like to step on my wings and watch me die
But that can never be I use my scales
Positive negative energy male and female
Emotions within me
Leo Aquarius compatibility
Also Gemini but I got four eyes
For one set of twins I look deep within
Often distracted by pretty little things
Like the wings of an angel or the songs they may sing
Argumentative but I hate confrontation
Ruled by Venus and starked with hesitation
Procrastinator but never an instigator
You wanna riff homie Ill see you later
Sapphire My type of jewel
I turn on one who thinks he knows me too well
Like the water barrier with the million dollar smile
Flowing like the Nile or the waters from the Panama Canal
Pisces fabulous catch
They remain detached yet to find a match
Dont lose your breath waiting to exhale
I shall prevail weighing souls on the scales
Follow me as we take this trip through astrology
The galaxy from Pluto to Mercury
What ya gonna do when the planets line up
Your time is up and your city blows up
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear none
Im at one with the sun til Im done
Astrologically speaking on the track
Dropping solar facts about the Zodiac
The sun and the moon and the stars
Make up the universe Earth is not far from the planet Mars
Virgo the virgin running from the twins
Stung by the Scorpions running through the Lions den
Ram with legs of a crab
With the halfman halfhorse waiting in the pass
Of course if you check the math its all symbolic
Horoscopes are purely logic check it
