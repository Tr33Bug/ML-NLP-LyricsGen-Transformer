Ain’t Gonna Die Tonight Lyrics
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Open up the doors on 'em, we playin' tonight
Bring on the marchin' band and turn on the stadium lights
They gon' learn from me, this is our church of The
Life of a champion, ugh, so Freddie Mercury
Sneakin' into Hov concerts in nosebleeds
The Hov bein' like "whoa"
Yeah, independent, keep killin' these people and don't sleep
Even the pigeon-toed still standin' on both feet, you know
It's obvious whose night this is
Grandparents immigrants, couple Irish kids
Victory in my grasp, gotta fight for this
The streets are ours this evening, goin' undefeated
I roll the dice against the staircase, uh huh
Steak season gotta marinate, uh huh
If I happen to die tonight, put my spirit in the stars
Bury me in the grave and carve "The history was ours"
Said I—
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Wake up, bitch, I ain't dead yet
And if I was in heaven, I'd be the best dressed
My closet lookin' like a swap meet in Texas
And maybe it's excess, but
We ain't cut from the same cloth, player
Talkin' to a boss player
Checks like a ball player
Easy money, all layups
I be pissin' off neighbors
Get up off my dick and get the finger like a cross-fader
I be in my lawn chair, star gazin' like, woo!
All praise to the most high
Your boy in his own J's, I made it to courtside
Remember the old days and playin' for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leverage
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands into the heavens
Said I—
You might also like
I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Didn't come this far to lose
Won't let death make a move
Might not mean much to you, but I'd die for this W
Let my life be something to prove
Every scrape, every fight, every cut, every bruise
I'll lay it all on the line, I'll re-write these rules
Victory in my sight, I will not lose

I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit (No!)
History is ours tonight
The people are chantin', can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh15Embed
