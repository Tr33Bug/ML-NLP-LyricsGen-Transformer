To really to be a creator you must ask yourself In the stillest moment of your night if it were truly denied you to create would you die And if your answer is yes you have no choice That is your choice because there is no euphoria in a different place for an artist Thats where you are thats what you do Thats it and its not an easy life but its your life
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Instead of staying the same
Cause I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say em outloud and complain to them
I figure Im made to live and havent gone that far
But I made it here so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take the pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebodys listenin
Dear God Im so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles heartache pain the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Through this page is the only way to paint you
But lately its like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening

As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up  Good Morning 
Im gonna change my ways
Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route but theres a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get truth in the flesh homie
You can do the rest Im through with trying to prove myself to you
Ill see you when you wake up hope the feeling is mutual
Now for artists and musicians you see the targets to listen
To the heart and then script it with no margin no limits
To make to pain strengths sun rays a part of the picture
And convey it in every shade and take it farther and vivid
Theyre gonna say what they say to barge in the vision
And whatever the DJ plays they market the gimmick
But Ive got a path to follow and the longer the distance
I realize Im already awake
Im just starting to live it
My language
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
Cause the musics my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
Im gonna change my ways
