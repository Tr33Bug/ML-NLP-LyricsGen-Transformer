Ladies and gentlemans
This an ode to the Bboys Bgirls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me Im not dissin anybody out there whos trying to get paid
Im trying to get paid too
But I got one question
Whatever happened to the heart
That pumped the passion into the art
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start
Breakdancing Im battling doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression not only to top charts
I dont know what happened wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radios lacking controlled by fascists assholes doing damage
But were gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred Gs a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hiphop without the Bboy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hiphop were freedomfighting graffitiwriting party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it come on get it cause Ive got it
Im honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial
We be the baddest
Now Bboys Bgirls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill for real pop and lock
If you record without thought then stop
Because Ill serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel thats not rapping thats acting
Im from a land of backpacks and fat cats
MCs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
Its a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the mp3s until the death of me
Record exceptionally especially
Whenever I be monumentally grammatically killing the mic
I tell my DJs cranking that music keeping em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it breaking and grooving and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio flow
So you can go blow we get a car
And a crib up on MTV
But in the end whats classic
Radio bubblegum Or a voice filled with passion
To my real hiphop heads please stand up
Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us
