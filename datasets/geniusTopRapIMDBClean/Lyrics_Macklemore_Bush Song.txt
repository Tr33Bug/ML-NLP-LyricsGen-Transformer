Bush Song Lyrics
Hello Americans
My name is George Bush, and I'm going to do a rap for ya'll
Check it out

Bitch I'm from Texas
We're homophobic and sexist
And if these Mexicans keep coming in I'm 'a dismember 'em
You don't see me in El Paso, selling their tacos
Shit in my el ba√±o, I'll cut off your asshole
Goddamn it, don't even talk about the faggots
If I ever seen one singing the national anthem I'ma strangle 'em
Hell nah, they can't get married, but they can fight in the military
Hopefully they'll end up buried in a cemetery
I don't even consider 'em people
Go ahead put 'em in the front lines
Next to the Negroes
But I'm not racist
Colin Powell's like my brother, alright I admit it I hate him
Where's Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq
Finding some oil to tap, tell 'em I got up on that
And y'all still think it was Bin Laden
When it was us and the Masons, plotting on oil profits
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich

My brother said some racist shit a couple of years back
Then the blacks came out and started to protest and crap
And I knew I'd have little hope, cause all of sudden
The blacks got together and started to register to vote
But thank God for computers and them helping
Cause we got the last names of every single felon
We programmed the computers to find the names that were the same
Whoever came up couldn't vote on election day
Way to go Jeb, really great strategy
We got rid of the majority of black families
And I'm not even talking about Dade County
The expired military ballots are bogus, counted
I'd like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy
My cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy
He told the entire world that I won
Before the votes were being done counted
And even though Gore had more, what matters in the end
Is the Supreme Court, and those are my dad's friends
So thank you very much, and please remember
If you don't vote, I'll see you back in November
You might also like
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich4Embed
