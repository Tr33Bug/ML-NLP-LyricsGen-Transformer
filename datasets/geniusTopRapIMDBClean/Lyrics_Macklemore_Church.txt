Church Lyrics
Moms and pops, they used to take us to church
Saying "If you don't believe, then the prayin' don't work"
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement, I'm first
Music brought me to my knees, I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues, I got problems, gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin' in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here, we call love
You can't put that into words, but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms, I watch the fallin' sun
Kiss my daughter and say "Thank God" as I wake up
Oh I know, yeah, I know now
And I'm up, but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

Oh my God, oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
This my life, it was planned, I can't take it off
Bruised elbows, knees scraped, I learned to take a fall
My mistake, my mistake
Karma waits, karma waits
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave
The pain seems more than I could take, I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain, than the gain
New state of mind, I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines, still pushing that '85 Lac
Windows down, city passing by, like a timelapse
The weatherman be trippin', so that ceiling got that white rag, ay
We came so far, just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain, hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role, never played my part
You might also like
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing, can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay, we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah
I can get fly with ya, ride with ya, shine with ya, yeah

I can have a life toâ€“ I have life today. I rely on that constant communication with my higher power, more so than anybody these days. And I realized, that's kinda all I need. And then, of course, y'all appear, right, y'all appear, things appear, and situations appear. And I realize, that's God working through me, if I allow myself to be that vessel.6Embed
