Moms and pops they used to take us to church
Saying If you dont believe then the prayin dont work
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement Im first
Music brought me to my knees I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I got some issues I got problems gotta make amends
I watch my daughter giggin in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here we call love
You cant put that into words but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms I watch the fallin sun
Kiss my daughter and say Thank God as I wake up
Oh I know yeah I know now
And Im up but Im aware that it goes down
Travelled round the globe I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding round in my hometown
Hope Im feeling this good when its Monday mornin
Been doing my own thing cant say that Im sorry
And I can only pray someday that well all be
More than just okay we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
Oh my God oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
This my life it was planned I cant take it off
Bruised elbows knees scraped I learned to take a fall
My mistake my mistake
Karma waits karma waits
But Ill be brave Ill be brave
The pain seems more than I could take I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain than the gain
New state of mind I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines still pushing that 85 Lac
Windows down city passing by like a timelapse
The weatherman be trippin so that ceiling got that white rag ay
We came so far just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role never played my part


Hope Im feeling this good when its Monday mornin
Been doing my own thing cant say that Im sorry
And I can only pray someday that well all be
More than just okay we can be so free
And I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can get fly with ya ride with ya shine with ya yeah
I can have a life to I have life today I rely on that constant communication with my higher power more so than anybody these days And I realized thats kinda all I need And then of course yall appear right yall appear things appear and situations appear And I realize thats God working through me if I allow myself to be that vessel
