I dont feel theres any point in trying to survive when people dont try to help me
When wewe share a community we should all be engaged and more involved in each others wellbeing you know
Now everyday that I walk outta my building
I see homeless people sleeping and chillin on the steps to the apartment that I live in
Im not saying everyones a victim
But the people that I live with treat em more like villains than actual citizens
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit
He gets his food and his garments by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon Mr President but Im a resident
And since youve been in office I havent seen any evidence
Of things changin we go into Iraq and attack
When we got people on the streets without a roof over their back
Weve come to accept the homeless as part of our landscape
The money the government wastes could provide them with a safe place
To eat and sleep but we cease to see
That our own country is based around war power and greed
We got families on the street with nowhere to go
And the concretes the only place they have to call home
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling youre all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home  Yo 
Feeling all alone
Now every face tells a different story a different message
Now how can we judge the book when we dont know the beginning
We dont know what turned em to the bottle or started injectin
We just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin
We dont see the kid who was an addict the second that his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped and stripped of everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin on the block pacin
Cause the only way she knows how to make it is gettin naked
We dont want to face it and it being the fact
That the government created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks and give em more of a setback
Like the last fivehundredyears wasnt enough to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate and tell me to my face that race
Doesnt play an intricate part in your fate in the United States
Now think about your home and the place that you sleep
And the homeless who only have the concrete


Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling youre all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home  Yo 
Feeling all alone
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that were living in is not fair
You wanna see change Then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground cause change starts right there
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that were living in is not fair
You wanna see change Then put your ones in the air
Now point em to yourself cause change starts right there
Cause change starts right there
The streets are cold all alone
In the city
Where you lay your head is your home
What a pity
People pass you by with a glance
Say youre filthy
But they dont know they pain youve been through
No not really
