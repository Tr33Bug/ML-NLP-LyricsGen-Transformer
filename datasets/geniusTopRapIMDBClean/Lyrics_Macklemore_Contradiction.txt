The other day me n XP opened for Souls of Mischief
Im like Yo lets get on some angry MC showmanship and hit em
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Even a couple dissin women callin em groupies hoes and bitches
Got off stage and Im like Yo I know that we killed it
Ran into a familiar face a female who comes in and supports us
I said Peace She said Wait Let me talk to you for a minute
I know its none of my business but I wasnt impressed by your performance
I said Word Shit I love feedback and criticism
She said I miss the passionate spirit your political vision
Quite honestly I wasnt offended by those references to women
But youre only continuing societys conditioning
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song cant be seepin with freedom
Cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that Im preachin
Everythings peace and love uhh thats somewhat misleading
Because this world is fuckedup and Im a product to what Im seeing
Not to justify but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
Now I am sexist Im prejudice I put that in my music
She said she heard that perspective but before she turned around
She said We have a flame your fires ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up or using your fire to burn it down
Consumption contradiction Im conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences I admit this shit because Im just like you
Walking a fine line between saying and living it
Light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down down down
Light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down down down down down down down
Now one thing that Ive always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs
Cuz on that perspective thats all over my records
But the other side isnt represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me
Not to say that Im a role model but I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic I am sending out the
Message Its okay hey I believe that it is
Chronic can be medicine but its all about your relationship with it
See Im either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hiphop music and weed theyre inseparable
So MCs that dont smoke or drink talking about it to me seems questionable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straightedge to their audience so keeping it real is neglected
Cuz when Im smoking I wouldnt wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Dev and break out the Swishers and a bong and some licks
See thats a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasnt as true
To all the struggles of the blunted consumption Im going through
Make music for the party and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50 what does that say to you
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down


Consumption contradiction Im conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences I admit this shit because Im just like you
Walking a fine line between saying and living it
Consumption contradiction Im conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
The differences I admit this shit because Im just like you
Walking a fine line between saying and living it
Light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down down down
Light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down down down down down down down
