Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
They said it wasnt a gateway drug
My homie was takin subs and he aint wake up
The whole while these billionaires stay cakedup
Paying out Congress so we take their drugs
Murderers who will never face the judge
And we dancin to a song about our face goin numb
But I seen homies turn gray noses drainin blood
I couldve been gone off 30s faded in that tub
Thats Prince Michael and Whitney thats Amy Ledger and Pimp C
Thats Yams thats DJ AM
God damn theyre making a killing
Now its getting attention cause Sara Katey and Billy
But this shits been going on from Seattle out to South Philly
It just moved up out the city
And spread out to the burbs
Now its everybodys problem got a nation on the verge
Take Activis off the market jack the price up on the syrup
But Purdue Pharmas bout to move that work
My drug dealer was a doctor doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma Pharma
He said that he would heal me heal me
But he only gave me problems problems
My drug dealer was a doctor doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma Pharma
I think he trying to kill me kill me
He tried to kill me for a dollar dollar
And these devils they keep on talkin to me
They screamin Open the bottle I wanna be at peace
My hand is gripping that throttle Im running out of speed
Try to close my eyes but I just keep on sweatin through these sheets through these sheets
Four horseman they wont let me forget
I wanna forge a prescription cause doctor I need some more of it
When Morphine and heroin is more your budget
I said Id never use a needle but sure fuck it
Im caught up Im on one Im nauseous
No options exhausted
This is not what I started
Walkin carcass I lost everything I wanted
My blinds drawn too gone to leave this apartment
My drug dealer was a doctor doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma Pharma
He said that he would heal me heal me
But he only gave me problems problems
My drug dealer was a doctor doctor
Had the plug from Big Pharma Pharma
I think he trying to kill me kill me
He tried to kill me for a dollar dollar
More more more
Reup reup
Death certificate signed the prenup
Aint no coming back from this Percocet
Actavis Ambien Adderall Xanax binge
Best friends with the thing thats killing me
Enemies with my best friend theres no healing me
Refilling these refilling these
They say its death death
Institutions and DOCs
So God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change
Courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
And the wisdom to know the difference
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
