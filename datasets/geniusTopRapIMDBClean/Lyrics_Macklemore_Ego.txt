Ladies and gentlemen Sekken Thaughtz on the beat
And you know how I feel  Big up to Lace Cadence
Good lookin out for this one man
I love hiphop music I just hate the ego
The politics that follow it getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybodys striving for that same shit
To get paid and make it and Ima be honest Im tryna become famous
When someone makes a move watch that person next to you
Cause Ill warn ya
I love Hova but jealousys The Takeover
Here come the mean mugs
I cant do what he does
And where does that lead us
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him Im afraid there wont be enough room
Comparisons a mother fucker
Like MLK said
We all want that band leader syndrome and it wont stop
This concept makes me wonder is it the commodity
Of the music or the ego that is killing hiphop
And you know how I feel 
Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back
You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man
You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
Im so cool
For real
You know dude Im serious spit it different and if you just flow too
Ill listen lookin for glitches and rip em to shove improve
That my rhythms a little bit more intricate just to boost
My ego its so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if youre going through somethin and life is feeling uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry
And thats hard to admit but since Im really being honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of taking it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin it out of this political scene of
Northwest haters to be next I guess Im just like them
Jealous of whos taking that step


Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back
You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man
You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
Now everybody got one but people trying to front
Claiming that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like man thats not me
Now let me break it down son
Its only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause were submerged in I gotta be
The best or number one
But its just that we dont trust
In our heart and thats what stops me
Its the ego
