Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what Ive written
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
Its the vessel like Im not in it
In fiftysomething years I wont be here
Therell be a kid with some headphones coverin his ears
Walkin round a hallway dreamin of ideas
Find himself in the sound cause music is a mirror
What you looking for What you headed towards
Whats your name worth when they mention yours
When you leave here are you stepping forward
Can you remember your intention when they question yours
Theyre gonna question yours theyre gonna question yours
Ive been to rock bottom and Im headed North
If you dont love yourself whats the respect for
If you dont love life the check wont correct yours
Excavate
Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin me round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that Ive ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success
Or did I leave a better life for the rest
My greatest achievement isnt the dollars
My greatest achievement isnt the followers
My greatest achievement isnt the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin up in the morning bein a father
Watchin the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin her sing along to Chance
And bein like Yeah thats my kid
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender laying in the snow turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate
Fill my lungs up pour my heart out peel my bones away
Crack my window shed my shadow excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
Im an open book no I dont mind but sometimes Im hard to read
Just flesh and bone Im headed home but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobodys watching me
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
Im an open book no I dont mind but sometimes Im hard to read
Just flesh and bone Im headed home but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobodys watching me
