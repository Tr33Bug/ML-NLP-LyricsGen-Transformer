Excavate Lyrics
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain

If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones coverin' his ears
Walkin' 'round a hallway, dreamin' of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours
I've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?
If you don't love life, the check won't correct yours
Excavate
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace

I had this vision of my death
Surrounded by people I love and respect
In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin' me 'round the block that I rep
The greatest fear that I've ever kept
Is dying with regrets
Like was I just alive for success?
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades
My greatest achievement is my daughter
Wakin' up in the morning, bein' a father
Watchin' the light kiss her eyelids
Hearin' her sing along to Chance
And bein' like, "Yeah, that's my kid"
The light started to glow
And the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow
Tender, laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road
Excavate
You might also like
Fill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away
Crack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain
And I found peace
And I found peace
And I found peace

Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
Hold me up into the light and study every part of me
I'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read
Just flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave
But who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?
