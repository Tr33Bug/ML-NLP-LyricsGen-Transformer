Feel like Im running out of time and the sun wont shine forever forever
I got my mind on my money and my money man fuck it whatever whatever
Sometimes I wake up on the wrong side I dont even feel like gettin up
But this depression on my brain hope it change but the rain aint lettin up
Cant call it dont know where my head is
Reflectin on Malcolm and the shit I thought but never said it
To Peter Robin to Kevin all my other friendships
That could hav would have should have and then thy ended
I isolate between happiness and hopeless
Know what makes it worse Still wanna get loaded
Sometimes I feel like I cant control my choices
And something takes over and I cant turn off the voices
Sittin with these thoughts cant escape em cant run
Got some bullets in the dresser as I polish my gun
They say a day clean is a day won
But Im holdin on prayin to a god abandoned
Zonin on the couch starin at my daughters
Know theres a pill in this house that Im obsessin about poppin
Reservations talkin the push and pull of the conscience
Should probably pick up the phone and call my sponsor but dont wanna
When the Percs dont work Xannies wont calm me down
Not enough liquor in the bar weed growin in the ground
Trapped by these walls where my brain cant get out
Wonderin if my mama have to put her son in the ground
We still goin when the day break
Me and the homies on the same page
Find me in the whip thats my safe place
Feel like Im gettin weak I need some AA
Need someone to pray for my soul right now
Everythings looking gray and theres no white clouds
I dont know what to say I got nothin to write down
On my knees questioning God like Why now
Im lost but Im found again
Im up all night I toss and turn
I love my life I got concerns
Ive been through Hell on some FML
Its just as well I might lose it
I need some light I need some air
I might be broken I need repair
Dont got the answers think Im confused
I asked myself Who are you
I need you right now Mack to wake up more than ever
Aint no more weed alcohol and poppin pills et cetera
I know these days gettin rough but they get better
Its a cold world lets go to the Gucci store for a sweater
Feel it deeply in my heart you need this letter
So I pour my feelings out to you before I go and mail it  Fore I mail it 
I dont know what Im sensin but I can smell it
When you write me back just tell it Ima soak it up inhale it  Inhale it 
Heard you got a daughter well I got one too
And she too beautiful barely see her too  See her too 
Do you hug her and tie her shoes
Is she reflectin of you and got a smile that bloom  Bloom 
Before you load that gun and shoot
Just know that she be needin you the best version of you too  Bah 
I would write more but my day about to break
We can meet up facetoface just let me know if thats okay
We still goin when the day break
Me and the homies on the same page
Find me in the whip thats my safe place  Thats my safe place too 
Feel like Im gettin weak I need some AA  I need some AA 
Need someone to pray for my soul right now
Everythings looking gray and theres no white clouds
I dont know what to say I got nothin to write down  Nothin to write down too 
On my knees questioning God like Why now  Why 
Im lost but Im found again
