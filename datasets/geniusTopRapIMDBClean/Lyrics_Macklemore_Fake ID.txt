Ladies and gentleman my name is Macklemore This is my music and it feels so damn good right about now Check it I got a story yo it goes a little something like
When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
Ayo son you better get that shit when you in NY  okay 
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
59 blues eyes born in nineteenseventynine  just right 
Nervous as hell I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled Dawg they sold me a 40
Yeah you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen had it made getting drunk everyday
Ayy I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age
You know what Im saying all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and youre in the club Seventeen like bah Check it out its like this yo
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hiphop clubs where you had to be twentyone
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRSOne twentyone up and live
Thats hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking IDs
Looks at mine and hes like Nah we dont take these
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq on crack
I shouldve punched him but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldnt have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin he called me a dumb shit
And if I wouldve let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no Im like Give it back bro
But no my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo
Ha Im laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and its still not very funny Fucker
Bitch why you got to take my ID
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
Get em
Your mother is dumb for having you
Youre a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
Get em
Youre too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
Get em
I dont like ya at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenagers lives
Ok Im going too far bouncers arent all bad
Im sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MCs fake ID
Yup I said never take an MCs fake ID
You could be buff and tough it dont matter to me
Cause youre going to get burned if you step to MCs
