Got a Guns N Roses Tshirt and never listened to the band
Just being honest I just thought that shit looked cool
Hold up do you know who I am
Turn the block to Woodstock
Retire Dont think that I could stop
Jetski the way I ride the beat
And fuck your wave Ima die knowing that I did me
I got some words and I cannot let them die in me
This is arena status
Our bones end up in the ground does it even matter
Make some good music get what you put in
Get out and go and leave the planet
Now what the hell did you think this is
Were born were dying inbetween we live
Love prosper hands to the sky catch a gospel
Roll the dice nah I aint betting on tomorrow
Chain looking like Orions Belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself
The same writers criticizing my rhymes
Are the same writers that gentrifyin BedStuy
I cant even see the hate I should probably check my eyes
I got 50000 phones pointed at me in the sky
Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather firebreather
Fire fire fire fire fire
Firebreather firebreather
Fire fire fire fire fire
Firebreather yeah firebreather
What the fuck you think Im doing it for
Hungry like its my rookie year and Im new to the sport
The game is tied up they looking at you in the fourth
Do you take the shot or pass it this is tenthousand hours
And Im working on my Masters liabilities and assets
And Im showing up to practice shooting early getting baskets
Theres no father to my style Im just a frecklefaced bastard
An animal in the jungle running hunting with a habit  woo 
Abracadabra that motherfucker is magic
Its 81 and Madonna is on me dancing
Im sorry momma I got it I know I should mind my manners
Id probably go doubleplatinum if I could think of an adlib
Im jazz Prince I rap a lot
I grew up on Scarface now Brads my dawg  woo 
Irish goodbye sayonara and we mobbin
Put the nail in the coffin motherfucker Im on one


Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face
Firebreather firebreather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Firebreather firebreather
Fire fire fire fire fire
Firebreather firebreather
Fire fire fire fire fire
Firebreather yeah firebreather
