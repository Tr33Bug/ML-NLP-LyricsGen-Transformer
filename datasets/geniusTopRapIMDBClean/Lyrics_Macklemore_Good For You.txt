Now you know whats good for you
Got that not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy melody life life life
Now you know whats good for you
Got that not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy melody life life life
See I dont know why I gotta go and creep around
Youve seen me and my penis
Not used to having to sleep without somebody
And Ive been chugging alcohol and Im leaving now
And I dont wanna go home alone tonight
I was freaking with some hunny named Lisa
She was squeezing alpha PuertoRican Diva
Weaving her hair with the cleavage out
Expedin by the V
Shes flashing the keys to go peep the house
And then my phone rings its my girl on the line
Its like I dont know what the hell to do
Its like women like this are seldom and few
Im fucked up in the club with a blunt and a butt
But my love will hang up if I tell her the truth
See I can be a selfish dude especially when
Im off a blunt and a brew but
But shes so sexy now let me spend the night
Its like help either way Im screwed
Get it
See if I lie I got my conscience to deal with
But if I go wakin up in the ride then Im gonna get
To grind with a fine PuertoRican Brazilian
But is it really worth it I dont know
I gotta ask myself that question
Bootys truly an option
But its not gonna suit me like my girl Evan


I dont wanna do it but I cant help it
Im so selfish
Lady what you want me to say
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed but I still wanna play
I dont wanna do it but I cant help it
Im so selfish
Lady what you want me to say
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed but I still wanna play
I dont wanna do it but I cant help it
Im so selfish
Lady what you want me to say
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed but I still wanna play
If I gave into the fact that you hate me and take me back
Im saving face by staying at the bar
And embracing this Jack
She wanna leave I can tell by the way
She react to the mouth piece
No more dollar drinks so she
Followed me with the house keys
And I know what Im doing is wrong
Hoping that you were the one
But out til like two in the morn
With nobody you wanna know
Its comforting to know youre home
When Im out on the road
I know youre lonely though
Or maybe got some flow of your own
In the looking glass you shake your ass
I sat back and I watched
Then I took your hand and we both danced
While thinking of the thoughts
It mightve been the circumstance that hurt
This man  Im a circus act at most
Nobodys perfect girl its a perfect world
But we dont have to know
And Im not trying to justify it
But I might try to simplify it
One touch and Im mesmerized
So I mess around in disguise
Flesh to the eyes test to the lies
Sex gets my vote unless
Youre destined to die with the one
Next to your side
Fo sho
I dont wanna do it but I cant help it
Im so selfish
Lady what you want me to say
Foolish
The lies and deception
I tried to confess it
Committed but I still wanna play
Now you know whats good for you
Got that not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy melody life life life
Now you know whats good for you
Got that not gonna warn you
We got that to make it right right right
You know all my women I adore you
Bodies wanna absorb too
The energy melody life life life
