I wish somebody would have told me babe
Someday these will be the good old days
All the love you wont forget
And all these reckless nights you wont regret
Someday soon your whole lifes gonna change
Youll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinkin bout the band
I was thinkin bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin merch in that 12passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin up still growin up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what Id become
Couldnt wait to get older couldnt wait to be some
Now that Im here wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me babe
That someday these will be the good old days
All the love you wont forget
And all these reckless nights you wont regret
Cause someday soon your whole lifes gonna change
Youll miss the magic of the good old days
Wish I didnt think I had the answers
Wish I didnt drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I wouldve gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldnt have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open and the stars above
Moment frozen sneakin out and fallin in love
Me you and that futon wed just begun
On the grass dreamin figuring out who I was
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me babe
That someday these will be the good old days
All the love you wont forget
And all these reckless nights you wont regret
Cause someday soon your whole lifes gonna change
Youll miss the magic of the good old days


Never thought wed get old maybe were still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe Ive been missin what its about
Been scared of the future thinkin about the past
While missin out on now
Weve come so far I guess Im proud
And I aint worried bout the wrinkles round my smile
Ive got some scars Ive been around
Ive felt some pain Ive seen some things but Im here now
Those good old days
You dont know what youve got
Til it goes til its gone
You dont know what youve got
Til it goes til its gone
I wish somebody would have told me babe
Someday these will be the good old days
All the love you wont forget
And all these reckless nights you wont regret
Someday soon your whole lifes gonna change
Youll miss the magic of these good old days
