A friend of mine once told me We have many paths in this journey
They act in different directions so when you question dont be worried
Its not a wrong one beauty can be found in all of them
Youll meet people whose paths intersect but you dont know how long youll walk with them
Cause the truth is and its so hard but youll never know
How long well continue with our loved ones down this rugged road
The path veers and its clear that we must steer alone
Ive learned if you cant hold on to that moment that exists let it go
Cause freedom is God
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on and possessing the strength to take it off
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when its hard having faith in the ability to embrace it thats where you are
And this is it
The same shit that we work towards but go against in the same sense
My friend hit me to some game and truth unraveled she said The brighter the light the darker the shadow
And since Im on cliche terms knowing is half the battle
But I dont know so I just go with what was destined
Life can be a burden or a blessing
The choice is yours to be connected
Its there if you want it you got it now let it
Hold your head up theres a light in the sky
I know youre fed up but you must try to survive
Each moments precious dont let life pass you by
Keep focused keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up theres a light in the sky
I know youre fed up but you must try to survive
Each moments precious dont let life pass you by
Keep focused keep your eyes on the prize
I feel like I have nothing to give right now
This is my trial tribulations and it must go down
But wheres the up Im stuck with the broken smile
No joking now wanting to grab a swish and smoke this out
The moment of a man choosing what path I will go down
Do I give in give up or get up and live right now
With a split gut pick myself up and spit my style
This is the only thing that can hold my ground
Youre born into this world alone and alone youll go out
All I have is myself and everyone else I doubt
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now
No sunshine when shes gone I can only see clouds
No homies can hold me down the spirits testing me now
But I can withstand this world but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions its like Im being held down to drown
Hells right around the corner but I can turn it around
You always have a choice no matter the situation youre not bound
To nothing no one youre chosen for this job
This is your life you cant escape this bitch when its hard
Just know that it passes but youll collect scars
They never go away but they will make you who you are
This is a beautiful struggle I share it in song cause
I cant control this remember the moments beyond us
Hold your head up theres a light in the sky
I know youre fed up but you must try to survive
Each moments precious dont let life pass you by
Keep focused keep your eyes on the prize
Hold your head up theres a light in the sky
I know youre fed up but you must try to survive
Each moments precious dont let life pass you by
Keep focused keep your eyes on the prize
And all my people say whoa whoa yeah
And all my people say whoa whoa
And all my people say whoa whoa yeah
And all my people say whoa whoa
Cmon

Each moments precious dont let life pass you by
Keep focused keep your eyes on the prize
