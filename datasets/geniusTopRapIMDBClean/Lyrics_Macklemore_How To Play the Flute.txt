How To Play the Flute Lyrics
Don't nobody give a damn what all that shit talking 'bout, man, we tryna hear some of that, that "Girl, shake your ass, shake your ass, shake your ass," you know what I'm sayin'? I'm tryna get that in my life
Gemini

Diamond, diamond, diamond, that's my shit (that's my shit)
Oh, juice (wet), three-piece, crisp (damn)
Saucey, dripping (dripping), CEO of this (CEO)
Curry, wavy, my undertow's a bitch
Shoutout to my city, know I really does this
Third time's a charm, I'm feeling triumphant (I want it)
I put a little gold up on my bicuspids
They can only see my eyes inside of the Cutlass (Who's he?)
She may be vanilla cream, baby her butt big
They treat me like McGregor when I'm out in Dublin (They do? Yes they do)
My momma don't like it when I be cussin' (She don't)
But fuck these motherfuckers, momma, I don't trust them (fuck 'em)
It's plush up in the bucket, look, don't touch it, thought you knew
In the pocket, like I'm Russel, man I hustle, watch me move
In the summer watch me fuck around, I'm 'bout to drop the roof
She hopped up in the whip and then I taught her how to play the flute, play the flute
Goddamn, they hatin' on a player (Why that?)
Don't understand, they need to get they weight up (Okay)
Shazam, I'ma have to David Blaine 'em (What you doin'?)
Emoji hands, I'm praying for them haters (Amen)

Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay
Ah-choo, God bless you, ay

Ay little mama, aqui
Skin tone macchiato, we eating mahi-mahi
On Miami Beach, we have a party la-dee-da-dee
On my B-I-E 'til I D-I-E, I think I'm king (I think I'm king)
You didn't think that I would get the peacoat (No!)
Unbutton that motherfucker, nothing but a speedo (Look!)
Who's that peeking in my window?, Cee-Lo
I was on that Khujo, that Big Gipp and that T-Mo (What?)
Dolce and Gabbana, cappuccino, gelato
In a grotto out in Cabo, amateurs so apollo
Whip this bulky like Costco, I'm out here and dodging 5-0
I hit the block with that top low, a dookie rolled with a poncho
But it ain't about to rain on me
Tryna sing up in this bitch, but I ain't on key
Now I stay genuine, I'm the same old G
Feeling like John Havlicek, check, with these eight gold rings
Play the flute
