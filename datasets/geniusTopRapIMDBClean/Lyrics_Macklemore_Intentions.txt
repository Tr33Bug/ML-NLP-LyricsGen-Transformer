Intentions Lyrics
I wanna be sober, but I love gettin' high
Wanna give it a hundred percent, but I'm too afraid to try
I wanna be faithful, but love hookin' up with randos
I wanna live by the law, but still think like a vandal
I wanna get exercise, but I'm too lazy to workout
I want all the finer things, but don't wanna go to work now
I wanna go outside, take my family to the beach
I wake up in the morning, first thing I do is look at a screen, at a screen

Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking
All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today

I want world peace, but I wanna watch Worldstar
I know that I should stay home, and still wanna kick it where the girls are
I wanna be a feminist, but I'm still watchin' porno
I wanna eat healthy, but I'ma eat this DiGiornos
We live on social media, read other people's thoughts
Tweet about justice, but don't show up to the march
I think about the earth, and I think about the eco
What am I willin' to sacrifice at the expense of my ego?

Wanna live freely, why isn't it so easy?
I should read a book, but I keep watchin' this TV
And I know this lifestyle doesn't really feed me
I just tune out to the voice inside that's speaking

All my little problems keep on buildin' up, and buildin' up
All my good intentions just ain't good enough, can't find the love
So I smoke until my lungs are full
And drink until I lose my cool
Apology's my middle name, and one day I will change, but
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am today
I'm okay with who I am today
I'm okay with who I, who I am todayYou might also like10Embed
