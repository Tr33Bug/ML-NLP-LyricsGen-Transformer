It’s Christmas Time Lyrics
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh (I got it)
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again (Alright)

Now, fill up the gas in the SUV
Spent way too much time tryna pick out our tree
The ceiling ain't as tall as we thought, I see
Gotta cut a couple inches off the top to proceed
And now we stringing the lights up
Five hours later, we stringing the lights up
Listenin' to Bing Crosby by the fire
Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Mariah
Turn off that Michael Bublé
Turn on that one movie about the kid
Who licked the telephone pole on the Blu-ray
Red Ryder BB-Gun, stayin' up all night
Jimmy Stewart, It's A Wonderful Life, now am I right?
The collar's puffy, the beard is long
The belly's tubby, but the reindeer are strong
It's Santa Claus
It's Christmas time!
Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again

Now, I wrap presents like a kid wearing mittens
Blindfolded, with a pair of left-handed scissors
Janky, but the gift inside? Ridiculous
Better than whatever it is you had on your wishlist
Dig in, then whip up the Bisquick
Go outside, and throw 'round the pigskin
I'm a dad now, but still feel like a big kid
Best time of year, can I get a "amen"? (Amen)
The Almond Roca, the hottest cocoa
The track around the tree with the locomotives
I wanted a Jordan poster to measure my growth spurt
Starter logo, Georgetown Hoyas
I'm going off of the head, y'all
Homemade cookies that I dip in the eggnog
I wanna take a second, and shoutout my dead dog
Toby, he's dead

Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again

Oh, I wish it was '99, when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldn't go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding, snow in the driveway
Under the lit-up Christmas tree with my crazy-ass family
Singing, oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas
Oh, oh oh, oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
It's Christmas time!2Embed
