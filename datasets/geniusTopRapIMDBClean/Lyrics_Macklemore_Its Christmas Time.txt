Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh  I got it 
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again  Alright 
Now fill up the gas in the SUV
Spent way too much time tryna pick out our tree
The ceiling aint as tall as we thought I see
Gotta cut a couple inches off the top to proceed
And now we stringing the lights up
Five hours later we stringing the lights up
Listenin to Bing Crosby by the fire
Frank Sinatra Nat King Cole Mariah
Turn off that Michael Bubl
Turn on that one movie about the kid
Who licked the telephone pole on the Bluray
Red Ryder BBGun stayin up all night
Jimmy Stewart Its A Wonderful Life now am I right
The collars puffy the beard is long
The bellys tubby but the reindeer are strong
Its Santa Claus
Its Christmas time
Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
Now I wrap presents like a kid wearing mittens
Blindfolded with a pair of lefthanded scissors
Janky but the gift inside Ridiculous
Better than whatever it is you had on your wishlist
Dig in then whip up the Bisquick
Go outside and throw round the pigskin
Im a dad now but still feel like a big kid
Best time of year can I get a amen  Amen 
The Almond Roca the hottest cocoa
The track around the tree with the locomotives
I wanted a Jordan poster to measure my growth spurt
Starter logo Georgetown Hoyas
Im going off of the head yall
Homemade cookies that I dip in the eggnog
I wanna take a second and shoutout my dead dog
Toby hes dead
Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
Oh I wish it was 99 when I was a kid at Christmas time
Couldnt go to bed that night
Santa Claus sliding snow in the driveway
Under the litup Christmas tree with my crazyass family
Singing oh oh oh oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas
Oh oh oh oh
Wish I was a kid at Christmas again
Its Christmas time
