Levitate Lyrics
I said "woo", don't make me
Break out the velour suit and the Stacey's
Give me a baseline and a break beat
Fuck around on the dance floor, make a baby, watch me
Got a cane with a gold tip
Gucci ice cream tat type flow, bitch
I could make it rain, but I won't, shit
'Cause I'm cheap, motherfucker and I don't tip (I don't)
Watch out, I'm about to pull this new watch out, ta dow
Puttin' in work, we don't clock out
How 'bout, we go and cut the rug at the pow-wow
Get to movin' and breakin' and poppin' like wild style
Electric boogaloo
She movin' that body like a booty in a hula hoop
Gave her that look like, "You don't know what I'd do to you"
And she was like "Oh my God, I just Googled you"
Jheri curl, mullet on some Mario Lopez
Last call, then we go and hit the coat check
Lyft outside, buenos noches
Now tell that motherfucker, take us back to the homestead, gone
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk (we don't need to talk)
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk (watch me walk)
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut (I'm an astronaut)
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch (I'ma watch)

Whoa whoa whoa (Whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Hey now (Hey now)
Alright now (Alright now)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)

Oh shit, she just gave me her number (number)
You now dealing with the Irish hustler (hustler)
Like a 2002 Usher (Usher)
Let that burn, nah, I'm wearing a rubber
Plaid on me, dancin' like a one man army
Turn a funeral into a dance party
Meet the Holy Ghost, I'ma catch me a body
You don't wanna see me when I start doin' the zombie, Thriller
Master P, barbecue chip, Percy Miller
That's a rap snack, I'm a fat dad, got some fat abs
Sweatin' like I'm eatin' jalape√±os out in Baghdad
You ain't on the level, got a medal for the flash dance
You ain't fucking gigging, what the hell you getting mad at?
I pulled up in that purple thang
I didn't dress like Prince in Purple Rain (oh my God)
Lions, cheetahs like the circus came
And I should charge everybody to observe the game
Pour shots, big up and fuck cops
Invite the whole neighborhood to a party on my block
Up rock a booty, juicier than a cumquat
Boyfriend mean muggin', little buddy fuck off
You might also like
Now take your shoes off in here
We don't need to talk (we don't need to talk)
I said "I'm shooting for the moon, baby"
Now watch me walk (watch me walk)
I don't believe in gravity, honey
I'm an astronaut (I'm an astronaut)
Just wanna see you levitate, and I'ma watch (I'ma watch)

Whoa whoa whoa (Whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Hey now (Hey now)
Alright now (Alright now)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)
Gon' levitate (Gon' levitate)

Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' 'til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
Gon' get down, we gon' get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on
We gon' get down, get down
Get down so you gotta get up
Don't sit down, don't sit down
Two steppin' til the sun come up, come on3Embed
