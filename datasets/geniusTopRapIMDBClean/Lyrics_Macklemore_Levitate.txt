I said woo dont make me
Break out the velour suit and the Staceys
Give me a baseline and a break beat
Fuck around on the dance floor make a baby watch me
Got a cane with a gold tip
Gucci ice cream tat type flow bitch
I could make it rain but I wont shit
Cause Im cheap motherfucker and I dont tip  I dont 
Watch out Im about to pull this new watch out ta dow
Puttin in work we dont clock out
How bout we go and cut the rug at the powwow
Get to movin and breakin and poppin like wild style
Electric boogaloo
She movin that body like a booty in a hula hoop
Gave her that look like You dont know what Id do to you
And she was like Oh my God I just Googled you
Jheri curl mullet on some Mario Lopez
Last call then we go and hit the coat check
Lyft outside buenos noches
Now tell that motherfucker take us back to the homestead gone
Now take your shoes off in here
We dont need to talk  we dont need to talk 
I said Im shooting for the moon baby
Now watch me walk  watch me walk 
I dont believe in gravity honey
Im an astronaut  Im an astronaut 
Just wanna see you levitate and Ima watch  Ima watch 
Whoa whoa whoa  Whoa whoa whoa 
Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah yeah yeah 
Hey now  Hey now 
Alright now  Alright now 
Gon levitate  Gon levitate

Oh shit she just gave me her number  number 
You now dealing with the Irish hustler  hustler 
Like a 2002 Usher  Usher 
Let that burn nah Im wearing a rubber
Plaid on me dancin like a one man army
Turn a funeral into a dance party
Meet the Holy Ghost Ima catch me a body
You dont wanna see me when I start doin the zombie Thriller
Master P barbecue chip Percy Miller
Thats a rap snack Im a fat dad got some fat abs
Sweatin like Im eatin jalapeos out in Baghdad
You aint on the level got a medal for the flash dance
You aint fucking gigging what the hell you getting mad at
I pulled up in that purple thang
I didnt dress like Prince in Purple Rain  oh my God 
Lions cheetahs like the circus came
And I should charge everybody to observe the game
Pour shots big up and fuck cops
Invite the whole neighborhood to a party on my block
Up rock a booty juicier than a cumquat
Boyfriend mean muggin little buddy fuck off


Now take your shoes off in here
We dont need to talk  we dont need to talk 
I said Im shooting for the moon baby
Now watch me walk  watch me walk 
I dont believe in gravity honey
Im an astronaut  Im an astronaut 
Just wanna see you levitate and Ima watch  Ima watch 
Whoa whoa whoa  Whoa whoa whoa 
Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah yeah yeah 
Hey now  Hey now
