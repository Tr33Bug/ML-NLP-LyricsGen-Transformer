Yo Im getting older now 23 years old
And half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other halfs like Hell no you better mess around
Dont let me down especially when you got an album coming out
When I first saw you Im like Aw shit
Goddamn it look what God did Hail Mary Jesus
Three years later Im sitting in our apartment
Thinking about all the places that my hearts been
I mean its crazy right this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought pulled me out and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now youre leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south which leads to crazy fights
And I dont know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love we wanna continue it but
This aint the same old love song
Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
But you know what makes it worth it
To watch someone progress to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
Its something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesnt move
The commitments to yourself and that youre always learning
To acknowledge youre both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary but its so complex
The most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it can work Im attempted nah were living it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that come on
Every time
I cant
Ignore you
Every time I come around
I see your face
Always moving
Yo just working on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does or doesnt work we both know that it was meant to breathe
Cant hide from experiences
And theres so many people out there in this world were gonna find interesting
Its only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away what you expect
You see Im wondering where are you
Tearing the label off of a beer as Im sitting at this bar stool
You would tell me not to call you
To never use you as a fall through to sit with my emotion
But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you you know
Lets get em come on
We been together
But in my head
We would break apart
I would hold my heart tied inside
But you knew that my soul
Could not be
Given to anybody
Easily woahohoh
Woahohoh
Woahohoh woahohoh
Its a beautiful thing isnt it
One more time Ev  Every time
I cant
Ignore you  It feels good dont it 
Every time I come around
I see your face  Yes 
Always moving
