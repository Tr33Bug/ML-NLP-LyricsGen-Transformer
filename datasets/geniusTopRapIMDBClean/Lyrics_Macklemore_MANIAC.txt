I dont wanna dance with a maniac
Cause the moment we touch its a heart attack
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I could give a damn youre a maniac
And youre talkin like a killer got me on my back
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I fell in love with her moonwalk
Dancin in the kitchen in her tube socks
I shoulda saw the signs but refused dawg
How am I supposed to ever move on
Why is this so complicated You said that you didnt love me
Said you workin on yourself you aint been to therapy since 2020
Somethin isnt right see it in your eyes
Always give advice never takin mine
When I say goodnight Im thinkin
Oohoohoohooh
You get on my nerves Im a foooohoohool
You better reimburse all the things you dooohohh
Put me in a hearse we both coocoocoocool
Its never gonna work
I dont wanna dance with a maniac
Cause the moment we touch its a heart attack
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I could give a damn youre a maniac
And youre talkin like a killer got me on my back
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I think we need some space I think we need a break
I think I need to move I think this isnt safe
Why the hell you follow me to Walmart
Gotta know everything you aint Nardwuar
Dress up on Friday nights turn up til Sunday mornin
Im Mr Probably Right ignorin all the warnings
I shouldnt wanna kick it too many red flags
I knew you were problematic cause all of your exes are mad
Somehow Im back in your arms told you Get back in my car
I know you dont really love me you deserve actin awards
As long as the night is young go crazy I got your back
Ill be posted by the jukebox watchin you dance thinkin


Oohoohoohooh
You get on my nerves Im a foooohoohool
You better reimburse all the things you dooohohh
Keep me down to Earth were both coocoocoocool
But somehow it works lets go
I dont wanna dance with a maniac
Cause the moment we touch its a heart attack
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I could give a damn youre a maniac
And youre talkin like a killer got me on my back
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
I dont wanna dance with a maniac
Cause the moment we touch its a heart attack
You know I love you honey but you got me runnin yeah
