Cant nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like Im whipping marmalade  whoa 
Look at the way that Im shining
I dont be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie
I said dont worry Im timeless
Watching Toy Story 3 thats a great fucking movie
City of Jimi Kurt Quincy
City of me Eddie and Bruce Lee  whoa 
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you aint getting no ride home
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up I need that bass
And my chain so bright cant see my face
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town
All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I aint turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted dont need your opinions
I be on my business and you be on Tinder
And if I was single Id be right there with ya
But Im committed keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they dont get into our party
Tell the bell hop that Im sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon Ill be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna thats fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and Im fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up I need that bass
And my chain so bright cant see my face
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town
When you hear that speaker sound ound ound
You know who it is Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy its gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no oh no we been grinding from the go
Jump start I just bought a new whip push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts Hip Hop aint the same we the new stars
Rock stars look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops and fuck Donald Trump bitch its Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up I need that bass
And my chain so bright cant see my face
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town town town
I be riding through the town
