My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think Im slowly goin under
But I wont ever tell my brother
And now I wonder wheres the good gone
Cause I cant find no miracles til I go home
Oh I wonder wheres the good gone
Need to find me some hope
Wheres my miracle Wheres my miracle
Wheres my miracle
Its been a long night
I just might wake up on the wrong side
I tell myself itll be alright
Sunlight peakin through the dark sky
Bottle it up fall in the cut all out of luck
Drownin in this quicksand and Im swallowin mud
I taste temptation and I fall in and out of love
Grab her hand taxi cab in God we trust
You can wish on all the stars way up in the galaxy
They want you to fall apart so they can have a piece
I threw a hundred in a wishing well
Ad then I came back for a refund
Said all this pressure just might tip the scale
Seen it before its just a rerun
So keep runnin ay I keep runnin
My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think Im slowly goin under
But I wont ever tell my brother
And now I wonder wheres the good gone
Cause I cant find no miracles til I go home
Oh I wonder wheres the good gone
Need to find me some hope
Wheres my miracle Wheres my miracle
Wheres my miracle


I got some secrets I got some secrets
My palms together prayin but I keep on thinkin bout evil
Snakebit in blood and the poison it aint leaving
Wanna sabotage everything one and only enemy
If these walls could talk theyd have a lot of blackmail
Is karma real or not I cant tell
The Devil complimented me and said You dance well
The praise wont save me and neither will the fan mail
Id be a sinner but thank God Im not religious
And Im addicted drugs and women theres no difference
I know the right but the wrong is just so tempting
Ive got a phobia fear of what Im missing amen
