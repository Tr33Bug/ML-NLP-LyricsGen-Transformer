Ive been lackin but I can feel that its the one
All the last threesixtyfiveone sucked
Like God group texted the world and dumped us
Bah bah bah you better watch my bounce back
Ima be the man in here
Glass to the sky like we tryna grab the chandelier
Id like to take this opportunity and toast to me
For bein exactly who Im supposed to be
Cause life is gonna do what life does
I dont wanna look back and regret who I was
Let go of the expectations and then fire one
Forget the tally sheet before all my times up
And I know I gotta roll with it
Im well aware the universe doesnt owe me shit
I know that all of this pain means the growth I think
That next years gonna be better than this  Lets go 
Im still an optimist yeah I
Got a lot to live on time
Aint foolin that shit cause next years gonna be better than better than  Go 
Next years gonna be better than this year  Woo 
Next years gonna be better than this cause
New Years Eve comin with a fresh kiss yeah
Next years gonna be better than this
Im sick of missin out sick of the fear and doubt
Ima get spiritual soon live in the here and now
Alone in my room but you gon hear me loud
And clear lets start it at the top of the year
I want one last cigarette one last sip of it
One last secret one last little bit
One last upper one last sedative
One last supper with the devil and his relatives
And I was gonna change my ways
I was just waitin for that day to pull myself up out of that page
Run that route and make a play so sick of sittin on the bench
Its finally to get in shape and livin like a scrimmage
Thinkin that Ill get another day now no
I aint wait up for coach marchin band
Ima go and parade in my zone goddamn
Man in the mirror finally got on fuckin next year
The time is now to press go and Im gone
