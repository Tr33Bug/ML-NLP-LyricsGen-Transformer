Chad Butler known as Pimp C died in a Los Angeles hotel room
The LA County Coroners office ruled the rappers death accidental and attributed it to a combination of
Apnea
Yes
And syrup and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine
Absolutely we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic
He rolled up asked him what he was sippin on
He said Lean you wanna hit it dawg
Thats the same stuff Weezys sippin huh
And tons of other rappers that be spittin hard
Yup he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip sittin in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox let the bass bump
Take it to the face gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat just so healin
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up cold sweat scratchin itchin
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldnt get off it
Didnt even think he had a problem
Though he couldnt sleep without gettin nauseous
Room spinnin
Thinkin he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name shook him but he never got up
He never got up he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin that it wont be us
It wont be us it wont be us it wont be us
Nah it wont be us
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed ash in a tin
Pack being pushed harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin about some shit they havent lived
Surprise you know the drill
Trapped in a box declinin record sales
Follow the formula violence drugs and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
Theres no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup Percocet and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke depressed and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
Its not conducive to being creative
And I know cause hes my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that Id try after I listen to Dedication
But hes an alien
Id sip that shit pass out or play PlayStation
Months later Im in the same place
No music made feelin like a failure
And trust me its not dope to be twentyfive
And move back to your parents basement
Ive seen my peoples dreams die
Ive seen what they can be denied
And weeds not a drug thats denial
Groundhog Day life repeat each time
Ive seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them we used to chief dimes
Ive seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin and lyin
Friendship cease no peace in the mind
Stealin and takin anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken hopeless headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealers supplyin
That rush that drug that dope
Those pills that crumb that roach
Thinkin I would never do that not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until youre stuck
Lookin in the mirror like I cant believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up keep me up
Hollywood here we come
You can tend to um go a little too far with some of these things they have very strong addictive qualities pills and syrups and whatnot so um
Is it changing the music
Um I can only speak for myself personally you know what Im saying
Um we had been taking down toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album of course probably wont have any references to cough syrup in it
But uh its a little bit more than the music
I think its gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people
