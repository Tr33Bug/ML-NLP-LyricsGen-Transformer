Over It Lyrics
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you

I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll, and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happened, long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity, and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I can't reason with a terrorist
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin, turn them into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me "Where's she been?"
Send her packing, now she's living back out at her parents' crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, "This the last time, I'm for real"
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There is no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Can't get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we don't make anymore
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (Oh, oh)
(And now I'm free)

Back on the "Why didn't you text me?"
Back on the "Shit, I was busy"
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that "Well, she don't do it, and I know that somebody else will"
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it, please Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners, if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it
You might also like
We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now I'm free (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
Now I'm free, yeah (Oh oh)
(And now I'm free)13Embed
