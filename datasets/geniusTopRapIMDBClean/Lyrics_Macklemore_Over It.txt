We got that bad love but it taste like medicine
I never had love so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought Id have to choose
Between paradise and you
I still creep on your Gram oh
See you with you and your man oh
And I scroll and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history aint happened long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity and we repeat it
Momma said we need counseling
But I cant reason with a terrorist
Oh this is embarrassing
You aint Cinderella aint no pumpkin turn them into fuckin carriages
You create a narrative people ask me Wheres she been
Send her packing now shes living back out at her parents crib
Fight break up we fuck we fight break up you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them This the last time Im for real
You text me then the next thing you know Im behind the wheel
Pull up fuck you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There is no use for you texting my phone
Got FOMO the minute I walked out the door
Cant get in the gate because I changed the code
Now you can toast to the love we dont make anymore
We got that bad love but it taste like medicine
I never had love so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought Id have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now Im free  Oh oh 
Im free yeah  Oh oh 
Im free yeah  Oh oh 
Now Im free yeah  Oh oh 
And now Im free 
Back on the Why didnt you text me
Back on the Shit I was busy
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobodys listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception back to the selfwill
Back on that Well she dont do it and I know that somebody else will
You cheated I cheated you cheated I cheated I mean it please Father forgive us
The dirt that youve done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I tried to cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish that isnt commitment
I try to hold it and I try to hold it and
Numb to it all and ignoring it
Im just searching where the closure is
Going in circles not noticing
But in my heart I know Im not over it


We got that bad love but it taste like medicine
I never had love so I learned to settle quick
I guess I never thought Id have to choose
Between paradise and you
And now Im free  Oh oh 
Im free yeah  Oh oh 
Im free yeah  Oh oh 
Now Im free yeah  Oh oh 
And now Im free
