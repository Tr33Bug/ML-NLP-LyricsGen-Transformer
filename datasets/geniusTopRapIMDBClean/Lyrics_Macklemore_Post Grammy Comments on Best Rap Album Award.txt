To Kendrick You got robbed I wanted you to win You should have Its weird and sucks that I robbed you I was gonna say that during the speech Then the music started playing during my speech and I froze Anyway you know what it is Congrats on this year and your music Appreciate you as an artist and as a friend Much love
My text to Kendrick after the show He deserved best rap album Im honored and completely blown away to win anything much less 4 Grammys But in that category he should have won IMO And thats taking nothing away from The Heist Just giving GKMC its proper respect With that being said thank you to the fans Youre the reason we were on that stage tonight And to play Same Love on that platform was a career highlight The greatest honor of all Thats what this is about Progress and art Thank you grammys
