Ten Million Lyrics
I paid my dues, now I'm really on
Prince to the SEA, put my city on
Left the condo for a bigger home
Everything clean like my chicken bones
I work hard, I work hard for it
Had to go back to the chalkboard
We was tourin' countries all foreign
Now I don't gotta open car doors
So say what's up to my haters at the club tonight
I'll be busy singing my daughter lullabies
When she sleep, I hit the booth and get super lit
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life
Living my dreams I can sleep in another life, yeah
The tensions so thick, you can cut with a butter knife, yeah
If that's your example of artists, then what am I?
You lied, they consume it, you say that you boomin'
That's probably why Metro don't trust you, gosh
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah

Ten million sold, go and look at that
Ain't no middleman gonna get any of that
I suck at math, but I know how to add (1 + 1)
That's a whole lotta money
Bought my baby's momma momma a pad
Wow, do a spin move on stage looking like the white James Brown
There's a whole lotta people in this arena, you know it sold out (sold out, sold out)
Took my daughter on the road and she pointing at me from the crowd (from the crowd, from the crowd)
Saying, "That's my daddy, top 5 on stage," no doubt
In God we trust, God we trust
They ain't came in the same way
They are not with us, not with us
Came back and it's game time
This the follow-up, and now I'm up
I decided that was not enough
Dopps and Budo with that final touch
Competition, go and line 'em up
I run this shit, I run this shit, put that on my momma
I done this shit, I done this shit, since I was pushin' a Honda
No one hit shit, no one hit shit, platinum plaques in mi casa
And my accountant's dead (rest in peace)
Couldn't count the commas
You might also like
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
I am not surprised, I am not surprised, yeah
Had to optimize, then monopolize, yeah
We turn out the lights, then we come alive, yeah
All these dollar signs, ain't no 9 to 5, yeah
