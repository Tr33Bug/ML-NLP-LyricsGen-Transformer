Thank God its Friday
Got my paycheck and Im going home
Leaving my job on the highway turn up my stereo
Because last weekend sucked
But this ones gonna be different
Because its fucking Friday Im getting drunk and we gonna kick it
Then my friends like Hey man whats going on  I dont know 
We all know though that were gonna get drunk at the club
Get it crunk to the same shit we did the week before
Meet at the store
Free funking in my house
In high school it was drinking games
Bad house parties in Ikes house
But now we go on the town
We gotta hit the club
We gotta spend them bucks
And we gotta get it crunk
Seven for a drink and fifteen cash at the entrance
And thank heavens Wells Fargos got overdraft protection
We walked up in
Yes theyre spinning RKellys remix to the remix about a chick and skeeted on her belly
The females  woop woop  theyre done and therere plenty
I got two dollars ah charge it bartender a round of Henny
Were going to the club club
Pour me another one gotta get numb numb
Hopefully end up with a girl I can fuck fuck
Oops baby you know that I meant love love
Whos coming with me back to my tub tub
Now Macklemore you know you aint got no hot tub man tub tub
Shut up man she dont know us us
Everybody toast your glasses tonights the best night ever
Now whos getting hammered
Im on the wall drunk as fuck
Like this sucks Im hella bored
Decided to cut the rug with a female like stellar on the floor
Break her off her stiletto sore
Thought she was Puerto Rican started talking
Im like Woops its a honky shes just hella orange
My homies like Mack what you tell her for She was feeling you
Dawg I could peel her foo this is Washington not Florida
The white girls are looking for some big black dick
The black girls are all Yeah hes cute for a white guy but thats about it
Asians kicking with Asians
And the Latinos are too beautiful
Wish I could confidently be like Girl you dont know what I could do to you
Get her back to the pad and probably bust in my pants
Shed be like Ooh ah pappy Id be like sorry
Think Imma buy you a drink Better find you a shrink
Im rich bitch psych 
I sling CDs and grind tapes bet your boyfriend cant spit
Get the clit to vibrate
I should have stayed home I get more chicks on MySpace


Theres that sweaty girl  sweaty girl 
In the corner on ebomb
Thinking shes in a Missy video but really looks like a retard
And theres the wall muggers  wall muggers 
That shout just to seem hard
And theres the ball suckers  ball suckers 
That fight and just seem odd
I spent seventyfive dollars and these drinks dont work
Who the hells this ugly taint skank
Why are my friends in pink shirts
My hats too big
My airforces were clean when I came here
Now theyre stained in beer
And who peed on my white tee
I thought this was the spot I was supposed to get jocked
Theres a dude talking on chickens and theyre clucking for cocks
Funny thing is were all insecure
Thats why we call the bartender and tell him to give us a beer
Until our judgement is blurred and little voices slush and they slur
We getting faded waking up hungover and going to work
Do it every weekend this is the life
You better peep it
And it aint no secret the club sucks but do we go
Better believe it
