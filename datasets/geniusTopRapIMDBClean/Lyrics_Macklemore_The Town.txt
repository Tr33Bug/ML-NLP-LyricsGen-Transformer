Now when I say 20 you say
Nah you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music our movement the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama theres respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
Its a rite of passage Im not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn Life Alpha P Massline and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them amen
Alright then just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
Its Good Medicine that Chief Sealth wouldve been proud of
Sends our city town pride heart blood sweat tears I5
North South side vibe live ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance
Music it saves lives these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form weve learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know whats up
Yup and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers but became through my music
Take that away thats a vital
14 Fathoms Deep Do the Math Tribal
My greatest teachers BSelf and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out no matter how hard it rains
Northwest making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do coming to my side
I mean I like how yall do
Thank you but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue
Thats right when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in cause theyre broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it alright
I get on stage style share my whole life
Try to reach em at the bar where theyre drinking Miller Lite
But the kids in the front they bring out the passion dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped forgot when they werent too cool to be a fan damn
Hatin at the concert
You dont remember RKCNDY watching Heiro or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know its not the same it never will be
But my my my my citys filthy
And weve been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin in Sir Mixalots video
Back when Scene was rockin house parties on the floor
JMGs Sit N Spin and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here so much has not
I was just a kid hopin I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter wholl give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected they would connect with it
Now looking over the citys the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
Its like my city stands still the world looks on
If I could only capture its beauty and put it in a song
