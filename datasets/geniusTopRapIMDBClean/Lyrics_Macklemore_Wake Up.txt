So I was relaxing at the spot
And some dude came through and was like Yo you got flows
I was like Of course and I asked him if he rhymed
And he was like Only when Im off this sizzurp
I love to rap I dont even care if youre whack
You got flows and a beat we can do that
He was like Okay but you go first so I spit an unedited
Spontaneous improvisational verse and we were chillin
Then this fool grabbed the mic and was like
Yeah I be killin stackin millions eatin children
Fuck a slut bitch I interrupted his ignorant ass
And said Unless youre trying to sound like Brother Lynch
On shermstick that the microphone you need to pass
You dont got a Bentley I just heard you talkin about your bus pass
He said Fool you dont know me
Im crazy blood Im a North End rider just ask my homies
I jack white boys like you I replied
Youre white too he said Honky I wear FUBU
Ill fight you Lets go head up
I told him My man slow your roll peep the flow and just wake up

So I was talking to one of my teachers and they asked me what kind of music I made
And I said Hip Hop Im an MC and I make beats
And he laughed and hes like
Mm you must be like Eminem
First of all hip hop is my life
My culture my blood and me being white
Doesnt have anything to do with my skills
He said Oh youre like Will Smith Puff Daddy dollar dollar bill bill
Nah bro
Never associate me with Eminem blingblingers RB singers
Im just sendin out words that the youth can relate to
So they can stay faithful
Themselves they regulate when ignorant people degrade you
You should respect one another youre a teacher
And still havent learned you shouldnt judge a book by its cover
He said Oh Im sorry brother calm down homie dont bust a cap in me word to your mother
I tried to help my teacher see the light
But ignorance leaves people in the dark seeing only black and white
I looked him in the eyes and told him straight up
You cant teach if you dont listen open your eyes and just wake up

So I was at the bus stop kicking a beatbox
And started conversing with some lady about music
And she asked me if it was true that
All people have guns smoke blunts and drink forties in hip hop
So I told her
Dont believe everything that you hear
The news associates acculturate violence and fear
Fear extorts fear
Hip hop is universal
A positive outlet with energy flowing through the circle expressing souls without rehearsal
A conscious movement in tune with
The mental physical spiritual side of the music
Its about love
Unfortunately its stereotyped as a culture thats based upon thugs
Hip hop is not about guns
And like all cultures yes some hip hop heads do drugs
Thats not even relevant
In moderation drugs can actually open eyes and expand the elements
Ive come closer to my ancestors remnants
Scripting my life through the force of their spiritual presence
I use my lyrics as the evidence
You question hip hops drug use
You should be questioning the Presidents
