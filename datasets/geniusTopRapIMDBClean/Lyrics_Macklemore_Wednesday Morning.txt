Bad taste bad taste in my mouth
Flag wavin flag wavin at a patriots house
Lookin for change on the couch
Mad world mad world thats what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up will the world be the same
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave
See I hope I hope that its gon be alright
But what a helluva a night
Humanity is a privilege we cant give in
When they build walls well build bridges
This is resistance were resilient
When they spread hate we shine brilliant
March by the millions til they hear the children
We found ourselves at a distance
Open up the jails and the overcrowded cells
When we oppress anyone we oppress ourselves
Greatest gift I ever learned is helpin someone else
You feel fully fulfilled cause you forget about yourself
Service purpose works if you work it
Love everyone regardless of the God they worship
This isnt the apocalypse
We cant address the hate til we acknowledge it
If Jesus was alive would he let Mohammed in
This isnt nature my daughter hugs strangers
We teach fear and preach hatred
Put up a fence scared to meet our neighbors
Think that if we let them in theyll take advantage of us later
Theres so much anger in this world as I raise her
My daughter hope its a dream when I wake up tomorrow
Bad taste bad taste in my mouth
Flag wavin flag wavin at a patriots house
Lookin for change in the couch
Mad world mad world thats what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up will the world be the same
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave
See I hope I hope that its gon be alright
But what a helluva a night
And we fight for the people that havent had a voice
Fight for the first amendment fight for freedom of choice
Fight for womens rights if she does or doesnt carry
We ride for all the queer folk and fight for all to get married
Im not moving to Canada not fleein the nation
No time for apathy no more tears and no complainin
Gotta fight harder for the next four and what were faced with
Got my daughter in my arms and he is not gonna raise her
Bad taste bad taste in my mouth
Glad wave Im glad wavin at a Patriots house
Lookin for change in the couch
Mad world mad world thats what the TV said
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up will the world be the same
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave
See I hope I hope that its gon be alright
But what a helluva a night
