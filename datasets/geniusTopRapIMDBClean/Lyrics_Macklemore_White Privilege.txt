I see so many people lost who really try to pretend
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend
When I take a step to the mic is hiphop closer to the end
Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
They marketed the windmill the air flair and head spin
And white rappers albums really get the most spins
The face of hiphop has changed a lot since Eminem
And if hes taking away black artists profits I look just like him
Claimed a culture that wasnt mine the way of the American
Hiphop is gentrified and where will all the people live
Its like the Central District Beacon Hill to the South End
Being pushed farther away because of what white people did now
Wheres my place in a music thats been taken by my race
Culturally appropriated by the white face
And we dont want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
Cause its human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites dont want to acknowledge this is occurring
Cause we got the best deal the music without the burden
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hiphop
And we hate the mainstream cause were the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear tshirts that say Brooklyn
But its not about black and white right
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you dont give them props isnt that selfish
Thats like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me
I feel like I pay dues but Ill always be a white MC
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesnt change the fact that this cultures not mine
But Im gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something thats effortless and shouldnt be hard
I said Im gonna be me so please be who you are
But we still owe em 40 acres now weve stolen their 16 bars
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true nope
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true Im not keeping it true
Now I dont rap about guns so they label me conscious
But I dont rap about guns cause I wasnt forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could choose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college
Now whos going to shows the kids on the block starving
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content
Marketed the music now adapted to the lifestyle
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Wheres my place in the music thats been taken by the media
With white corporations controlling what theyre feedin ya
I brought up Aesop Rock but Im not even dissing dude
We love hiphop and what do you think caucasians are listening to
And I speak freely when I write this
If a black MC examined race there goes half their fan base white kids
And this is so true
And we didnt even have to fight the system we just went and picked up the microphone too
And we got good at it so we should be rappin
But only supporting them is like burning Jimi and buying Clapton
Now Claptons incredible but no Jimi no foundation
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with dorags trying to practice their accents
From the suburbs to the upperclass mastering a language
But hiphop is not just memorizing words
Its rooted in authenticity something you literally cant learn
But Im gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something thats effortless and shouldnt be hard
I said Im gonna be me so please be who you are
But as Im blessed with the privilege theyre still left with the scars
Hiphop started off on a block that Ive never been to
To counteract a struggle that Ive never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means Im not keeping it true nope
