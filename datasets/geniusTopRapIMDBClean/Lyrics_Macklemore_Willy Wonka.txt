RIP Willy Wonka watch the roof come off  Willy 
I pull up in that candy paint call it Veruca Salt  skrrr 
You cheated and you lied you broke the rules my dawg  rules 
Now you wanna come around when theres food involved
Hell no
Let the truth be told Im in a Coogie robe
With the Dookie rope and Lil Boosie on  Boosie 
Im eating sushi rolls doin the tootsie roll  hey 
Thinkin bout future goals hater what you been on  yeah 
Im in a neutral zone Im bout to lose control
Then Im hoppin out you think its Rick Ross
Im pullin out in that Maybach
Didnt cop that from the thrift shop  hey 
With my daughter singing Hakuna Matata
Why they hootin and hollerin
Im maneuverin out to Budapest
And my baby momma duckin the audit
The IRS been callin tryna get in my wallet
But they aint gettin all of it
I put my feet up on the ottoman I ought to be relaxin yall  relax 
Cause Im just bout that action boss bbbout that action boss
Im a motherfuckin icon  icon 
Boots made of python  python

She got her lips round my my anaconda  oh 
Hands on my hip when I grip the burner  brrrt 
Roll up some cookie you smell the burner  cookie 
Willy Wonka probably pour deuce
Blowin up this money like a flute
I pipe the shit up but cant pipe that bitch up  pipe 
No Super Bowl ring but not one Super Bowl  hey 
Ooh what would you do for some dough  huh 
Flash I took a picture for Vogue  flash 
I never play with my nose  no 
My wrist is a fridgerator cause its cold  cold 
Pull up in the frog I suppose  skihi 
I was broke when I was a tadpole  broke 
Hoppin out the ghost  ghost 
Jumpin in the crowd off the ropes  woo 
All in her mouth like Scope  brah 
Green Lamborghini fourclover  skrrt 
How many horses up in your motor  err 
Snakes in the grass they cobras  snake 
Tryna get five hundred like Hova  Ms 
Rain drop iced out emoji
