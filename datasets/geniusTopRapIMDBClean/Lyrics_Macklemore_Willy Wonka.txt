Willy Wonka Lyrics
R.I.P. Willy Wonka, watch the roof come off (Willy)
I pull up in that candy paint, call it Veruca Salt (skrrr)
You cheated and you lied, you broke the rules, my dawg (rules)
Now you wanna come around when there's food involved
Hell no
Let the truth be told, I'm in a Coogie robe
With the Dookie rope, and Lil Boosie on (Boosie)
I'm eating sushi rolls, doin' the tootsie roll (hey)
Thinkin' 'bout future goals, hater what you been on? (yeah)
I'm in a neutral zone, I'm 'bout to lose control
Then I'm hoppin' out, you think it's Rick Ross
I'm pullin' out in that Maybach
Didn't cop that from the thrift shop (hey)
With my daughter, singing "Hakuna Matata"
Why they hootin' and hollerin'
I'm maneuverin' out to Budapest
And my baby momma duckin' the audit
The IRS been callin', tryna get in my wallet
But they ain't gettin' all of it
I put my feet up on the ottoman, I ought to be relaxin', y'all (relax)
'Cause I'm just 'bout that action boss, 'b-b-bout that action boss
I'm a motherfuckin' icon (icon)
Boots made of python (python)
I met with the Pres and I'm in Obama's iPod (hey)
My front yard got all kinda cars
Long Caddy, blue body, call it Avatar
I don't really fuck with the caviar
6 figures gets you 16 Wonka bars, give me that
Willy Wonka flavor (Willy Wonka)
Willy Wonka been had haters (Hey)
Willy Wonka live on acres (Acres)
Willy Wonka got a lot of paper (Racks)
Golden ticket put you in a wraither (Wraith)
I barely see my own neighbors (Where?)
Willy Wonka, I got flavor
Willy Wonka, I got flavor
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver
Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, lifesaver
Willy Wonka, I got flavor

I woke up like
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka
Bitch, I'm Willy Wonka

I got more flavor than Willy Wonka (flavor)
I took three bitches to Benihana's (woo)
I took a jet out to Punta Cana (pew, pew)
She got her lips 'round my my anaconda (oh!)
Hands on my hip when I grip the burner (brrrt)
Roll up some cookie, you smell the burner (cookie)
Willy Wonka probably pour deuce
Blowin' up this money like a flute
I pipe the shit up but can't pipe that bitch up (pipe)
No, Super Bowl ring, but not one Super Bowl (hey)
Ooh, what would you do for some dough? (huh?)
Flash, I took a picture for Vogue (flash)
I never play with my nose (no)
My wrist is a 'fridgerator 'cause it's cold (cold)
Pull up in the frog, I suppose (skihi)
I was broke when I was a tadpole (broke)
Hoppin' out the ghost (ghost)
Jumpin' in the crowd off the ropes (woo)
All in her mouth like Scope (brah)
Green Lamborghini, four-clover (skrrt)
How many horses up in your motor? (err)
Snakes in the grass, they cobras (snake)
Tryna get five hundred like Hova (M's)
Rain drop, iced out emoji

Flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, got flavor, life saver
