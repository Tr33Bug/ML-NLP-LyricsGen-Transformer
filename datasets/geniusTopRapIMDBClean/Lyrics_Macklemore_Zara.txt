So we end up at Zara
Late night hit the city
And we go out to Target

You read bell hooks and Cornell West
You make me quesadillas when Im stressed
And be like Boy you better clean up the mess
And take out the trash before you come back
Stay in amen dont fall asleep til the AM
Wake up in the morning and Im prayin
Sunlight made its way in gave me angels
And I hold em paint a mural so golden  alright 
And my girl she sweet as hell
But well have a world star moment
Like Ill fuck this bitch up  whoa

And jump in if theres a problem  progress 
But not today the ocean waves
