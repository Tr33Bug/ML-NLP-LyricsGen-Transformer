Uh uh
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
99 Double Up uh uh
Yo when you look in my eyes what chu see
A sincere man or just a bunch of G
Why second guess the brotha would last
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave
The booties in Aruba boats and hoover crafts
So if Biggie could love the dough Murda could love the cash
Butter Benz gave the Tahoe to my other half
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have
Why dread it tell the waiter too much ice in the crib
Blinks so drunk he think we singing Nights Like This
He say when he grow up he want a life like this
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this
While girls throwin head I aint even touch dice
I aint trust Don King how my trust Mike
I date bull daggers aint I dont trust Dykes
Need a cleaner nina cuz they dont bust right
I aint stingy when everybody see the plush life
Buy rims before the benz so I look just right
Girls love me try to get the girls that love Mike
All I need is cup of KoolAid I got enough ice
All I ever wanted was you for me
Cuz that nigga who Im with dont give a fuck about me
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you
Cuz that girl who you with dont give a fuck about you
You unhappy and I can see it when you cry
You look like your life has just been minimized
I aint your man Im your man on the side
You just call me when you plan to slide
And if you ever feel like you wanna creep
All you gotta do is just give me a beep
Only way I wont call you back less Im asleep
Gettin my money or layin it wit a piece
We hit the block shop alot
She see her man but she dont wanna drop the top
And you know that dont really mean a thing to me
Cant no girl ever run game with me
You know Mase got alot of places to be
Spots in Ohio kick in NC
And I be wit older dudes and know the rules
So if a man pick up I know what code to use
All I ever wanted was you for me
Cuz that nigga who Im with dont give a fuck about me
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you
Cuz that girl who you with dont give a fuck about you
If you cheat on me Imma cheat on you
If you dont speak of me I wont speak of you
Ill tell you now we wait about a week or two
Then I know what we could do
We could just get our food and stay in
Cuz people on the block is hatin
They know your man and know we datin
So we gotta do this just to stay friends
OK  Amen
I lay back I zone
You say that its on
Then the girl try to snatch the phone
So I knew I was happier home
All I ever wanted was you for me
Cuz that nigga who Im with dont give a fuck about me
And all I ever wanted was to be there for you
Cuz that girl who you with dont give a fuck about you
