Street wise I dont just roll alone we ride

It aint that you not my man but Mase my man more
And family is the only thing I stand for
Blinky Blink yo I know alotta niggas tell you this dog

Blood is thicker than all this here
Dont be worrying bout the cars the clothes
The money or these hoes

Blood is thicker than all this here
Dont be worrying bout the cars the clothes
The money or these hoes
You know blood is thicker than all this here
You heard me blood is thicker than all this
Blood is thicker than all this blood is thicker than all this
Ill be whatever you call this
Im Cash Money like them Hot Boys in New Orleans
That thin vest you got on slugsll go through all this
And burn so when you see me salute and fall in
Im real and only the real would understand me
Got love for my niggas thats why the chickens cant stand me
Wasnt for your mami I woulda got the grammy
But thats what niggas get goin against they family

And truthfully a nigga cant do nuthin to me
On the real you know my nigga BIG used to school me
Said never do a show for less than a QT
If a nigga get to you he gon get through me
And if a mugger move wrong I put one in his coffee
If a nigga shoot at you you know he gotta shoot at me
More then less my mother used to warn me for the best
Said Mase niggas gon love you nigga long as you fresh
Long as you hot long as you cop
Long as you not that nigga who be doin never come through the block
But think about it now Mase who wouldnt love you alot
You take niggas around the world with girls suckin they cock
But just because a nigga ride witchu fly witchu high witchu
That dont mean when bullets come he gon die witchu
It be them niggas you be knowing that long
You be killed run up the block with your new Rolley on
Dont be quick to flip a nigga brick and spend whats on
Cuz if they recognize you stole them pots bring the war
Now you could skate now or stick around
But dont be afraid to call the name when this all go down
You feelin me now
Cuz if Im showing you something that you never seen
Then you gon shake when you see this dusty M16 come off the shelf
I know we kill for what but what they brought
Nigga we came to kill you got the gun put in sto
And what about the block niggas cant get nuthin in his coat
Cuz them the same niggas we took em on they wanted to smoke
So leave them niggas there
Blood is thicker than all this here
Dont be worrying bout the cars the clothes
The money or these hoes
Blood is thicker than all this here
Cuz anything you love in life
You cant take it when you go
Blood is thicker than all this here
Dont be worrying bout the cars the clothes
The money or these hoes
You know blood is thicker than all this here
You heard me blood is thicker than all this
Blood is thicker than all this blood is thicker than all this
