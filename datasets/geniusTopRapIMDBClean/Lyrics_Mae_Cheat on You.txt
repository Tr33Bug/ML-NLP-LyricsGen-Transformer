Yo yo
Yo if you gonna hit niggas girl
Just expect niggas to hit your girl
And thats it
112 help me say 
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
Mae come on
If Im in the streets or Im in my Jeep
And Im with my peep ex know not to speak
See its all good and its all sweet
All women flirt all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the Bad Boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach never caught when I cheat
If I aint work late I say I was with my peeps
And quick to tell a ho yo I aint get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it aint your pencil its how you write your name
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
Aint nobody hotter than the Jam Don Dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick lie to Escada Prada
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 on my Benz them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You dont got TV whatcha mean who am I
If you knew what I knew you wouldnt be givin her pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Half you cats couldnt live in my world
Cause you couldnt picture another nigga hittin your girl what
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
Is it because my game is stronger name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth of caine
Chicks stop mesmerize rub up on they tatas
Like push up bras who you dealin with ma Its Jigga
You know the rawest ice is flawless baby
Nights is lawless recite for ballers
And I fools yall fake players every time
Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due but Im unfadeable
Mommy screamin Papi can I skate with you
They wanna ride with me stay fly with me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But Im straight though thanks ma I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin
I get Shirley Murdock I hope your door slam lock Im gone
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man
Why wouldnt she cheat on you
Why wouldnt she cheat on you 
Yo you cant think you gonna be cheatin
And the girl aint gonna cheat
Just like you cheat they could cheat
And I just think you a fool if you think girls dont cheat
