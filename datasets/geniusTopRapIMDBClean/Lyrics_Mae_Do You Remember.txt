Oooohhhyeah yeah
Hands in the sky
And put em up hiiigh  X2 
Gimme reason why
Cmon
If its your thing that aint workin then you improvise
Whyits meyou hatethats genocide
Everytime Im in a vibe
Its me that they criticize
But everytime they in a ride
Its my song they memorize
The richer get richer the poorer get poorer
See Im here to save the city like Sodom and Gomorrah
Got a order Im awaitin from a 404
My auras not the Torah plus Im jazzy like Norah
See my codi call me wodi and dont even know me
I been around the world man without a roadie
See Im classic like a Audi
Save the game like a goalie
Got my Rollie holy so you can call me holy rollie
You dont know what youre in for dont do no indoor
Im not tintin my windows
Im not duckin no bimbos
Im saying NO to the nymphos
You got something to say then send your memo
X2
Do you remember how it used to be
Back in 96 when I made ya move ya feet
The feelins back so get up out your seat
Lets do it again and again and again
Yea yea yea yea
Now it was this bounce that opened up a Swiss account
If you get this you guaranteed for this amount
Now can we pause for a minute under the authentic
See I aint said a word and youre already in it
See money is my linen I get it as long as they print it
I tell ya that far invest in Nascar
I leave the streets smokin like brand new black tar
Girlsput stickeys everywhere my ass are
Silver horsey on the back is this a fast car
Yellow ice on Sunday pink on a Monday
White ice Six Flags family on a fun day
Know much about a Hyundai if you wanna come stay
We kick it beat ticket make on a oneway
Now what they gon say I dont need it
They dont really tell the truth man they life was defeated
They quite conceited
They rockin all that ice thats treated
I wrote a book about it like to read it
Huh huh huh huh

 X2
Do you remember how it used to be
Back in 96 when I made ya move ya feet
The feelins back so get up out your seat
Lets do it again and again and again
Say ohhhhyeah yeah
Hands in the sky and put em high  2X
Uh uh
Engine in the back no rooftop
Feet on gas with no need for cash oo oo oooh
Trunk in the front
I make a million in a month like pumps in the bumps
You know Mason be that very fellow that bring canary yellow
Hand so heavy that its hard to say hello
Im somethin you got to have like strawberry Jello
Same jewellery in the hood
Cause I aint scared of the ghetto
You know it
X2
Do you remember how it used to be
Back in 96 when I made ya move ya feet
The feelins back so get up out your seat
Lets do it again and again and again
Say ohhhhyeah yeah
Hands in the sky and put em high  2X
