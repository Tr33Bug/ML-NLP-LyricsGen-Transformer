Uh uh come on uh
It be the same cats that wouldnt listen to my demo
Now I want they ass in my limo cuz now Im a sex symbol
Intercontinental LA airplay just like Jay Leno
Now all the labels out wanna send a memo
To do a remix yall but Mase say NO
Figure once I make it theyll fake it
And aint nobody show me love when I was naked
And when he threw my tape in the trash I laughed
Now a nigga tape on blast I laugh
Figure as days pass make more cash
And I push everything from E to Hclass
Four years ago I couldnt go to a show
I was standin on the corner sellin dope for dough
Now I no longer hope Ill blow smoke my dro
On a yacht nigga fuck a boat that row
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Yo the reality of it all everybody cant ball
If you had currency you wouldnt be worryin bout me
But see I could go the whole summer gold Hummer
But Id rather go Lex bubble cuz its less trouble
Make my dough and I just stack
No investment I live off just that
Money hoes and clothes and shit that Im best at
But Im a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that
Why do what most do Do what you posed to
Make hot jams yall sell bicoastal
If you want a hit you can let me coach you
Money back on anything that got my vocals
This is so true I do what pros do
Cause broke aint a state that Im tryin to go through
Dealers give me credit any place I go to
Drive out in the Benz say Let Mase owe you
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
See the moral of the story is
Im not here to replace Notorious
Im just a young cat tryin to do his thing
Harlem World style pursue my dream
Cuz see the things that went 3 mil I didnt even like
You say you got mad hoes well where is she tonight
Mase be the cat thatll lead you to the light
Messin with me shorty youll be aight
Stop listen to all them cats on the block
That tellin you that Mase dont rock
Cuz Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht
And a big knot to move you and your moms off the block
For real though Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo
And since you cant beat us its best you join us
Cuz I know you wont have this hold thats on us
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
With all this money that we can make
Why yall cats wanna playa hate
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
Do you wanna get money with us do you wanna
