Why you standin on the wall hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin in the club
Im the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldnt wild when Im in my fresh clothes
Dress as I suppose from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows collect those extra Os
Buy the E get a key to the Lex to hold
