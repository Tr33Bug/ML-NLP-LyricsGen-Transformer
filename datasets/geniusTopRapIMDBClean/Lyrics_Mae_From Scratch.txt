Yo just think if you could rewind time
And start your life all over again
What would you give and what would you keep
You heard me what would you keep
Yo yo if I could go back I wouldnta sold no crack
Wouldnta never put my hands around no gat
But you know Loon bein all hardheaded
And dont listen even if God said it
I didnt have to stick with folks that sniff no coke
I didnt have to fix the block when shit was broke
Same cats I helped was twistin smoke
Now imagine if I went to school went to class
Stead of bein a young cat sent to blast
Sent to slash criminals necks in half
For playin dumb when I come to collect my cash
And cuz of that cats will respect my past I aint playin
If I start from scratch Id sign with Def Jam
Nah fuck am I saying Puffs the best man
Plus Imma Bad Boy Im more like a bad man
Put mo niggas in pits than Brad man
Cant dodge bullets Too bad man
Shit Id a copped the five instead of the six
That way wouldnt of crashed and killed my cousin
Keep quiet instead of having the industry buzzin
Do a devils advocate style dont let em see you comin
Use the revolver when bustin and sluggin
That way no evidence
But fuck it got money to be tried worse come to worse
Who God bless no man curse hatin niggas lay in the dirt
Yo if you could start your life from scratch  What What 
Rewind time and still go back  Its time to eat 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
If you could start your life from scratch  What What 
Rewind time and still go back  About to kill it 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
Come on come on
Yo if I could start life from scratch I wouldnt change shit
Same gun same clip same dumb bitch
All Out Harlem World same old clique
Same old studio same old shit
Shit dont change just because a cop took six to the brain
Meeno got a lawyer man Im hip to the game
You could find a gun but if my prints aint on that thing
What is you sayin
And on the same block that I get my Glocks from
You see the same cop that get popped with the shot gun
Mysonne Mysonne 
And at the same bodega I got my tops from
Mysonne Mysonne 
I give the same old money to the same cops bum
If I could start from scratch Id bring daddy back
And put five in the first cat that show mami crack
I sit back and listen to them drunks on the block
Tryin to school me with jewels tellin me who to watch
I killed five people Id let survive
And the five I took away Id a left alive
If I could do all it again Id bring Virg back
Or I switch places with him I hope you heard that
I would have prefered that I aint have to starve
Pitch crack have to rob and catch a charge
And Id do it all again if I had to
Pitch nowin to win and Id be glad to
And Id hit every target I took aim at
But Id still be a problem you cant change that
Im a problem
Yo if you could start your life from scratch  Uh 
Rewind time and still go back  All Out 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at  And Double Up 
If you could start your life from scratch  Bad Boy Bad Boy 
Rewind time and still go back
Yo I really dont know whats goin on 
What would you change in the way that you live today
Im tellin ya I really dont know whats goin on 
And what would you leave right where its at
Come on come on
Yo cuz half the cats that flip we all was cool
And half the chicks I hit they teased me in school
I got a baby by a lady I dont even love alot
Wish I wore three rubbers case the first rubber popped
But you cant cry now milk already spilt
I had eleven friends and ten already killed
Went down south and I aint feel the guilt
And I aint ready to war but that aint the way built
And for all the nights and all the fights
That I had for all this money over all these dice
All my cars and homes and all my ice
If I could do it all again Id do it all for Christ
Whoever thought the limelight or the superstardom
Whoever thought thered be a problem comin through Harlem
Cant even chill cats wanna make me a villian
Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin
Nobody love me Im my own mister and on my own mister
Mama did what she could but now Im grown mister
Though she told me once wish shed told me then
Though Im the youngest Imma grow to be the oldest man
And cats thinkin they gon win cuz they veterans
Aint about age at this stage man with the most cheddar win
How you live right Every day get in bigger sin
How you say no at the door screamin Let me in
From the outside its lookin gooder than it ever been
To tell the truth when I was broke it was better then
All Out 33rd street
Yo if you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
If you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
Come on come on
