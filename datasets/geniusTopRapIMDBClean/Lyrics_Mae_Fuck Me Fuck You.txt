Fuck Me, Fuck You Lyrics
Yo, I look scared? Huh?
Teamsters, I look scared in here? Huh?
When I go through the hood do I tuck my chain in? Huh??
Do I be in the hood with bodyguards? I thought not
Now look what y'all made me do
I was just good wit' my shiny suit
I wasn't botherin' nobody
I was just throwin' my rollie in the sky
Now look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Lood what you made me do
I ain't even here to play wit' you
What, what, Wanna Blow, what
Yo, Mase hop out the blue Lex wit' about two tecs
Spit fourteen got about two left
If one vest is thin then rock two vest
Triple platinum and only in the U.S
I'm the Harlem-World-slash-All-Out-dot-com
My con, if you could buy Cris' then why buy Don
All you cats at rah-rah-Betty-dot-com
Wanna see a hundred grand then look at my arm
You think I wanna take this too far in a Rugar
Put a hollow bullet through y'all
Have cats at ya wake come out of New York
And ya body in the Salt Lake out in Utah
So you are feel good, leave the country
And then all you are, Spain, baggage claim and they yellin' bonsoir
You think I'm comfy, think Mase won't go home free
Think I'm satisfied make 20 grand monthly
Wanna lump me, walk through clubs they bump me
Wanna tell all they bone chickens how they jump me
They can't wait to see the paramedics come to pump me
While they OT, I'm O.C., I'm out the country

Uh, uh, uh
If you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Nigga, if you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Fuck you

Yo, being at the wrong place at the wrong time
Get some cowards killed and some get long time
I roll wit cats who would roll for me
Bust a gun for cats who will bust for me
Did some wrong, I did some right
I lived the life, sometime I think what will my kids look like
Rarely talk even wit a chick I like
I'm here 'till Thursday, don't make me switch my flight
Don't get your moms caught in the middle of the night
Don't look good for your son but the kid could fight
And yo, you can't prolong but for so long
When it's God playin', no man could hold on
Nigga, I be real when the act be over
See you at the light and snatch your black rover
Cook my coke and crack without the shoulder
And don't mind bustin' a gat without a motive

Uh, uh, uh
If you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Nigga, if you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Fuck you
You know alot of people talkin' 'bout doin' the kid
Never leave witnesses that knew what I did
You wanna harm me cat, bring five of your best
Put two in your ribs and five in your chest and five in the vest
Cat cosign and get the five that's left
Want suicide nigga, I provide your death
No nigga's in the street that die for less
So why confess? We won't leave alive
Unless you keep your feet up frontin' in the jeep
Cuz nigga's who I'm wit spit nothin at your feet
Red dot head shot, fluorescent green beam
For them niggas who test my team
And when your joint jam, my joint'll bust
I kidnap friends cuz the money is a must
And to be real wit' you I feel for you
Cuz two to the head is how I deal wit you
I ain't playin'

Uh, uh, uh
If you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Nigga, if you love me, I love you
The same way you trust me, I trust you
The same way you hug me nigga, I'll hug you
The first time it's fuck me nigga, it's fuck you
Fuck you
