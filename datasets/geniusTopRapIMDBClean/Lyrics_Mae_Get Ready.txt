I remember the days of prayin my chips be right
Louie the 13 no more Cris tonight
Gold to me is like Superman and Kryptonite
So I pray how I dont miss my flight switch to night
Get out the plane it look all strange
See a man from Spain holding up my name
Give him my things and head down to bag claim
And I hear somebody scream my name
So I look back look once look twice
Look fast look left look right
Look Blink look Meeno look Myse
They try tell me honey dont look right
So I approach her it all look Kosher
But there was kids runnin up with posters
And I was startin to lose sight of chauffer
So I had to say nice to know ya

But a girl walked by caught my eye
So I said What the fuck stand here and give me luck
And she whispered in my ear
A purple one on there and put a pink one on there
