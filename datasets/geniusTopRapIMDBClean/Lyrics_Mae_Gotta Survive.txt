I dont regret nothing that I have ever done
At this point I dont owe nobody an explanation  woo yeah 
Man they love you when you up
Kick you when you down
Look around VH1 man where are they now
Life is amusing nobody like to see you cruising
But everybody like to see you losing  non stop 
So I stop despise on top of lies
And if it prophesized Ill be ostracised
One day I lost my rodium on the day I hit the podium
Now Im back on top and salty like sodium
A gift to this world man wrap me with a ribbon
Why do you look for a dead among the living
Some thought I was crazy some said I was missing
Some said I was lazy some said I was different  come on 
I was so loaded that everybody floated
But once I got the notice then I got focused  woo 
And then I saw the motive so everybody bought it
So I did the way wrote it and live it the way I quote it
Come on  yeah 
Gotta survive in this life thats being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
When Im down at the back just keep it real
Gotta survive gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life thats being given to me
Imma survivor to survive 
So I try and to be all I can be  survivor 
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
Gotta survive  Mase  gotta survive  Imma survivor 
Hold up trying to tell me what Im not
Pull up in the Bach not Im all of the sudden hot
Now they want to stop just to look at what I got
Thought they want my home man
Left me out to rot  west side 
So I had to make it on my own take it on my own
I wanted out the hood I had to scape it on my own
Believe me now its easy now
Cause everybody see me now and Im on TV now  woo 
But it started out with low budget
Then I took it around the world the folks love it
In the beggining man my life it was so rugged
But now I shine like a gold nugget
Cause I made the most of it  what 
I know how you feeling man I was weary
Some days I used to sit there my eyes all teary
Thinking to myself do anybody hear me
Now I know you making it out
Is not a theory come on


Gotta survive in this life thats being given to me
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
When Im down at the back just keep it real
Gotta survive gotta survive
Gotta survive in this life thats being given to me
So I try and I try all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps crushing on me
Gotta survive gotta survive
Ive been laughed at talked about ridiculed
But M Dot Betha is still not a bitter dude
And you know its no coincidence
That me and you is not so intimate
I cant fake I dont shake I dont break
I dont lose I dont use I dont groove
