Hey I just wanna see you doing good
Uh
From the first day I met you I knew you were special
You had alot of drama but I used to protect you
Being you was naive yo I could not let you
Do a lot of things so I had to correct you
Im thinking if you just went left instead of right
Right now what would your life be like
And me you know I love the good life
And you I know you hate the hood life
I watch you as you turn and turn
And burn and burn from all your decisions
You could be a Christian rich somewhere
But you aint choose to listen so get somewhere
Its never too late till its too late
Right now if you was with me
You be living in a new state
Riding around with new plates
Living in a new place
But you couldnt tell your crew wait
Cmon
I wanna go back to the days  oh oh oh 
You stayed and you were loving me  oh oh oh 
And I was loving you I was loving you  yeah yeah yeah 
I wanna go cuz I would do so many things  uh uh uh 
So differently  party party party party over there 
Baby me and you would still be together  party party party party over There 
I wanna go back to the days  uh uh and you dont stop 
You know I see you on the beach
Feed her rose peddles I tell you the truth
But then you wanna go settle
A girl like you is on another whole level
Tried to move you out the hood
But you scared to leave the ghetto
I told you anything you say you can have it
With me I always spend a million on my fabric
Established and lavish carrots is a habbit
Im married and that dont mean I want you looking average
I thought you known that take you where your zone at
Peeps in the street talking like they own that
I talk truth but they only want facts
When you wanna do right you know where your homes at
I tell you wait on Lenox that mean wait a minute
Bracelit tennis face it we finished
And just because your not my girl
It doesnt mean your alone in this world


I wanna go back to the days
You stayed and you were loving me
And I was loving you I was loving you
I wanna go
Cause I would do so many things so differently
Baby me and you would still be together
I wanna go back to the days
Im in love with a girl named Twyla
Im in love with a girl from Mississippi named Twyla
Im in love with a girl named Twyla
Im in love with a girl named Twyla Betha  Twyla Betha 
I said Twyla Betha  Twyla Betha 
You know Im in love
Im in love with a girl named Twyla
Im in love with a girl from Mississippi named Twyla
I wanna go back to the days
You stayed and you were loving me
And I was loving you I was loving you
I wanna go
Cause I would do so many things so differently
Baby me and you would still be together
I wanna go back to the days
