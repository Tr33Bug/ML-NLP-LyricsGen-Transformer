I Wanna Go Lyrics
Hey, I just wanna see you doing good

Uh
From the first day I met you, I knew you were special
You had alot of drama, but I used to protect you
Being you was naive, yo I could not let you
Do a lot of things so I had to correct you
I'm thinking if you just went left instead of right
Right now, what would your life be like
And me, you know I love the good life
And you, I know you hate the hood life
I watch you as you turn and turn
And burn and burn from all your decisions
You could be a Christian, rich somewhere
But you ain't choose to listen, so get somewhere
Its never too late, 'till its too late
Right now, if you was with me
You be living in a new state
Riding around with new plates
Living in a new place
But you could'nt tell your crew wait
C'mon
I wanna go back to the days (oh, oh, oh)
You stayed and you were loving me (oh, oh, oh)
And I was loving you, I was loving you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wanna go, cuz I would do so many things (uh, uh, uh)
So differently, (party, party, party, party over there)
Baby me and you would still be together (party, party, party, party over There)
I wanna go back to the days (uh, uh, and you dont stop)

You know I see you on the beach
Feed her rose peddles, I tell you the truth
But then you wanna go settle
A girl like you is on another whole level
Tried to move you out the hood
But you scared to leave the ghetto
I told you, anything you say, you can have it
With me, I always spend a million on my fabric
Established and lavish, carrots is a habbit
I'm married, and that don't mean I want you looking average
I thought you known that, take you where your zone at
Peeps, in the street, talking like they own that
I talk truth, but they only want facts
When you wanna do right, you know where your homes at
I tell you wait on Lenox, that mean wait a minute
Bracelit tennis, face it, we finished
And just because your not my girl
It doesn't mean your alone in this world
You might also like
I wanna go back to the days
You stayed and you were loving me
And I was loving you, I was loving you
I wanna go
Cause I would do so many things, so differently
Baby me and you would still be together
I wanna go back to the days

I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl from Mississippi named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla Betha (Twyla Betha)
I said Twyla Betha (Twyla Betha)
You know I'm in love
I'm in love with a girl named Twyla
I'm in love with a girl from Mississippi named Twyla

I wanna go back to the days
You stayed and you were loving me
And I was loving you, I was loving you
I wanna go
Cause I would do so many things, so differently
Baby me and you would still be together
I wanna go back to the days
Uh, uh
Yeah, H-world
Mason Betha
This that feel good music
That thing that get in your soul
Before you know it
It done took whole of you
Ha, ha, ha
Everybody out there
Right now
Its about 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock matter fact
L.A. time, in the mourning
We did this just for you
You hear me, just for you
We back
You know it, you here
C'mon
You know a real man let you know how he feel
Thas all I got to say1Embed
