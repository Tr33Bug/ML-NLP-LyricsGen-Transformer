The prettiest cars and the prettiest stars
By far the prettiest Misses
I pull up in the prettiest sixes
So by the time you get the six bitch I have the seven
By the time you get the seven I switch to the eight
When it time I get this cake a bitch could wait
They know I could sell five so they ship me eight

You could see I still got it by the look in my eyes

It dont matter if it rain I got a pool inside
And a stretch range so at least 20 could ride
And I could tell fake platinum from a mile away
