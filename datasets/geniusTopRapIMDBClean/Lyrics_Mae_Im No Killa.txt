I’m No Killa Lyrics
Uh, and it don't stop

See I’m all big benzes, coupes and hummer trucks
Hoes don’t really like me I’m just somethin to fuck
What it gone take to make cats slow up
Do I got to go back to pickin 4-4 up
Leavin’ the seen for teams that gone make them throw up
I'm the reason the witness don’t ever show up
Wanna be safe from Mase give a safe to Mase
Neither judge or the jury wanna take this case
One in your mouth you don’t know the rage I’m in
Matter fact you don’t know how mad you made my men
I got niggas at your moms house 8am
And after they through with you they go and blaze your men
You was ass way back then, should of laid you then
Grab a nigga out the building trey straight to his chin
Pull a bullet to his chest that a change his wind
And don’t care bout the pain he's in
I’m no killa, but you could make me one
I’m no thug, but you could make me one
I’m no hustla, but you could make me one
I’m no gangsta, so don’t make me one

Who would ever, ever ,ever make a nigga try me
What you think sumthin tangy bout Mase I see
What it take for blood to clog niggas IVs
For cats to sit back and think why me
Now why you better yet how you
Be a light skinned nigga that get fount sky blue
Either all summer long you been ducking Piru
Or half y’all cats just scared to buy blue
Wit Mase your rival, Mase is liable
Put Blink beside you, then tape and tie you
Rape and hide you, in the lake they find you
With no prints cops can't trace what I do
Now your mother think her baby didn’t deserve this shit
Well her baby shouldn’t fuck with a third of my brick
I got people that’s payin think they ain’t concern with this
Is you thinkin how could one bullet burn like this
Put the word out I want that black suburban hit
One think side of the story from a top journalist
When you dropped in a box with worms on your wrist
Other niggas learn from this
You might also like
I’m no killa, but you could make me one
I’m no thug, but you could make me one
I’m no hustla, but you could make me one
I’m no gangsta, so don’t make me one

Half these cats spit it don’t even live it
And according to they digits they all midgets
See me I rocks wit it, 6 months shock bid it
I go up state see all my cats and count digits
You got guns but never get knocked wit it
Cuz if I’m stopped wit it the cops get it
I'm one of the few that talk about gators and got lizards
You got ice but never go on the block wit it
Jerk your work and you go n still rock wit it
I'll rapped till I’m clapped like Big and Pac did it
Mase get his message from a lifer
He said shorty I was young I was just like ya
Now I’m illy wit the best snipers
Did wheelies wit the best bikers
Gettin’ head from confessed dikers
Saddle thugs and that’s just righteous
Niggas don’t want a war, niggas just hyper
Movin off a motions, I'm no dude for commotion
Leave niggas bruised in the ocean
Neck broken head open chest soakin
Fund him piece by piece wit the rest floatin
I’m no killa, but you could make me one (Yeah, don't make me one)
I’m no thug, but you could make me one (Motherfucker, don't make me one)
I’m no hustla, but you could make me one (Fuck what you heard, nigga)
I’m no gangsta, so don’t make me one (I'm gonna tell you wassup)
I’m no killa, but you could make me one (You can't stop me)
I’m no thug, but you could make me one ('99)
I’m no hustla, but you could make me one
I’m no gangsta, so don’t make me one (So, wassup motherfucker?)Embed
