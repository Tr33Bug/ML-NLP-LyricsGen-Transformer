Uh and it dont stop
See Im all big benzes coupes and hummer trucks
Hoes dont really like me Im just somethin to fuck
What it gone take to make cats slow up
Do I got to go back to pickin 44 up
Leavin the seen for teams that gone make them throw up
Im the reason the witness dont ever show up
Wanna be safe from Mase give a safe to Mase
Neither judge or the jury wanna take this case
One in your mouth you dont know the rage Im in
Matter fact you dont know how mad you made my men
I got niggas at your moms house 8am
And after they through with you they go and blaze your men
You was ass way back then should of laid you then
Grab a nigga out the building trey straight to his chin
Pull a bullet to his chest that a change his wind
And dont care bout the pain hes in
Im no killa but you could make me one
Im no thug but you could make me one
Im no hustla but you could make me one
Im no gangsta so dont make me one
Who would ever ever ever make a nigga try me
What you think sumthin tangy bout Mase I see
What it take for blood to clog niggas IVs
For cats to sit back and think why me
Now why you better yet how you
Be a light skinned nigga that get fount sky blue
Either all summer long you been ducking Piru
Or half yall cats just scared to buy blue
Wit Mase your rival Mase is liable
Put Blink beside you then tape and tie you
Rape and hide you in the lake they find you
With no prints cops cant trace what I do
Now your mother think her baby didnt deserve this shit
Well her baby shouldnt fuck with a third of my brick
I got people thats payin think they aint concern with this
Is you thinkin how could one bullet burn like this
Put the word out I want that black suburban hit
One think side of the story from a top journalist
When you dropped in a box with worms on your wrist
Other niggas learn from this
Im no killa but you could make me one
Im no thug but you could make me one
Im no hustla but you could make me one
Im no gangsta so dont make me one
Half these cats spit it dont even live it
And according to they digits they all midgets
See me I rocks wit it 6 months shock bid it
I go up state see all my cats and count digits
You got guns but never get knocked wit it
Cuz if Im stopped wit it the cops get it
Im one of the few that talk about gators and got lizards
You got ice but never go on the block wit it
Jerk your work and you go n still rock wit it
Ill rapped till Im clapped like Big and Pac did it
Mase get his message from a lifer
He said shorty I was young I was just like ya
Now Im illy wit the best snipers
Did wheelies wit the best bikers
Gettin head from confessed dikers
Saddle thugs and thats just righteous
Niggas dont want a war niggas just hyper
Movin off a motions Im no dude for commotion
Leave niggas bruised in the ocean
Neck broken head open chest soakin
Fund him piece by piece wit the rest floatin
Im no killa but you could make me one  Yeah dont make me one 
Im no thug but you could make me one  Motherfucker dont make me one 
Im no hustla but you could make me one  Fuck what you heard nigga 
Im no gangsta so dont make me one  Im gonna tell you wassup 
Im no killa but you could make me one  You cant stop me 
Im no thug but you could make me one  99 
Im no hustla but you could make me one
Im no gangsta so dont make me one  So wassup motherfucker
