You see if we had more pimps
It wouldnt be no jealous guys
See me I live by the four pimp rules
Number one you control the situation
You get in they head before you get in they bed
And number two girls run like buses you may miss one
Catch another one every hour on the hour promptly
And number three what that girl aint willin to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin
And number four is a new rule to the new pimp testament
You cant be a playa and hate the playas
