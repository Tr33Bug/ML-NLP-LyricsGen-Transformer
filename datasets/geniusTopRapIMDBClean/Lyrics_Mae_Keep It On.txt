Keep It On Lyrics
Do the thing man
Fo real, dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)
H World dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)
M. Betha, dont stop
(And I like it, I, I)

They wanna roll like me, do a show like me
Wanna jump in the ferrari and roll like me
But I know who I be, wit no ID
So much money think the bank owe me
Yo, I do the thing now what you wanna do?
I make the music that you want with ya boo
Go away bring back somethin just for you
Can't no man stop what we come to do
I been flyin all week, I land for a day
Sit somewhere so I can plan my day
I take you to somewhere like St. Tropez
And you though I said San Jose? No way
Come on, you know I wouldn't lead you wrong and
You know I wouldn't lead you on and
If everybody tellin you to keep it off
Who gon say keep it on? Come on
We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right

Uh, we dont stop
I tell those, girls in Melrose
That love Chanel clothes
To keep they legs closed
The way we met, gave you major respect
I move bodies like I wave the tech
I make all the young girls stomp like a majorette
You need lights to engage in sex
And just because you got the best ride
Don't mean you the best guy
Like the car, you can't let everybody test drive
And I know you like expensive trips
Expensive whips, and spendin chips
The drink you drink is an expensive sip
I just bought a home in an expensive zip
And ever since I met you it haven't been dark since
Hold your hands by a central park bench
Twenty million just for the apartment
No financin tell me when your heart went
You might also like
We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right so right
And I like it, (you know I like it) and I like it
And I like it, (I know you like it) I, I
And I like it, (I know they like it) and I like it
And I like it, (Yeah I like it) I, I
And I like it, (I know you like it) and I like it
And I like it, (You know I like it) I, I
And I like it, (Come on, come on, come on) and I like it
And I like it, (Come on, come on) I, I

Now we can just dance, all I need is a chance
To meet ya old man and go and meet ya whole fam
Ain't tryin to weaken ya stance, with a weekend in France
I wanna pay all ya bills like a week in advance
I'm not a rude dude that'll reach for ya hand
And if ya tell him no then he'll understand
Even though, everywhere he go he in demand
And gotta give you no E to try to sneak in ya pants

We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so right
We dont have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We can just chill and kick it all night (kick it all night)
Cause it feels so right (feels so right) cause it feels so rightEmbed
