Hey yo Mase you know what I dont like
Why you over there lookin at me 
I dont like when you know Im in a club
Why you over there lookin at me 
And Im with my honey
Why you over there lookin at me 
You got you know the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of a sudden
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Hit you with the ice grill you know
Haha cause your boys aint with you
Little do they know the girl roll harder than
Some of yo niggas
You dig
Now what the hell is you lookin for
Cant a young man get money anymore
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score
Cant my car look better than yours
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors
I was Murda P Diddy made me pretty
Did it for the money now can you get with me
People wanna know who is he he get busy
Spray so much izzy girls get dizzy
Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World we all got dough
98 Tahoe Tommy and a Roscoe
Case Im ever chased by Donnie Brasco
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here


Yo I cant get mad cause you look at me
Cause on the real look at me
Yo it always be the haters that be sittin in the rear
Dissin every year but they better listen here
You cats keepin it real you cats is on your own
Cause bein broke and alone is something I cant condone
Plus it wont be long til they send me the dome
Sit gently while Im on the Bentley phone
Why you dont like me cause Im mad fly and icy
And why you cant satisfy your wifey
And if it wasnt for this Bad Boy exposure
CD TVs really would I know ya
Now me and Blink float in a gold Rover
So its only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl dont be real committed
Cause Mase will hit it you got to deal with it
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Make it hot baby make it hot  Come on 
Make it hot baby make it hot  Come on 
Make it hot baby make it hot  Come on 
Make it hot baby make it hot  Come on 
We dont stop 
We was all at the Greek Fest its hot and sandy
I rent scooters Im with my family
Tank top flip flop really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy
Who look good enough to be Miss Miami
But say since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin me how she met Puff down at the Grammys
He aint tell you I was the one with no panties
Boo you know how many he meet with no panties
Please tell me something that I dont know
Like if we have sex you dont want dough
And if its not a problem you can meet me at 10
Ill be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon hit me it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies cause wifeys with me
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
Why you over there lookin at me
While my girl standin here
