Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
You think I wanna see you cryin
You think I want you when you need not one more dollar
Then gettin scared every time you hear them sirens
Hear niggas open fire and
Think your baby dead front of a hydrant
But its gon to be a time when
Aint gon be no more winin
No more dinin no more diamonds
No reclinin no more expensive violins
And Ima probably be the one thats cryin
Accordin to my mother if you wanna know if a girl love you
All you gotta do is make her suffer
Stop spendin stop givin her the minks and linen
You will see if this girl gon be with you to the endin
Cause floatin in the drop it be all good
And when you come in on the block it be all good
Givin her money to shop it be all good
But when you get broke dead pop is it all good huh
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why

You know you startin to act just like these bitches
Every fuckin night with these bitches
Whatchu doin fightin with these bitches
They like me for my riches you like me for me
Thats the reason I gave you keys to my V
See you be whippin my Benz
But you still wanna listen to your friends
And them gon be the same bitches with me in the end
You look at your neck what you see plenty of ice
Then you think these hoes dont envy your life
They wanna lay in Brazil spend a day in the hills
It aint hard to shop all day and pay the bills
Fuck the way you feel
And keep it all real I wrote your name on my will
And yo thats real
You think a nigga cheatin cause I dont be all in your ass
You think them your friends
I cut you off all themll laugh
See my shit right there put it all in the bag
You aint gotta say shit to me again just call me a cab Im out
Oh daddy

How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
Now good thing I aint a nigga who get way open
And fall for a chick that live way in Oakland
You pay for a trip she lay up on an ocean
Then you find out this girl playin with your emotions
I had this one chick turned out a dumb chick
Cause all she ever did for me was some dumb shit
But I could peep how mommy used to be foul
And every time I hang up the phone she would redial
But it takes more for Mase to flip
Im the first one to want out this relationship
Save that Jeep receipt just in case you shit
You wanna fuck with my friends take your pick uh
You wanna do your thing do your thing then
But dont be fiendin when you see me minglin
Runnin up sayin you love me and dont know the meanin
When I walk away I could hear the girl screamin
Oh daddy
You know you make me cry
You make me cry too
How can you love me
I cant understand why
I just wanna know why
Oh daddy
