Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Make money make money
Whys it always got to be about some money
Ha ha ha ha
Cause I was born to have it
You satisfied
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
See the charm is global the ice on my arm is oval
Money stacked in the back like its Barnes and Noble
I know a girl Colorado half of mulatto
Said I was hollow till I bought her a Murado
Some call me Mae and some call me Dolla
Some came to hate and some came to holla
Followed by a model I aint even cop a bottle
See me GP and I aint even hit the throttle
Mansion not listed yall got me twisted
Only young boys shop at the district
I hop out of big things rocky wristed
Now everybody thinking Im domestic
Uh grown mine I need to chrome mine
Yall go lease I need to own mine
I stay so fresh I need my own line
So if money involved I need a hundred for mine
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes


I know the pros and the cons to the smoking dons
See Im laid in the shade to the Boca Raton
And people wanna beat me with they open arms
But could it be my Rolls or my frozen arm
Im like whoa man mind I remember I fear no man
Put chicks on the floor like a slow jam
With God on my side I fear no man Im deprogrammed
Its like I dont really care what another man think
Love to spend many so I understand
Money in the bank so I understand
Excuse me miss youre standin on my mink
My rock so big it jams up the sink
You cant call me sissy cause my whole hand pink
Enough ice in this to make a man blink
You think I care about what he think
Here we go
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
Now you be the middle man Imma be the money man
This flow right here I know you dont understand
Power to get wealth part of the covenant
Im not your man dont front me about my government
Yall do it yall way Imma do it Yahweh
Forget the house I put a million on the driveway
Clothes every spendin winnin dressed up in funny linen
Grinnin while I spendin givin to men and women
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And we gonna get some lunch
And oh we back we cool we friends again
And you aint seen me in sixty months
I know how you stunt Im hard to distort
You know my face so its hard to resort
Garage lookin like a rob report
House one hole away from a golf resort
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
In my life money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when its movin slow
I aint afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes
