Yeah YEAH
Cmon
Man I just do what the doers do
Cmon yeah you heard the man
I just do what the doers do
Now I been makin hits since underage
Contract intact cant be under paid
This aint a game I aint fun to play
Dont front for me I aint from the A
Dont you wanna hear what I come to say
This just a kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
Im in another island in a bungalow
Evisu down to my underclose
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give and get it back in a hundred fo
I feel like a man that was from the road
And yall know that I will bring you out
And what Im talkin you dont know a thing about
Bring Modenas out
Take a scenic route
Bettin against me its bound to clean you out
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Droptop cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia
Its hard to get low
In a 360 Spider
License plates all the chicks know
Cats walk aroud buffed up like beach guys
But they dont put no fear in these eyes
Besides Im just here to teach lives
Girl walk around try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I roll up the tint top up and rode away
I smell like money let the odor stay
Go in my closet fur to throw away
Im never lost I already know the way
If I need it for tonight Ill get it for today
Im Godmade I took five years parlay
Home pool arcade and its all paid
What say I spend a third on a upgrade
Import palm trees cuz I aint have enough shade
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Droptop cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia
And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh dont you be afraid cuz Im your alliby
So when Im drivin by
Dont try to analyse
And beacause of him Imma still be fly
And this our lullaby
Cmon now you know my flow
Im in and out
Non guilty I aint gotta buy the trout
Couple of critics but I aint gon stop now
I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
Im on jets they doin sky miles
So I see why the people so hostile
Its no drama its mo honor
Im wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exageration
Why these people so mad at Mason
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Droptop cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia
Repeat 2X 
Take that take that
Take that take that
Repeat until fade
