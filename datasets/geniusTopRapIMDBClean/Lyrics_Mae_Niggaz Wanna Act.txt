Yo check this out right
Harlem on da rise
And you dont want no problem with us guys uh
MAdollar signE
And if you ever out tryin to find me
I think I should warn you
I get hard when I want to
Angelettie Bad Boy niggas aint ready
Yo you the type of cat in the building holdin the cracks
Playin son to the niggas on the corner holdin the gatts
Nigga come through a nigga kill never blow back
You the nigga never did but send in all the facts
Yo I know niggas like you cuz I meet em all the time
And I greet em with the 9 if they ever keep whats mine
If I lose I get loc put a fool in the yoke
Two to his throat take his jewels and his coat
More than likely you aint got to like me
And this might be the last time I take you nicely
For my legion fill up the season and start squeezin
Niggas talkin shit be behind the cars weavin
Theres no breathin aint nobody in here leavin
You kill my man I kill your bitch now we even
Im from a cold world where its bleeding twenty degrees in
Fahrenheit niggas get sniped for no reason
Do a lot of work got plenty funds and many guns
Many sons niggas do anything to anyone
And on the streets I dont doubt nuttin
So when you talk to Mase better watch yo mouth son
Yo if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap we could scrap
You niggas got gatts we got gatts
You niggas wanna style we style
If you get foul we get foul you get wild we get wild
If niggas wanna act we can act
If niggas wanna scrap we could scrap
You niggas got gatts we got gats
You niggas wanna style we style
If you get foul we get foul you get wild we get wild
Yo started with a blue whip blue whip
Got a silver new whip cuz feds watch when I do shit
Keep poppin up new shit new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We crisp bub sippers strip club niggas
Peace to the street team yall get love nigga
Six years ago I was the havenot nigga
Hot nigga represent for all my block niggas
Now Im 6 drop niggas baguette rock niggas
10 Gs a show and I aint even drop niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase you get your wig rocked nigga
Players like mell leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop nigga
Hustle is a hustle so I never knock a nigga
Dont really fuck with Dame but still I copped Jigga


Yo if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap we could scrap
You niggas got gatts we got gatts
You niggas wanna style we style
If you get foul we get foul you get wild we get wild
If niggas wanna act we can act
If niggas wanna scrap we could scrap
You niggas got gatts we got gats
You niggas wanna style we style
If you get foul we get foul you get wild we get wild
Yo I do this everyday why brag about the glory
Tell you the whole truth never half the story
You wasnt no hater youd probably be happy for me
Billboard first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me they dont love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie
Over Iceberg Rugby pushin a Benz buggy
For a better batch roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean um think its smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke the niggas aint cheap they broke
Oh yeah this my dough year
Jealousy and envyll get you nowhere
You dont like me bet against me
You right got dough do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight how many link loosen my ice
And for I scoop the dice bet a grand I beat the deuce twice
Niggas who dont make dough I cant affiliate with em
Im dyin from a sickness known as Willieism
Busta Ad Libs around Chorus while
Um yo whatever you want
We can do
We can do it better
And you niggas wanna scrap We can scrap
Niggas wanna wild We wild
However niggas like it you get it
