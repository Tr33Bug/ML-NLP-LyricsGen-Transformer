Niggaz Wanna Act Lyrics
Yo, check this out right
Harlem on da rise
And you don't want no problem with us guys, uh
M-A-dollar sign-E
And if you ever out tryin' to find me
I think I should warn you
I get hard when I want to
Angelettie, Bad Boy, niggas ain't ready

Yo, you the type of cat in the building holdin' the cracks
Playin' son to the niggas on the corner holdin' the gatts
Nigga come through, a nigga kill, never blow back
You the nigga never did but send in all the facts
Yo, I know niggas like you cuz I meet 'em all the time
And I greet 'em with the 9 if they ever keep what's mine
If I lose I get loc, put a fool in the yoke
Two to his throat, take his jewels and his coat
More than likely, you ain't got to like me
And this might be the last time I take you nicely
For my legion, fill up the season and start squeezin'
Niggas talkin' shit be behind the cars weavin'
There's no breathin', ain't nobody in here leavin'
You kill my man, I kill your bitch, now we even
I'm from a cold world, where it's bleeding twenty degrees in
Fahrenheit, niggas get sniped for no reason
Do a lot of work, got plenty funds and many guns
Many sons, niggas do anything to anyone
And on the streets I don't doubt nuttin'
So when you talk to Mase better watch yo mouth son
Yo, if niggas wanna act, we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild
If niggas wanna act, we can act
If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild

Yo, started with a blue whip, blue whip
Got a silver new whip cuz feds watch when I do shit
Keep poppin' up new shit, new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We crisp bub sippers, strip club niggas
Peace to the street team, y'all get love, nigga
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga
Hot nigga, represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggas, baguette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop, niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase, you get your wig rocked, nigga
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop, nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Dame, but still I copped Jigga
You might also like
Yo, if niggas wanna act, we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild
If niggas wanna act, we can act
If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul, you get wild, we get wild

Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie
Over Iceberg Rugby, pushin' a Benz buggy
For a better batch, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me, bet against me
You right, got dough, do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight, how many link, loosen my ice
And 'for I scoop the dice, bet a grand I beat the deuce twice
Niggas who don't make dough, I can't affiliate with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism
Busta Ad Libs around Chorus while:

Um, yo, whatever you want
We can do
We can do it better
And you niggas wanna scrap? We can scrap
Niggas wanna wild? We wild
However niggas like it, you get it
Harlem World
Bad Boy
It's '97, yeah, Harlem on the rise
And you don't really want no problem wit us guys
Uh, got my man Cardan with me
KFC, D-R-E, Blinkey blink
Cooda Love, Utto, uh
Black Fred
Big
Puff Diddy
You know we got bitches
Lox, Black Rob, the whole committee
You don't stop, we won't stopEmbed
