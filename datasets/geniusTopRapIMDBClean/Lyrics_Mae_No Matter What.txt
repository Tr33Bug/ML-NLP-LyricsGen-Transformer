No Matter What Lyrics
 Yeah, here we go
 Uh Uh
Let's party again, let's party again
Let's party again, let's party again
 Can't be stopped (Uh huh)
Won't be stopped
 Let's dance again, let's dance again
Let's dance again
 Don't know how to stop
 Let's dance again
 Refuse to stop , All Out, Bad Boy, come on
Yo, everyday I wake up, sick of the homeless
But other than that I'm a Bentley consumer
I get pain, yo' I cry like you
I get sick, I could die like you
I used to hate my broke days with a passion
Now when I get big money I stash some
See a watch I like, I just grab one
Party and bullshit, book trips have fun (Come on)
Get paid, get money, get dough (That's right)
Get laid, get honeys, get low (Get low)
Platinum status what I live for
Sold four million now I want six more
Never satisfied just like my mom
With 10 mill' sitting' in the treasury bond
When I roll dice just respect my arm
You can't put me on the level
Cause I'm level beyond

It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say
It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say
You might also like
I be M.I.A and M.I.A.M.I
So am I the kid who be so appealing
Live a lifestyle so revealing
Love them M&M's, the multi millions
So y'all could spit it out, me I live it out
Y'all cats lay away a month then get it out
I'm the first cat in the club all izzy-ed out
Rock iceburg when you thought it was Mickey Mouse
So sit me, I'm pourin' Cris to the curb
All I got to do is just give a chick a word
Her whole team, you will see a chick with a bird
Messing with Mase you'll get what you deserve (That's right)
A buck 50, nah, take a buck 60
Extra 10 good for thinking they can mess with me (Uh)

It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say
It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say
Yo, you the type in the movies cuddled up
With a groupie hang by, buttered up
I ain't getting with you, yo' love her in her gut
That's the reason why you can't even bubble up (Come on)
You get your team and huddle up
And come back with enough cream to Double Up
Until then I'mma still be here cooking
Anything I'm pushing, 20 G's a cushion (Uh)
Why prove this kid is the smoothest
When there's people that pay me to do this
Pretty color cars is what we cravin'
Six star tele's is what we stayed in (That's right)
Any man with me must be made men
We just buy cars, we don't trade in (Nuh uh)
I don't need ten statements see what I'm saving
No need for a manager I need an agent (Let's go)
 x3
It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say
It don't matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
You'll still have something to say

(Come on, come on, come on)

Mase Murda can't be stopped
