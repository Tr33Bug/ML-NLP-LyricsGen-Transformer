Lets party again lets party again
Cant be stopped  Uh huh 
Wont be stopped
Lets dance again lets dance again
Lets dance again
Dont know how to stop
Lets dance again
Refuse to stop  All Out Bad Boy come on
Yo everyday I wake up sick of the homeless
But other than that Im a Bentley consumer
I get pain yo I cry like you
I get sick I could die like you
I used to hate my broke days with a passion
Now when I get big money I stash some
See a watch I like I just grab one
Party and bullshit book trips have fun  Come on 
Get paid get money get dough  Thats right 
Get laid get honeys get low  Get low 
Platinum status what I live for
Sold four million now I want six more
Never satisfied just like my mom
With 10 mill sitting in the treasury bond
When I roll dice just respect my arm
You cant put me on the level
Cause Im level beyond
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
I be MIA and MIAMI
So am I the kid who be so appealing
Live a lifestyle so revealing
Love them MMs the multi millions
So yall could spit it out me I live it out
Yall cats lay away a month then get it out
Im the first cat in the club all izzyed out
Rock iceburg when you thought it was Mickey Mouse
So sit me Im pourin Cris to the curb
All I got to do is just give a chick a word
Her whole team you will see a chick with a bird
Messing with Mase youll get what you deserve  Thats right 
A buck 50 nah take a buck 60
Extra 10 good for thinking they can mess with me  Uh 
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
Yo you the type in the movies cuddled up
With a groupie hang by buttered up
I aint getting with you yo love her in her gut
Thats the reason why you cant even bubble up  Come on 
You get your team and huddle up
And come back with enough cream to Double Up
Until then Imma still be here cooking
Anything Im pushing 20 Gs a cushion  Uh 
Why prove this kid is the smoothest
When theres people that pay me to do this
Pretty color cars is what we cravin
Six star teles is what we stayed in  Thats right 
Any man with me must be made men
We just buy cars we dont trade in  Nuh uh 
I dont need ten statements see what Im saving
No need for a manager I need an agent  Lets go 
x3
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
It dont matter what you do to me
I can handle what you send my way
No matter what I do today
Youll still have something to say
Come on come on come on
