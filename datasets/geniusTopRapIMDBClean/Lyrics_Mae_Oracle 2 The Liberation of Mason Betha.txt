We aint gang we aint goals we aint family we aint foes and we definitely not bros we aint nothin nigga
And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul we aint nothin nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga

Im an unapologist knew women like Solomon
I can burn bridge walk water like the prophets did
I can read niggas futures like astrologists
Why Im so clean Im next thing to Godliness
Niggas try to starve my kids and give my money to his first born
Im not the nigga posed to work for em
You pose the teach culture P about your legacy
And said that niggas follow you you teaching treachery
And now you say you check for me without a check for me
Now what you talkin bout this murder niggas double jeopardy
Niggas sayin let it go you buggin nigga I cant let it be
Tell niggas dont call for me I can only talk for me
I know what my budget read I read the budget every week
Im on the way I talk but its a way out for me
Then they try to dangle money they didnt think Ill ever leave
Niggas never pay the artist but they love to pay the freaks
We aint gang we aint goals we aint family we aint foes and we definitely not bros we aint nothin nigga
And we definitely not goals and we definitely not vows
You can feel it in your soul we aint nothin nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga  no 
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga nah
We aint nothing nigga
He that is from above is above them all above them all
Yeah I show up when thunder fall I aint runnin from yall cause I come for it all
Now I fire on Goliath and watch him fall
Didnt want to kill the short first cause I come for the tall
And when your main artist died who the hell did you call
I bring smoke with water on Im used to the fog
And I empty pipes when clips get clogged
And go to church on Sundays Im the illest of all
Dont ever put Mase with other Bad Boys who had hardship
You know I get it jumping like a mosh pit nigga
Im the first level dirt level yall can never hurt level
Niggas mad I made it to the I will never work level
Since Cain killed Abel Im able to kill Cain
And Love dont steal my nigga change your name
And I see no integrity in you name
And Im haunted by the voice of St James
Champagne came matched my Rollie plain jane
And I say blame God I aint changed
And if niggas never found the killer why is nigga livin here
Everybody Brooklyn niggas gotta play a vision here
And niggas be selling their soul to go to a brunch
And niggas might end up sweet drinking that punch
I suffer good and niggas know Im from another hood
So keep your brotherhood Im tryna make sure that my mother good
I ask sheep but Im really goat to the goats
No matter with Top 5 Im the nigga quoted the most
Im the ghost of Wolf ghost of Rezar
I come with the facts you never consider Im a ghost of Shyne
I speak for every artist never spoke their mind
Representing every artist that was left behind
From Craig Mack to GDep
I still remember them kids trample
For every producer you every stole they sample
Why you playing with me Knowin I make examples
Niggas hide behind money you know thats not a man move
You know youre Frank and Im Tony
You know that itll get lonely its never safe when you owe me
You know the sayin true
You has a chance to do right I dont understand you
You cant stop a nigga came from Wick and Cam fool
But Karma came in getting hold of movers
You flow for the man causin Georgia may show his wrist and piss water
He could have made it right that nigga couldve saved his life
Now there aint now way to fight now he out there waving white
Ay know your strategy
Now what you have is being right now I got a mole in your faculty
So when you get the nerve to come after me what audacity
Gotta know the dollar sign wasnt rappin free
Actually after BIG died what a travesty
Cause when Mase left nigga wouldnt nobody after me
I guess I got the last laugh niggas aint laughing huh
Niggas stay strapping up Im ready for a massacre
Cam blackballed Mase the ball aint black enough
Tupac for us nigga I aint even mad at ya
Pretty nigga always make they hearts melt yeah
Guess you can say I know how Pac felt yeah
Im just a Harlem nigga reppin down a Vegas strip with my own Suge
You from Mount Vernon go and rep your own hood
Im not hating on your billi worth
Right now Im only saying what you really worth
You aint no architect
You just a nigga who know how to market death
Go pay his momma what hes really worth nigga
We aint gang we aint goals we aint family we aint foes and we definitely not bros we aint nothin nigga
And we definetly not goals and we definetly not vows
You can feel it in your soul we aint nothin nigga
We aint nothing nigga we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga
We aint nothing nigga no we aint nothing nigga nah
We aint nothing nigga
And if you dont know now you know nigga
