Uh yeah yeah
Shit is crazy yo
I feel you though nigga 
Who woulda ever thought same niggas
Itd be them same niggas
You are the same nigga though 
Same nigga that couldnt get the deal
Now Im the hottest nigga wit a deal
You aint changed a bit 
Yo niggas never got nothin good to say quick to blame
Fore you judge me feel my pain
You know it aint a vest in the world that could shield my reign
You aint got money for the gas bitch get out the range
Got welcomed to the game wit like 4 mil and change
Niggas feelin like I changed but Im feelin the same
So who cares if they beg to differ
When all them niggas that beg to differ
Is cokeheads and sniffers
Take me for example least I made it
You think niggas in the hood should appreciate it
By time its happy birthday its gon be belated
When you me everything you do get exaggerated
You miss a nigga pound they gon say you flipped out
Take a piss in the street they say you pulled your dick out
As a youth its just a lot of shit I wanna live out
Got a lot of friends but only had a few when I was without
Same niggas I was starvin couldnt get a crumb from
Sometimes I think where all these motherfuckers come from
I needed money for school couldnt get no ones from
Got jumped in the park and couldnt get the guns from
Instead of rollin wit a clique roll wit my sis
Hell no these motherfuckers cant hold my stick
You think I care if they get mad I dont owe them shit
Wanna hold sumthin hold my dick nigga


We might be from a different hood
But we the same niggas
Thats just the way it is 
Dont be thinkin shit all good
It be them same niggas
Same niggas get caught blame niggas
Same niggas go to court and name niggas
Some things will never change 
It be them same niggas
Man regardless how you feel
Its the way it is 
It be the same motherfuckers thatll get you killed
Them same niggas them same niggas them same niggas
Them same niggas
Thats why I dont fuck wit niggas
I got a brotha named Ant right Glad to be home
Been through a lot of shit so Im glad to be grown
But yo where were these freaks when I had no jeeps
Livin on 34th street and we aint have no heat
Cross from PS 92 7th and 8th
Asked you for dough and you said No dead in my face
But now that Im on its like I owe everybody somethin
All my niggas dead so everybody frontin
Same kids went to Catholic school is dealers
And same niggas had no heart is now killers
Sometimes I reminisce on what I said in the mist
But even when I dream it wasnt better than this
But actually the niggas who would scrap for me
Or go as far as getting guns and clap for me
Aint even here to get a platinum plaque for me
I talk to them but they dont talk back to me
I aint know you that long so aint much I can ask of you
And when I reminisce I cant take it back wit you
I cant ask Yo what happen to my nigga Black or Q
So I dont really need to rap wit you ya know
We might be from a different hood
But we the same niggas
Thats just the way it is 
Dont be thinkin shit all good
It be them same niggas
Same niggas get caught blame niggas
Same niggas go to court and name niggas
Some things will never change 
It be them same niggas
Man regardless how you feel
Its the way it is 
It be the same motherfuckers thatll get you killed
Them same niggas them same niggas them same niggas
Them same niggas
Thats why I dont fuck wit niggas
Yo I figured if we All Out its all right
As long as when we all brawl we all fight
Im under niggas hoses like roses
Here I am M A dollasign E nigga fear no man
Nigga hit me in the mouth and we bound to fight
Just call my bluff and it be on tonight
I got words of a madman tattooed on my arm
Aint fuckin wit my sister cuz Im mad at my mom
Blink sayin That aint you wit a gat in your palm
But Blink its either that or be harmed
So the doctor give me pills for the wound stitch my flesh
Give a nigga last wish so he could pick his death
So my sister wanna rap and I wish her the best
But I would never wanna wish her my stress
Cause its like when I hurt yall laugh
They put me on every forecast sayin that I bought ass
So I drink a tall glass before I spaz
Then I take it like a man and let it all pass
I wanted big bucks no whammys understand me
I show niggas love and niggas underhand me
Then they wonder why I want no family
What I need a hooker for gettin head from
And I fear when New Years come cuz it might be the year
A good nigga die cuz when you good life aint fair
Like you call on the saints but the saints dont hear
You could cry to the Lord its like Christ dont hear
So instead of hood winking I give you the plain facts
If I never change how Im gon change back explain that
They sayin Mase aint the same cat
But every time you get robbed I get ya chain back
Them same niggas
Them same niggas
Them same niggas
Them same niggas
Thats why I dont fuck wit niggas
Its crazy like that you know what Im saying
Youll be tellin a nigga you got a deal
He think that that shit come with Rollies
And they come wit Benzs
Come with Bentleys and houses and shit
They dont need no one to work a nigga quitin
We might be from a different hood
But we the same niggas
Thats just the way it is 
Dont be thinkin shit all good
It be them same niggas
Same niggas get caught blame niggas
Same niggas go to court and name niggas
Some things will never change 
It be them same niggas
Man regardless how you feel
Its the way it is 
It be the same motherfuckers thatll get you killed
Them same niggas them same niggas them same niggas
Them same niggas
Thats why I dont fuck wit niggas
