Hey yo dogs for real
Im yo man but you got the address up
Cuz now you got chicks talk What the fuck
What the fuck what the fuck
You know somebody swung on me  cut me
Come on come on come on 
You know somebody pulled a gun on me or robbed me
Come on come on come on 
Is they stoppin my money  Hell no 
Come on come on come on 
Then it aint no problem here
Come on come on come on 
Cmon I aint wit that man
Yeah what what 
Just throw my B back on
Yo yo yo
You know my mission aint complete
Till I hit the city with a 600 Jeep
Hardest nigga from All Out you wanna meet
Hash in the dash with heat under the seat
Chased Kate 52 states straight
But still aint nothin sweet
I took a year off to let the young niggas eat
Everybody wit me want bucks
Walk around platinum linked up
With money like Brink trucks
Shit get too hot Puff put the minks up
Come back in the summertime like fuck it its summertime
All Out tattoos over wife beaters
Get mail Branson never buy reefer
Bentley five seater its all for real
First rapper to close down a mall with a mil
The clothes the hoes the cars that flaunt
Plus the money so Im on nigga one
Talk to me
If you dont fuck with me
Like I dont fuck with you
It aint much for us to talk about
Cuz you dont fuck with me  Yo yo yo yo 
And you know I dont fuck with you
So all I can say  uh uh 
Is stay out my way


Dont take much to wake up taped up
Fuck the district I live in Jacob
Hit a nigga bitch nigga kiss and made up
See me without Puff try to get your weight up uh
Aint nuttin between you and me
And on the real nuttin you could do wit me
I got cash thatll fund your leave
Youll pull that hoodie over your head
And put five in your Ceasar
Doubt me now and die a believer
Run and catch bullets like a wide receiver
When the wars on put your gloves and your Gores on
Teflon hard hat nigga put it all on
Beef no more thats what other niggas for
I got a fam that love to go to war
Love to get locked up love pickin the odds up
Love not comin home love to be boxed up
Im from a town where kids could pop up
Little punks in garbage bags body all chopped up
Ill come and run your block knowin you got popped up
Arms are rocked up Bentley wit the top up
Uh you dont stop come on
If you dont fuck with me
Like I dont fuck with you
It aint much for us to talk about
Cuz you dont fuck with me
And you know I dont fuck with you
So all I can say
Is stay out my way
Repeat 1 while
What what what
Yeah yeah yeah what what what
You dont like me nigga  What the fuck 
You wanna fight me nigga  Huh huh 
Stop frontin nigga  You frontin nigga 
Uh
Yo one two three four
Everybody on the floor
You see grams Imma see craters
By the time you see land Imma see acres
Drop another CD just to see paper
And before you see me youll see the maker
All I see is more chances more advances
More houses no spouses more beaches
Wild thugs around me and no leechin
When they guns out playa therell be no reachin
Ballin in Dirty South wit no creases
And all I see is more Fin iced out Jesus pieces
The rock over Sean John fleeces
You never love the money like we love it
Pay the chick sucka and let her teeth touch it
All Out
Bad Boy forever
The Movement
What
X2
If you dont fuck with me
Like I dont fuck with you
It aint much for us to talk about
Cuz you dont fuck with me
And you know I dont fuck with you
So all I can say
Is stay out my way
