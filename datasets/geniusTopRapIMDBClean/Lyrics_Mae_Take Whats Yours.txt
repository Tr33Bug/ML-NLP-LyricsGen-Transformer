Yo I be that young fly fellow got thorough
Die over dinero hit everything in the Triboro
And Im the newest member of the Bad Boy team
And Imma bring this nigga Puff mad more CREAM
With hooks galore leave this city shook for short
And Imma take em back where Biggie took em before
You stay a playa since you cant stay up with the Pope
And stick to what you do best stick to wearin coke
You lookin for excuses ways to say youre broke
Cant keep a whip cause you cant pay the note
Fuck the side Im waiting for you on top Mercedes drop
Black 380s cops till the day I get knocked
All I ask when I die dress me fly and neatly
And brush my waves so Im handsome when the bitches greet me
Word from the wise niggas jerk pies we hurt them guys
Bust lead to skin they head and leave them circumcised
So how you wanna settle this rappin or on some ghetto shit
We can do it yo way with mics or with metal shit
Niggas wanna shout Ima make noise
Niggas run they mouth Ima break jaws
Mase is comin out we gon take yours
Harlem World uptown baby we make wars
Niggas wanna shout Ima make noise
Niggas run they mouth Ima break jaws
Mase is comin out we gon take yours
Harlem World uptown baby we make wars
Yo yo before its all over lot of blood gon be spilled
We aint discriminatin even thugs gon be killed
We early inheritors  born into CREAM
If a nigga get sheist then we form as a team
Bullshit if you want and it be on for this CREAM
The weatherman dont even know the storm Ima bring
But yo Im not the man with whom you interact
So before you grab gatts to jack remember that
You take dough from Mase you might as well send it back
I got thugs everywhere where you gonna spend it at
When clicks come to brawl everything I hit fall
Niggas play sick wit yall wit me they aint sick at all
No matter how big or small I get rid of yall
And shit I spit at yall come in one size fit all
Niggas wanna shout Imma make noise
Niggas run they mouth Imma break jaws
Mase is comin out we gon take yours
Harlem World uptown baby we make wars
Niggas wanna shout Imma make noise
Niggas run they mouth Imma break jaws
Mase is comin out we gon take yours
Harlem World uptown baby we make wars
Yo if you think Im on some sweet shit then wont you creep quick
I let the heat spit make a nigga G flick
Classic criminal keep a gatt by my genitals
Thugs love me so dont get splashed for the minimal
We never vest up be in a double breast tux
Plus keep a fresh cut picture me getting left stuck
I let one loose to show you I aint the one do
And I aint puffin nothin nigga all my guns shoot
You let your gun loose none of them niggas gunproof
Watch them niggas drop when I pop one in they sunroof
And we be lead bustin leavin niggas head gushin
You niggas talkin bout guns like you sayin something
Ill be lacin em hollow tips I be wastin em
Thats what you faggots get tryin to fuck with Mase and em
Bad Boy 97 front therell be none of that
And all you cats running your trap one in your cap
Niggas wanna shout Imma make noise
Niggas run they mouth Imma break jaws
Mase is comin out we gon take yours
Harlem World Uptown baby we make wars
Repeat until fade
