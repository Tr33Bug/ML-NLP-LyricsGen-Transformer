HeyI love you
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
The love you need is already here  Put it in cruise control 
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
I know you better than you know yourself
And I hold you higher than I hold myself
And what I told you it was just to make you wealth
I try to mold you but you keep goin for self
Uh I had you on such a high pedastal
Did things for you I said Id never do
Gave you my hancock it wasnt legible
And the love we had it was incredible
But you know I had to move on I guess
Somethin was going on people was in my lawn
Talkin on the phone tellin me I did you wrong
And that was just not the norm
I see now everything you said did you really mean
Cause everything I said I still mean now
You can make a frown and all the cryin sounds
But this is how its goin down Im tellin you now
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there  What 
The love you need is already here  Why you keep foolin with him then 
The love you need is already there  Man I can say whatever I want Im a grown man 
When you need it Im gon be there  You gon end up back wit me anyway 
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is somethin you could have for years
Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is somethin you could have for years
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
Aint it funny how honeys now
Tryin to find love in the club
Good girl wit a thug and its makin me bug
They the ones who wanna lose they life
And be wit somebody thatll do them right
Put yellow in they ear put pink in they wrist
No worldly man would ever think of this
When Im gone youll make a wish
Youll dream all the days you could think of this
I only wanted to make sure that you had everything I got
Make sure that you had everything thats hot
Since I got it all you could even have
Mansion wit a lab put somethin in your bag
Dont let me be the one to hold you up
But go tell him its over now the time is up
Now you know I got a message to the world
I aint here to mess wit your girl you can relax
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there  I tell you what love dont act like that 
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
Im tellin you now love dont act like that 
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it Im gon be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
