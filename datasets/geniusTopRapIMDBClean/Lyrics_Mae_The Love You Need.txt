The Love You Need Lyrics
Hey, what's up?
Yo I been tryin to call you all day man where you been?
Now it ain't like that he been wit me all day I been tryin to call you
Word, umm, really?
Yeah, I got the flowers you sent me to my job, that was beautiful
You like that?
Yeah
Umm, cool, cool so umm
How was your day?
I mean it was kinda hard at the office today but I got by though
Hey, ok, lets go but I gotta go he comin upstairs
Oh word, oh alright ok cool
Hey...I love you
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
The love you need is already here (Put it in cruise control)
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places

I know you, better than you know yourself
And I hold you, higher than I hold myself
And what I told you, it was just to make you wealth
I try to mold you, but you keep goin for self
Uh, I had you on such a high pedastal
Did things for you, I said I'd never do
Gave you my hancock, it wasn't legible
And, the love we had, it was incredible
But, you know I had to move on I guess
Somethin was going on, people was in my lawn
Talkin on the phone tellin me I did you wrong
And that was just not the norm
I see now everything you said, did you really mean?
Cause everything I said I still mean now
You can make a frown and all the cryin sounds
But this is how its goin down, I'm tellin you now
You might also like
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there (What?)
The love you need is already here (Why you keep foolin with him then?)
The love you need is already there (Man I can say whatever I want I'm a grown man)
When you need it, I'm gon' be there (You gon end up back wit me anyway)
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places

Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is somethin you could have for years
Tell me what you want from me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is somethin you could have for years

The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
Ain't it funny how honeys now
Tryin to find love in the club
Good girl wit a thug and its makin me bug
They the ones who wanna lose they life
And be wit somebody that'll do them right
Put yellow in they ear, put pink in they wrist
No worldly man would ever think of this
When I'm gone you'll make a wish
You'll dream all the days you could think of this
I only wanted to make sure that you had everything I got
Make sure that you had everything thats hot
Since I got it all you could even have
Mansion wit a lab put somethin in your bag
Don't let me, be the one to hold you up
But go tell him, it's over now the time is up
Now you know I got a message to the world
I ain't here to mess wit your girl you can relax

The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there (I tell you what, love don't act like that)
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong places
(I'm tellin you now love don't act like that)
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
The love you need is already here
The love you need is already there
When you need it, I'm gon' be there
Why you wanna look for love in all the wrong placesEmbed
