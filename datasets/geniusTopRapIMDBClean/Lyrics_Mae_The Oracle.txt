Imagine 20 years with a bitter bitch and the same drama
Dame told you do this shit and you dont see Dame karma
K9 on your ass nigga no distraction
Pussy nigga wearin pink I guess he think he matchin
Ima paint the picture let the niggas make the caption
Fuck bars Im tell nigga what really happened
You hear this tone you know the mac is in my seat
You see exactly what I see you know my rap is not for free
You sent them pussy niggas to the hill to trap me in the V
You singing nigga aint gonna be no back up bitch with me
I chew that nigga til my teeth hurt dont even hit the weed first
Bitches used to say Im blessed and I didnt even sneeze first
Much dirt as I got on you dont even need no research
My hand filthy heart guilty niggas like me need church
Tax know you as the nigga that snitched on the Roc
DC crips only know you the nigga they shot
OG niggas dont have no history with you on the block
And everybody seen the footage I got
Every since 10 you was a thirsty nigga
I aint gone talk about the time you fucked your sister
In 2002 you lost 50 pounds ulcers in your liver
And now you tryna sell niggas liquor nigga
You always play the sucker part
Where was all that Rico shit when you left Jim in Rucker Park
Matter fact Im on a true life change
But lets get back to that smack and that Tru Life chain
Damn bro
Damn the whole fuckin land know
After that 50 shit you moved to Orlando
You had the nigga Jim on the radio where did Cam go
We all understand though
You not really built for this shit
You not ready to kill for this shit
But no regrets
You gotta lift up a TEC to get Murder respect
Nigga are UN you dipped on the set
Im the fuckin cough in the slime flu
You gone out rhyme who Im your prime times 2
I never paid for my mistakes cause thats not what crime do
Bitches fuck me but thats what dimes do
Somebody wanna jump in tell em come share
Im starting to feel like we dont really compare
Im pretty nigga wrist litty sun wear
Diplomat only mean that you aint from here
You had a run here but yall niggas is done here
All these pretty women and yall niggas bringin guns here
You way past the gun line
Every time you talk of me you sound like one time
I fuck the King of rap bitch when I was unsign
And made the nigga Diddy sign me off of one line
Dont blame for the past and I wont blame you for the crash
Sent my nigga Huddy on a dummy mission and he crashed
Gilet I know you need money I get it
I know your digital sales I know about your digits
I know Sony Red didnt wanna your shit distribute
I know its crickets so fuck it use my name so they can click it
I made you I raised you why would I play you
When you dealing with this power nigga Flex cant save you
Me amorin drive the foreign kick the door in
Lady treat me like him important
I dont even think of scoring
I just run the floor and D could alleyoop it to me like in Boston
On some Kyrie shit yall just talking
Heard that often
Had to rap again yall was boring em
Now you can tell Dave East AAP Mob whatever you want
The whole hood know Im the origin
You robbed Juelz on some Diddy shit
And when Jim start ballin you get back on sissy shit
You even had the nerve to call up Sham
And use his basketball skill to steal the name Jelly Fam
Damn Cam I thought more of you
But when I think about it thats really all you do
You really not that fly
You really not that guy
You really not that wise
Im really not surprised
All pride aside you try to pay Lodi moms to side with your lies
Now Im like fuck it Drago if he dies he dies
Aint no unity
Aint no Children of the Corn
Aint no you and me
Any nigga ever got Diplomat Immunity
Was niggas who ratted or ones who snitched on their community
And thats word to my nigga Big L
To my nigga fucking Trell and to that nigga Bigavel
To nigga Loon on all my niggas in the cell
Hope you hold ya head I hope yall niggas doing well
This Mae nigga I invented the curve
Im the name on the ribbon on the bird
Im done rapping with you
Youll always be my bitch you got my fucking name tatted on you
