The Oracle Lyrics
Imagine 20 years with a bitter bitch and the same drama
Dame told you do this shit and you don’t see Dame karma
K9 on your ass, nigga no distraction
Pussy nigga wearin' pink I guess he think he matchin'
I’ma paint the picture, let the niggas make the caption
Fuck bars I’m tell nigga what really happened
You hear this tone, you know the mac is in my seat
You see exactly what I see you know my rap is not for free
You sent them pussy niggas to the hill to trap me in the V
You singing nigga, ain't gonna be no back up bitch with me
I chew that nigga til’ my teeth hurt don’t even hit the weed first
Bitches used to say I’m blessed and I didn’t even sneeze first
Much dirt as I got on you, don’t even need no research
My hand filthy, heart guilty, niggas like me need church
Tax know you as the nigga that snitched on the Roc
D.C. crips only know you the nigga they shot
OG niggas don’t have no history with you on the block
And everybody seen the footage I got
Every since 10 you was a thirsty nigga
I ain't gone talk about the time you fucked your sister
In 2002 you lost 50 pounds, ulcers in your liver
And now you tryna sell niggas liquor, nigga
You always play the sucker part
Where was all that Rico shit when you left Jim in Rucker Park?
Matter fact I’m on a true life change
But let's get back to that smack and that Tru Life chain
Damn bro
Damn the whole fuckin' land know
After that 50 shit you moved to Orlando
You had the nigga Jim on the radio, where did Cam go?
We all understand though
You not really built for this shit
You not ready to kill for this shit
But no regrets
You gotta lift up a TEC to get Murder respect
Nigga are U-N, you dipped on the set
I’m the fuckin cough in the slime flu
You gone out rhyme who? I’m your prime times 2
I never paid for my mistakes cause that’s not what crime do
Bitches fuck me but that's what dimes do
Somebody wanna jump in tell 'em come share
I’m starting to feel like we don’t really compare
I'm pretty nigga, wrist litty, sun wear
Diplomat only mean that you ain’t from here
You had a run here but y’all niggas is done here
All these pretty women and y’all niggas bringin' guns here
You way past the gun line
Every time you talk of me you sound like one time
I fuck the King of rap bitch when I was unsign
And made the nigga Diddy sign me off of one line
Don’t blame for the past and I won’t blame you for the crash
Sent my nigga Huddy on a dummy mission and he crashed
Gilet I know you need money I get it
I know your digital sales I know about your digits
I know Sony Red didn’t wanna your shit distribute
I know it's crickets so fuck it use my name so they can click it
I made you, I raised you, why would I play you?
When you dealing with this power, nigga Flex can’t save you
Me amorin, drive the foreign, kick the door in
Lady treat me like him important
I don’t even think of scoring
I just run the floor and D could alleyoop it to me like in Boston
On some Kyrie shit, y’all just talking
Heard that often
Had to rap again, y’all was boring 'em
Now you can tell Dave East, A$AP Mob, whatever you want
The whole hood know I’m the origin
You robbed Juelz on some Diddy shit
And when Jim start ballin' you get back on sissy shit
You even had the nerve to call up Sham
And use his basketball skill to steal the name Jelly Fam
Damn, Cam, I thought more of you
But when I think about it, that's really all you do
You really not that fly
You really not that guy
You really not that wise
I'm really not surprised
All pride aside you try to pay Lodi mom’s to side with your lies
Now I'm like fuck it Drago “if he dies he dies”
Ain’t no unity
Ain’t no Children of the Corn
Ain’t no you and me
Any nigga ever got Diplomat Immunity
Was niggas who ratted or ones who snitched on their community
And thats word to my nigga Big L
To my nigga fucking Trell and to that nigga Bigavel
To nigga Loon on all my niggas in the cell
Hope you hold ya head, I hope y’all niggas doing well
This Ma$e nigga, I invented the curve
I’m the name on the ribbon on the bird
I’m done rapping with you
You’ll always be my bitch you got my fucking name tatted on youYou might also like7Embed
