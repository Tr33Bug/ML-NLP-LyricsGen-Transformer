The Player Way Lyrics
No one expected the unexpected (uh uh)
Know what I'm saying?
Something real, something you could feel (that's right)
Straight from the Suave House (Bad Boy)
Representing (no doubt)
Put a little soul in here
And we don't stop

No one has to ask who be actin' bad
Eightball and MJ pimpin' G be all up in that ass
From Memphis Tenn, around the world and than back again
Make non-rappin' weak MC's go home practicing
I flip a Benz with Lorenzen and plenty Benjamins
Low key, plenty ends makes plenty friends
Baby, I got all the herbs that I need to chief
Smoke up a pound and leave you bitch niggas in disbelief
Inhale the smoke and every word I wrote came out dope
Not like that crack, I mean lyrical dope above tracks
Not sayin' I won't pull the Rueger and put hollow to ya
Have yo mama on her knees screamin' Hallelujah
Lay it down playa, Suave House, Bad Boy
Fat Boy ain't afraid to rat-a-tat boy
Matter of fact boy, this is not a act boy
The player way, keep the player makin' stacks boy
Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin' blowed on the dro, takin' smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, every day
The player way, the player way

Now on, on, break o' dawn, can't stop, I'm too hot
Look shit, my niggas rock, hype man be in the drop
Me no care if the B's be tinted
You won't see me in it 'less there's TV's in it
I can tell by the way you talk and the way you chit-chat
You foul and if you had styles you wouldn't get back
You thinkin' you invincible, you ain't hard to get at
I know everywhere you go, everywhere you live at
I be wanna click-clack and you be ready to get back
I be ready to go to war, you ain't gon' be with that
You be the same cat that I run up on and spit at
Bleedin' all crazy and don't know where you hit at
I'm head up, niggas doin' drama better shut up, I'm fed up
Know for my Roley I was set up
I can't let up, you in some shit that don't concern you
Send a bullet through your thermal, you know crazy
You might also like
Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin' blowed on the dro, takin' smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, every day
The player way, the player way

I've been waiting 20 minutes, baby, now drop yo drawers
And do something outstandin' with yo jaws
After all this waitin' I can see clean through yo forehead
You mo' said than done, give mo' head than some
Throw my jacket down in the puddle, hell no
If you don't know a pimp, somebody best to tell y'all
Yeah the women say it's good to have a confidant
But yet and still they give it up to pimps once a month
See a lot of these pimp lovers, they tuck they cape in
Front like they real and hold a fake in
You wastin' the time of serious ballas and ready hoes
Got my women walkin', dibs on da strip with steady toes
As I roll up, cranking is thinking the bigger financial expertise
Plenty money workin' for G and whoever next to me
And I ain't gonna rest till we made a statement
I'm straight up you watered down, it's time for a replacement
Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin' blowed on the dro, takin' smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday
The player way, the player way

See, true players have love for one another
Now you got these niggas over here
They Suave House niggas
Got these niggas over here
These Bad Boy niggas
Instead of feuding and fighting they getting money together like true players do
All the time, y'know
United we stand divided we fall
Bad Boy, Suave House
One of the many connections we gon' make as black entrepreneurs
Black players..Embed
