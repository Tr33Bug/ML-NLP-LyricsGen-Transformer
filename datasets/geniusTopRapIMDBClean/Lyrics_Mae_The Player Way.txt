No one expected the unexpected  uh uh 
Know what Im saying
Something real something you could feel  thats right 
Straight from the Suave House  Bad Boy 
Representing  no doubt 
Put a little soul in here
And we dont stop
No one has to ask who be actin bad
Eightball and MJ pimpin G be all up in that ass
From Memphis Tenn around the world and than back again
Make nonrappin weak MCs go home practicing
I flip a Benz with Lorenzen and plenty Benjamins
Low key plenty ends makes plenty friends
Baby I got all the herbs that I need to chief
Smoke up a pound and leave you bitch niggas in disbelief
Inhale the smoke and every word I wrote came out dope
Not like that crack I mean lyrical dope above tracks
Not sayin I wont pull the Rueger and put hollow to ya
Have yo mama on her knees screamin Hallelujah
Lay it down playa Suave House Bad Boy
Fat Boy aint afraid to ratatat boy
Matter of fact boy this is not a act boy
The player way keep the player makin stacks boy
Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin blowed on the dro takin smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman but I dont love hoes
Im a player baby and dont you forget
You need to get with it let me hit it and split it
In the bed on the floor hot tub every day
The player way the player way
Now on on break o dawn cant stop Im too hot
Look shit my niggas rock hype man be in the drop
Me no care if the Bs be tinted
You wont see me in it less theres TVs in it
I can tell by the way you talk and the way you chitchat
You foul and if you had styles you wouldnt get back
You thinkin you invincible you aint hard to get at
I know everywhere you go everywhere you live at
I be wanna clickclack and you be ready to get back
I be ready to go to war you aint gon be with that
You be the same cat that I run up on and spit at
Bleedin all crazy and dont know where you hit at
Im head up niggas doin drama better shut up Im fed up
Know for my Roley I was set up
I cant let up you in some shit that dont concern you
Send a bullet through your thermal you know crazy


Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin blowed on the dro takin smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman but I dont love hoes
Im a player baby and dont you forget
You need to get with it let me hit it and split it
In the bed on the floor hot tub every day
The player way the player way
Ive been waiting 20 minutes baby now drop yo drawers
And do something outstandin with yo jaws
After all this waitin I can see clean through yo forehead
You mo said than done give mo head than some
Throw my jacket down in the puddle hell no
If you dont know a pimp somebody best to tell yall
Yeah the women say its good to have a confidant
But yet and still they give it up to pimps once a month
See a lot of these pimp lovers they tuck they cape in
Front like they real and hold a fake in
You wastin the time of serious ballas and ready hoes
Got my women walkin dibs on da strip with steady toes
As I roll up cranking is thinking the bigger financial expertise
Plenty money workin for G and whoever next to me
And I aint gonna rest till we made a statement
Im straight up you watered down its time for a replacement
Everything that I do be all about the loot
I been kickin up dust in my Polo boots
Gettin blowed on the dro takin smoke up my nose
I give the world to a woman but I dont love hoes
Im a player baby and dont you forget
You need to get with it let me hit it and split it
In the bed on the floor hot tub everyday
The player way the player way
See true players have love for one another
Now you got these niggas over here
They Suave House niggas
Got these niggas over here
These Bad Boy niggas
Instead of feuding and fighting they getting money together like true players do
All the time yknow
United we stand divided we fall
Bad Boy Suave House
One of the many connections we gon make as black entrepreneurs
Black players
