Talk tough on the turf and I swear Imma attend to that
And you can take that vest off cuz Imma put em in ya hat
Point blank walk up aint never did a drive by
Catch a nigga slippin and let the 45 fly

You crazy enough to play with me then you deserve a wake
Of course a nigga word a wait I raise the murder rate
Clap a shot at the cops like I never heard of Jakes

They can make a million dollars just bein my flunky
I got a set of soldiers that I send outside to check my motor
