Or is it really that you envy Mase
Or you dont really wanna see me fly
Do you really wanna hurt Mase
Or do you really wanna make me cry
Or is it really that you envy Mase
Or you dont really wanna see me fly
Now you dont wanna see me angry
Aint enough cops or cuffs to chain me
Days to arraign me KKKs to hang me insane me
Ya need ice picks to bang me
Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and maim me
Nigga look at you and look at us my duns dont fuss
Harlem win you with a thrush nigga you better hush
I can mess out the cave niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust aint enough for us
Listen here Masell make you disappear
And yo mouthll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya you dont need me I dont need you neither
Thats why my next Lex gon be a two seater
And the things I do to you wont leave you beautiful
And though yo feelin fuck me Im feelin mutual
Do you really wanna hurt Mase

From the M to the A nigga dollar sign E
Come around money if you ever tryin to find me
I was Murda for six years seen no cream from it
Drop Murda off Mae woke up at Teen Summit
My niggas joke niggas broke kill a laugh
I got power make a call get a mil in cash
Like my money and yeah cuz they dont tax me
Actually anything you got to ask me fax me
Im no Beamer dreamer Im a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off now will ya Im the one that bitches live for
Dont get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I dont know you cats so dont you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarantee I peel ya

If I ever whisper on a remix I got Cchips
Time is money when you talk gotta be quick
I dont see how yall hang or even be wit
Niggas ridin in the Benz with only one V6
But I know how it is when you goin to the bar
Got girls overreact they throwin you a star
Got niggas player hatin dont even know who you are
And go as far as leavin bullet holes in yo car
When youre from Harlem World niggas never see yo views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the Gs and jewels Vs that ya cruise
Being the underdogs they cant wait to see us lose
Dont hate me thank me
I dont get mad when niggas bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you cant be
Im too pretty to let you niggas shank me
And frankly know you probably hate me cause you aint me
