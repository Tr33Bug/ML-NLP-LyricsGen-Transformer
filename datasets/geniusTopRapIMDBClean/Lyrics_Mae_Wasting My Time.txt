Wasting My Time Lyrics
H-world, keep dreaming
Keep working, working, don't stop
Keep working, working, don't stop!

I'm telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you don't want nothing
If you keep calling me girl, then tell me something
I'm telling you know girl, to be with me ma
It's all or nothing, doing all that fronting
You're wasting my time
Uh, yo
I like the fact you're Bougie
To wrapping you're doobie
The way you walk with big bags of Gucci
Forget just buying you rocks, of value block
Them things that you want to shop, I get in stock
And it don't stop there, helicopter to the lear
Am Ex Black Card, shopper of the year
Around the world and back, with no Visa
I get it so hot in here, it give you feaver
The watch that I'm wearing right now
Made in Genneiva, wavey low ceaser, navy four seater
Girls is snobby, money is my hobby
Cats want to rob me, coupes is wide bodied
So I'm like mami, move down a seat
Next thing I know, hat blew down the street
Never knew we could have life like this
So much dough, it'll put your life at risk
C'mon

I'm telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you don't want nothing
If you keep calling me girl, then tell me something
(Tell me something)
I'm telling you now girl, to be with me ma
Its all or nothing
(All or nothing)
Doing all that fronting, you're wastin my time
You might also like
You know everybody loves a star
They love me up close, and love me from a far
Just got another car, matter of fact another "R"
You know my rims same color as the car
Though my life was hard, I made it look easy
You know that we be, out in D.C
Wit Jamal and Gee Gee, sipping Fiji
Rolling in a brand new Bently G.T
And besides, it's my pictures, I'm saved and I'm rich
Sitll the fly chicks see Mel my sidekick
Balling, just with a different calling
Sorry your tone, I speak this fallin
Christion Dior'n, 'til it gets boaring
Leary now, Verizon, can you hear me now
I'm not just on fire, I'm in the zone
By time you call the phone, I'm in a mall in Rome

I'm telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you don't want nothing
If you keep calling me girl, then tell me something
(Tell me something)
I'm telling you now girl, to be with me ma
Its all or nothing
(All or nothing)
Doing all that fronting, you're wastin my time
Uh, uh!
Jesus, here's my thesis
Used to want, now they need us
Everything in the club want to please us
Now I'm on T.V., more than Regis
We just do it with a big budget
Like 9-1-1 wit the rubbish
I ain't got to go in the club to be discovered
Might not know what a thug is
But I know what love is
Love ain't weak, love ain't deep
And love wanna see you more than once a week
And love ain't cheap, love don't creep
Love ain't a freak, and love don't want to run the streets
And this is how we operate
Love is the opposite of hate
And love is no demand
So you need to understand
It won't take your man
Its just a command
C'mon

I'm telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you don't want nothing
If you keep calling me girl, then tell me something
(Tell me something)
I'm telling you now girl, to be with me ma
Its all or nothing, doing all that fronting
You're wastin my time
(reapeat 2x)
H-world, keep dreaming (You're wasting my time)
Keep working, working, don't stop
Keep working, working, don't stop (You're wasting my time)
Keep working, working, don't stop
Keep working, working, don't stop (You're wasting my time)
Keep working, working, don't stop
Keep working, working, don't stopEmbed
