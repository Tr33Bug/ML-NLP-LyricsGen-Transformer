Hworld keep dreaming
Keep working working dont stop
Keep working working dont stop
Im telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you dont want nothing
If you keep calling me girl then tell me something
Im telling you know girl to be with me ma
Its all or nothing doing all that fronting
Youre wasting my time
Uh yo
I like the fact youre Bougie
To wrapping youre doobie
The way you walk with big bags of Gucci
Forget just buying you rocks of value block
Them things that you want to shop I get in stock
And it dont stop there helicopter to the lear
Am Ex Black Card shopper of the year
Around the world and back with no Visa
I get it so hot in here it give you feaver
The watch that Im wearing right now
Made in Genneiva wavey low ceaser navy four seater
Girls is snobby money is my hobby
Cats want to rob me coupes is wide bodied
So Im like mami move down a seat
Next thing I know hat blew down the street
Never knew we could have life like this
So much dough itll put your life at risk
Cmon
Im telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you dont want nothing
If you keep calling me girl then tell me something
Tell me something 
Im telling you now girl to be with me ma
Its all or nothing
All or nothing 
Doing all that fronting youre wastin my time
You know everybody loves a star
They love me up close and love me from a far
Just got another car matter of fact another R
You know my rims same color as the car
Though my life was hard I made it look easy
You know that we be out in DC
Wit Jamal and Gee Gee sipping Fiji
Rolling in a brand new Bently GT
And besides its my pictures Im saved and Im rich
Sitll the fly chicks see Mel my sidekick
Balling just with a different calling
Sorry your tone I speak this fallin
Christion Diorn til it gets boaring
Leary now Verizon can you hear me now
Im not just on fire Im in the zone
By time you call the phone Im in a mall in Rome
Im telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you dont want nothing
If you keep calling me girl then tell me something
Tell me something 
Im telling you now girl to be with me ma
Its all or nothing
All or nothing 
Doing all that fronting youre wastin my time
Uh uh
Jesus heres my thesis
Used to want now they need us
Everything in the club want to please us
Now Im on TV more than Regis
We just do it with a big budget
Like 911 wit the rubbish
I aint got to go in the club to be discovered
Might not know what a thug is
But I know what love is
Love aint weak love aint deep
And love wanna see you more than once a week
And love aint cheap love dont creep
Love aint a freak and love dont want to run the streets
And this is how we operate
Love is the opposite of hate
And love is no demand
So you need to understand
It wont take your man
Its just a command
Cmon
Im telling you woman
Why you calling me all day
If you dont want nothing
If you keep calling me girl then tell me something
Tell me something 
Im telling you now girl to be with me ma
Its all or nothing doing all that fronting
Youre wastin my time
reapeat 2x 
Hworld keep dreaming  Youre wasting my time 
Keep working working dont stop
Keep working working dont stop  Youre wasting my time 
Keep working working dont stop
Keep working working dont stop  Youre wasting my time 
Keep working working dont stop
Keep working working dont stop
