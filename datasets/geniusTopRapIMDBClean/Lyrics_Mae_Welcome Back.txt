How long you been back man
Welcome welcome welcome welcome back
I see the girls in the club they gettin wild for me
And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat drop I know they gon lean
World debut I know they gon fiend
Everything Mississippi to the Palm Springs
Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys dont know what a don mean
Im just a bad boy gone clean
Im the diamond chain choker always remain sober
Dont drink liquor and all the games over
Need a plane I explain it to my broker
Three bots in the hood top down it aint nova  My homie 
You know theres more man where that come from
Me and Cudda Love rollin back to back in one
See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game aint the same since I left out
Ooh you know we need ya ooh you know we need ya
Right heres where we need ya right heres where we need ya

See I rep the most high still Im the most fly
Win so much they wanna know who Im coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa but Im like dont try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control and I cant tell you no lie
Tryin to find a soulmate you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin the vida without the loca
Im down south so they show me country love
And I aint even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I aint even sellin the track cause Im that Harlem cat


See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game aint the same since I left out
Ooh you know we need ya ooh you know we need ya
Right heres where we need ya right heres where we need ya
