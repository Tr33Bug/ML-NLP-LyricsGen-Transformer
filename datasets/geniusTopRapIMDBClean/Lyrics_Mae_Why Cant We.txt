Jay said it Drake said it
Dont get mad now cause Mase say it
Come to find out Im Ye favorite
APs up to all the naysayers
Come on I said come on
Why cant we go back
Why cant we go back
To the way we used to be girl
Why cant we go back
Back when we only had each other
and lust forever
Why cant we go back
So the world things that youll let me through
We found our things that we never knew
Why cant we go back
Go go
Go go
I wanna be your first spouse break your first couch
Pop your first blouse buy your first house
If this dont work out Im the first out
Bring the Merce out and still get cursed out
Mase be the nigga that bring your worst out
Take you out for dinner you bring your purse out
This is easy money this easy work
You know I like my girls in bikini and fur
Dont take it off fast tease me first
You rub me like a genie youll see me work
On an one night stand Ill feed you first
So when you hit your friends Ill lead you first
Ill leave the Earth
Id tell you you the best but you believe the worst
I break your heart but I dont leave you hurt
See hes a jerk trips the rain dealer

He the type of nigga here go and get it for his goddess
If thats true you know youll be living just like a queen
You know how I do the thing when Im rolling through the scene
TMZ them niggas when Im rolling in the 
Left fan European whipping through the Chi like Im cuckoo
Got too many friends getting back to the twodo
All eyes on me like Im ready to die
Life after death but what Im bout to do though
They thought they had me trapped but I found a loophole
I look around and I ask where my crew go
Spanish niggas singing 
Two hundred Benz and thats two shows
I said thats two shows
