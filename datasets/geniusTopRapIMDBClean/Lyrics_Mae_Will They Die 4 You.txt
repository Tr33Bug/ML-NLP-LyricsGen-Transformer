How many get a ki slice the pie wit you

Niggas know infrareds on ya head and they ride wit you

Well Ima ride for you would you ride for me
Well Ima die for you would you die for me
Obviously we all know you type of cats
Let they man get struck never strike back
Stay in the street seven days a week
Shit get hot you never blaze your heat
Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet
So I keep em on his toes that way he never sleeps
Bigger than the king and the Pope sling no dope
Call me anything but broke
When its on I guarantee my team dont choke
Want a war you niggas better bring yo force
And when I say we wont quit believe this shit
When I talk about a Benz let you see the 6
And when Im talkin to a ho let you meet my bitch
When Puff talk you niggas take heed to this

Yo if you down to act we came to scrap
We beef 89 still watch your back
A nigga smack me Ima smack em back
If it lead to the guns then that be that
And lately niggas that snake me just make me
Wanna send em heat without AC
Thinks Im sweet taste me
How much you really want it
Enough to put a mil on it or your deal on it
This year Cancun guess who Im going wit
My own niggas see I pay my own trip
Make my own chips I copped my own 6
I knock my own shit like Im on my own dick
My day be short need coke raid the fort
Im knocked by the cops come blaze the court
And though niggas die for go on the shelf
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt
Me I always had so I never go for self
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt
Better slow down tellin you now put the dough down
Kick your door down surround the block where you go now
Fifty shots spit at you and thats not a whole round
Way I leave the furniture think it was cofound
Heres the lowdown messin with Mase gotta go down
What more could I say but hey guess you niggas know now


Yeah how many niggas thatll die for you
How many get a ki slice the pie wit you
I aint talkin bout those that get high with you
Niggas know infrareds on ya head and they ride wit you
Yeah how many niggas thatll die for you
How many get a ki slice the pie wit you

Motherfuckin right Ima roll with my motherfuckin dogs
Bitches aint around when its time to go to war
This shit here nothing to fuck with
Im the same bitch all yall wanna try yall luck with
Lil Kim spread like syphilis
You think Im pussy I dare you to stick your dick in this
Chrome 44 inconspicuous
In the 600 shits ridiculous
Speak when youre spoken to and only with permission
Like EF Hutton when I talk niggas listen
So dont yall be mad at me
Cuz Im the Q to the B to the motherfuckin EE
Copped my CD now all yall wanna be me
See me on the TV beds will dip in 3D
Peep the CD chromed out and phoned out
My shit is paid for your shit is loaned out
I gets it on money keep growin
Ice fully glowin plus Im bad to the bone
In the danger zone I hold my own
When the pain is gone like a splinter I enter
So why should I throw my blows in those
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles
My nigga BIG Ima ride for
But it aint too many niggas that Id die for
Yeah how many niggas thatll die for you
How many get a ki slice the pie wit you
I aint talkin bout those that get high with you
Niggas know infrareds on ya head and they ride wit you
Yeah how many niggas thatll die for you
How many get a ki slice the pie wit you
I aint talkin bout those that get high with you
Niggas know infrareds on ya head and they ride wit you
