Yeah my moms saying No way you going to Jefferson
Thats a school where kids be sneaking their weapons in
Around here Jeff is where they gon put ya
Or Maxwell but they aint even got football
10 more points and I would have gotten into Brooklyn Tech
Oh well what other schools are we looking at
Its Midwood and South Shore and Edison
They all full so no way they gon let us in
Fort Hamilton High School is dumb far
Thats like two trains and a bus or one car
Stuyvesant they sent the nice poster to us
But there where some schools a whole lot closer to us
Erasmus Hall boys and girls some other places
Moms thinks I should go to school with some other races
Italians Jews Russians and Armenians
Dominicans West Indians youll make plenty friends
Just be ready for a real bad racial tone
Them white boys dont hesitate to chase you home
Then we settled on Sheepshead Bay
My man work out there and he said hey
Long as ya dudes dont come out try to act a fool
Everything gon be real cool after school
But act up and they gon chase yall cats
All the way back to the hood with baseball bats
Damn thats a long bus ride to a foreign land
But Im ready to hit the scene like Marlon Bran
All I need is some new clothes from Aqueduck
And the rest of these cool Joes can pack it up
Sheepshead Bay strange name yes it is
And I vow to be one of the freshest kids
So fresh Imma be having you vexed
When I arrive at 3000 Avenue X
Ok ok settle settle down
This line is only for students who dont have a school yet
If you need lunch passes youre over here
Hot lunch only over here
Here please
Bus passes over there on that side to the left
Miss miss youre going in the right direction
No no not you you are going in the right one
Youre going in the wrong one youre on that line
Where is where are your parents
Oh God I cant wait until this day is over
