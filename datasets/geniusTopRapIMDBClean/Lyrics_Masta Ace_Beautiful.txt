Yeah BK Uptown Boogie Down Queens
Its beautiful
Listen I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today I have to laugh on the real
The aftermaths kind of ill like Im Dr Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded I just hate it  just hate it 
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
Its a new kind of dealing its a special kind of healing  uh huh 
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz You know what it is
Positive over negative see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster  thats right 
I rise up above
See people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit you can pop in the deck
Its beautiful
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
Whats inside goes beyond your mind its beautiful
Yeah this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees 10nothing killing the Sox
This aint hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran  thats right 
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like Im more than a cat with a plan
This feels like its more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
Thats why I stole this mic yall dont hold this right  nope 
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack no a glass of Henny  thats right 
Now drink it up til there aint nothing left in it
Im repping it BK thats a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
Whats inside goes beyond your mind its beautiful


Im wishing on a on a on  the most beautifullest thing ever
And its here to bring terror to the bling era  yeah 
You can feel it in your inner
Its like Grandmas house Thanksgiving dinner
Its like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark  swish 
Its that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But Id rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
Its a young mother braiding her daughters hair
Its beautiful
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
Whats inside goes beyond your mind its beautiful
