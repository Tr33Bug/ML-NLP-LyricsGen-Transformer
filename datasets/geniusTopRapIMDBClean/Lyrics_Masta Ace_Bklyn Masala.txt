I met her on the corner of Gates and Bedstuy
It was only right that I approached and said hi
Cause she looked like no other chick I ever saw
She was on her way coming up out the cornerstone
I asked could I carry your bags and walk her home
I can tell she was new in New York just from her tone
Cause she wasnt that typical rude and ignorant
Teethsucking and eyerolling telling me to leave her alone
We dipped and we yapped we chit and we chat
About this and that and where she lived at yeah
This may sound kind of WuTang Clanish
But this butterpecan honey was not Spanish
She lived like three blocks from my man
In New York for six months moved from Pakistan
Well that explains the strange accent and the strange clothes
And that cute little diamond in your nose
She said I gotta wear this gear every Sunday but
You gotta see how I look come Monday  Word
Meaning I can see you again Maybe
Give you a call take you out on the weekend
She winked at me and kind of laughed
Ripped a piece of the grocery bag and wrote her math
You can bet your last damn dollar
That Ima give you a call Brooklyn Masala
Mentally and sexual  cant forget how I met you
And every time I look at you
I see the most wonderful woman I have ever met
Can we walk and talk share our worlds
Im feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number Ill holler
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala

On our first date knocked on the door around eight
When she came down she smelled good and looked great
She had the tight Frankie Bs on white on white Ones
A pink bubble goose and pink bubblegum Im like damn
Even pink Chanel shades
Her long black hair was done up in box braids
She didnt have the Maybeline face that was all dead
Instead she had a red dot on her forehead
Ccups pumping looking real ill
You wanna see Lord of the Rings or Kill Bill
She looked at me and said either one
Cause there really aint no Black stars in either one
So what you wanna do girl
She kind of blushed then
We settled on dinner for two at Justins
The food was good with no surprises
We had the barbecue shrimp as appetizers
We had the cat fish main course
A few drinks then out the front door like Main Source
We stepped out into the big city
She said the Times Square lights are so pretty
We caught a cab back to the lab
Stopped kissing long enough to pay the tab
She said I think we got a nice future
That night learned all about the Kama Sutra my Masala
Can we walk and talk share our worlds
Im feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number Ill holler
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala

Think Im starting to feel you just wanna let you know
One day youll be mine and I just wont let you go
You feeling me Im feeling you
You feeling me Im feeling you
Might be falling in love but Im tryna take it slow  my Masala 
Thank you madame for this fascinating lesson in our cultural differences
