Woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
The TVs on from playing all night on Nintendo
Jumped out of bed tryin to see whats up with all the noise and
I see somebody else has caught a case of lead poison
This type of shit around my way is a regular occurance
Because the same shit just happened to my nigga Terrence
A week later now somebody else is laying dying
Surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
The way hes laying there it looks to me that hes a goner
I seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
I start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
I bet I knew him or at least I bet I probably met him
I cant pretend Im shocked like electrocution
Cuz any night there could be an execution
My momma told me that that thug shit will get you buried
The next day theres your name in the obituary
I asked her why we gotta live in this environment
She said Your grandfather drank up his retirement
Plus when I fucked around and had you I was just a baby
Just maybe if I wasnt being miss lady
Things couldve been a little bit better
Threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
I hit the block tryin to find out who got done in
Who had the gun and who that was I seen running
Another body on the ground cold and
Another day another lost soul and
Same shit in every zip code
No matter where you go
Its just another block episode
Another story on the street told and
Another turn down the wrong road and
Sit back and watch it unfold
Yo Ill let you know
Just another block episode
Yo I roam the streets with my peeps and the gun by my crotch
I got beef with this cat that resides on my block
He getting popped I swear when I see him its on
Hell just be a tattoo on his best friends arm
My friends screaming Punch be calm yall can save it
He borrowed 5 Gs two months ago still aint pay it
This girl hit me on the cell about his location
I grabbed my gun jumped in the hoopty then I started racing
Turned off the lights a block away so he dont peep the caper
I see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
Dont wanna kill him I just wanna teach this cat a lesson
Stepped on the gas grab the gun cocked back the weapon
Shot up the whole corner but hit him in the kneecap
Thats cool cuz dead niggas cant pay your cash back
Im nutting to laugh at I keep bad temper
I hit him a bystander and one of his crewmembers
gunshot 
Yo yo yo yo last thing I heard was a blast car circling past
I wasnt nervous thought they might be searching for gas
Soon as Rob came out dispersing the trash
Car sped and lead went through his windows curtains and glass
Dove in the dirt and the grass
I look bullet struck my right arm
Glass in my left palm I lost my neck charm
I knew it was Punch cuz Rob owed him money
But never had it always got new kicks and gear to match it
Im in the ambulance I thought that beef was squashed
Thats why when he seen Punch he crossed the street and dodged
See Robs records with the DA is forfeit
My records 40 GPA going to Harvard
Athletes 100 miles and running hes a convict
Other hand my high school football team I lead in yardage
Boys regardless blood pressure dropped artery vessel clogged
Cardiac arrest next my chest was shocked IV
Oxygen mask bleeding heavily
We need to get to the hospital fast Im doing 70
Why I gotta be a casuality of war Did good most my life
My career was growing gradually and more
Hearing hold on youll be alright youre gonna make it
Sirens up ahead construction on the pavement
Slowed down from this moment I didnt have a chance
Seein hazards flash cant believe I died in the traffic jam
ambulance siren
