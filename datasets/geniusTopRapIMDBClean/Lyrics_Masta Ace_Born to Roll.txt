Brainiac dumbdumbs bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching em
And they take a loss take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didnt know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cockdiesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didnt wanna battle if they did when they saw me
Theyd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin aint no future in your frontin so lets get it on
Like Marvin Gaye hey  take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wickwack lowridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and lets start the battle
Act like ya know the Masta Ace dont play when it come to my bass aahhhh
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll  repeat several 
Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
Its Saturday its Saturday the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a airconditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we cant hear they horns
Cause he got musica grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he dont know the time
So Im turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira mira man dont sleep I got tha I got tha I got the woofers in my Jeep
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll  repeat several 


Black boy black boy turn that shit down
You know that America dont wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga Ill arrest you if you holding up traffic
Ill be damned if I listen so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
Im breaking ear drums while Im breaking the law
Im disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can if you can heres a donut
Cause once you drive away yo ya know Im gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya cant stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
Gods on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out they coming out the woofers in my Jeep
Check it out baby check it out yall
I was born to roll  repeat several
