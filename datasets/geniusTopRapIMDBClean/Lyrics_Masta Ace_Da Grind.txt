Yeah
Send this one out to everybody trying to make ends meet
Yeah
Im on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
When it seems like Im running out of time
Thats when Im going on the grind
Ay yo Im trying to make my dollars double
I done found a place to fit in
For niggas trying to get into this power struggle
I work hard on the job like immigrants
And always try to get my first half in advance
It sounds strange but the rap game is not a game
You could make a lot of money gain a lot of fame
But dont get it twisted
You could get addicted
Buy a mansion in the Hamptons and get evicted
Now if you call me and Im not around
Im probably putting my grind down
Doing shows out of town
I be the manager road manager and call handler
Booking agent choreographer and tour planner
I be the VP of marketing and promotions
Producer and arranger with a range of emotions
And after it all I still gotta perform
At three oclock in the morn when half the fans are gone
But its fine
Been on the grind since like 88 or 89
The game is foul like a plate of swine
Now is there anybody kind like me
Is anybody out there on the grind like me
For everybody working nine to five
For everybody trying to rise with they eyes on the prize
Im with cha we all going through it
But yo deep down inside I know we still gon do it
Oh
Im on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
And it seems like Im running out of time
Thats why Im always on the grind
Yeah Im on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I feel like Im walking on the line
When it seems like Im running out of time
Thats when Im going on the grind
Yeah
I really feel Im blessed cause I was born with a talent to rhyme
But the stress got me this close to quitting sometimes
On the crowded A train every morning
I cant wait for the day
My hustle game dont got to start this way
Niggas think its all good when they see me and hear my CD
And think Im jumping in the 745 with TVs
They dont know I miss tours and shows
To go to work and pay bills and keep dough on my clothes
In the shadow of a legend so
They expect me to spit and sound like him
But yall need to let it go
Everyday I face the crossroad of rap or drugs
Album cuts and singles and crack heads and clappin thugs
When Im broke my moms wont even give me a hug
But on payday Im her baby then she call it love
I keep making my moves cause one day Im a prove
I got what it take and I will not lose
Yeah


I had to hustle hard never give up scratched to end
