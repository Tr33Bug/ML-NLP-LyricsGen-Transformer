Do you ever song a little song like this
When you get up in the morning
Dear diary  Yo  what a day its been  Now I hope you aint releasin another album 
Dear diary its been just like a dream  Let me ask you something 
Ayo Ace dont tell me you thinkin about a return
Im kind of concerned when will you old cats ever learn
Its time to hang it up when you stand on your last leg
When you dont write on the reg and your future is past dead
Ima tell you cause none of these cats will
You cant still try to rely on your rap skill
You aint got nothin behind you and believe me
Not a label out that gon find you and want to sign you
Write your rhymes in the shower youre washed up
If there was a law against wack shit youd be locked up
These cats in the game pretend that they your friend
But as soon as you walk away they talkin bout you again
Half your old group dont like you and want to fight you
And even made songs about you to try to spite you
Big Beat dropped you and said that you cant sell
And they aint had a hit since before Pac was in jail
Its like the shits up under your nose and you cant smell
Hell you probably older than Blu Cantrell
You cant tell Its over capital OVER
And thats just in case you cant spell cmon
Dear diary what a day its been  Trust me I know what Im talkin about 
Dear diary its been just like a dream  You need to give it up kay Its over 
Woke up too late wasnt where I should have been  Its not 88 89 no more 
For goodness sake whats happening to me  Oh you prayin now 
Yeah I heard all of your prayers but I doubt that God got em
So break out the suits and ties and the hard bottoms
And get yourself a job with a desk in a nice office
And learn to enjoy all of the garbage that life offers
And dont ever again show your face on a stage
Or write the name Masta Ace on a page kid ya done
Whoever let you back in the door should get a smack in the jaw
Cause you sure shouldnt be rappin no more
You already proved that at the Lyricist Lounge affair
Tryin to battle with rhymes you wrote on the way there
Maybe next time youll know not to play fair
Say your best written shit and school em like daycare
But through the sad mess and all of the bad press
I cant recall a time in the past when you had less
Aint nobody out there gon keep it realer than me
We one in the same sincerely your diary
Dear diary  Stupid man  what a day its been  Whats wrong with you 
Dear diary its been just like a dream  Psh let these cats gas you up 
Woke up too late  Thinkin you could put another record out  wasnt where I should have been
For goodness sake  Sad man  whats happening to me  Start a family and move somewhere get a job or something 
Dear diary what a day its been
Dear diary  Probably checkin for your ass  its been just like a dream
Woke up too late  You gon waste all these peoples money  wasnt where I should have been  You aint gettin no video 
For goodness sake whats happening to me  Its over
