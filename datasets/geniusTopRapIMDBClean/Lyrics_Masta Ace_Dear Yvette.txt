Ay yo shorty Im sayin I knew
You since you was like yay high yknamean
You out here whylin out you really need
To cool out with all that
Please you dont know me
Ay yo Yvette theres a lotta rumours goin around
About you hoein around you need to slow down
Eversince ya ass grew you been movin kinda fast boo
Dont even speak now when I pass you
Hundred Dollar bill tattoo on yo thigh
The gleam in ya eye for the cream and the pie
Skirt ridin high so they can see ya thong better
Imma sit down and write you a long letter
We was little we was friends we rode our big wheels
Now I see you gettin a Benz with big wheels
All these guys in the city see is the size of your titties
And that you got hazel eyes and youre pretty
They see a girl like you and they wanna get in her
I was thinkin we can go to a movie maybe dinner
You turned around and told me I need to retire
If I cant show you the money like Jerry McGuire
I dont know
You dont really know me
Just what ya think ya see
Just what ya think ya see
You dont have to worry bout me
This chick got hopes and dreams
But Im about this paper cuz
There aint no love for free
I never been they type of bitch maybe when I was younger
I craved love and thought they could satisfy my hunger
Thirsty had a few niggas do me dirty
Slid a blade across my wrist almost went 730
I spazed now its all about the cash
Swingin naked on a pole doin tricks with my ass
You wanna be with me and let happilly ever after
Same ol song get more hits than Napster
You dont care about me you dont really know me
My broked hearts and dreams is killin me slowly
Get ahead bitch walk with a switch
Lip gloss lips and 34 inch hips
Airbrushed chips and chromed out whips
I like to take trips when wife stash the whips
Fuck love em solo
Raisin my seeds for dolo
And mindstate fresh with nothin less than Polo
Please dont be sympathetic
Shit I dont regret it
While these hoes halfstepped it
Nigga Im gonna rep it til I die
And make these Gs multiply
Imma make Gs cry like when Jesus died
And on the third day my G rose again
A foul type chick quick to fuck ya best friend
And smile in ya face niggas stay in ya place
Catch my head at his waist lie with a straight face
I know my man had you in the Bricks with a couple of chicks
Drivin around havin endless kicks in the Benz 6
He said the sex was  good  the head was  good 
Yo I think he would tell the whole hood if he could
You say its all about the money well I can tell
Cuz that nigga makes Sam Cassell look like Denzel
My bad Imma sound like a real hater
Imma leave it on that note and holla at ya later
One
You think you are the judgement
Yall niggas dont know me
I do what I gotta do I take care of mine
Who you think you are you aint no better than me
Why you say all that
Im only doin what I gotta do
I do what I gotta do too
You dont know me you dont love me
Im tryin to help you I mean you out here whylin out
Whatever though
