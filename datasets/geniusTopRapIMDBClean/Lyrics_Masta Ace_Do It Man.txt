Check it out yo ey yo
They call me Big Noyd the one that smack the taste out
Your fucking mouth I keep it gutter thats what I be about
Thats what I breathe what I eat thats what I shitted out
Im from the streets and Im a G and I know nothing else
Like when theres beef I grap a Tec from the fucking shelve
Stuff it in my jeans step on the scene ruin your health
Snitches run their mouth thats why I do it myself
No need to co theres noone ratting me out
Just to find the guy I keep it gully nigga ride out
Before my thuns come and air out your hide out
Matter fact say no more your raw to grap your four
Your scared to call your dog nigga lets get it on
I set it off I start long blows
Knock your ass out and leave your dead with a bloody nose
Winking to your front door who you know as raw as me
A skinny nigga but up on the streets Im a beast motherfucker
Yeah yeah this is how we do it man
We busting them chrome nines and running from one time
This is how we do it man
My mind on my money and my money on my mind yep
This is how we do it man
We strap with them big gats and chases some cool cat
This is how we do it man
We hold it down we dont fuck around niggas know our style yep
Hope I dont get shot today
Cause I heard some niggas letting off rounds like a block away
Its like walking through Vietnam
Sorrounded by americans dressed like the Viet Cong
See that kid 16 try to cop a gat
Ever since he was a brat he been a copycat
And he aint scared to pull it blood
So I better watch my step or I might catch a bullet slug
See theres all kinds of rival stuff
We all in the line of fire nigga and survivals tough
Send my son to the store cause theres mold on the bread
They might send him home with a hole in the head
And just like Windex Cleaner
Its clear that niggas settle problems with their index finger
And my moms has yet to strove
Cause she know that folks catches strays like pet control
These are dangerous times the lifes on the line
A nigga might get it by the knife or the nine
I gotta stay awake when I hold the cake
Cause the grim reaper looking for a soul to take
And the next cat may be him
So I look over my shoulder when Im standing at the ATM
Ya can go head and worry bout the crackers fine
But that nigga with the nine skin is black as mine
This is how they do it man
Sawedoff shot screaming give me what you got nigga
This is how they do it man
Straight off blunt spillers and natural born killers
This is how they do it man
Chrome play the nine put your life on the line woaw
This is how they do it man
Holding down the block the plot just wont stop no
