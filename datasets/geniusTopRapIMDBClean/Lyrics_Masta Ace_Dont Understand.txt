I get the feelin that these cats is thinkin that I might be on the verge of sinkin
Either they weeded or they heavily drinkin
Niggas know that Im steadily seekin to readily weaken
These socalled thug cats with a melody beacon
That the world hear loud and clear over the airwaves
I move up on the charts like stairways
I bus raps like trailways and greyhound
This is for them kids that was shot on the playground
Yo dont know why the streets is so evil
To this ghetto shit theres no equal them yo people
