Yeah yeah yeah yeahone two we aint gotta spit sixteens on this
Aiyyo this the best thing that ever happened to rap
Since Big Pun was packin a mac in the back of the Ac
Its like gettin pulled over by police
With a loaded mag and duffle bag of crack in the back
Yall in hot water yall crab motherfuckers it got too hot
In the pot ya got slaughtered
Your manager got sorted you got shorted
We turned around and put it out the blocks bought it
Yo I got rhymes and gats that Im concealin
If rap is the floor hiphop is the ceiling
Led from jump never was we trailin
Before you fight me you better fight the feelin nigga
Face it god the base is broad
Edo is grimey Ace is hard  PAUSE 
You can catch two Ls like your names James Todd
A  E off en garde the hit squad
Yo yall dudes is similiar to cinema
Trained actors like Brad and Jennifer
But yo I got a flow like Angelina
And Im a king like Billie Jean promoter Don and Regina
Weve been doin this as long as yall been alive
So little boys keep your mouth shut when the men arrive
I look mean as a motherfucker when I drive
The chromed out black four fifty like ten to five
Youll get bodied hard so you better have a bodyguard
I get that green like Swiss chard
When the flames pop youll never gain props
When the game stops and the chain pops
We gettin off at the same stop
I can understand an ocean by lookin at a raindrop
We EVERYWHERE you in a same spot
Imma make it so you rappers never EVER namedrop
Yeah your girls on my wood like a hungry beaver
If she tellin you she home with a fever nigga dont believe her
She on top of me Im underneath her
Cause your swag is illegal procedure like one receiver
Women hate a grown man with feminine traits
And your body gel kinda smell like cinnamon grapes
Your shampoos like Fruit Passion
You the ass in the Louis store tryin to find some cute fashion
Yo you a noshow and you wont blow
The people who know arent talkin
The people who are talkin dont know
You a hobo youll get ateeight like ocho
By my vocals Im number one
Twist your wig like a cumberbund
This whole industry is troublesome
We pop rappers like bubble gum
Dont confuse AE with the other ones
Yeah When Its time to get wild on stage
I can spit eights like Lynn Swann Alan Paige
Or maybe Randy Moss in his college days
When he was goin through that childish phase
But listen what you witnessin is violent rage
Kind of like a lion that got out his cage
Its the underground sound that pays
Me and Crazy Eddie go together like Brown and Beige
The game a soap opera The Days of Our Lives
Rappers talk shit then they apoligize  Im sorry 
No substance hollow guys
Thats why I do my 12 and dont follow lies
Im wax you Serato guys
You bullshit and Edo is bonafied
My dogs sick em get em now they play victim
Aint about them toys its about who playin wit em
