Yeah from BK to the world Ive had enough
Nowadays a range aint big enough Moschino aint jig enough
Im kind of iced out but my chain aint thick enough
Album aint hot enough label said its not enough
Singing in the hook I need to change my look
My rims aint big enough chrome dont shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab but I still cant find enough
Iceberg to swerve dont dress gay enough
No airplay so I guess I aint pay enough
Cristale dont cost enough and I still aint lost enough
Money on these chickens that said I dont floss enough
Album barely gold guess I aint try enough
Video wasnt fly enough budget wasnt high enough
And I aint lie enough about crack sales and jails
Yall feeling me like braille well I still got no sales
Must aint sold enough cause my heart aint cold enough
Said I was Born 2 Roll they said I aint roll enough
Guess I got to brag more must dont boast enough
Aint New York enough aint West Coast enough
But thats fine cause Imma focus on mine
Im hoping that 2009 is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
Youll see how Im on it if you hung enough with me
The rap games a book and Ive read mad chapters
And if you ask me it aint enough mad rappers
Somebody tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggas got to know its for real
Niggas only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough we gon start calling your bluff
Watching your moves we gon be all in your stuff
Fuck around and come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price niggas is nuff shiest
Guess it aint enough thugs enough drugs on the streets
And niggas aint busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians know what stress is
Project girls rock vests not dresses
Enough lessons learned play with fire get burned
Enough dough get made none of it earned
Enough wilding fuck that yo enough smiling
I rep Brooklyn Manhattan Staten Island
Queens plus the BX not enough Tecs
Not enough cops killing us all for paychecks
Enough of this enough of that enough crap
Enough wack radio stations said enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if theres enough niggas on it
When we in the house its like its haunted
We got you shook mad niggas from the Brook look
Enough cats crack Mos and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these enough of those it never slows
It just grows your girl dont wear enough clothes
These nobrainers are lost entertainers
Get found on Billboards greatest sale gainers
Enough Beems and Benz enough fly honies with dime friends
That want to juice you for your ends
Its getting rough whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime dog like McGruff enoughs enough
