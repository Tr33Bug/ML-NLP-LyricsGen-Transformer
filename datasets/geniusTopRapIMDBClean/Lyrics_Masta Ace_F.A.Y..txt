FAY Lyrics
Im startin to think that my skill is a waste
Still in the race with an ice grill on my face
Mad at the world mad at you mad at my girl
Mad at my friends and anybody drivin a Benz
I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail
But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail
I hate my neighbors they always askin for late night favors
Hate indie labels especially hate majors
I dont give a fuck no more fuck this tour
Fuck these shows and these groupies they all hos
Hate these rude people stayin all in my face
And hate the fact that Visa always callin my place
So all you mean creditors and magazine editors
Same ones that debted us and put niggas ahead of us
Im a mad dog who sits in the dark
Im fixin the bark watchin 106 And Park
What a mess I guess Im sorta stressed
Turn on the radio and I get more depressed
No wonder Im kinda bitter
Strick told me I should quit player hating but fuck that Im not a quitter
Had a few cats betray me try to play me
Bail and try to blame me fuck you pay me
If yall could yall would finish me
Thats why this finger here is for everybody in the industry
When you tryin to hustle for pay and people get in your way
Thats when you ready to say Fuck all yall
When the job is givin ya hell and pay is minimum scale
Thats when you ready to yell Fuck all yall
When its really starting to seem that people killing your dream
Thats when you ready to scream Fuck all yall
Im talkin to you and Im talking to you and Im talking to you nigga
Yo Im simply trying to eat til my belly is fat
And I rest in the Midwest where R Kelly and Nelly be at
Where my name ring bells like Whos celly is that
And Yo Strick you about to blow yo stop telling me that
Cuz at the end of the day Im still just a nobody
Cuz nobody knows me no record label chose me
But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me
A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky
A huge debt three lawyers and two managers
A bullshit advance that didnt recoup the damages
A couple of singles that wasnt really chartin
Yo Ace I got a Cherokee Bow Wow got an Aston Martin
That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool
A rec room with many games and plenty women too
He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin hot tub
I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs
Speakin of nots yo Im not a happy camper
Not gettin no younger feeling like a grandpa
Yo I got low self esteem
Just like a nigga running in place tryin to chase his own selfish dream
And fuck my girl soon Ill be startin to creep
Shes a slob and dont care if her carpet is neat
She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak
And cant cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep
I got a dog that dont bark and cat that dont meow
Everybody else is rich and I dont fuckin see how
Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up
Should just end it and give back the spot Im takin up
