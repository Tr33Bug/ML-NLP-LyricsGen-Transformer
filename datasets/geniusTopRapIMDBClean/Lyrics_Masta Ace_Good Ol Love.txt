Give me some of that good ol love
Ohhhh let me make you you
Give me some of that good ol love
Whoa ohhh
Put your hands together and show your love for the
One and only  Steve Harvey
Hey yo the world gon show me some love listen
And Im not talkin bout the fakes hugs and kissin
Fifteen years a lot of love is missin
I done already showed Im not above the dissin
Imma take what Im owed won wait til Im old
The game got rules and yall breakin the code
Yall dont really think I can be hot in the club
Yall think Im washed up like I got in the tub but
Im keepin it poppin the streets watchin
Im keepin em locked and the beat knockin
Hear me comin with this song that I brung in
DaddyO told me this when I was still a youngun
Aint nothin like hip hop music
Thats why we choose it and the world just cant refuse it
This shit is underground like a gopher
Show a little love fore its over
Give me some of that good ol love
Ohhhh let me make you you
Give me some of that good ol love
Whoa ohhh
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
Gimme that good ol love
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
Let me put yall on like a bulb in the socket
In the club niggas knock it wit a dub in the pocket
They walk in the store I love when they cop it
Make you other rappers struggle to top it
But this man flow with the greatest ease
Never did care about the haters please
He done paid his dues paid his fees
He done stayed overseas made his Gs
But now I got a wife and she bad as Halle
Her moms is a militant dad is rowdy
The fans kind of act like they glad Im outtie
But they prolly sittin at home sad and pouty
You show me some love Imma show it right back
I know a tight track so I throw it like that
My limo drivers white my attorney black
Show me some love like Im Bernie Mac


Give me some of that good ol love
Ohhhh let me make you you
Give me some of that good ol love
Whoa ohhh
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
Gimme that good ol love
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
This is for my Shaolin shooters and my Brooklyn teens
Uptown Bronx and them crooks in Queens
I work like a maid when she cooks and cleans
Cuz its about to be a wrap from the looks of things
The game is changed the game is strange
The game is lame and it aint the same
But thats how it is you can ask Giz
You can ask Biz we did it for the kids
Listen here this is different here
If you got an eye for detail and efficient ear
I wont disappear Imma keep on givin
Imma keep on livin Imma keep bein driven
Im down to earth and Im close to ground
And spit shit better than most around
This how hip hop is supposed to sound
Tear them other cats posters down now
Give me some of that good ol love
Ohhhh let me make you you
Give me some of that good ol love
Whoa ohhh
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
Gimme that good ol love
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on let me make you sing
Give me some of that good ol love
Ohhhh let me make you you
Give me some of that good ol love
Whoa ohhh
