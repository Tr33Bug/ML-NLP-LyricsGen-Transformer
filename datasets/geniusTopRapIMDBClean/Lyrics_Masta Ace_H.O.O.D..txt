HOOD LyricsYea goin out to the H double
Thats for you you and you
They got broke people poor people my people your people
Wherever I go  Listen
And they wont change ever change cant change dont change
And everyone knows 
As I travel through various towns and strange places
I see the same scowls and frowns on the same faces
The game races and cats try to catch it
Before they know it they know death on a first name basis
Whether its slangin or banging drinking or smokin
Theres bound to be one cat thinkin of loccin
The hoods like a sitcom
Leave ya bike outside come back outside I guarantee your shit gone
Young cats be sellin the rock
Money busting out they sock mama tellin them stop
But desperate times call for desperate means
It all seems so simple when youre just a teen
Only take one bad apple to poison the good
This for the girls on the block the boys in the hood
And wherever I go its the same as home
Its the H double O D the name is known
They got broke people poor people my people your people
Wherever I go  Listen
And they wont change ever change cant change dont change
And everyone knows  Yeah
They got broke people poor people my people your people
Wherever I go  Listen
And they wont change ever change cant change dont change
And everyone knows 
Listen they got wild and rough blocks where its hard to trust cops
Get shot on your way to school at the bus stop damn
That kid was a fine scholar
Hear his mama whine and holler he died for nine dollars
Young mothers trying to learn the ropes
And them one dollar lotto games turn their hopes
They keep hoping that they number coming
They dreamin about getting rich driving in they hummer dummin
Old ladies keep they purse in the front
Cuz them fiends on the prowl its the first of the month
And you still feel good when you there yup
And you know you in the hood when you there
They got one in every spot on the planet
And if you wasnt raised there you prolly cannot stand it
Some call it the hood Im calling it home
And theres love feel it all in my poemwhat they got


H dot O dot O dot D
Should I turn my back on the hood No not me
Whether PR DR or the West Indies
Or fifty other spots that are just like these
Chicago know what I mean Philly as well
Shit I hear nowadays sounds silly as hell
Whether in Miami or in Houston Texas
Where some so broke theyre not used to breakfast
Oakland know what I mean LA too
DC feel me I can tell they do
When will it change Never I know
And I see the same things wherever I go
beat stops
They got broke people poor people my people your people
