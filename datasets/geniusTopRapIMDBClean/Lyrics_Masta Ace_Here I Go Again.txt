Here I go  Uh huh  A  Yeah  Gain  Here we go   Here we go 
Yo This track really reminds me
Of when I got my deal in 1990
Moms wasnt behind me didnt take too kindly
I had to find me so I came in blindly
Got a contract to buy me
Ted got the demo hade Mercury sign me
Hip Hop became a part of
I Got To Have It BugABoo Be A Father
See I went for mine next album Roxbury 02119
Yeah It didnt sell as well
People started sayin they could tell I fell
Third album was comin out sloppy
All of a sudden Mercury dropped me
It felt like my world ended
Until I found the blessings of independence
Life could bust your bubble
Its a everyday grind and a constant struggle
Bam I got hit with the target
With Masta Ace a new project here I go
DJ Scratching 
Here I go again  Here we go 
Been on a road to success from the very beginning
Saw everyone around me was steadily winnin
I was in the drivers seat but I lost control
Now its time to take a shit or get up off the bowl
I mean the mortage due tuition from my daughters school
Gotta be in before August 2
I still wanna fight but it dont seem right
Its like why wage ya battle when the war is through
I know where Im goin but that place is far
Kinda feel like the dog tryna chase the car
No matter how fast I run Ill never catch it
And that reality I gotta face tommorow
Most times I feel like What is the use
I got a good mind I should put it to use
My transit score was the open proof
But I dont wanna be the man in the token booth
Or the man sayin Watch the closing doors
And give up his live full of shows and tours
I know a lotta niggas sellin real estate
But if I did then I wouldnt really feel as great
This time truly Im torn
Cause my wife want that brand new Louis Vutton
And I just got a call to do anohter show
Damn once again here I go

  DJ Scratching 
Here I go again  Here we go 
Ive been doin this since I was a little girl
This music thing its like my whole world
Its what I love fo sure
But its so damn hard to kick down them doors
But I HUSTLE Cause I want it gotta STRUGGLE if you want it
Cause cant nobody keep my man down
My passion gonna keep me around
Ridin tourin studio anything to keep my mind flow so
Here I go  HEEREEE  again  Here I go 
Heey yeaah
Here we gooooowooo
Gotta keep fightiiin cause we grindiiiin
And like diamooonds keep it shinin
