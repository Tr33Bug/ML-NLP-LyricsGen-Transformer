Awww yeah
Uh  Uhhuh 
Uh  Uhhuh 
Uh  Uhhuh 
One two
Microphone checka one two
Microphone checka one two
Microphone checka one two
Tell em what Im gonna do
On and on and on is how the beat goes
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros
And dance til the feeling is gone in your toes
I wear shorts in the summer Timberlands when it snows
Sometimes I like to chill sometimes I like to mingle
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single
Sexy young slimmy but not too young though
Thats because Jimmy might end up on death row
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song
Its not too short but then again its not too long
I brought somebody with me someone you might know
Hes bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe
All the way up to your last hair follicle
Hey hey hey its me the diabolical
Yes yall and its time for me to fall in
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and like
Jump make you move your rump on the floor and like pump
Cmon dont be a chump I see four and maybe five
Live party people but the rest did not survive
Why 
They had a cardiac arrest
Now rocking microphones is something I do daily and
Making people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey and
People just love it when the Biz starts to play
With my  and by the way
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky
And Im the sneaky type to like slip a girl a mickey
And I live the type of life thats far from affordable
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable
Me and master ace is funky  word to miz 
Yo who is it Ace  its me and the Biz 
Its me and the Biz  repeat 4x 
Yo Ace I got an um question
Excuse me brother but can you spare a dime
Naw but if you want I can kick a funky rhyme
All I need is a groove thats as smooth like a harp and
Im ready to talk nough shit like Al Sharpton
I take the stage and engage in a page and
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age
Yo Im the BIZM and like a lot of women
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon
Gucci Louis Fendi Me and sexy Cindy
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and
They know its me because Im the BIZ
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife
And get a regular job where Im working 9 to 5
Shit Im the Biz and its great to be alive
Im making crazy hits a winner never quits
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table
Cause Im able to rock a crowd without a cable
Or a Cuban link and  yo Lincoln wasnt Cuban 
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin
MASTER and this aint store bought hiphop from a jar and
It sure aint Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the wiz 
Its me and the Biz
Im a 100 proof and rag on the roof and
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth and
Wilding styling this land is my land
youre a  prisoner to my music like you was on Rikers Island
A slim softspoken brother from the ghetto
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know
You run your rhymes like a horse and force and
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like youre the boss and
I think youd better keep them to yourself
Do it for yourself put your lyrics back up on the shelf
Now Im going to pass it to the BIZ MARKIE
Cause I know you want to see him
Ah one two one two this is what Im gonna do
Keep the place jumping get it wild like a zoo
If anyone can do it the BIZ can
Peace to Marley Marl Tragedy and MC Shan
And my cousin Cool V and TJ Swan E and
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and
EPMD and Nice and Smooth B and
MC Craig G and Just ICE and
The list goes on and on and on and on
I go to Dapper Dan or Benetton
Hey hey I got some shoutouts I know you all bought my new album

Everybody in Jersey bought it
Everybody in Uptown bought it
Everybody in Philadelphia and California and Florida bought my new album
