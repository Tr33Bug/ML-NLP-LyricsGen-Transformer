And we dont want no trouble we just came to hang
Maybe sip a little something and shoot the breeze
Some of us high on life others use the trees
No bloods no Crips no guns no clips
Just a bunch of fellas running off at the lips
Cause hanging with your friends be the thing to do
Let me see if I can explain my gang to you
Now first we got Eone of them crazy brothers
Got ten kids by ten different baby mothers
And another on the way did you get that cousin
Hope he get that snip snip fore he get that dozen
Then we got Lionel who drives a cab
And every female customer he tries to bag
He dun had a couple sessions on them vinyl seats
You wont believe some of the freaks that Lionel meets
Then we got E L who drives a TL Acura

You can tell from his appearance he aint missed a meal
See he once had a tryout as a New York Jet
But he spent his little cheque and bought a new Corvette
And then theres Brad hes a college grad
Book smarts are great street knowledge bad
He had a 4 point oh in a four year span
But he stayed getting scammed by the bootleg man
And thats Bud perfect name indeed
Cause he really loves beer its the same with weed
And he likes that nutrition that packs a punch
For breakfast two blunts a six pack for lunch
Opposite of him is Malik Jamal
Who dont eat smoke drink or eat meat at all
He be preaching every night about eating right
While he sip a cup of coffee puff a newport light
