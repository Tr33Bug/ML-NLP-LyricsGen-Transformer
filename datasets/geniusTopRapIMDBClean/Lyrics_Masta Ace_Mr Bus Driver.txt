Take me home a long way
Aint no rush to get there
I got time to go and
Make you see the cold world
Dont no ever go now
Im just glad to be here
Can I come along
Tell me can I fly with you
Looking out the window its the world
Keep passin me by like a Pharcyde song
See this little boy and little girl
Moms screaming at em as the cars ride on
She take off her shoe and you know what she do
She swings as the girl and the boy cries on
I look at this man and he looking at me
We thinking to eachother oh my God thats wrong
But we dont get involved cause nothing getting solved
Its plain to see that that lady gotta have it
Six months pregnant with a third
Whatevers in her blood man that babys gonna have it
Dreams unattainable so let me explain to you
Its insane and its so painful when in plain view
Close my eyes trying to avoid the pain too
I knock out and inner shout i came to
Now we on a different block different area
Little leerier and the projects is scarier
Uh unless you come from this part of town
With the people the paper bags and the water brown
Lotta dudes they do lose when they brought around
Its so steep and so deep and you sure to drown
Man do you get where Im going
Cause Im just try to get where Im going Mr Bus Driver
Mr Bus Driver
Doesnt know a thing of my life
But I know yours well
Holding this line up
Got enough change in my pocket to get around
Wheels keep turning
You stop and you go but you wont slow down
I dont wanna know where Im going now
Wheels keep turning
Mr Bus Driver
Doesnt know the passenger lost on your route
Making my mind up
One day Ill have enough change to see the whole town
Red light green light
You stop and you go but you wont slow down
All I ask of you is you hold it down
Mr Bus Driver I gotta ask you
One question not tryin to harass you
Can you please get my nana home safe
Cause shes posed to bring home dinner from White Castle
And it gets dark early in the fall
Wonder if she ran into Shirley at the mall
They got a ride home because the bus be running late
Wait why am I worrying at all
The 12 bus the 14 the 25
The 38 carry your things and many lives
Many guys street mobs with plenty ties
Sometimes can turn these to shitty rides
Its the New York city vibes
Mass transit that fish in a can shit
Yeah another homeless man lit
Cross town or Downtown the plan trip
You can get more than what you planned for
Im holding on even though that my hands sore
Im well aware what it means when a fella stare
I stay ready for whatever thats for damn sure
I guess my confidence is growing
Or the fact that I lack it isnt showing
I dont know if you get where Im going
But Im just try to get where Im going Mr Bus Driver
Mr Bus Driver
Doesnt know a thing of my life
But I know yours well
Holding this line up
Got enough change in my pocket to get around
Wheels keep turning
You stop and you go but you wont slow down
I dont wanna know where Im going now
Mr Bus Driver
Doesnt know the passenger lost on your route
Making my mind up
One day Ill have enough change to see the whole town
Red light green light
You stop and you go but you wont slow down
All I ask of you is you hold it down
Take me home a long way
Aint no rush to get there
Can I come along
Tell me can I fly with you
