I was raised to the sound of the 70s
Earth wind and fire sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklins picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit all white
Minnie Riperton high notes all night
Moms even had a box full of 45s
Put the needle down yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back yea Imma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack
Hide records
In the bag
Sneak them out before she notice that they gone
Gotta think
I dont know
Should I rap of my moms favorite song
Better hope I dont scratch it or thats it
Imma get my ass kicked thats a classic
Cant explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin like a castaway
Hiding in grandmoms room more than half the day
If I told her that her Parliament at brian crib
And nobody home now Imma be a crying kid
But its seeming like Im safe for the time being
My uncle gettin all the blame far as Im seeing
I just gotta lay low like a snake belly
Its a sticky situation like grape jelly
Im on the titanic or some other boat
Got my mother and her brother at each others throat
You better hope mommy never find out
Cause if she does then thats your ass
You know damn well if you touch one
And you get caught thatll be your ass
NinteenSeventy Something
And the year is
Ninteenseventy Something
The final act Brians at the door
With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said close call I said yea I know this is
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
Shed a found out its me she would of laid to rest
But Im over like a fat rat
That was smart its a good thing you hid em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now Im out the door back out to play
Im about to say these are the good time like Chic
And then I hear my mom shriek
Duval
Get back in here  uhoh 
How did my record get scratched
I know you did it
Go get my belt
Cmon ma
Thats it get my belt now
Cmon ma
