Uhh Beatnuts Masta Ace
Gettin cash to trash the place
Take a blast cmon uh
Oh my God
Yall rap dudes are funny I dont feud with dummies
I dont need no problems I need food and money
I recall when we used to fool with honeys
That was cute as bunnies with the smoothest tummies
Now we like Brinks tryin to move this money
Run with cast to Akman rude and crummy
Its the chairman of the board and Im carryin a sword
I look heavy in a Chevy and Im scary in a Ford
F150 you should just run swiftly
Unless you nice you like it you can just come get me
Yall dudes sweet like cakes and pies
I go together with rap like shakes and fries
And I hate them guys with hate in their eyes
Hopin we fall cant wait to rise
Yeah Im all natural like a case of Snapple
And dont talk shit cause the Acell slap you
And dont try to run cause Ill chase and catch you
Put a sharp blade to your face and scratch you  ouch 
Whatchu wan fuck with a ninja for
Im like a cornered rat with a injured paw
And Ill bend your jaw and end your tour
Even if I lose the battle Imma win the war yeah
Oh my God
When Beatnuts and Masta Ace both up in the place
Its like  Oh my God
When you cant find your girl your girl probably up in our face
She like  Oh my God
Its mad ways to do it my man and we doin it hard
We like  Ohoh oh ohoh oh oh my my my God
I dont mix weed with yay
Lets take it to the streets nigga lead the way
Imma watch you bleed your way into emergency
Youre gonna need surgery
A facelift face it Psych is whylin
Like them niggas on Rikers Island
Stab you with a spoon in the lunchroom
Have you hallucinatin Oh my God like you on mushroom
Head twitchin like an epileptic
Youll get dropped  like what  like elephant shit
Im from the home of the Yankees
You not feelin that then yank these Im sittin on twankies
You goin nowhere fast like a treadmill
Dont make me have to roll up to your crib and meet your parents
Like Ben Still  youll get killed
For tryin to be a funny ass  like who  like Ben Hill  ha ha 
I dont wanna have to run up in your label
And put a hole in ya head like a bagel  blaow 
From here to Milwaukee
I do it for the kids like Bill Cosby  hey hey hey 
Its Big Ju the family favorite
You should just place the name on your forehead and staple it
Im here yall I finally made it
Then I can be really cool to talk to when Im medicated
One of the games most underrated
Im makin a hit then everybody wanna recreate it
Every due that come through I paid it
So now if you bite this Im leavin you decapitated
Came to show you niggas I got soul
Me and the music man together bust out of control
Its a feelin thats hard to hold
Look even if you pregnant it makes you wanna work that pole
Now tell me yall whats really good
Cause everything Im hearin on the radio is hillbilly hood
Its evident that I clearly should
Put a fuckin foot up your ass to make the shit understood
Whats the matter trailer cant you take a little heat
