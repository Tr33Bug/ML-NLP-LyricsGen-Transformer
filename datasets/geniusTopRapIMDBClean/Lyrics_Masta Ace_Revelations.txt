At times I dont know who I be
And when I look in the mirror its like I dont know who I see
Am I even moving at all
Cause I swear I cant tell if my life is improving at all
Every time I got a pen in my hand
I forget every time before that one has been in my hand
And I write for the moment get it tight how I want it
Get the right lawyer on it cuz I might wanna own it
I tussle and I fight I hustle and I write
I struggle every night with every muscle in my mic
Im in this rap race trying to eat the cheese
But yall dont know my name like Alicia Keys
My face aint familiar neither is my music
If shit dont soon change I be the one to lose it
I drink a little liquor tryin to heal my nerves
Cause yall dont listen here and feel my words
But somethings wrong with yall aint nuttin wrong with me
And happy in my life is what I long to be
And happy in my life is what Im gonna be
What you see in me is what I was born to be
From the day that my moms first birthed a child
She didnt need the world to make it worth the while
So I dont need no magazine to reach the pinnacle
Screw a review and you can eat the interview
Cause thats what yall seem to tend to do
Them cats you cover all seem identical
Through it all I weave like the Parkers Hair
And shine underground cause its darkest there
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Yall industry niggas should be feeling ashamed
Yall like he aint still in the game we stealing the name
Oh wait just a sec thats straight disrespect
If you take shit and get and dont be late with the check
Im on the underground trying to scrape and scrounge
And sure it feel good to take a break and lounge
All these ups and downs like a roller coaster
Life is a bitch Im trying to hold her closer
Im killin every nigga in sight
The bigger the dog the bigger the fight
If you really say you know me then youd figured I might
Try to use my anger as a trigger to write
I put it down simple on the paper or pad
Try to take a stab at what is making me mad
I jump on the track and I ride it through
And do it for the people that are tried and true
But yall so fickle yall love me today
And tomorrow love another cat and shove me away
But most aint committed to do it how I did it
In the way that I did it in the way that I spit it
Its like my burst of truth and it might hurt the booth
But first the proof it gave birth to youth
Raps like trying to take a piss in the wind
Im just glad to know that some of yall are listenin in


Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
Try and listen
Keep movin along keep bringin it on and keep singin the song
