Party animal back at the tele now
Katie and her best friend turn up the celly now
Friend got big boobs Katie got thick thighs
Put em both together and what I nice chick prize
Looking in some sick eyes light green I seen
Katie ass busting out the scenes with them tight jeans
Damn katie whoa damn you lookin god yep 
Alchohol flowing now bout to get stinkfaced
Katie says Here Ace tell me how this drink taste
Not bad whats this sex on the beach yo
Friend pulls out her boobs thats what I reach for
Now Im in the party mood take a few more swigs
Clothes start coming off Im about to score big
Katie start kissin and feelin on her girlfriend
Thats when the room starts spinnin like a whirlwind
Feeling like Imma hurl then I fall face down
Not cool dude Im nude from the waist down
Look up drooling I feel like an asshole
Katie got my wallet in her hand as my cash flow
Cant move a muscle now somebody save me
This shit crazy wonder what they gave me
Slow down
Dont think it really cant down
It happens everyday
Its a dirty game are you sure you wanna play
Finally got your money up you sure you wanna pay
Slow down
Dont think it really cant down
It happens everyday
Wake up at the hospital guess I just came too
First I see Mr C then I see Kane too
Then I see Jay C Scoob Lover Scrap and
All of them looking like Ace what happened
Usually my mind be sharp as a thumb tack
Maybe if I take a minute everything will come back
I dont even know what wait 
I know
I was with these two chicks sippin on a few licks
Everything was humming right along like a new six
Next thing I know I was laying on the floor
And it feel like they hit me in the head with a few bricks
Then the room just really start to spin bad
Then I knew this night was gon end bad
When they found all the money in my gym bag
Thats when I realize that I been had
They took the cash then both of them dashed out
After that not sure mustve passed out
God damn how stupid could I be
Nurse whats that you putting in my IV
Dont worry its gonna help you rest dear
See her lips moving but her voice sounds less clear
The moral of the tale
Dont trust a cute face and a thin waist
Cause they all go to jail
Rappers go on tour and many gonna score with a whore
Thats for sure but theres more gon fail
Think with your dicks then add liquor to the mix
You can end up in the morge on the scale
These girls ruthless worst then the guys be
Act like they want your puddin pop Bill Cosby
Waiting in the lobby with a little slick plan
Get up to the room and try to make a quick grand
Or maybe six grand if you leave your chains out
Her main thing is to bang your brains out
When you exhausted laying with your clothes off
She gon wait till your stupid ass dose off
