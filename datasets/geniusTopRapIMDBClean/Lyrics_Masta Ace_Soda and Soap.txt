I met this girl named Fantasy on wall street
From Tahiti real Tahitian treat
She had a lot of pep see honey was peace
And she told me she liked my smile like Shanice
She danced at this club and made the guys holler
And in a minute made like a thousand dollars
The club that was run by Mr Schweppes he had a rep
And everybody watched they step
Cause word on the street was he was no joke
Had everything from crack marijuana to coke
Later at the club saw this guy named Wayne
Who always bettin money on the Giants game
As soon as its on yo I stayed away
Cause he the type who welches a bet and wont pay
I keep tryin to tell him be a straight stepper
Somebody gonna slice him and send him to Dr Pepper
Went to the bar checked the score
Got the bartender told him what to pour
He put it on my tab as he filled my cup
And told me the game was tied seven up
Around 12 oclock she came out to dance
Had all the guys pushing just to have a chance
To spend a little money trying to see the rest
She was blessed in an orange crushed velvet dress
But I stayed by the bar cause I already know how it go
I already saw the show
See I went to a club like this in Toronto
And came back from Canada dry with no dough
And ever since then I see and see clear
You never find love in this atmosphere
Sometimes you gotta find a better place to be in
Maybe go to a mountain do a little skiing
So I finished up my drink and I said goodbye
And got home before the sun kissed the sky
No matter where you from or which way you leaning
Now goin pop got a whole new meaning
Dont you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it aint Nelly but its hot in here we got it locked in here
Wont stop  you know  come and drink in numbers like h2o
Soon you gonna hear us everyplace you go
Bubble like the soda kinda like the soap
I just hope you know it dont stop
The Y2K is a brand new era
Im tryin to make hits like Yogi Berra
I wonder how long Ill be in this biz
Cause its not all cheer like you think it is
Theres a whole lot to gain but a lot to lose
Just ask any rapper who paid dues
Everybody now and then bound to struggle
I just grab my wife and we lay and snuggle
We talk about the ivory coast how one day
We gonna sail on the tide and get whisked away
Look up at the stars til the crack of dawn
Hold up I never leave your side for long
But for now I keep on making you bounce
And make sure something in my checking accounts
Grab my cell phone and then start to dial
Take a look at my life and start to smile
Its funny how the game make you change your tone
Cause the joy of my life is the microphone
So I straighten up my act and keep doin my thing
Gettin the green nah mean getting it clean
Dont you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it aint Nelly but its Hot In Here we got it locked in here
Wont stop  you know  come and drink in numbers like h2o
Soon you gonna hear us everyplace you go
Bubble like the soda kinda like the soap
I just hope you know it dont stop
