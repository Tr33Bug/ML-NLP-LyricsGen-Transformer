Yeah big Strick lets get it on
Yo last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope Im sorry its that you said something dope
Fuck it it dont matter cause I know shit aint really like that
Cause if you said something dope I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an Im on the right track
I hit the cypher and you bounce talkin bout Strick Ill be right back
What the fuck you comin back for
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Mad cause I stack more than what the Lakers sign Shaq for
Incredible rhymer what the hell Imma sell crack for
Im real you a actor Im hot you just not a factor
You on some bout to do Im on some already done shit
Ill burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit
And I done came wit the style you probably bout to come wit
You the opposite of smart feces get it dumb shit
Could give a fuck who you run wit
Or them niggas you bout to go get
Matter of fact go get em youll just be layin on the floor wit em
Lookin up at me talkin bout Why you let the fofo hit em
I really dont know these niggas I just did a show wit em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit em
Met em at the studio an just spit a couple of flows wit em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit em
Oh yeah thats good to know now you bout to die wit em
Head straight to the pearly gate say hi to the big guy wit em
Or take it to that other level down with the devil and fry wit em
Grumble and groan piss and moan boohoo and cry wit em
At least go home and tell his momma bye bye wit em  bye momma 
Cause duke Im the hottest nigga on earth right now
Aint bust my gun in nine months bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothings what your life is worth right now
Ive been in shit for too long its about time I burst
A  Rs ready to quit cause they aint find me first
Record labels ready to shut down cause they aint sign me first
But let me stop right now cause I know yall niggas be dying to rewind my verse
If yall dont know how we gets it on
From twelve  midnight to the cracks o dawn
Got girls in the back takin off they thongs
Then feelin that somethings wrong
If yall dont know how we gets it on
From twelve am to the early morn
If you sitting on things then blow ya horn
Cause if ya not theres something wrong  Word is bond 
I came outta rap training camp as the reigning champ
An lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I wont stop til I see my face and my name on a stamp
And yall still wont be able to stick me or fuck wit me
Im bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly you just missed me
Fuck Alice Ralph Ed Norton and fuck Trixie
Imma fuck like its my honeymoon til I touch sixty
You aint a thug so dont try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me youll get snuffed quickly
Deep down hate Bobby Brown but love Whitney
At times I wish I was OJ and the glove fit me
Then I wouldnt have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talkin bout how your crews rich and you stack figures
In my hands a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shits big but I packs bigger
Just ask your wife cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life
Yous a pussy I can tell by your song
Homothug rapper I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank you probably shit syrup
The worlds about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back home for my birthday
Imma do another video too explicit to play
If yall dont know how we gets it on
From twelve  midnight to the cracks o dawn
Got girls in the back takin off they thongs
Then feelin that somethings wrong
If yall dont know how we gets it on
From twelve am to the early morn
If you sitting on things then blow ya horn
Cause if ya not theres something wrong  Word is bond 
Ace Zee yo Strick Bricks Zee Outsidaz yeah yeah yeah yeah
Niggas fear me like the fear of AIDS
I take out pretty boys wearin shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braids  punk 
Then fuck yo girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars you probably aint been in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justins while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared of jail but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin bottles of rock
An so much dope came we remodeled the spot
Thats why all cat spendin tens we beat them
See you grinnin when I stop and the rims keep spinnin
Fuck with Zee Ill bash ya face
Ill fucks wit scratches Masta Ace bitch
