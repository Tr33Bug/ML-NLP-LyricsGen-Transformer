Ayo this shit Prime Time like Deion
My clique be on that shit shining like neon
Hardcore like freon but we on
The hottest shit you ever heard nigga thats word nigga
The whole word Ima pee on so put me on
So I can go to Egypt see the Spinx like Leon
Come back to the states send a 100 G on
The SClass with the Playstation TV on
Play me that hot shit and I get live on it
My crew be looney like them niggas that Got 5 On It
Street buzz like it got a bee hive on it
Your girl want it
She gon get it if she flaunt it
Scared of the dick as if the shits haunted
Who want it Fuck around and youll get cornered
Youre worthless like ten carats when you pawn it
Park shit in valet Brooklyn to Cali MA
Ayo ayo when Im on the mic I splash
Uh huh uh huh yo I got that shit that splash
Alright alright when we in the club we splash
Ayo ayo everybody know I splash
Yo these rappers think they stepped it up like stairs
Cause they bought some new wears but really who cares
Half these cats is fruit like two pears and one apple
And I dont think they want no hassle
Look I just bought a new castle
Where I hang like a tassel looking for some girls to wrestle
Got spice like Dijon my legion from the Brooklyn region
Ima preach on
And baby if you ninteen like Keyshawn
Ima go deep on it so dont sleep on it
If you got my pager number put a beep on it
But dont forget your code though on the low though
Niggas rock Rolex watches with no doe
Living in the PJs with they DJs
Your whole album is nothing but cliches
Why you wanna say what another MC says huh
Ayo ayo when Im on the mic I splash
Uh huh uh huh yo I got that shit that splash
Alright alright when we in the club we splash
Ayo ayo everybody know I splash
Check it out
A lot of records sold ten years a lot of gold
A lot of shows a whole lot of groupies a lot of hoes
A lot of cars a lot of wild nights at a lot of bars
Met a lot of fans and met a lot of socalled stars
Mad music if you can name it Ive been through it
Name a club any big city Ive been to it
I probably did a show at it dropped a flow at it
Made a lot of doe at it met a ho at it
In ninefive sat on chrome and still sitting
In twothou still MA and still hitting
Still shitting still got styles that still bitten
Aint nothing changed really this rap game is silly
Rocking the cream Timbs in a green Benz with clean rims
Running with three of your mean friends
Hoping that your team wins
But thats when your dream ends
Soon as I come out I make em dumb out
Ayo ayo when Im on the mic I splash
Uh huh uh huh yo I got that shit that splash
Alright alright when we in the club we splash
Ayo ayo everybody know I splash
