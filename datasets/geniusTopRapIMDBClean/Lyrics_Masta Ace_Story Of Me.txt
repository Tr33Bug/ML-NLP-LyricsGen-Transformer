Still here
Somehow
Man it took me 15 years to understand my worth
It was 1988 when Marley planned my birth
Had to get my feet up out of the sand and surf
Never thought that my rap lines would span the earth
But they did went to every corner of the globe
Its time to reveal since yall really wanna probe
I went from Brownsville kid gone to Kings County
To Queenstown sitting in a sauna in a robe
And since then never took a day off from the pen
I understood hard work would pay off in the end
Yeah for as long as my body is strong
Imma give it all I got try to body a song
Imma give it all I got try to rip that show
And yo understand I got to get that dough
And so cause I know how to spit that flow
Sold out three nights in a row like TicTacToe
In the fast lane kick back slow no need to rush
We royalty bow down at the feet of us
The anticipation its like
Standing on the corner in the cold and you can see the bus
Its finally here our arrival
Raised in the ghetto singing songs called survival
We stand united by the beat man
Tight plan right hand on the Bible
Try to let you know
Just want to let you see
The real is all I know
Real is what I be
Time is now for yall
Now is now for me
Life is beautiful
This the story of me
Just try to make history
Gotta make history  history 
Aint no mystery
Gotta make history  history 
Know my history
Gotta make history  history 
Cant shake destiny
Just gotta make history yeah yeah yeah
I almost had the nineties by the throat
I was just that close to getting money by the boatload
Instead of hoping what I wrote flowed
I could have said Whoop there it is
But it would have felt so wrong to do that song
Try to prove I belong in a crew that strong
Listen understand this is preordain
This is written by God then we all came
Could have signed with Def Jam but Lyor changed
Changed his mind at the strangest time
He was still destined to sign a dangerous mind
Another cat with the grind the same as mine
Another son born on the fourth would come
He was of course the one with that course to run
And like a ham sandwich on the softest bun
I refuse to eat it I will not be defeated
Here to stay and get a lot completed
This what I got to offer what I got is needed
Confident but Im not conceited and I swear
The same mistakes I made will not be repeated
I choose to keep paying up dues
Life try to beat me up like scuffed shoes
It was hard doctor called me off guard
Same place I was born got the rough news


We rise we fall and pray
For better days
Why shoot we for the stars
And prayed for better aim
The world the pain remained
It never change
Long as the sun will show
The cold is still the same
Just try to make history
Gotta make history
Aint no mystery
Gotta make history  history 
Know my history
Gotta make history  history 
Cant shake destiny
Just gotta make history yeah yeah yeah
We rise we fall and pray
For better days
Why shoot we for the stars
And prayed for better aim
The world the pain remained
It never change
Long as the sun will show
The cold is still the same
Just try to make history
Gotta make history  history 
Aint no mystery
Gotta make history  history 
Know my history
Gotta make history  history 
Cant shake destiny
Just gotta make history yeah yeah yeah
The story of me never would have knew me without it
And they wont make a movie about it
I mean I guess they could but truly I doubt it
Mad friends watching Ralph McDaniels knew me and shout it
Oh snap thats Duval he live in my building
Life in the PJs living and building
Whether you in Seflo or living in Tilden
Trying to escape men women and children
A product of the same and when I got into the game
Initially my moms was really shocked and ashamed
She was like Boy you got a Bachelors
And I was like Why they call it a bs
Bullshit walks as far is what I was taught
Yet I aint had one job interview and she stressed
The story of me born from the story of us
Studio bound the story of us
My Hondas in the shop no warranty
I need a new regulator no Warren G
But Imma get by do or die
And then I left URI
I looked around and then came the yellow tape
I decided to sit on chrome and accelerate
And after that I knew they wanted me gone and singing a
Swan song but I decided to let em wait
