Lets take a walk through the deepest part of the hood
I wanna know who it was that said it was all good
He musta never been to the corner
And spent the half an hour or longer
Where you could smell reality stronger
Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if youre old enough to walk to the store you can buy liquor
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time theres a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky and the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game cause they learned to take aim
At a young age and elude police with a fake name
Hes tellin em Im Bobby Jackson from 3B
When the fact is hes really Rashawn from 4D

And ya might see your neighbor down at the corner bodega
Buyin a malt liquor in exchange for a used Sega
You can even buy your clothes on the block imagine that
From Versace to a Coogi sweater wit a matchin hat

Its the same old routine but it never gets old
And ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block

But the driver got a bigger one up under the seat
