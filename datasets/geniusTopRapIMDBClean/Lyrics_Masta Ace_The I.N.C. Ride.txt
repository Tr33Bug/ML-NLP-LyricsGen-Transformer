The INC Ride LyricsChorus
Its the ride yall come on were goin on a ride
Its the ride yall come on I know you wanna ride
Its the ride yall come on were goin on a ride
Its the ride ylla its the INC Ride
Verse One
R to the I D to the E check out how we the INC
Get more Biz than Markie as I spark the
Mic like lightning thats frightening Im hyping
Niggas up cuz they dont know the score
Ooooh here comes the roar knock on your door
I wonder who it is and who could it be
Aint nobody but the INC
Wit mo Soul than the Train Im a reign
With 808 beats that hit big like Kane
Daddy caddy Coup DeVille chill
Jump in my ride and slide down the hill
To see if we catch dem kids talking that was talkin that mess
And tryin to impress never the less yo
I gotta let em know they cant find us so get behind us
Cause we cruise in the INC Ride
Chorus
Incorpate the INC into a flow   4X
From the East side to the West side
From the North side to the South side
From the East side to the West side
From the North side to the South side
Verse Two
Aint nobody but the A  okay 
And Im not the one you wanna play  dont play 
Im flat like a cap on a can of flat black
Let me snap back break a nigee down with my rap
Cause this is how we do
Who is the crew coming through with the brand new
As we flex and get fly you cry
The roof is on fire but my name aint Left Eye
Punks be all up on it like a Charlotte Hornet
But they full of Chicago Bullshit cuz they dont want it
Ooooh dont let me sing Im peaking
Im freakin get in that ass like a GString
And that you dont need
Well be blowin up like that movie Speed indeed youre on a ride
Chorus
Incorpate the INC into a flow   4X
From the East side to the West side
From the North side to the South side
From the East side to the West side
From the North side to the South side
Youre in a Lexus or Blazer
Youre in a Beamer or a Benz
Youre in a Corvette or a Nissan
Youre in a Sidekick wit your friends
Youre in a Caddy a Landcruiser
A Range Rover a Mustang
Youre in a Burban with ten woofers
Then your system it must bang
From the East to the West
From the North to the South
From the East to the West
From the North to the South
From the East to the West
From the North to the South
From the East to the West
From the North to the South
The INC Ride
