So you want to be in music business
Listen
A life in raps like a knife in the back
This life attracts some of the trifest cats
Niggas getting deals with pipes and bats
If that dont work then they strike with gats
I know a few dudes got label deals
Cause they crew pack steel like Navy SEALS
And I aint too smooth or too cool to mention
I done ran up in the label with cruel intentions
Listen a label guys like a bitch in disguise
He just trying to stay alive see the twitch in his eyes
A punch and a slap put his lunch in his lap
And a kick to the gutll put a hunch in his back
No teeth and gummy and now he talk funny
But he set to sign off on that tour support money  thats right 
This nations built on violent intimidations
Turn cats to hospital patients they more gracious
No promotion Make em float in the ocean
Your album about to flop and he aint showing emotion
He having a good time with a bunch of his friends
Let him find his dog dead in the trunk of his Benz
And he ignored your memo and the issues on it
Give his ass a bullet with his initials on it
You want a big advance Dont tell him twice
Hang his ass out the window like Vanilla Ice
See cats get the message when they life on the line
But when you call from the crib with they wife on the line
This country of ours was built on violence
If your ass got in the way you was killed in silence
And these been the ways since back in the days
Just ask the Indians or the African slaves
So before you pick a logo and choose a name
First you gotta learn the ways of the music game
Yup
I need to talk to you right now about my royalties
My office hours are from 9 to 5
Fuck your office hours I need to talk to you right now motherfucker
What are you doing man
These are the ways the ways the ways the ways
This is how you got to get down these days
You want to get paid just remember the phrase
These are the ways the ways the ways the ways
The ways scratched repeatedly 
These are the ways the ways the ways the ways
Now if you think what Im saying is a bunch of bull
Run up to the label now and punch a fool
And watch niggas panic and start to run frantic
This goes for Warner Electra and Atlantic
And any other major on the map
Or AR cat who turned his back after he made you want to rap
See if you can find out a face and name
So you know when you roll who to place the blame
But Keith Murray aint need investigators
He fuck niggas up ask questions later
And Diddy had a problem with Stevie Stout
Got a Cristal bottle knocked Stevie out
Damn he even whip a nigga ass in style
When Suge hears this record man he has to smile
And Def Jam reps wearing vests to work
Cause they dont want they ribs and they chests to hurt
If I worked for them dudes man you wont see me
When Rocafella fall out with ODB  nope 
That be a day that Im a call out sick
Cause niggas cool first then they fall out quick  thats right 
Keep on thinking that its only rap
Youll be a brokeass nigga and a lonely cat
So before you get played out and lose your fame
First you got to learn the ways of the music game
Yes

What the hell you talking about
Im talking about the cars and the clothes
And I got an even longer list of expenses
Studio time promotions your expense account
You trying to muscle me
