Who you think I am
Check check yeah
Look fam you could be the man
Got young chicks moving mad grams on Peter Pan
Im not blind I can see the scam
You talk tough but yall a bunch of girls like the Cheetah band
Im a leader and you a follower
Your goal hollow and your ho was a swallower
She put it down like a report
But her box smell like South Street Seaport
What a odor black in fact
When I got her in the sack jack boy I couldnt hold her back
Cause her bottom is thick like a hippopotamus
Tramp stamp on her lower back
See I know the facts the hoe filled me in
Her best friend is a twin named Lillian
Im going really in Im really going in
Foul I bust on that towel that you throwing in
Who you think I am
Who you think I am
I tried to holler outside when she was getting out her ride
Guess she must got that parking lot Alzheimers
Cause now find us cozy at the bar
Guess at that point she aint know she had a star
I cant explain what mightve got into her
Cause now your conversation got friendlier
Seen me and ran with your devious plan
And thinking you gon drink all them premium brands
Its different when you aint got to hear no price
Cause you was just Nurse Jackie with that Smirnoff Ice
Yeah I caught that you and that short cat
Even saw the brushoff after he bought that
What the fuck he aint make your drink quota
And as for tricking them days been over
Jedi mind tricks wont work if you bring Yoda
Envisioning champagne Well shit think soda
Who you think I am
Who you think I am
Big up Ace Im glad I had a chance to flow with him
Just last summer me and my mans did a show with him
In Montreux hit the stage Im like Go get em
Even had the soulless folks rocking with no rhythm
Marco Polo was on the wheels and on point
They did Jeep Ass Niguh Im like Thats the joint
Some old school heads remember who was who
Brooklyn was in the house even the newbies knew
Before the Masta left the stage from doing the do
Blew off the roof with a tribute to Guru
First time I met the brother felt like I knew him forever
Too clever album dedicated to his mother
I thought of mine at the same time we growing up
I know they proud of they baby boys we blowing up
Only got one wont ever forget her
Make sure you let her know you love her when you with her kiss her
Who you think I am
Who you think I am
Who you think I am
Who you think I am
