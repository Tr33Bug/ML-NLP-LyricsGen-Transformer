Man I was starting to think I wasnt never getting out of here
But umm Imma do things different this time believe me
I aint never trying to come back here again
Aight thats what they all say
Youll be back they always come back
Well save a cell for you too
Crazy fuck that you aint gon never see my ass again
Mark my words this time Im staying out
Yall waited too long for this  x4 
Aiyyo its been a long time just like sweet revenge
Never thought that Id be seen on these streets again
Its been five years at least waiting for a peace
Bouncing off of these walls awaiting my release
Pacing like a caged lion with rage crying
All them days trying to engage with the iron
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place
I got down on my knees looked into Gods face
Its really not the same is it With low digits
And yall aint hold me down aint paid me no visits
New cats claiming shit just like they bought stock
And yall let em move in and take over the block
I heard yall be out there spending dubs with em
Out all night long going to clubs with em
I guess thats what I get for having a kind heart
Todays when they life end and mine starts
Sometimes waking up is even kinda scary
Some foul deeds I find necessary
Like the Christ and the Judas theory
I feel the hurt and scream loud but nobody hears me
My broken body bleeds heavy plus my mind is weary
Slipped the Mickey when they first gave me sex
Addicted to the trees Henneseys and cigarettes
Inhaling the toxic gases when I breath
Study words of higher deity cause him I believe
I dont pray on my knees
Just in case the evils comes like Ds
Ill be ready to blast and make him bleed
In high doubledigits I go back to the essence
Leave my rhymes behind so you can use em for lessons
Like a new Revelations chapter
You aint moving slow its just that in my mind Im moving faster
Sick messiah like Im David Koresh
You done picked the wrong nigga to test
Now pick  the tre pound or the tech
Yall waited too long for this  x5 
Gun shots
