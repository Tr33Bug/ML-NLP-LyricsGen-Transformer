At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 1 reasons youll never be this raw
My crew is representing for BK dont play
Or you might have to get Crime Watch around your way
Cause Brooklyn keep on taking it still from way back
Say black trying to get that fortune like Sajak
There must be at least twenty reasons you cant win and
In this rap game youre hopeless heres a top ten
10s very simple and plain its petty crime
Its only 94 when you wrote your first rhyme
And now you think you got more skill than power tools
But never could your feet fit up in our shoes
You only got one delivery
Onedimensional rappers is dead as chivalry
Dont get your spot blown up block sewn up
I lift MCs to tone up rip your zone up
I got more flavors than womens douche
Make ends with Mexicans and rock dreads in Flatbush
9 you cant see mine cant find mine
Cant do mine step to mine when my crew find
A frontingass nigga we get in this
You dont want to get beat and boxed like Biz
You aint wild cause you run with wild kids
Now the chorus is gonna tell you what 8 and 7 is
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
6 I bury that ass like Halle
All up on tracks like a trolley my golly
Like Bob Marley we jammin by all means
And real gangsters dont talk shit in magazines
5 never judge a rapper by the song he make
Some of the coolest rapping niggas will drop your ass in a lake
And on the other hand some of them screaming Keep it real
Their videos the only time they ever busted steel
4 you dont faze me this aint Star Trek
I know where you park your cars at as far as that
Beef thats going on in all these spots
In parking lots niggas pop more shit than shots
Funny dummy lyrics dont stun me
If I was your only pair of pants you still couldnt run me
Out this rap game its INC for life
Niggas gonna know soon cause Brownsvilles trife
All up in the mix like blenders
Offenders life enders whatever genders dont offend us
Coming at you gonna catch you and when we find you
Dont lose count let me remind you
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker

One two one two this be number trey
Might be in the game but I dont think you wanna play
Im coming with the flav getting more rich than Bey
I say this Master jam more than Jay
And two is my crew is coming with the newest
Cant do us knock your teeth out trying to cue us
You want to step to us come clean on the scene
Without the drama my team making all the green
Im in your spleen no afro with mad sheen
In my ride young teen girls getting mean
Every Day just like Mary J
Im downtown Brooklyn where niggas play
The corners and blocks like street lamps I beat champs
In rapping leaving niggas wondering what happened
And that be the number one reason you cant flow
But bring back the other two shits to let em know
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
