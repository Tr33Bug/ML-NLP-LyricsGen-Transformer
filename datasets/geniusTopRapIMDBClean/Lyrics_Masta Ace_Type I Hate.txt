Yo this joint right here is dedicated to all them grimy cats
Thatll stab you in the back nah mean
Disloyal ass niggas all in your business
Snake in the grass ass hoes peeped your stash
You aint goin nowhere snake
See you check it
I hate a nigga all up in your business
Tryin to finally confine about you yo what is this
Damn nigga do you work for the Source I hope they pay you millions
Cause you act like you takin the place of Wendy Williams nigga
I see you in front of my crib in the dark
Lurkin and waitin to see whos car was parked
It aint your chick so why you care for
Why you stop and stare for what you there for
Do you need to know every single thing about my life
Its not enough that I rap and sing about my life
Even when Im sleep you got nothin else to do
But call up your man whos a bitch nigga just like you
Talkin bout my business like it aint nothin
Yall have a two hour discussion on who I might be fuckin
Cats with these feminine ways and traits
Just one example of the type of niggas I hate cmon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate them niggas who just kiss ass
So they can move up in the game like quick fast and they get gassed
Now they walkin round like they so down
Cause they workin up at Motown but slow down nigga
Yall motherfuckers is the worst kind
And I know youre probably hearin this here for the first time
But Imma say that shit other rappers just wont say
Think about it feel it inside but just dont say
Keep them fake hugs when you come in the place
And when I see you Imma say this directly into your face
Yall some fake niggas except now you got a name
And this applies to half of these niggas up in this game
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I had to get a pen and just write this shit down cmon


You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate bitches that be frontin like they got your back
But when the jump off crack you see its not like that
Certain chicks put the S in snake
Try to give a bitch a break wanna test your weight
Let em stay in your crib even take your whip
Might even babysit while they playin the strip
Kinda chick want to smile up and call you sis
Cant even bring your man around shorty  tsk tsk 
Call your moms mom even wear your clothes
Thats why I gotta give it up to them honest hoes
You know what they about from the gate
Stay in there place heres another type of broad I hate  What type 
Type to put all of your business in the street  uhhuh 
Thats why I only got a handful of peeps
Closely analyze all the new ones I meet
2001 bitches I aint too beat
There you have it
Just a few of examples
And if you cant relate to this shit right here
Chances are youre the type of motherfuckers were talkin about
Ya heard
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
