Yea MA EdO
Take a look at my eyes
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what you see
When you look at me wutuwankno now
Imma speak to the fans now and answer questions
So theres no room for errors no chance for guessing
Thats the reason why on this track I choose to rap
Its to make sure that none of yall confuse the facts
Cause no I never moved to Cali
I just had a bitch in Compton and a few in the valley
And Born To Roll never went gold or so Im told
I never did find out how much the shit sold
And no I aint sore at Marley
Though I rarely ever see him and I call him hardly
And no I never lived in the bridge
But Craig and Shante did as kids
Straight from the ville had to catch the train
No I never picked a pocket or snatched a chain
I was way too deep in the music
God gave me a gift I decided to keep it and use it
And no I wasnt dissing Ghost
Before you try to spread beef you should listen close
I gotta watch what Im yelling fella
Cause some fans dumb like Hellen Keller
Nah label aint off the ground
But we bound to get yall niggas open off the sound
Now we aint got are office yet
But we got big plans like a architect
Take a look
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what you see
When you look at me wutuwankno now
Take a look at my life and tell me what you see
When you look at me wutuwankno now
Take a look at my eyes and tell me what you see
When you look at me wutuwankno now
Take a look at my life and tell me what you see
When you look at me please I gotta go now
Whats up MA
I see the look of concern and fate its ya turn to wait
I play the judge and the jury and adjourn late
See that tend to happen when you learn hate
Edo left out good but returned great
And now Im about to face the city
Plus I got a case with Diddy
For jacking my classic
I Got To Have It beat thats so gritty Im so witty
And yall niggas is so pretty
Outside of Boston people ask me about Benzino
Are we cool do we got beef or is we peoples
We could debate on that but I guess yall got to wait on that
Now hate on that nigga and stop stirring up beef
You turning up grief when you doubt your beliefs
Stay out of grown folk business
We young entrepreneurs that own our own business
I answer questions like a witness
To chop your crew down with no forgiveness
Take a look in his eyes
Hes an angel on the outside but a crook in disguise
Now take a look
Look here I gotta go be fair I got a show
You here you kind of slow oh yeah you got to know
Well I do got a lot to tell
And a book bout my life got a shot to sell
Yea them raps bout them rise I was one of the first
But them facts niggas hide like a gun in a purse
Yea I made you put them chromey things on your cars
And yea I used to hang with some porno stars
Strip clubs on a weekly basis
You used to see these faces in some freaky places
But all thats behind me its not the same
When you reach a certain age life is not a game
I was in the fast lane I was out for speed
But now I got more than one mouth to feed
Yea it used to be all about a hump and a rub
But I aint tryin be that old nigga up in the club
