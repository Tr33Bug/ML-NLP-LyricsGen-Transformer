Young Black Intelligent  YBI  Lyrics
Young black intelligent this is not a first
But it feels like its curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart its like Im smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul its our stroll through the ville again
Stranded on this island feel like Im Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that Im under I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that Im living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint thats the point where our eyes meet
Asked whats the weight on the books in my knapsack
Hes so amused Im confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
Hes trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
Thats why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced my moms made a promise
If I get the grades Ill be praised like Thomas
Clarence but I dont know if laws in my future
Cops in the war and theyll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free sing
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I  why be I
Why be me  why be me
If I fly  if I fly
They gon see   they gon see
I might die  I might die
But Ill be free  but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me  why be me

Penny for your thoughts a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta fortyone cents
Caught up in the barbed wire shorty on the fence
I can be a knifepacking guntoting hooligan
But I cant decide so Im on my way to school again
On my way to duel again me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But Im on a team and my coach wont hear of it
Hes well aware of it I aint getting pinched
Yall dummies go ahead I aint getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything youve worked for Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I  why be I
Why be me  why be me
If I fly  if I fly
They gon see   they gon see
I might die  I might die
But Ill be free  but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me  why be me

Young Black
In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds brah
Design your inside concentration desire
Dedication inspiration perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesnt guarantee anything
But without it you dont stand a chance
Intelligence will save you
And us too
Peace
