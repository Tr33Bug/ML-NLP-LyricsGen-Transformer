If we was owned by the white folks it will be all good
But we independent black owned and making scrilla
We a threat to society
They ban our movies our videos but we still 1 in America
You see a coward can talk shit behind a nigga back
But only a man can tell you whats on his mind
When he look you in the eyes
In other words dont judge a book by its cover
See we successful black businessmen
But we also mercenary soldiers
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug seller
I sell stones out Im breaking them got damn phones up
Niggas they popping them keys Master P he fucking 
Besides them gs Im  them keys but they didnt know
That I could go gold
Platinum and still slang keys out the record store
This caine got me sick
These niggas they talking that shit
Dont make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit
I caught the game from some old gs
Niggas they slanging they fucking keys
Got the game from New Orleans
Now the world know of me
Im down south hustling from the west
To the east in the midwest yeah yall niggas know of me
Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world
Every woman man and boy wrap these cds up like furls
On the corner posted up with them ballers
Slanging that yella niggas yall cant hold us
Gone for 155 when you see me its no drought
Im the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth
Got every fucking club bout it bout it
Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy
Cause Im down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map
Independent black owned and aint scared to bust no caps
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him

Nigga tell me what you gone do
Its just me and you you and I
Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano
If we did the mix
Flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering
Fludging
Tell your fucking boys dont move
Cause like a rug I got them covered
Niggas aint like they used to be
Back in the days they were playing the dozens
These days niggas will kill ya
Talking shit say it to the end of my muzzle
We dont want no trouble black just as subtle
Tell you what you gone fuck around and find
If you disrespect my hustle
None of you niggas fuckers young niggas fuckable
Some niggas  dumb niggas suffer
Before you can even think about making a move Im already on it
Ill have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only
Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling
The interference started from the ground up the building
Behind mines I just dont give a fuck
Aint no closing my eyes
Im gone look in your face and tear your ass up
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him

Aaahh its murder
Do or die killed or be killed
Nigga who am I
Silkk the Shocker do or die for a mil
Dont you see I be counting money like a machine
No how Im saying I got to buy my green
For every fiend equals money like ching ching
My dream know what Im saying got to get the cream or triple beam
By it for 155 and I sell it for 18
You know what Im saying you know what a nigga like known for
Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one
You know what we known for
And its all good in the hood but I still stay strapped
Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack
And you know how Im saying 4 gs and I run it
Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game until I done it
And its cool I gotta reach eight digits
Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him
Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if hes a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
My pops say 
Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
