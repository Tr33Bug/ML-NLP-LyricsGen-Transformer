This is station KMLN
And were sitting here with rap star Master P
Leader of The Real Untouchables
Master P where are you from
The ghetto
Now that you are living in Beverly Hills
Has anything changed
Wellnot really
Master P would you like to say anything to the people
Who think that you couldnt make it
Yeah fuck em
So Master P whats life to you
Life to me aint nothing but bitches and money
Lifelifelifelife
Lifeaintnothingbutbbitchbitches and money
Life aint nothin but bitches and money  Bitches and money 
Life aint nothin but bitches and money  Bitches and money 
It all started way back in the day
When this bitch named Brenda used to give a nigga hay
So just listen to the words I say
And if you a man youve experienced foul play
You know the hoes the ones that act funny
That dont say shit till ya whip out some money
Then a bitch start jockin
Next thing ya know ya at the hotel rockin
I cant have a bitch cause we didnt have no money you was a trip
So you makin that mail its kind of risky
You thinkin fuck she thinkin rags to the riches
So this the shit you gotta beat
Meet a freak before ya fall for another mans freal
But if ya laugh aint a damn thing funny
Cause ya like P life aint nothin but bitches and money
Im the KING dont avenge me
Dont think cause Im stingy
I want cash I dont flash
Ask my bitch fuck the dash
Rollin in the street in a fresh ass Rolls
Checkin out the bitches and the funky hoes
Ooh who is this behind the tinted glass
A bitch named Gina wanna give me some ass
Well next week call the honey
Cause life aint nothin but bitches and money
My Vette clean as shit
I see some hoes lookin they wanna ride in it
Bitches think a nigga can tap for some ass
Open like a fuckin convertible runs off of gas
So open on up and start pumpin
Cause that dont be workin hoes get something for nothin
Man life aint nothin but bitches and money
I love moneyand bitches too
The ones as sweet as honey
But when she fucks up shes gotta go
Dont let her stay but the cash flow
I could give a damn about a stupid ho
Bitch ya cant make me rich this I know
This is behind me
I need big dollars and fuckin thick bitch behind me
And Ima get them to thinkin hope
But I aint fuckin with em if they broke
Cause money attracts money
And when ya aint got none all ya days are funny
Just like my boys said
When ya got a pocket full of money
Everything is funny
Aint that the truth Ruth
With a pocket full of dough fuck a bitch hella fun
And afterwards she will cease
All I care about is bitches and money
I think its all types of games bein played
But to a bitch these days the looks aint shit
Unless these niggas pay
Look here bro ya gotta suffer
Cause a motherfucker with trues and Vogues got all the hoes
Dont even cuss she think a nigga is hustle
The more ya make the more she take
Bring her to dinner think of desert
Come up with an empty plate
This to them young hoes
Theres money meals and haves
This another way ya feel up Mike and Thomas and rock Ruth
So dont take it personal hoes just keep runnin
And to the fellas out there you know how it goes
Life aint nothin but bitches and money
