You know Im from the Calliope so meet me on Erato Street
A round rolled tablet these fiends actin bad
Dont make me pop the trunk and get that tac and tap that azz
Walked through the Courtway made it to the gym
Hollered at Michael Brown Big Willie and Magnolia Slim
See my old girlfriend damn she hella fine
Got three kids but aint none of them hoes mine
Asked her is it all good for a light night creep
She said she on her way whistled at me at a quarter to three
Gold teeth shinin diamonds almost blinded her
And just like Brandy I wanna be down with ya
Say its all good jumped in the Lexus
Mobile phone ringin its my cousin from Texas
Say they bouncin hard to my shit back in 5th Ward
North side south side and south par
Chorus  4X

Breakin em down while shakin the town with hoes all on my dick
