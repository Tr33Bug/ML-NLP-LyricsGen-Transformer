This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players hustlas pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
Slappin skins makin dividends and riding strapped
Uhhhhhh  wood grain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin on that doja
Four niggas in the back screamin No Limit soldiers
True to the gizzame
Stopped in the projects sold a half an ounce of cocaine
Hit interstate ten to Texas
Listening to DJ Screw just raced a Lexus
Called up Pimp C
Did a song last week with my nigga Bun B
Twistin on some green spinach
And niggas still trippin I aint dead Im still in it
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players hustlas pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends and them paper stacks
See pockets full of dollars already stacked
So Im gangsta leaning sideways
Today aint Friday
Ten it is and today is my day
Take it from mister hundred spoke rider
Cadillac Suburban driver pussy diver
Push the Glock inside when Im ridin
Flossin down the block
Holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word swerve
To the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him
I said Bitch cant tell Im off
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block
Dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes
At the sideshow abouts to plot
Hittin donuts you know Im actin a straightup menace
Catch me spinnin you can tell I was there
Cause there was a cloud of smoke when I was finished
I seen 50 and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin hed be nice and all cause I gotta 185
In the hood and you know they cant catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that Glock 40 up on the dashboard
You never know who might try me
This is for the playas
Playa play on
I cant hate you homie
Playa play on
I cant hate you homie
Bourbons and Lacs mansions and bitches money and weed
A made life is all I dream
Paper chasin for that green
Im thuggin on the scene nigga
Whatcha dont believe Well check the credentials theyll tell ya
A niggas livin presidential
Im on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought Id get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mil
For real Im slangin platinum shit until Im old and ill
Lil Gotti Im gonna make you feel what I say I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay smoke some hay
I wouldnt have that shit no other way
The made life the game tight
No Limit for life
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
Playa play on
I cant hate you homie
Rollin on chrome and candy
