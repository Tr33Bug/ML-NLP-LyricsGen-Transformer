Gone off that juice  formaldehyde  and leave their mothers cryin
Cause their little boy is dead
Cause that color blue or red
And want to do what them other ballas said
To make some snaps I mean to make some money
To break it up on the street but this game aint funny
You want that beat in aint no way out
