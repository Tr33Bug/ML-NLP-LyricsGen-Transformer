I hit it one time and they be callin back talkin bout Silkk why you do all that playin
And she had the nerve to tell me if I aint a fuckin trick Im worthless
I told her Bitch if you aint suckin dick then none of yo clit defeats the purpose
Figured she had game tryin to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind
I figured lookin at me she see nothin but dollar signs
Simply a bitch might give you some weed a bitch might give you a buck
