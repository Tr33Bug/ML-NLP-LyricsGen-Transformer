Somebody musta told these hoes I was a muthafuckin rapper
But will they didnt tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin
Gambler

I got hoes like acorns fallin outta trees
No Limit niggas dont save hoes
Aint no Captain Save a Ho gonna breeze
Now Now Now P all the time I done put in work
I aint know I was livin next door to Captain Kirk
Kept a smirk on his face lookin like Joe Sausage
Come to find out some bitch holdin his money down hostage
Got keys to his cottage done changed the alarm on the Ac
And all he get to do is eat that funky ho from the back
On top of that  the bitch fat makin a career off this nigga
And all his homies gone because they cant get it clear to this nigga

I bought her lunch the first time but see there trick thats nothin but game
I hit it one time and they be callin back talkin bout Silkk why you do all that playin
And she had the nerve to tell me if I aint a fuckin trick Im worthless
I told her Bitch if you aint suckin dick then none of yo clit defeats the purpose
Figured she had game tryin to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind
I figured lookin at me she see nothin but dollar signs
Simply a bitch might give you some weed a bitch might give you a buck
Man but since you my boy you better use a condom before you try to fuck
Take the game from this show bug cause Silkk aint no love
I give em a little somethin but at the end I take em back and get the most love
