Look get this up out of my face
I told you I dont want anything to do with your dirty money

Im telling you you need to change your life 
Man you trippin on me and Im out here trying to have something for us
Cause when it all boiles down its gonna be me crying 
Man you aint gotta worry about that
Oh you think your better than me now
Im outta here girl
Im going insane without you Im losing my brains without you
And I just cant help myself dont want nobody else Im so crazy about you
Ill do anything to see ya and I slang myself to feed ya
I just cant help myself dont want nobody else Im so crazy about you
Ill never forget the first day we met I was so crazy about ya
I beeped you all the days just to here you say someday we will be together
You know you made me have this funny feelings
I guess I just love me a thug
You know how to push me down and take it from me
Show me that real type of love
Ugh The feelings I have for you its hard to explain to you
I would do anything for you girl Id die for you
I live my life for you so crazy about you
Just give me a chance and I promise never to lie to you
I would be the best for you complete any task for you
Any wrong doing I swear Id do the time for you
I could feel your pain thats why its easy to cry for you
So please dont leave me cause I cant breath without you
Who took care of the situation when you got caught by the feds
And I was waiting on your every phone call lying alone in your bed
My people tell me your not worth it but it is so hard to explain
And just the thought of you on top
Makes my nature hot i want no other man
Who kept everything fresh for you The best for you
Who counted all the figures for you
Continued the buisness for you
Who ran away those niggas for you
It was me that paid the bail for you collected all the mail for you
Who do you trust with your life Who cant wait to be your wife
That is I Ms Peaches the one you love tonight
Id be the first girl to fight about ya so please dont leave
Cause I cant breath without you
Im going crazy about my baby
No one could ever take your place
With all the memories we share nothing else can compare
So Im hiding my pride what Im feeling inside
I know that I cant hide
