Ughhhhh
Good Day America this is Mr No Limit
So you want to get rid of gangsta rap
But what if gangsta rap gets rid of you
Howd you like them apples
You want your kids to grow up listenin to good American music
But they dont want that they want that bout it bout it shit
You always point the finger at the bad guy
But what if the bad guy points the finger at you
Fuck the politcians the media and the government
The fucking world was built on corruption
If it wasnt for people like me and my reality music you couldnt pay for a meal
Im tired of you fucking hustlers following me around tapping my phone and over taxing my money
You know what a hustler is
Its a pig that dont fly straight
But its OK  its OK 
When you finish listening to this tape
Itll be the last time you hear a bad guy like me
So fuck you cockaroaches
Sincerely yours the last don Master P The Last Don
I made millions from raps I couldnt die in scraps
No Limit niggas we strapped thug niggas bust caps
I live the life of a rider lost at heart
I played the pieces to the puzzle but they tore me apart
I went to jail for shit I didnt do
Niggas banged at my motherfuckin crew
We retaliated now we killers  Ughhhhhh 
Niggas slang ghetto dope tapes but we drug dealers
Aint that a bitch a nigga tryna make it
Changed for society but these fools tryna take me
They want you dead or locked up smokin or rocked up
Walkin the blocked up down or cocked up
In the bayou haters six feet deep
It could be you or me your girl or your homey
Cause life has no time but keep your eyes on your enemies
Thats one to grow on from the Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
He took the kiss of death so I could be The Last Don
2Pac Biggie Smalls my little brother Kevin Miller
They all took the kiss of death so I could be the last don
Real niggas and bitches out there feel my pain
Feel my pain its real out here
Aint no such thing as uh you cant change your life
You cant do what you wanna do
A coward dies a million deaths but a solider only dies once
So all yall niggas out there in the hood tryna feed your families
Get what you gotta get and get out nigga get your shit together
And if you hustlin hustle for a cause nigga
Dont believe in nobody but your motherfuckin self
Cause moneys the root of all evil
We done lost a lot of soldiers behind them dollars
Thats one to grow on nigga from the last Dizon you heard me
