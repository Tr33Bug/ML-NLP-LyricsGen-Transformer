This is an invitation for all my thug niggas to come join me
On a journey to the ever lasting ship of eternal life
A place where theres no violence no pain no crime no prisons no ghettos Nothing but sunshine at the end of the road so come with me lets ride
All my thug niggas ride to eternity lets ride nigga lets ride nigga  2X 
Nigga back in the days I was afraid of the police
Just another paranoid drugdealer on the streets
My ghetto hero was above the law I caught a glimpse of a bullet
That took him down like a south paw uneducated to the game of life I was hated to the grave but the pen kept my mind right
A young motherfucker doomed since day one
Shit Im a fool Im a ball til my time come
A G to me is like a mil on the streets Im a kill just to eat
And leave my enemies on the concrete they say a soft heart
Make a bitch nigga stay alert stay alive thats the code of a thug nigga I wanna rob and steal but crime pays the bill niggas know Im real So my pain is what they feel Im a rider TRU niggas gone feel me CMurder aint gone die til a bitch nigga kill me
How many niggas want to ride with me
When Im gone dont my fuckin soldier cry for me
I want the nigga that did it to die with me
And his mama and his brother take a ride with me
Cuz Im a killer  a killer  nigga baller
Servin up the 3rd ward Caliope New Orla
Nigga like the devil with the motherfuckin red prints
Fight me like a monkey on top of an elephant
The game got me crazy prophecy dazy
This god wasnt  when a nigga tried to play me
God wont you save me nigga only baby only time could take me
Mama why you made me life is like slavery
Technines and three eighties
Homies live in shady pray for your baby my first born replace me
This ghetto might waste me Im a hunted bitch like ghostly
It be a nigga close to me that take me
4X
They told me in this life those who start off last a end up first
Those who start up first a end up last
Last time I saw a 45 blast a nigga who was last should be doin 50 years
Without parole life is cold but it fair fuck the mayor that coward bastard
Ask him durin his term how many niggas sawt jail cells and found caskets
Place me the plastic when its time to shoot only god will know the truth
Whats in a niggas blood is in his heart
From the start my pain was irreversible the book on how to kill a nigga
Is unwritable my title dont solidify our right to tell a child how
To live his life or how to stop a man when he beat his wife but if you turn
Your back grab your gun we could ride tonight
And aint no game as I stroll on
Nigga you know this SERV mister get my ride ON
Hahhahaha the media point the finger at me like Im the bad guy
But its ok just take a good look at me Im no different then your average
Businessman society wants to eliminate me but uh in a few years
You be wishin you had another Don like me sincerly yours Americas
Nightmare Master P
