Master P  talking 
Yo Boo uh I know I aint never told you this before but uh Im out here

LawandMercedes
Since youve been away Ive been down and lonely
Since youve been away Ive been thinkng of you
Trying to understand the reason you left me
What were you going thru
Im missing you  gangstas need love too 
Tell me where the road turns  echoed 
Verse 1  Master P 
Uhhhh I got you livin in mansions
Jumpin out of Benzes  honk honk 
DKNY clothes but get fake presidents Rolex watches
You used to wear Swatches
Done took you out the ghetto now your name is Miss Versace
Alligator Purses Met with your Reeses Hershey
Miss Revelon on yo lips an hair an toes on Tuesdays and Thursdays
Even though Im livin wrong tryin to get my hustle on
I want you in your birthday suit when I make it home
So I can Uhhhh then squeeze ya tease ya
You wanna rub me let the Ice Cream Man please you
I aint got no nine to five
Hustle just to stay alive
Keep you on your game
Give you a pistol with your cute 45
Heiffers decieve ya cuz they wanna be ya
Tell you Im a thug and they cant wait till I leave ya
So think about what I say and fuck what them hoes say
Chorus Lawand and Mercedes
Im missin you
Tell me where the road turns  echoed 

Verse 2  Master P
You was a high school queen
Met me sellin ice cream on the corner went doubleup servin Fiend
Even though Im a thug ya love me
If sex was a game wed a played rugby
I got you flyin first classes on planes
Jumpin offa trains
Takin cruises on boats sippin champagne
Rollin out the red carpet when they see ya 10000 mink coat
Thats why them hoes wanna be ya but they cant
Taking trips in Land Cruisers
Droppin off cash to the bank
But they dont know what you done seen
The shit i done put you thru
The penitentiary chances you done take for ya boo
The FEDs harass you
The lies you done told for me
And when i went to jail you found a way to visit me
Runnin up ya phone bill
Sometimes the kids aint even have a decent meal
It aint no limit to this ghetto love
Even though im out here slangin drugs
You still show me love
Thats why Im here for ya Boo
But just remember  uuuhh  that gangstas need love too
CHORUS
Verse 3  The Shocker
I got a  and i wonder why i wonder what she in me
Man I cant lie
Cuz i be hustlin  hangin wit my homies all night chall
Ill be hustlin from the morning to the night fall aight chall
Its kinda hard tryin to stay clean
Tyrin to chase dreams
Tryin to make it happen
But this rappin aint what it seems
Know what i mean
Now thru thick and thin ya stood beside me
When I was on the run you hide me
On the real Tryin to make a mil but on the real
Thats the type of love money cant buy me
I need someone who could be trusted
Take this hundred gs in case a nigga like me get busted
Ya blame it on my mob lifestyle
My thuggishruggish friends
Ya keep tellin me
My fine lifestyle gonna havta come to an end
Ya gotta realize I aint tryin to be no broke fart
Im takin the chances now
Cuz its gonna be hard for our future sons and daughters
Im tryin to take trips to Reno
Cash chips like casinos
Live life as a high roller
Silkk the Shocker make moves like Valentino
I only got one chance so I got to take it
If you could just be patient
Diamonds the size of 20s just for waitin
Yo mom think Im a thug
She dont like me you still sneak out and see me
Ya friends think Im a ghetto thug
But this is ghetto love that they cant see G
I know when it rains it pours one day i gotta stop
And when I do ima be sittin on top
And gonna be sippin champagne on yachts
Cars and tennis bracelets just to thank you  meanwhile 
Ill be home tonight
So keep it tight for this gangsta
