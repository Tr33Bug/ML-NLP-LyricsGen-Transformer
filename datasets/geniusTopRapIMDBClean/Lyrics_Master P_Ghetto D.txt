Thank you dope fiends for your support ha ha
Let me give a shoutout to the D Boys  drug dealers 
Neighborhood dope man I mean real niggas
Thatll make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Aint got a dime butll ride to pay the rent
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the task
CMurder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight Im straight you dig
What you need ten aint no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You wont be getting yo money if yo shit be cooked wrong
Overcook yo dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that Im bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine
One  look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
Two  no buying from no nigga that you dont know
Make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You get the baking soda I gots tha D
And get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it bubble up and get harder
Then sit the tube in some readymade cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while its still hot
And watch that shit rock and rise to the fuckin top
And now your cocaine powder is crack
Now hope youre strapped cause you might get jacked

Nigga nigga never let a nigga front you no dizzope
Start from the ground work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short you better get rowdy
Kick down doors show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break kis down to ozs
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use B12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1 Never talk on the phone in ya house
2 Never slang dope out ya baby mommas house
3 Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4 Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yoself to an Uzi
The first hit for free  damn 
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty Gs
5 Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy thats the Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money
