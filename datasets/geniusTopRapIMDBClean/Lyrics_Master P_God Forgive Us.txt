God forgive us cause we do not know what we do
We only do what we see
The Gift all my real niggas out there
No Limit forever man
I told you it aint over I made these niggas
Im back to get whats mine
This my life ughh
This my life nigga
No Limit forever
Boss of all bosses
Godfather of this shit nigga
A little skinny nigga call me underdog
Hangin with my partners parkin our expensive cars
Its funny how the rock will change a niggas life
Went from sleeping on floors to mansions fuckin overnight
Took grandma to the church had to pay my tithes
A hundred Gs to the preacher shouldve seen his eyes
My auntie cry every time when she sees me strapped
But these niggas will kill you life is just one trap
Keep my pistol cocked homie I dont fuck with cowards
Took my bitch out the hood heres a million dollars
Put my trust in god and I love haters
Cause every time they talk nigga I get paper
Watch your enemies you even got to watch your friends
Peter told Jesus he love him then he did him in
Boz called this shit last year man this shit funny
Real niggas will turn bitch over a little money
I thank God for my partner my nigga Joey
Cause when I was hurtin he aint talk shit
He said kitchen dro it
Yeah lets make a toast to this real shit
And all the bullshit we had to deal with
Started off with crumbs we had to build bricks
I pray 20 years later that Im still rich
Rollin up swishers to this real shit
Still prayin for the patience not to kill shit
Started off with crumbs we had to build bricks
Its no limit to this real shit
Its the untouchable grew up on the Huxtable
So its nothing for me to kick in the door and fuck with you
Tie you and your bitch up then hop in the truck with you
You die on your way to the trap the knife stuck in you
This next bar for Rihanna Im fuckin you
Gangsta hit it doggystyle with Chris Brown bumpin too
Love bitches smoke weed cut pies sold dope
Drove raris parked Masis crooked on Appalachian slopes
Ey yo P they aint seen a cold nigga like this B
These are the memoirs of the gold rope
Hollywood never them the white boys I sold coke
Crazy motherfucker my conscious stream Four Loko
IceT in them bricks I been fuckin with CoCo
11 years old I had a triple beam before I had a GI Joe
Birds by the boatload that bitchlife in a chokehold
Its hard to trust hoes you see what happened to Ocho
Yeah aint no limit to this real shit
Mastering them Ps since 12 its time to kill shit
Yeah lets make a toast to this real shit
And all the bullshit we had to deal with
Started off with crumbs we had to build bricks
I pray 20 years later that Im still rich
Rollin up swishers to this real shit
Still prayin for the patience not to kill shit
Started off with crumbs we had to build bricks
Its no limit to this real shit
Uh huh

Yall have woke up the motherfuckin sleeping giant
