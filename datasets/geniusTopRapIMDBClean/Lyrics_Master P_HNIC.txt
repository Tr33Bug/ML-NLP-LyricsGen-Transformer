See Im that head nigga in charge
Leave you dead in your garage
Yall niggas scared you seein dreads and camouflage
Dont get me fucked up all these niggas call me sarge
Itll be like wham bam thank you maam
Im that head nigga in charge
I get paper I got goons I got hoes
I aint hatin you get money
Im that head nigga in charge
You aint bout it what you fuckin with me for
Itll be like wham bam thank you maam
Im that head nigga in charge
I just won me a kilo
My niggas speakin in Creole
They call me the chef
You know I fry like grill
Started learnin the ropes
Sweatsuits and the Locs
Homie taught me to whip
So he made us a toast
They speak my name like a myth
Went and got me a Ghost
Picked him up in the suite
They gave my nigga the most
They be hard on real niggas
Gotta stay on my toes
They be watchin my twitter
Gotta watch what I post
Cowards all by the killers
Wrong one to approach
What you spent on your video
That went on the coat
Spend a million with Jacob
Another several with Johnny
I mean look at my Bezel
We got it lookin Versace
Cookin yams in the morning
Tell the streets that we back
See I fuck with you pussies
But I dont fuck with you rats
Thirteen when I cop it
26 when I drop it
Nigga call me James Harden
Like I played with the Rockets
36 OZs
Watch I whip it to fifty
Dont talk on the android
Cause the feds be listenin
I got million dollar connects
In my minute I touch
Have tons of that raw
False bottom in the trucks
Brought that brand new blues
And Im balled up nigga
Im that country boy
Sellin fiends walnuts
And supermodels be mysidepiece
I made more money than your favorite rapper
Bitch when I was on the streets
No Limit
Uh Huh
Check it out killer
Ill show you how to get money get paper
Im like instant grits just add water
