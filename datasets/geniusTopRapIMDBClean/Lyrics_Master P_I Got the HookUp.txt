I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh  8X 
I live my life as a thug but girl you know I need ya
Each and ever women that I meet damn they dont wanna be ya
It aint no limit to what we could do
Holla if ya hear me girl you know Im comin through
Im out here on the grind livin my life fast
And if you really love me lay some blankets on the grass
I know the way I live make you wanna cry
But you know I gotta hustle thats the way I survive
It aint no changin me but me and you could make it
Lets fix a plate of ghetto love with grits eggs and bacon
Let me wipe away your ghetto tears misery and pain
All you need is a passport I got the hookup and a private plane
Dont wanna go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
Can we go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
For a while tears are all that we shared our love was fading so fast
Was right now is wrong gaining fast baby
In the night I sat alone wanting you crying out for you
Wondering whos loving you baby
Something happened along the way the love that we shared has gone away
We tried and tried for a better day for that day girl I pray
Dont wanna go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
Can we go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
Holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh  3X 
I love you Ohhhhhhh holla if you hear me
Dont wanna go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
Can we go on livin without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me  Ughhhhhh 
And if we say bye bye bye bye
