I want yall to play this at funerals in the hood
Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know when its gon be yo time
Sitting in the ghetto thinkin bout
All my homies passed away  uuunnnggghhh 
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
Thats how me and my boys rolled
How could it be
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friends gone
And Im so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though youre gone away
I know youre in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday
I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds
In your hearse damn its sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin I be perkin never jerkin
Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know youre up there workin
Your little babys cool and ya babys mama straight
But todays a sad day to see your tshirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball put yo name upon the wall
In the projects yous a legend on the street you was a star
But its sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain
Some Gs never change damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals
Take a minute to smile for the dead  uuunnnggghhh 
Smile for the dead  RIP 2Pac Makaveli Biggie Smalls 
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
How could it be
Somebody took my boy from me
Its like I cant believe you gone 
My best friends gone
Sometimes I feel like I cant go on 
And Im so all alone
Everytime I see something you done left 
I really miss my homies
It just remind me more and more of you dawg 
Even though they gone away
I just keep reminiscin 
I know you in a better place
Cause I know you alright 
And I hope to see ya soon someday
And I keep smilin knowin Im a see you in the crossroads 
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But Id give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin weed til 3 hollerin at the hoes
Spendin 4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap he had to chase the game
Nigga told me C leave that dope cause rappin is yo thang
I aint gon even lie some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if theres a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin kis
I keep my memories try to keep my head strong
But baby its hard to be strong when yo main homie gone
Even though you gone away
Even though you gone you aint never gon be forgotten 
I know you in a better place
Cause as long as Im here
You gon live through me and other TRU playas 
I really miss my homies
Even though theyre gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday
Im just sittin here dazed thinkin about all the times we had
Thinkin about the past some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante It was a group of us just a group of five
Now three dead one in jail it seem right now Im the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me may yall rest in peace
When He took three took my soul just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin girls writin down numbers like memos
Makin million dollar bets makin all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile its sad but they say gangstas cant cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when its yo time when your time was up
You never seen your child but hes here to remind us
Even though you was wrong I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin and thuggin
Rest in peace to all the ones that didnt make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon miss you
I love these fools 
I know you in a better place
Every time I get on my knees 
And I hope to see ya soon someday
I pray for you Im glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon aint no more killin
Aint no more fights and aint no more tears
