set to an instrumental like LL Cool Js I Need Love
When Im alone in my car Im thinkin about Ms Lorenzo
My girl Enkei Sprewell
Giovanna Daytons Momos Diablos
And my girl Asanti
I need dubs when I ride to the club
Cruisin with my girls even rollin with thugs
I need dubs 22s 24s
Shinin in the hood Im the king of the car shows
Dubs when I ride to the club
Cruisin with my girls even rollin with thugs
I need dubs 22s 24s
Shinin in the hood Im the king of the car shows
I see it I buy it you need it I got it
I could transform a car til a Halle Berry by demand
Regular wheels I bend em dont stand up
Im the first one to put Sprewells on a Phantom
Girls see me and scream Im reppin Orleans
I got cars baby Flex aint never seen
Xzibit in the game but he cant Pimp My Ride
I got everythang flipped from the in to the outside
Them Lambord golds 50 talkin about
I had em on the Cutlass back before I bought me a house
I put ice on my grill just to hurt them haters
27 dipped in chrome for the Escalades
Put candy on the body so it glow in the dark
Put light on my rims for at night when they walk
Cant roll like no scrub man on no hubs
Ghetto Bill up in here yall know whassup
From the streets to the pen you know these soldiers gon win
When they see me on TV say he did it again
From his shoes to his clothes hes ballin outta control
From the Bentley to the Beemer to the Hummer with six golds
But wodie dont stunt make them sixfos jump
Like Reebok pumps P Miller amps in the trunk
Louis Vuitton Ferrari 360 is so clean
Asanti rims that really bling bling
And girls trip when they get in the ride
I got the CL5 steering wheel on the other side
And Im gangsta man what you thankin man
Shorty wanna roll cause Im on them twankies man
Now I know Im kinda young but I keep my dubs clean
Nicknamed my rims Demi cause they older than me
At the age of 15 man doin big thangs man
Dont hate dawg cause you aint me man
Some say Im ballin cause my chrome stay crawlin
Took the Phantom for a ride now they say Im nightcrawlin
Never get hongry cause I keep them deep dishes
The peoples just ahhh then they take pictures
My Hummer sit clean on them Shaqs minus eight
White gold and purple just like them old days
Now its kinda crazy cause Mercedes get me jealous
Range on Asantis but they cant have it
All for Lexus my baby my boo
If I ever need help I just scream HOOTIE HOO
My P Miller speakers match my P Miller sneakers
The ones on my feet and the ones on my Beemer
