Im at the time in my life when a niggas ready to change
Ill be dead or in jail if I dont shake this game
Feel like Im trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die
Its getting harder for my people yet we dont know why
They cutting sisters off welfare these kids cant eat
And its the children like  turned out by the street
I couldnt see it while I was outside slinging my rocks
Serving death to my people committing the ultimate evil
Robbing and killing my own kind Lord forgive me
Blinded by this life of crime God somebody hear me
Since the death of my mama my life been filled with drama
Lost both of my kids punished for dirt that I did
I cant bring em back so I get high to forget
All the mistakes that I made that time wont let me erase
I keep my head up high but Im stuck in this game
Steady checking myself God help me to change

If I could change Id bring my mama back from the grave
I aint got too much coming cause we living in the last days
Crime pays doing broads can get you AIDS gotta wear a strap these days
All the time I stay high trying to fight my stress
Jealous fools of the world trying to put me to rest
Last night I had a talk with my mama
Then I cried asking god did she serve her purpose before she died
You can see it in my eyes a brother want to slow down
I aint mad at you daddy cause you didnt come around
Im knowing that the times is hard but you can make it
You see the opportunity you take it
But what about my little baby
I got a mouth to feed but I still want to hang in the streets
And smoke weed with the OGs
My homies rest in peace in the game
I dont think you even know the pain in me
I want to change

Lord knows picture me balling
Trapped in this ghetto with my young Gs calling
Hennessy and weed when they bury P
A quarter key 6 Gs when they carry me
Fall on my knees to no nigga
Trapped in this hood raised by chrome trigger
Never had a pops a nigga learned to sling cream
Should have been a chemist the way I work a triple beam
Life is like a page I want to turn
I want to make a change but Lord you let my brother burn
I done seen a nigga lose his life over  stones
Every night my auntie bring a nigga home
Mama worries cause the rent late
3 strikes my cousins doing time upstate
I sent him Camels with no filters
Im in the ghetto slinging stones with straight killers uh
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it bout it
Im from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy rowdy
Is there a heaven for a gangsta Lord put me to sleep
Cause your best friend turned into your enemy
Crooked cops is dirty in this shady game
God take me out the ghetto I want to make a change
