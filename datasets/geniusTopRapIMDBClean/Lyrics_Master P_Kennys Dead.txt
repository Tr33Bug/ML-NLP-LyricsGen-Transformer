Lets welcome Master P
This is Master P
Im down here in South Park
I just put a million dollar reward up
For any information on anybody who know who killed Kenny
Ya heard
Kennys dead 
We got to ride tonight
My little homey Kenny died tonight
thats what I said 
We got to ride tonight
My little homey Kenny died tonight
Kennys dead 
We got to ride tonight
My little homey Kenny died tonight
thats what I said 
We got to ride tonight
My little homey Kenny died tonight
Unh
Kenny strated messin up hangin with the thugs
Cutting class in the fast section see weed and drugs
And I guess thats how it is when the ghetto got you trapped
But Kenny aint scared he seen his pops get his neck snapped
People lie in they sheet on South Park streets
Where the hoes chill and everybody run from the police
But what I liked about Kenny he wasnt no crip or no blood
And he mumbled when he talked but he loved that bud
A lot of hopeless nights chasin nickels and dimes
Kenny rode the other bus to school but at night he did crimes
Two eleven one eighty seven its like a hobby
Kenny slowed his roll he did three years for a robbery
Some say Kenny was the poorest kid on the street
But picture this Kenny with about ten gs and a couple of keys
Huh servin the dope fiends standin on the corner
Moved and worked from New Orleans to Arizona
But it was a trip Kenny always wondered how he would die
Would it be a car crash a plane a gun or suicide
He knew one day that the rats would come
But he didnt know they was gonna scream bout it bout it
And hit him with a shotgun
Unh
A lot of wasted deaths a lot of senseless crime
But everybody think about what you do out there because uh
Judgment day is for everybody
Just remember that uh we cant take none of this wit us
And its real out here on these streets
Id love to live like Kenny
Huh died hes dead aint no comin back
Ya heard me
Hombre Master P No Limit
To the world baby
Dont get no realer than this
