Chorus
Where them niggas at
Where them niggas at
There them niggas go
Uhhhhh
Fuck it lets get em x4
Im a motherfucking soldier
Bitch I thought I told ya I smoke your ass like doja
Niggas mad cause my tapes selling like crack
Sold a million records not one disc came back
You know I gotta repre fuckin sent
My ghetto niggas got me getting paid like the president
But TRU niggas dont yap about it  yap about it 
But when I do some gangsta shit you know I gotta rap about it
I left the dope on the motherfucking table
The feds mad cause we the number one rap label
No Limit records made history in this bitch
And its a myth on how ghetto niggas getting rich
The whole world say they bout it bout it
I drop this ghetto shit and get my thug niggas rowdy
My tank dogs coming through where them niggas at
Ready to hit em P pass me them thangs let me get em
Chorus x4
P man pass me them thangs and let me get em
I be damned if I dont kill a nigga
They shouldnt be fuckin with ya
They dont respect a fucking soldier
They gonna roll or get rolled over or get fucked over
Now I may be the first to go with but you best believe
Thirty niggas came out here to get us thirty niggas gonna bleed
Im here to protect and serve my tank dogs
And any nigga that fuck with us
Colonel get ready to go to war Im hitting hard
A made nigga thats why they call me mister Magic
Busting that niggas that try it Magic and laugh
Im military minding I dont second guess
Click clack blast erasing niggas its all bad
Chorus x4
Nigga I ride for scrilla hang with dealers
Daddy wasnt home so I rode with them killers
And thug niggas high off hennesey and weed
Tatoos and ozs invested in CDs
Now the feds wanna see me dead
Independent black owned and teaching other niggas how to get paid
Ran with some gangs bank for some change
Third ward niggas dont play no fucking games
Me and Silkk CMurder we killers
Plus Magic together a world of TRU niggas
Taking over this rap game
Its No Limit for life lights out Im the trigger man
bang bang bang bang 
OK Im reloading Ha ha
I told yall No Limit niggas we mercenary soldiers
We dont talk we dont rap about niggas
We all about getting our motherfucking paper
A coward dies a million deaths but a soldier only dies once nigga
Real niggas they play the motherfucking game they dont talk nigga
Ha ha yall fake ass niggas yall think about it
Rapping for the motherfucking white folks
We independent black owned nigga
Ghetto niggas ha
Real niggas and bitches unite Ha ha
Fuck fifteen percent nigga I want the whole motherfucking wallet
Talk to the niggas I feed nigga if you got problems
