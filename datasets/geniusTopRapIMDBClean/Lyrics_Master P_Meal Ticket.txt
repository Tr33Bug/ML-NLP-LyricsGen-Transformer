My partner gave me 50 put me in the game
I been slangin weed then I moved up to cane
Pushin them bouldas slangin them quarters
I got em 2 for 3 god dammit now Im a balla
Pushin mad weight from state to state
Niggas ridin dirty on my mobile phone its UGK
Pimp C said P whats really goin on
I said whats really happenin he said I gotta pocket full of stones
Now P be dat new kid on the block
36 OZs choppin up rocks in my rock spot
And label me a drug deala just anotha hard nigga
Rest in peace to 2Pac and the rest of yall thug niggas
Playaz hookin up tryin to make bucks
Sendin work from FedEx to UPS trucks
Now P livin lavish caviar and cabbage
Peppers and beans and grits and cabbage
Down South hustlin ballin slangin
Niggas teamin up some niggas gangbangin
Used to drink 40s now its Moet
Used to roll cutlass now its benzes and vets
Becketts on my fingaz Rolex watches
Hoes on the block bounce that azz I mean pussy poppin
Label me an alien just like Outkast
Cause I made my money from the ghetto and I did it fast
Cause Im bout it yall know Im rowdy
Ask Big Mo and John Henry if yall doubt it
Hooked up with 8ball and MJG
Cause we tryin to get a meal ticket from these streets
Hook 
Tryin to get a meal ticket  8X 
8ball and MJG southside representin a nigga came to mention
These hoes cant touch my pimpin
Mobbin through the swamp P and me and G and UGK
Hustlin as a muthafucka fuck what these hoes say
Cause we each be lookin for meal tickets witches drivin me crazy
Lady can I claim yo baby honey call me the shady maybe
Construct the thinkin were turnin to duckies bankin
No laws somebody save me a slice of meat up in my grave
Captain Save Em pay em before you get to lay em
Got a real niggas job so damn hard tryin to play em
Weigh em no weigh me cause thats what they gon pay me
Pimpin aint their baby just ask MJG
Who be I MJG he be me
But if I was he and you was I who would you see
Where is justice when ya hungry or do it only
Pertainin bustas fakes and phonies
About that money where my ticket
Hook  8X 
Cocaine lady white lady sellin good
Im leanin on the leather and Im grippin on the wood
Im peeling on the Grant ballin in the slant
Back Im Pimp C bitch and trill niggas roll Cadillac
Bad ass bitches cant leave my dick alone
I done bought me a key and changed my name to James Jones
Pimpin aint dead ya heard what I said
How the fuck is pimpin dead when bitches still givin me head
Lickin my ass and butt be the deala
Suck the nut up out a  bucket slow down suave nigga
Now bitch I be the prince of pushin everything up out of Port Arthur the king of them quarters
Fuckin with nothin but queens and they daughters
Get cleansed weeded and watered I flow like a Asian Malaysian
Saudi Arabian African I be blazin
In the Golden Gate swish it out holdin weight I hits the block Im
Rollin bait Them fiends come out they know they got to stole the case
I motivate fiends dealas ballas hatas shops and boppas
Jekll and Hyde Bonnie and Clyde and niggas that ride with Glocks and choppas
Where we out
Hook and fade
