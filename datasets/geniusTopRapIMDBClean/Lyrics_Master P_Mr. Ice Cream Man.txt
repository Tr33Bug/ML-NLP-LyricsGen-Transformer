Hit the block dressed in white with some baggy Girbauds
A pocket full of stones three Gs and tryna lose these hoes
And the task comin sick cause its the first of the month
Fiends on my pager like Im tryna take these fools to lunch
Goin crazy and ghettos tryna kill me
My little homies lost his life yall fools feel me
I pack up heat cause Im paranoid at night time
Brothas be pullin jacks Im in the hood bustin gangsta rhymes
And still gotta watch my back in the hood G
Like Spice 1 say these fools livin like the movies
Little kids get bout it I mean my hood is rowdy
Im tryna make a dollar out fifteen cent before Im up and outtie
Before you jump in the game  Ugh

Breakin fiends off boulders I mean A1 soda
Duckin the task and tryna hide from the rollers
And hangin with TRU soldiers my TRU clique we true to this

And if you fiends want a lick nothin for free thats gon cost you twenty bones
For yall ballers that want weight call me on the pager
