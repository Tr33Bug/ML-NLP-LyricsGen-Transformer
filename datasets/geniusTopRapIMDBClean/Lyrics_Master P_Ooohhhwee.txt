I know a big girl with a ironed skirt
Give her couple dollars shell make it work
I mean holla at me whoadie you know our crew large
My fantasys to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane some exotic cars
From a Bentley to a Lex girl bring the toys
On the dance floor shawty started takin it off
Took her to the VIP started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her Wait it dont stop keep drinkin the Cris
Im a country boy just like the Dukes of Hazzard
See a fine chick you know Im gon grab her
Annie May girl where you at
This No Limit boy tryin to do that thang
I said Rock the boat dont let it sank
Its time to go to war I got the tank
Say that then

You know Weebie and Master P we gon tank it up tank it up
Turn around to the ground you know how it goes
Catch the flow tippietoe come and wobble some mo
Like you know how I do it so dont act surprised
For a fact gotchu dancin til you hurtin your thighs
Now wontcha tune it up and wobble wit it
Act a fool and wobble wit it
Wontcha make it hustle ooh baby dont pull a muscle
Gotcha workin on the wall til you run outta breath

Now you could shake it like a dog break my fuckin balls
Do it how ya do it lemme see ya take it off


Now wontcha rock rock on rock rock on rock rock on
Rock rock on rock rock on rock rock on rock rock on rock
Now wontcha turn around and hustle wit it
Back it up and hustle wit it test around and hustle wit it
Ooh baby ooh baby
Mary had a big ol butt in them tight ass jeans itd show
And every club that Mary was at them thugs were sure to go
I mean she had bowlegs wit the curves just like a bottle
Project chick but pretty just like a model
When Im rollin through the hood she on dubs
Dont mind gettin in and shakin her thang in the club
I mean beat bopper she loved the tote shoppers
Call her head nurse then Imma be the doctor
A real country mamma cook grits and eggs
And she wont leave the farm except to get paid
Candies on twat cause she love to ball
Find her at the mizzle on the dresser or the mall
Buyin high heels on some leather boots
Or lookin for them ballers wit the crazy loot WHAT
Where them No Limit boys at Throw them bows
Them No Limit girls get money and what
Told yall clowns aint no stoppin us
Putcha Gameface on when ya catchin us
