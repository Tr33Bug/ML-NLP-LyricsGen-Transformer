RIP Tupac Lyrics samples from 2Pac albums 
Follow me
I see death around the corner
Master P 
Ya thought it was over
But its only the beginnig thug niggas dont die
One born every minute 2 pac dont leave
Thats what theyre screaming
But theese niggas on this earth is the demons
God call my dog its time to move on
You a rider jump in the Pimp caddy
Get youre cruise on
God got you now no more penitentiary
Youse a soldier nigga you made history
Hoes moaning no more pain
Took my dogs to another place another gang
Its still westside till we die
Niggas roll reminisce and getting high
Thug nigga no more tears moma shared
No more pain in the muthaphukkin new year
Cause youre in heaven with the other Gs
We scream Makaveli to our enemies
Youre like a ghost to the niggas in the Eastcoast
Makaveli number one in every recordstore
You live life to the fullest then you die
You taught niggas never run just ride
Killaz thats what you hanged with
Gangstaz thats what you banged with
You felt dead around the corner but you came out
Real niggas dont change thats whats youse about
You taught niggas to take pain be a man
Thats why 2Pac nigga scream your name
Tatooed up with tshirt
When you die you say ashes and no dirt
See youse a legend in your own time
Ghetto millionaire from gangsta rhyme
Cause your real to the fullest
If you had a trigga nigga you pull it
RIP to my thug niggas see you in the crossroads
Rough from Master P MUCH LOVE NIGGA
Westside niggas feel this
Eastside niggas feel this
Southside niggas feel this
Me and West niggas feel this
Thug niggas wont ya feel this
2Pac was the realest
I see death around the corner
