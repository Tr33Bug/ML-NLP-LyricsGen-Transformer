RIP Lyrics
Rest in peace fool
This for all my niggas that aint here
RIP to my homies that are dead and gone
Rest in peace to my homies that done made it home
RIP to Danny and Darnelle
I reminice on when my broter Kevin got killed
I cant sleep I know its sad
One day they gon put P up in a body bag
I watch movies like Ghost
Wonderin if my brother really know who slit his motherfuckin throat
And when they gone yall thought it was a poem
And the ghettos tryin to kill me Im still tryin to make it home
And mama cry and daddy say son realize
Just remember one day we all gotta die
I cant trip Im sinkin with this ship
In the projects you know its one big battlefield
Where everybody dont give a fuck about another life
And lil kids dont give a fuck about another life
They quick to put chu to that other game
And if you lose in that battlefield then thats yo ass man
And yo life is sinkin on with them other niggas
Cause they dead and gone now what the fuck is goin on
To underestimate you see ya own fate
You straight gettin poped in the ShowMe State
Two slugs to the face man brace yourself
While other cats view the body at the wake
And I hate to think about what we gonna miss out on
Knowin yo ass is gone
Cause I know we gonna miss em
And I hate the fact that a brother done passed on
The things we do we gotta deal with
Can ya feel it on the reala
Watchin the blood spill from the veins of a real one
RIP cause ya couldve been a G
And still alive to kick it with me
Never let it fade cause ya locked in a grave
RIP to my homies


Im constantly surrounded by death
And my citys so scandalous
So I step with a half cockin that stainless steel
Cause I feel that I have to be strapped
Cause I learned from all of my dead folks mishaps
A lot of my dogs took a fall
Cause of a flaw on the streets when concernin mail
Between two brothers been homies forever
When lookin past the yellow tape fool I cant tell
This is the world I live in
My world is consumed by chaos
Makin me not want to get too close to folks
In fear of the pain Ill feel
When anothers called off hauled off
In a Caddy brown tryin to hang on let em go
I shed a few tear I spilled some beer
And appear to be at peace
But inside Im so cold
Cause I think of how my homie caught slugs to the mug
And I cant let that be me
Keep ya memory close to my heart
So may ya soul rest in peace
Now why life be so hard
I beend down with these wars
Since Ses my ace caught a slug to the chest
From a tech and I hope he finally at rest
See thats why I didnt cry when my homie died Lord hear me
Too many murderers and drug dealers and killers standin in me
Lord forgive me
Im bout ready to check it out but Imma stick it out like a G
Cause its a sin for me to kill myself
And I wont let a nigga kill me
Ima try to hold on to these memories
But it seems all my homies done changed since elementary
Now life is the same as death and thats kind of bad to me
For every nonblack males born one dies thats kind of like sad to see
I lost my brother behind some jealousy
Not stayin on his toes livin carelessly
From the cradle to grave I always see a better day
RIP to my Gs and I hope they in a better place
Yeah this for all my motherfuckin true soldiers
Thats gone with the wind ya know what Im sayin
All my niggas that restin in peace
Hope yall in a better place homie
Cause its hell on Earth nigga know what Im sayin
We see yall in the crossfire
For all my true soldiers rest in peace fool
And uh No Limit till I die
See yall niggas on the other side
RIP to my homies that are dead and gone
And to all my niggas Down South hustlin
Just remember stack ya mail live life to the fullest
Cause ya cant take none of this shit with ya
And always keep ya eye on the enemy
Might be ya best friend but watch yourself homie
Oh yeah the most important thing never trust a bitch
Cause a bitch only out for the money
Know what Im sayin
Remember that though
Yeah playa RIP
