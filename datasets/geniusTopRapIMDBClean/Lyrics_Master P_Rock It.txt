No Limit
Imma make yall have it for a minute
But we want it back for the next 5 years
Hit the dancefloor whodi
The new No Limit baby
Respect it or check it
Master P 5th Ward Weebie
Krazy
You got to rock the boat

Ooh ooh baby come on you can wobble wit it
Ooh ooh baby come on you can hustle wit it
Do the Beattown Mo get cocky wit it

They call me the Ghetto Bill got the keys to the city
Hit the club for the girls lookin pretty
Big butts with them littlebitty waistes
Ghetto fab but looks just like a waitress
Rip on her name was Sonya
Roxanne Monique I put it on ya
It aint No Limit to the change I got
You see the Bentley on the 20s in the parking lot
Hennessy and trees thats all I need
Back it up dont stop
Hit the floor make it drop
Rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat

Put a hump in your back and lift your rump
Now bring it around the world wont you jump for me
Bounce bounce baby baby make it jump for me
Where your head go at when you want it from the back

You can dance if you wanna do it if you wanna
Move it in a circle and put that thing in the corner
Shake if you wanna shake shake baby

We all thugs but I aint gonna hurt nobody
Make it shake girl work that body
I want one thick like Bubblicious
That can clean the house and do the dishes
Im lookin for a girl that can twurk
A thug chick that can put in work
Handle business with a miniskirt
Jump suave with a P Miller purse
Handle business on the dance floor make it twurk
Drop it like a dog then make it jerk
If I was in it theyd call me Don Juan
Gettin cash then chickens is no crime
VIP is Crys and Moet
Still thuggin Tshirts and sweats
Ice cube on my finger 10 karats
I can swing a bat and break a record like Barry
Now Rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat
Rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat rock the boat
It goes left right left right
Left right left right left right left right
Make that thing whistle

Move around and whistle
Twurk for that thing dont stop it till ya whistle
Put your Game Face on
