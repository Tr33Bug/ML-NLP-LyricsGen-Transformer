Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all this hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
Pop the locks on the Benz steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley mustve been a coward
No more hit em up like in the old days
Homies ride with Mack 10s and AKs
Thats why I roll by myself I mean alone
Cause haters be all up on
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Dont wanna see you make no money then take ya
And try to figure out how to get what you got
Cause haters be the same niggas on your spot
Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
How do hatin get started Its started by the jealous people
And they get mad over the things you have and the things theyll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors Im really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla fool dont mess
Im only in with a few cause these bitchmade niggas is actors
See I done had to many gunins runins with these ass backwards
Nonpackers Im strapped like P or C
Just in case these niggas after me capture me
Forget Im goin out with a blast
And I put that on some cash Im standin last
For some ass yall young crazed punks are trippin
Dont hate me nigga and go head and credit my dippin
Im admittin that Im not only on the twat
But I know I got stopped on the 
Its understood that Im not one of the best young playas that ever lived
But I got some advice to give and that is


Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
I wonder why they hatin for Probably cause we got Gs
All mad cause we makin moves cause we got keys
But really I cant save em
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know yous a motherfuckin playa
And Imma try to make yall kill me in a matter of lines
I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me
When I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes upon my enemies I gotta watch my friends
Like when Im sittin on top or ridin a Benz
Why dont yall go out yalls ass up and get somethin
Dont worry about how I got mines
Always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine
And kill me
It kills me
Its disgusting cause I got a few Gs
They try to rob me
But the white manll make it they wont touch em
Smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
But I just cant call it or catch
But I still got Gs and Im still ballin
Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
Look at all these haters surroundin me every day
Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
