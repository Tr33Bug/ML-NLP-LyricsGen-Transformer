 Master P 
I dont know where Im going to
But selling dope is the only thing
God knows how to do
Damn indo you got to handle that dank
Time tonight
Im deep up in the game I cant sleep at night
And momma praying cause she know her boy aint living right
And when I die they say Im going out by the gunsmoke
Cause I refuse to be broke up in this ghetto
See I been tripping all life cause life is a damn trip
And when I leave the house you know Im carrying an extra clip
See in the 90s things all gone change
I never thought Id grow up to be the dope man
But in reality I guess I damn lost it all
Cause just the other day i put my brothers name on the wall
Rest in peace yeah they done killed him G
I know one day somebody is going to try to kill the P
And if they do I guess it was my time to go
But if they miss you will be reading about some dead folks
In other words can you feel me and if you from my hood
You know the ghettos tryin to kill me
Chorus repeat 2X
The ghettos trin to kill me
They might send me to the pen but doing time that dont scare me
Master P 
Im selling dope and my baby mommy she wants me to quit
But i cant cause the game gives me dividends
See in the game hella my partners they depend on me
So when I go out Im going out like my dead homies
Forty Gs two keys in the crackhouse
Popos on my drawers you know the Ps gon smash out
Never trust nobody cant even trust my chick
And when my kids grow up they know their daddys a lunitic
Drivebys in the ghetto happen all night long
Call me Master P killer call me Al Capone
Because when I die they probably wont remember me
But while Im here those marks know they cant fade the P
You seeing fatal when you messin with this dope click
But if you run on the P you get your wig split
For the jealous suckers thats out to kill me
Im going to reverse the game partna can you feel me
Chorus repeat 4X
King George 
Yeah There Something Always Got To Be Strapped
247 3 Bustin Caps That I Am Gang Im Playing And Dont Know The Game And Im Being The Pain
Your Mouth To Blow Spoke

 Silkk The Shocker 
I lost 2 brothers in the gear and I cant cope
I try to go straight but I still end up selling dope
Reminiscing on my childhood and it aint the same
I never thought my occupation was going to be the dope game
Two keys a day you never see so much coke
Three oclock up in the morning chopping up dope
Reaching for my gat soon as I hear the slightest noise
Just come from a funeral and it got me paranoid
Having flashbacks of this fool I smoked with my gat
He living if hes real hell be coming back
But if Im going out Im going out with a bang
Suckers jealous because Im Silkk riding on those thangs
Having visions of how Im going to die G
Will I die up in this game or die in my sleep
Thats why im packing a piece yall should feel me
I aint paranoid I know this ghetto is tryin to kill me
Chorus repeat 4X
Yeah like my partna Too hort said
Get In Where You Fit In
Just remember Life Is Too hort
