Woke one morning tears in my eyes
The feds kicked in the door and caught me and my baby by surprise
He got high but they didnt find no dope
They said it was conspiracy just cause a hater said so
Now we might do time in the penn
But the state dont have a case without witnesses and no evidence
So I guess once again that its on
But I really wish the haters would just leave us alone
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Do what you gotta do boy
Do what you gotta do girl
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Thinkin about you
Im thinkin about you
My enemies hate me money cant make me
Bitches cant break me the feds cant take me
Give me four or five months and Im out
It must be love momma put up the house
And the game wont change nigga still the same nigga
Real thangs and little change nigga
But um I gotta do what I gotta
Even if it take us slangin CDs and narcotics
I gotta little sware when the penetentiary
Cause on these streets are heaven or hell
Now picture me balling
I love No Limit like sex and dont plan on falling
Im thinkin about you girl
Im thinkin about you boy
So do what you gotta do girl
So do what you gotta do boy
Im thinkin about you girl
Thinkin about you boy
Im thinkin about you
Thinkin about you
Motherfucking right Im a take it how it come like a soldier
TRU click TRU bitch go to war for ya
In the kitchen at the stove cooking up the product
Cause fiends love it most when you give it to em rocked up
Chopped up bitches in the game that was talking
But they didnt know hoes got them feds stalking
Playing peekaboo plotting on the front door
But all the goin find is some ghetto dope
So come on so would you just let a bitch live
Stack my ends and raise my kids
Ride my benz flow my ice
Teaching all them ghetto bitches how to live this life
Why yall fools trying to knock this bitch
Its the tank so you know you cant stop this
Watch this young black family take this whole industry
And run it thinkin bout you while we done it
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Do what you gotta do boy
Do what you gotta do girl
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Thinkin about you
Im thinkin about you
Im thinkin about you girl

So do what you gotta do girl
So do what you gotta do boy
