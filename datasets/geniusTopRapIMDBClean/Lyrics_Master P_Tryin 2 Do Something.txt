Ugh ha do that to one of those tenderonies
And uh that mean you trying to do something
Im trying to do something yall hear that
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be real with ya look Im trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be blunt with ya look Im trying to do something
Maybe its the bud in me or the thug in P
Got these ghetto hotties wanting to put they love in me
Im a G from the CP3 and dedicated
Screaming No Limit Soldiers and these playa haters hate it
Relax shorty hit the blunt drop the Ruger
Come close to a nigga let the P seduce ya
Work it like a Solo Flex say you wanna a ruffneck
Cristal and strawberries weed smoking rough sex
I want you to open your legs as wide as you could
So I can hit from the back with this nickle plated wood
Up and down like a roller coaster
From your stomach to your back
Let a gangsta poke ya
I aint trippin never slippin cause I got straps
9 months later we aint bustin no caps
Crispy clean no strings attached
Little bumpngrind miss thang are you with that
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be real with ya look Im trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be blunt with ya look Im trying to do something
I heard you want a real man
Wont you lay up here and give me the chance
I aint saying romance and what you got can be enhanced
Im matured enough and I aint approach you for nothing
And the reason I came up off it cause you working with something
Now I done had a little herb now I done build up the nerve
On top of that my head tight from everything the bar serve
Im pitching cause your curves got me wanting to slide home
And prove that I flip other things besides zones
Tell ya girls ya gone baby you gots to roam
Who leaving with Fiends he get it on get it on
You could make me moan so you up for screwing me
Please use ingenuity when you doing me
Damn your dress in blues with you matching hat and shoes
Pretty legs but knees gone get bruised
Aint no one gonna get used
Now cut the bullshits and bluffings
Straight to the point shorty
Look Im trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be real with ya look Im trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be blunt with ya look Im trying to do something
Back stage at the concerts peepin
You wanted me to see you and Im thinking about creepin
Far from home destination unknown rock bone
Hotel booked and I dont wanta be alone
Maybe its the tone got me visualizing this song
Camouflauge love all night making me moan
Thug passion in the back seat ripping off your fashion
Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin
Im here tonight and the vibe is right
Red and blue lights are glowing over Brian McKnight
But tomorrow my flight and Ill be outta your sight
Take my address down so you can write
But for now lets do something
Fuck the frontin and the talking
My dogs just about barkin
Take your outfit off and put the soldiers shit on
And go to war with me
Pager numbers on the desk
Hit me when you trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be real with ya look Im trying to do something
The eye contact that you and I share
Make me wanna be real and make these niggas disappear
If I could I would
And I aint even frontin
Im gonna be blunt with ya look Im trying to do something
