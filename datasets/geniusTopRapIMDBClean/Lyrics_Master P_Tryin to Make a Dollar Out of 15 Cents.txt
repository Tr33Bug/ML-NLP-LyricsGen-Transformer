See its a fucked up life that Im livin in
Hit that slang cola cause I didnt have no dividends
My baby mama stressin she dont want me to slang dope
The ghettos tryin to kill me which way should I go
Now Im on the corner takin penitentiary chances
Even though theres marks on my turf that cant stand me
Think to myself one should I leave
Two say fuck em and continue hit my weed
I guess Im a G about my scrilla cause they dashin
Fools know that P is quick to put em in the casket
The game got me stressin but the P aint gon stress out
Even though the task just raided a niggas house
Took a loss in the game tryin to bubble up
Find the P deep in the grind slangin the dope fiends double ups
And pretty soon Ill be back to a whole thang
And if I had to do it again Id probably do the same thang
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent

Man it aint nothin but a thang to let yo nuts hang
Cause in this game a million niggas striving for the same thang
I know it be like on on my block
Niggas must be on the cell while another on the short stop
It wont stop and it wont quit
Tell me another quick way for a nigga to check a grip shit
Im kinda in a rush its kinda like a must
To get some In God We Trust
Bein broke sure aint no joke
Cause I barely got enough money to buy me a whole loaf
And niggas be spendin money like record
So I moved from Mike Chester to Girbaud pocket check it
Cause unless a niggas out there singin Shoop
Or playin hoops he aint gon never see no signs of no quick loot
Dank costs ten and the drank costs five
So I gots to have more in my pocket than a nickel and a dime bitch
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin

Gold fronts in my mouth hella dope and got my bags tight
Bitches on my dick cause they know the P rags are tight
But I aint trippin off no hoochies with no lil skirt
Id rather deal with them Turks puttin in work
They caught up in some dirt
Cause Im the ice cream man droppin off hella loads
Vanilla stawberry cherry bitch I even got Rocky Road
Take yo pick I know you dope fiends wanna lick
But thats gon cost you twenty bones case you hoes want a hit
I love you you love me
But this ice cream dont go for free
Its a ten twenty fifty hundred dollar sack a cone
And if you aint spendin bring yo broke ass home
Gold ones on my vehicle fools they cant see me though
Tens for twenty  nigga thats plenty  meet me at the liquor store
Fiends want credit but cha know I cant fade ya
And when you get yo cash together call me on my pager
Im stressin off the game I barely get sleep
I just had to bury my little partner last week
In and out of alleys gettin chased by the 50
I gotta get my hustle on my way of survival
And if I get caught I got played
But I aint goin out without two stones to the head
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
How come when I was broke you wasnt brown nosin

Cause Im the ice cream man
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
