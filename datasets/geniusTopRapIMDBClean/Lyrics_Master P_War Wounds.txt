Every soldier got a story to tell
I done been through it all
Dont ask the way I shoot cuz I done shot  uggh 
Put a tank on my block
Fiend gone get the scene hot
Greens and rocks
Burnin flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga
Been tapped up ready to die from mail niggas
Straight goin to hell
But livin the dirty dirty
Havin yah mama worry
That   
Tired of being blast at but didnt cast that
I done asked for my life and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked   
Blast back
Told em to cast that take these rounds and add that
But fact is you dont fuckin choose yo wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns
Check my war wounds  uggggh 
My war wounds  ugggh 
Every soldier got a story to tell
My adversarys get popped
Got me runnin from cops
The ghettos like Vietnam
Got me carryin two Glocks
My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drivebys and rags
And representin red and blue flags
See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos
Pullin in car dos
And cut up Girbauds

Im down tah blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if Im old G Ill be down to ride and die
If the hood call me
Thats why I be hustin every day
Could you imagine me with no stash
Like a bank with no cash
Tryna drive a car with no gas
And fuck one day with no tag
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
An alright girl with no ass
See Im a Richmond rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans
See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo shit
And the nigga tah be the grave digga
See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been stabbed popped at and shot at
But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I aint forgot that
Its real shits real check my war wounds
This here real life aint no fuckin cartoons
Im the Saudi Arabian death killin veteran of the platoon
Either me or you right here
Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in aint no turnin back
Lay yo ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
Theres no overcome to this shit
Be on yo Ps and Qs nigga
Dont cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga thats a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga thats a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why Im gone
If I die bitch box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the NO with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin sayin fuck Iraq
If you dont believe me check my combat patch
I got a muthafuckin story to tell
Nigga nigga what
A muthafuckin story to tell  What 
Fool I got a muthafuckin story tah tell
And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas bank niggas
Do mo fo show
Seven cluckas fake dough
Stayin way cut throat
I hang out slang out at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall
Sippin 8 ball
Eastside rollin dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me and youll see how Gs move
Its written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies
Thats why Im so OG
Look when half of you niggas couldnt come outside
When yall was learnin how tah sing
I was learnin how tah bang and ride
Fo sho bro I told yah
Ima gangsta soulja blowin doja
What a story tah tell
