The game of life done changed
The old dope game is now called the rap game
In other words you cant trust nobody
Moneys the root of all evil
I can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
Hit the road with motherfuckin casket closed
Young nigga fourteen doin death row
Look in the eyes of some killers drug dealers
From the projects young niggas
Pullin hits in the ghetto to make change
Gats cocked niggas blastin on other gangs
Young villians in the ghetto starvin
Hennessy and green when a young nigga ballin
Pull the plug if they shot me
Just die every nigga and bitch that tried to stop me
Just a young nigga tryna make skrilla
Learnin double it up with the killas and the drug dealers
Ugggggggggh 
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
Its hard times on the blocks in the projects
Call my girl up in time to flip a county check
I got cocaine weed and amphetamines
Pac said P keep your eyes on your enemies
I aint trustin no nigga or no bitch
Thats the recipe in the hood nigga to get rich
Thugs keep their gats right beside them
True niggas keep their gats cause we riders
Hold the gauge motherfucker while I blow his head
Hit the horn motherfucker two niggas dead
RIP tattoos weed and Hennessy
Blow dust to the motherfuckin enemies


If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
In school its pencils and pads and books
In the ghetto its Tecs and killers and crooks
I done seen bloodshed over blood money
I done seen niggas kill over drug money
Got the game from some OG ballin
Down here 3rd Ward Calliope New Orleans
I wont change til they bury me a paid nigga
I wont change cause P is a made nigga
I got killers and dealers on my side
I got homies and jackals ready to ride
Got the game in my vein cause Im bout this
How many niggas out there really doubt this
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
Camouflage and all that murder murder kill kill and shit
Bad nigga from the bricks blood on my kicks
Seen it all in the project halls and the street corners
Never choked even when those folks ran up on us
Soldier rag sag on my eye no lie
Fuck with me for sure die no lie
How many niggas follow my lead the envious swallow my feed
Layin niggas down  lay em down nigga  like apollo creed if need
Got my game from that nigga versal
Keep your enemies close shoot first and show the fakers no mercy
Never dance with them youngsters in your life nigga
You dont wanna live amongst us we aint right
I was born in it yall niggas was sworn in it
Fuck around and get your whole click tormented
Bullet proof vest cover my chest so you best
Aim for my brain if you tryin to put me to rest  we riders 
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
If you want me come get me how the fuck you gon take me
I got my TRU niggas with me and we riders
