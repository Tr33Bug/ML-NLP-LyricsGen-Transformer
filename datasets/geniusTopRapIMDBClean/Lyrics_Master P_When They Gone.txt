Its 1995 a lot of brothers done died
A lot of sisters them mothers them fathers
And aunties and grandmas left to cry
Now he nothing but a memory used to be a friend to me
Said hed never die but now hes six feet deep with a tombstone
Oh my god my brothers gone
And I dont even fucking think I can go on
Cause it hurts to lose someone you love
To this madness and killing murder shootemup this game of drugs
Doctors pumped his chest my daddy said let him rest
A team rolled up and put him to his final test
Hands got cold god rest his soul
He walked out his body to another fucking episode
Then the window opened then they put him in the final frontier
You know what happened in the end
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front back side to side
But who would be the next victim to roll in that black ride
Front back side to side
It might be you to be the next victim to take a ride in the black ride
Just another homicide for the West County Times
Fools gettin took out the game at the fuckin drop of a dime
The games gettin deep I toss in my sleep
But would a young nigga live to see 23
Killing dont phase me fools think Im crazy
Muslims on every corner handin out black daisies
Name scratched off the wall aint no final call
Used to slang bean pies now its bout that white ball
Only fifteen already got fiends
And working the ghetto like Jack Stark could work some beans
Livin off a high gold ones on this ride
Bitches on the side but only livin to retire
Aint that a shame took him out the game
Same fool we used to roll with yelled out his name
Popped him in his chest didnt wear his vest
Same day his kid took his first step he took his last breath
Whos under the white sheet Somebody bring the yellow tape
The ghetto took him under today will be a sad day
Aint no time to cry no time to shed no tears
You know the way he died the same way he lived
Who was his killer Found him dead on his knee
Same room he left his wife and kid left to grieve
Hopin that this a nightmare one pop and hes outta there
God rest his soul left his kid in a wheelchair
Stabbed for his life his daddy took the ghetto flight
And at the funeral mama say Boy you know its gonna be alright
But now hes gone aint nobody to run his home
Another kingpin stripped from that ghetto throne
Lost at the game of life aint no time to think twice
The same fool he trusted and now sleeps with his wife
Tagged his toe slapped him in the ziplock
Another nigga flipflop popped while slanging that crack rock
Now hes gone Amazing Grace his last song
Six ballers carried out the church to take his ass home
4 limos 3 Cutlass 2 El Doggs a cop and the hearse
Everybody had their lights on
When the straps pops to lower him down in the grave
See it was sad the way his fucking family misbehave
His family crying but everybody gots to die
But you wont feel what they feel until somebody in your family dies
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
I wish I could seen him before he died
Talk to him but when they gone thats when we realize
Front back side to side
But who will be the next victim to roll in that black ride
Front back side to side
It might be you the next victim to take a ride in the black ride
Front back side to side
It might be me the next victim to take a ride in the black ride
