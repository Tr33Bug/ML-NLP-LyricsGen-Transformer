Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin white we wont sell it no more
Im like Trump aint feelin us cops still killin us
Niggas takin shots cant stop me they aint real enough
Cut her off act like shes dead and its killin her
New Dawn Hermes seat I let the ceiling up
Just to kill em softly ooh get em off me
Try to crucify me like Im Jesus the way she cross me
Im too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo on point like an arrow
We started off with zero now Im seein Ms
Diamonds like water and they jumpin out the gym
Shootin like Harden if your head was the rim
Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim damn
Back when I was broke they was cool with it
Now every move I make Im in the news with it
Even if I aint do it they be like You did it
My teacher always used to tell me You gon lose nigga
Thats why I never went to school nigga
And why Im rappin like I got somethin to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp I get two with it
Move with it cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin thotties in the Phantom thats the way of life
And make em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin for the Glock every time I play the light
Im on 12 oclock every time I play them bikes
Im with the pack uh gettin back yeah
Spendin dope nigga sellin smack gang
Im gettin chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah 10 mil in cash of Ethika thats a fact
Money power respect eatin breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset they aint see me fall yet
Wins and losses
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
Im on some shit that they aint seen before
Dream chasin catchin all my goals
And I dont need these whores
Im gettin money me and all my woes
Play with me you know its allout war
The young niggas goin all out for us
Bloggers in a frenzy truck to the Bentley
Aint doin no interviews Im busy nigga we litty
So when you see me out dont ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens we was servin fiends
40 bust your windows out Jazmine Sullivan
They told em pop Mollys I told em to be kings
Sippin 1942 like its lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So Ima give it to em every time Im on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it I go through it dont show it
I told niggas who wrote it aint takin back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon rob me put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing bout Meek Milly Ima get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan totin Ks like its Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
Im on some shit that they aint seen before
Dream chasin catchin all my goals
And I dont need these whores
Im gettin money me and all my woes
Play with me you know its allout war
The young niggas goin all out for us
Talkin this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel why you son him Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek call me like 94
Mean nothin to me I tell you how it gotta go
Rain sleet on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap we started poppin though
Heard that bitch say she cut me I was like adis
In the field knock em down it look like dominoes
Young nigga I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies now they straight nigga
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
Im on some shit that they aint seen before
Dream chasin catchin all my goals
And I dont need these whores
Im gettin money me and all my woes
Play with me you know its allout war
The young niggas goin all out for us
