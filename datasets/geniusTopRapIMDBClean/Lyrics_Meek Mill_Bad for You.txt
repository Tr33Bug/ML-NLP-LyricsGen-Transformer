You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
Im a good girl but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be badadad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
And they say bad girls aint no good
Good girls aint no fun
I still cant find a nigga that touch that
I dont know one
And I aint searching for it
Never trust but Im working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool you surfing on it
Like Yonce do the surfboard surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didnt show
Second year we couldnt hide it
Funny part they didnt know
How could something thats so wrong feel so right
But who to tell you this wrong though This your life
Word up
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
Im a good girl but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be badadad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
We just fucking up the city going hard every night
Niggas hating on us you know lord they aint right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts aint do them girls right
But you broke hearts too but that boy aint fight
So they dont deserve it it feel like its perfect
Im loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see whats inside
You know that its pride you say that Im worth it
But said I aint ready really Im ready
Really Im ready Im ready like never before
Imma just give you a key to my heart
Youll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Aint trust them before
You know what youre doing fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed its like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform sing it
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
Im a good girl but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be badadad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
