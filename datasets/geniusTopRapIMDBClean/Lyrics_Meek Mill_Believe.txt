You know I still believe still believe in you and me
Cause every night I go to sleep go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still I raise up to take back the crown yes
You can break my body
But you cant lock the soul of a man down  Yeah uh 
Follow your dreams not your addictions
How we gon follow our dreams locked in a prison
They tried to swallow me whole God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but Im relentless
I want the money aint never want attention
So I dont pay attention to comments and all the mentions
Cause they aint see my vision
I was washin dishes til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We aint even barely get presents but we was gifted
In the school of failure we present perfect attendance
Welfare baby we workin with what they give us
Made me some commas judge still gave me a sentence
No period city girls dont get scared when its really real
When your bank account twenty mil and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway you walk out and see the grill
Thank God you believe make sure you pray when you kneel yeah
You know I still believe still believe in you and me
Cause every night I go to sleep go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still I raise up to take back the crown yes
You can break my body
But you cant lock the soul of a man down  Yeah uh 
My bank account it was on superzero
Aint never panic Im a superhero  Uh 
Target my goals and Ima shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me he said You De Niro
Play your part got some brains like the scarecrow
Lets play it smart cause we aint playin checkers this is chess play your pawns
Sit back like a king when they move make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart  Take your heart 
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf Im trippin  Im trippin 
Laws of attraction you just think Im rappin
Im just puttin out the energy so I can grab it
Everything thats in my memory that I imagined
Its finally here hundred million in a year


I still believe still believe in you and me
Cause every night I go to sleep go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still I raise up to take back the crown yes
You can break my body
But you cant lock the soul of a man down
As I lay  As I lay  me down to sleep  Down to sleep 
Pray the Lord  Pray  my soul to keep  Soul to keep 
Fallen ones  Fallen ones  rest in peace  RIP 
Please God watch over me  Watch over me 
As I lay  As I lay  me down to sleep  Down to sleep 
Pray the Lord  Pray  my soul to keep  My soul to keep 
Fallen ones  Fallen ones  rest in peace  RIP 
Please God watch over me
