This is my blues
Cause Im back down on my own again
This is the blues Im playing
Yes its a fine old thing
When the night is cold and low
This is a Dollar Bill beat 
Was it the money that made me a savage
Poppin them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me Im so excited to be
Started with nothin we had to inspire to be
Niggas aint flyer than me Im getting to it
Feel like the man I got the plan
I call the shooters they hop out the van
Play with the squad get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc Im goin ham
Im goin crazy on niggas too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
Im in the kitchen compressin a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler Im bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in 03
I got the plug he send em OT
Dont know these niggas these niggas know me
Even old niggas they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it werent round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there my G
This is my blues
Do me one favor take a few steps back
Cause Im back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself nigga
This is the blues Im playing
Congratulations its the motherfuckin Chasers
Yes its a fine old thing
You feel me We on it
When the night is cold and low
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put em on money
And show em some love
You did me a favor I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
Its only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood yeah nigga
Member they told me that we would fail
Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
Im in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and Im sick of jail
No disease but Im sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell
This is my blues
Cause Im back down on my own again
This is the blues Im playing
Yes its a final thing
When the night is cold and low
