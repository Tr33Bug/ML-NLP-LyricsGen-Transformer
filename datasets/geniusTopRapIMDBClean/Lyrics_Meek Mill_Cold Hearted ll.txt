Woah dont you baby hey
It wont matter baby
Dont you know
Dont you know
Woah dont you baby hey
It wont matter baby
Dont you know
Dont you know
Uh make it out the hood they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like Im Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me see nobody stood
And I was lookin at you niggas all the ones I fed
Had me grindin all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something nigga gon ahead
Treat you like I never knew you put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like When you comin home
My mama see it in my face she know that somethin wrong
Bodies droppin in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin on
Cause I cant let em take my life you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasnt right but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet we like three deep we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night we stayin down
For the love of them millions aint layin down
Left you in the hood what you sayin now
And niggas wanted the smoke you said Stand down uh
Cold heart never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef I had to tell niggas You better come
Sister said they gettin over its like you lettin them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from uh
Checkin in checkin out I just had to check you out
2012 it was 50 niggas when Im steppin out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I aint lend it out
I aint even know you was upset thats what this shit about
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you cant bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close talkin closer than my neighbors
Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides catch them vapors
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
See I look at it like this
What Im supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin my lights out
Goin city to city cant take my son to school when I want to cant see my mama my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money then act like he hangin with me
I aint never been sweet
Far as I can remember every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I aint never even think about a nigga callin my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while Im doin this time in the cell
Actin like I owe you somethin
See it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas niggas that I was feedin I heard em whisperin Meek Mill finished
I was like And damn I was feedin you bro
All I did was keep grindin
Through the storm nigga Im like Derrick Rose on a 50point night on a daily basis nigga
For the love of the millions royalty over loyalty never get it confused
I got real friends and family thatll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie thats doin lifehe cant offer me no money he cant offer me nothin but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So dont come to me talkin bout no money shit nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money we goin to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me even before I had money
Ride or die no matter what
Dreamchasers for life you dig
Uh I told niggas stop askin me where niggas at
If you dont see em in the pictures with me that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from we love each other its all love but everybody cant make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht huh Where they do that at
