Yeah ladada ladadada yeah
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock40
A little shorty heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us Probably why Im rebellious
To a fraud nigga I lost niggas when I got paper
Its like more money I made they got faker
And its crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said dont ever ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause theyll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle I aint never really round squares
They say theres levels to this shit you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror Meek Milly this your car
Look at your arm check out your neck look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three watch it go swish and fall
And that was andone they thinking how we get this far
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldnt D me like Earl Boykins Im sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but Im Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown what now
Gold AP all bust down fuck clowns
My heart getting cold and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldnt make it no way
I think my heart getting colder my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day only Lord knows
Dedicated determinated and disciplined
When Diddy Hova and Baby talking Im listening
When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I wont fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week he was my chauffeur I was like told yall
Mommy was a booster daddy was a shooter
So they couldnt blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping hes gon knock out your medulla
Oblongata Im a father and my son dont see a lot of
If I dont get he gon probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me
Told my momma I wont let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I wont ever let these bitches see the real me do you feel me
Times change like the Rollie did
Now Im killing these niggas the way that Kobe did


Ayo it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit moneys the root of all evil
Family start telling you you acting different nigga
Youre goddamn right Im acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother your sister
Your mother your father that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you aint never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you know what Im saying
You got raised you done played in the park with them
This money thing this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son You sure you want this money
You sure you want this fame You sure you want this power
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you aint shit
Yeah everybody want it everybody need it money motherfuckers
Get money dont stop but I aint mad at them
Shit but shit even bosses got feelings you know
Dear mama dear papa family were all we got
Dont let this money bring us down
Shit everybody eats B everybody eats everybody eats
Lets go hahahah
Uh yeah
And we started off as kids stomachs touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we aint have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we aint have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you aint have nothing to give
I aint trip I aint trip I pour bottles I aint sip
I let niggas shine bright you still act like I aint shit
Let you have them little hoes they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga I aint hit
Twenty chains eight watches cant fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said its my shit
I said its ours nigga and when youre ready were gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant Metta Peace and Gasol nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my hearts cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twentyfifth matter of fact the twentysixth
Maybe its the twentyeighth fuck it though my moneys straight
As long as Papi smiling
Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
Ive seen it Ive seen it
Jealousy in your eyes I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I aint want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit I know you aint mean it
But yeah nigga Ive seen it
My heart getting cold and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldt make it no way
I think my heart getting colder my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day only Lord knows
