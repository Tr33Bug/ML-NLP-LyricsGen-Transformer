TranslationsFranaisDreams and Nightmares  Intro  Lyrics
Aint this what theyve been waitin for
You ready Uh uh
I used to pray for times like this to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some lockedup shit
In the back of the paddy wagon cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said Yeah I do
If you want it you gotta see it with a cleareyed view
Got a shorty she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed nigga please fore them triggers squeeze
Im gettin cream never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started lil nigga but Im lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless draw it like Im an artist
No crawlin went straight to walkin with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches mnagin fuckin suckin and swallowin
Anything for a dollar they tell me get em I got em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil nigga Im on fire
Icy as a hockey rink Philly nigga Im flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big cant even fit in the parking spot
You aint talkin bout my niggas then what you talkin bout
Gangstas move in silence nigga and I dont talk a lot
I dont say a word I dont say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
Maybach Music
Hold up wait a minute  Minute  yall thought I was finished  Whoa 
When I bought that Aston Martin yall thought it was rented  Yeah 
Flexin on these niggas Im like Popeye on his spinach
Double M yeah thats my team Rozay the captain Im lieutenant
Im the type to count a million cash then grind like Im broke
That Lambo my new bitch she dont ride like my Ghost
Im ridin around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
Cause my mama need that bill money my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life they fuck around get killed
You fuck around you fuck around you fuck around get smoked
Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me dont fuck around no joke no
All I know is murder when it come to me
I got young niggas thats rollin I got niggas throwin Bs
I done did the DOAs I done did the KODs
Every time Im in that bitch I get to throwin 30 Gs
But now Im hangin out that drop head Im ridin down on Collins  Skrrt 
They let my nigga Ern back home that young nigga be wildin  Lets go 
We young niggas we mobbin  Mobbin  like Batman and were robbin  Whoa 
This twodoor Maybach with my seat all reclinin
Im like Real nigga what up Real nigga what up
If you aint about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in your raps Ill get yo pussyass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood no that tour life aint good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block  Block  bike on 12 oclock  Rah 
And they be throwin deuces on the same nigga they watch  Meek Milly 
And Im the king of my city cause Im still callin them shots
And these lames talkin that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
Im the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin on me hoes waitin on me
Still on that hood shit my RollsRoyce on E
They gon remember me I say remember me
So much money have yo friends turn in yo enemies
And when theres beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40 aint no 10 a key
Hold up broke nigga turned rich  Rich  love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon still suck my dick
It was somethin bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
Im gone
Woo
