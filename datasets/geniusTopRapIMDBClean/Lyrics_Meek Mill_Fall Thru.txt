Yeah
Sad to say it but I love you
Dont take no offense but youre my bitch
Yeah you gone fall through every time a nigga call you
Thats why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel
Ass all fat say she get it from her mama
She just want the money she aint fuckin with no bloggers
Fuck you on a PJ the whole way to the Bahamas

Put you on my homie cause he say he wanna fuck you
When he asked me bout you I just told him that I want you
But now its quiet for you cause I told him that I loved you
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
Thats why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel
I was locked up I remember when I hit you
Used to write me back every letter that I sent you
You wasnt my girl but you used to pretend to
When I came home let me beat it instrumental
Lame left you scarred so I had to reinvent you
If you was car shit you ride it like a Benz do
Wraith it with the stars every time I come and get you
We be goin hard every time you on that Hen too
I was in the mix actin like a savage
Got another bitch and you told me I could have it
I know you was sick so I doubled back to grab you
So anything you wish yeah yeah you can have it


You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
Thats why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
