Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters

Every month got me pissin fuck around with them papers
So I cant smoke no kush I cant smoke no kush
But I ran through them hoes and I aint talk bout Reggie Bush

In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece let me cook
Now hold up I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same whips as Stunna do

Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters
