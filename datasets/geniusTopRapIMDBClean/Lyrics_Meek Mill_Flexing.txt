Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters

Glock 10 with that laser fuck around meet yo maker
Every month got me pissin fuck around with them papers
So I cant smoke no kush I cant smoke no kush
But I ran through them hoes and I aint talk bout Reggie Bush

In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece let me cook
Now hold up I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same whips as Stunna do

Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters

Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold say its time to get paper

Pocket full of them racks and my bank account Meek Mill nigga
Stuntin all on my old hoes styling all on my haters
