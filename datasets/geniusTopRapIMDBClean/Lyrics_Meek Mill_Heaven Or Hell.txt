Ayo this the one We all get caught in our own sins Sometimes I have to remind myself that on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatestand so do you Dont let your demons take you to Hell Introduce em to Heaven
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life
Look I got homies in the ground skeleton and bones
And niggas doin life they aint never comin home
They said I wouldnt make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
Cause I left to chase my dream get it any means
I said that Ill be back she wasnt listenin to me
That backandforth arguin was gettin in between
I said fuck them other niggas I go get it with my team
If we all grind we all shine fuck a parttime
I used to play the block early mornin and dark time
Now its G5 flights fuck a depart time
It was hard times nigga now its our time
Just take a look at my life rappin brought me back to life
Cause I was in them streets my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin like we was in Iraq to fight
Cause niggas gettin murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin water in the world of no order
In the hood aint no loyalty aint no world for your daughter
Aint no life for your brother on the life of my mother
Ima get the fam right nigga you damn right
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life
Yeah I used to pop a lot of shit now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out hoppin outta shit
Right now Im prayin for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go I acknowledge it
But whoever aint a snakes usually a follower
Luckily I can tell the difference
My man comin home my other man gettin sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin on your pictures
We dreamchasin yall niggas walkin behind wishes
Without workin for it not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around bout the militia they malicious
Dblock finish that and cop more dope
Im twostroke you fourstroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Aint nothin all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand thatll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and theyll leave you
You cant see the Devil hes seethrough
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life
