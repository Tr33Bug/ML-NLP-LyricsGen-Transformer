Running around in jail like I aint give a hell when
You was on PC locking it with males
And I aint got time for this shit let me get another one
23 and 1 never get to see the sun
Had to get a glass visit just so you could see your son
Took a deal on your homie cause you couldnt beat the gun
They was tryna give you life man you know that wasnt right
Then you left him in the hood on his head he had a price
You aint even give a call other niggas shot him twice

Swimming with the fishes all you niggas is bitches
Dick riders knocking on the wood superstitious
Pause that Im all that Im really in the trenches
And when I see you nigga Imma have you jumping fences
Cutting through the alleys you must be on the molly
Sniffing all that white shit and fucking with that Bobby

And Im like a brick of Diesel it cost 60 for the flow
You aint a gangsta you a wanksta nigga 50 even know whoa

And you locked your homie out when you heard the cops coming
Rapping for a long time nigga you aint got nothing
