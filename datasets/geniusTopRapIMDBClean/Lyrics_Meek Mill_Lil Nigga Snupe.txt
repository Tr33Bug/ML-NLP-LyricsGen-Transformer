RIP to my lil nigga Snupe  Rest in peace to a real nigga 
Yeah
We the realest niggas in this shit
Reporting live out of Philly
Young nigga loved popping bad bitches and wheelies
And Im talking all this money now these niggas cant feel me
Money long team strong so these niggas cant kill me ah
I get a rush from this lifestyle
Solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the chasers in the building turn the lights down
Cause every single nigga with me gon be iced out
Glock 40 living life wild
I go to court for probation and looking like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
Im living better than ever Im thinkin like How
Is it the money Is it the cars
Is it the way a nigga living that took me this far
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star
I shine I grind harder Im working my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama mama my mas daughter
They telling me I aint shit I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me matter fact sing for me
Lil Snupe they killed my lil nigga Snupe
My lil nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe all he wanted was a coupe
So whats a nigga sposed to do
Tell em put the guns down or tell these lil niggas shoot
Cause theyll do the same to me do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof thats why I got a bulletproof
And as Im rolling through my city nigga all I see is murder
Aint nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And aint nobody hiring so everybody serving
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin better get a strap
Young niggas selling caine just to get it back
And they busting out them things til they sitting back
And if a nigga hit my homie we gon hit him back
And if you send him over here know we gon send him back
My flow iller I came up from dope dealing
I been sayin Id make it they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it
I came up on four wheelers bananas and gorillas
Through the jungle where killers rumble and everyone perishing
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me that Im arrogant
But what the fuck Im young black I made it in America
So Ima ball harder than the mahfucking Carters
Beyonc and Shawn arm bluer than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark thats on a dolphin
Nigga darker in a coffin Devil on him get em off hah
I can look at your homies and tell you foul dawg
Leaning with your left but you still a southpaw
Be the same niggas thatll take you out dawg
Leaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr Chows dawg
Where the love at Where the love at
Id give up all this money to get lil cuz back
Just for my nigga go starving like Where the grub at
Give up the fame start over and get my buzz back
Do it again murder his killer him and his friend
Put the arena step on the stage kill him again
Look at the stands the fans coming filling them in
To give my nigga a chance see him winning again


Snupe They killed my lil nigga Snupe
My lil nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe all he wanted was a coupe
So whats a nigga sposed to do
Tell em put the guns down or tell these lil nigga shoot
Cause theyll do the same to me do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof thats why I got a bulletproof
Real nigga for life
Real nigga for life
Real nigga for life
They killed my lil nigga Snupe
Killed my lil nigga Snupe
