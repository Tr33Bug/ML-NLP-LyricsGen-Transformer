All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Uh Lord knows Im filthy rich
All this ice is like fifty bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad she on my Christmas list
Member I prayed really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
Im with some niggas that mad we taking risks for this
Im talking risky business flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly wont get home until Im fiftysix
They say Im the Messiah you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while youre lying
The middle of the church have you wake no Im lying
I just came from jail aint do no crying
They put me through hell sharpened my iron
I did my pushups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up from balling Im tired
Im back in this bitch and Im back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble Im cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game Philly as shit
Look at these rappers they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
Im talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And Im talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose came up from nothing
And now they like How he made millions so quick
Im in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches Im fuckin on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like Im Sosa
A brick on the table aint sniffing no coca no way
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Uh niggas cant see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Dont reach round me thats a chopper zone
Every time you be on count what the topic on
Two hundred and fifty thou what I dropped it on
See yall think its a game til FOX be on
CNN momma picking out boxes for em
I want everything got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed em for em
Stick and moving on these niggas get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see yall later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see yall hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Yall looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money dont make it real
Dont give a fuck if its eighty mill pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley wont make you thorough pussy
Still hating me from my city
Im thinking is they for real pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
Theyll come in like Navy Seals
Thats word to my momma I promise I aint doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately Ive been on this money
Dont run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it you pussy
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows nigga Lord knows
