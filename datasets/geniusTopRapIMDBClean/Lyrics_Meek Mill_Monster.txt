The money turned me into a monster  Hah 
The money turned my noodles into pasta  Hah 
The money turned my tuna into lobster  Whoa 
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster whoa
4 AM Im on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters dont want to kill me
Its a shame how they hate on me you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
Jahlil Beats holla at me
Im like Do it for the gram ho Do it for the gram ho
She dont want to bust it I say Do it for them bands yo
I say Do it for them bands
Fucking with that broke nigga you should do it for your man
Lately Ive been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like Momma I gotta go
I done took so many trophies to momma
My momma know her son a real nigga
I get that money pay them bills nigga
My momma told me You a real nigga
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now what a feeling
When you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it I got it
On that other line with Benjamin and money is the topic Lord
The money turned me into a monster  Hah

The money turned my tuna into lobster  Whoa

Popping that pistol they talking they never deep  Never deep 
Dropping that nickel out something with leather seats

All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain Im ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like Andretti  Skrt
