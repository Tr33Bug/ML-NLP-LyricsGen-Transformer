Get it right Terio
Ooh ooh kill em ooh kill em ooh
You ready You ready
I dont think they is
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin shit
Im like Dre I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh I grew up I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24 let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga step back
Hundred shots aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doodoodooodooo
Well my gun go blatblatblatblatblat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really Im sick of you niggas
Youve been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so Im killing these niggas like
Hhhhold up wait 
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids make the beast come back like
Hhhhold up wait 
And a nigga fuck around get the RICO Act
Shoot shoot and one where my free throw at
And my lil nigga Bobby cant eat those flats
Like ooh kill em ooh kill em
Ooh kill em ooh kill em
They know Meek Milly I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money Im getting my nigga
I swear I dont know what to do with it
Yeah its Meek Milly Im bombing on rappers
I really dont give a fuck who with em
Pair with a nigga like me one time like me one time
And yall forgot about me
Acting like I dont really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill em ooh kill em
Ooh kill em ooh kill em ooh kill em ooh
