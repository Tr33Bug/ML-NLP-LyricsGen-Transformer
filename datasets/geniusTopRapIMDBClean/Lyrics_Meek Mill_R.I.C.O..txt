Yeah views views views
Yeah yeah alright
Old ways new women gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
Ive been counted out so many times I couldnt count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Paybacks a bitch and you know that shit
Yall niggas gettin too old for this
Please dont think nobody notices
Ive been up for way too many days
Yall sleep enough for me anyway
Yall dont be doin shit anyway
Yall are not true to this anyway
OVO East End Reps Up we might just get hit with the RICO
Everyone home for the summer so lets not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But theyre from the way fam theres not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonnas a ting I know and Im the king of pop
Im building NeverNever Land
How he hate me when I never met the man woo
We might just get hit with the RICO
Meek Milly
Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
Im on probation so let me not talk whats illegal  Switch it up 
Today I woke up with my dream girl she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldnt make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin niggas wildin violence
Why we even got to take it here
Why we even got to play these games
Run up on me catch a facial there
Its the Chasers what you thought
I come through my block like Im Rico
Poppin a wheelie no squealie cant talk to the cops thats illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter no doublecrossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
Im back on that hood shit yeah that wish you would shit
Im talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on lists most wanted but now its the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh listen you hear that


We might just get hit with the RICO
We might just get hit with the RICO
