Maybach Music
They say your brains most creative in your sleep
See they say in the sleep state
The brain thinks much more visually and intuitively
Ha what is this  Maybach Music 
I like this Maybach Music Swate
As dreamchasers we accomplish that wide awake
Turn everything up a lil bit in the headphones
You ready  AllStar 
Ready or not here I come
You cant hide nigga Im too damn fly
Sippin all of this purple it got me too damn high
They say theyre down for the team but playin two damn sides
Im like niggas aint loyal  no  niggas aint loyal  no 
And these voices in my head saying niggas aint for you  nah 
And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you  fire 
And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
Its a dark cloud over me money took control of me
Im barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
Baby momma trippin out I tell her to work with me
Im on probation still strapped cause niggas want to murder me
And lately Ive been getting faded  faded 
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating  they hating 
And all these bitches wanna fuck me
Cause a nigga made it  I made it 
Im getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And aint a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain yeah


As dreamchasers we consider ourselves a creative upper class
When it comes to ideas were just in a different tax bracket
Gangsta Grillz you bastards  Gangsta 
Young rich nigga quarter millie worth of jewels  jewels 
Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse  fuse 
Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes  shoes 
Aint it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs huh
Big dreams turn to big things  things 
Ive been waiting on this day since I was 16  16 
Big chains Aston Martin as I switch lanes  skrrt 
Before I ever made a hit I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs trying make a killing  killing 
We in the building every other month I make a million  yeah 
Any nigga talking reckless cause they think Im chilling
Til I put some money on their head yeah make em feel it
Have they own homies do him like they never knew him  fire 
Ill have Omelly walk up on him when we run into him  fire 
Close range shorty have him put something through him
So I hope youre ready cause we heavy and were coming for you
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And aint a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain yeah
Dreamchasers 2
We decided to share the wealth again
Care to join us
The meek shall inherit the earth
So Ima own this bitch until Im buried in dirt
I only roll with niggas thatll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma she carried me to that church
And I dont know why I just feel like Im the one  one 
They label me a victim but now look what I become  come 
Or should I say became I dont do it for the fame
Im from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name assasination to my character
Lifes a bitch she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the potholes jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch I feel like I just got in that pussy  yeah 
Shorty wanna be a star thats why she popping that pussy
She trying to win so she hang amongst winners
Thats why I take the time just to pray at moms dinner  I pray 
Cause I remember cold nights not the winter  not the winter 
Not the weather Im talk about within us  within us 
Cause for that money sins they get committed
And friends they get to splittin divided just like division
So every day that I wake up my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
Yeah The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger Im gone
Nigga like me
I walk around fear no man  no man 
I dont owe you niggas shit  shit 
Ery nigga you see around me
Thats the niggas thats with me  my niggas 
Unless they in jail or dead or something
Nigga livin life like Fuck all you niggas
You feel me
