Dougie on the beat 
I fell in love with these streets I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin bad bitches I went runnin wild  gone 
I just pray Papi forgive me aint seen my son a while  I pray 
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin smile  facts 
Somebody save me save me
Tryna please a bitch it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change but shit it changed me
Somebody save me save me
Twentythree and one it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone cant let it phase my
I just wanna make it home to see my baby
I fell in love with these streets I seen a hundred thou
Bustin choppers sellin dope I went to runnin wild
Threw a drum up in my forty shoot a hundred times
Two hundred thou my cousins case to see his daughter smile
Somebody save me save me
All this lean and all these percs gon drive me crazy
I see niggas switchin sides like they KD
I cant let it kill my vibe cause Im too wavy
This what I wanted Ima own it
Anything I ever said Im standin on it
Got my dog in the feds he turned informant
I just pray that he dont say some shit to harm us
I fell in love with these streets I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin bad bitches I went runnin wild  gone 
I just pray Papi forgive me aint seen my son a while  I pray 
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin smile  facts 
Somebody save me save me

I was breakin bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change but shit it changed me
Somebody save me save me
Twentythree and one it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone cant let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby
One time my dog tried to line me mustve lost his mind
When he know how we get down when niggas cross the line
And I hate to be the one that gotta call his mom
That money mix up with that greed it happen all the time
If I cant trust you its fuck you
Know that money aint a thang I tell em touch you
Know them boys gon bust your brain I push a button
To make it home to see me son know Im gon crush you
Cause thats important to keep it one hundred
I just wanna make it home to see my youngin  Papi 
Move my family out the ghetto all I wanted
Left me dancin with the devil chasin this money
Amen
I fell in love with these streets I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin bad bitches I went runnin wild  gone 
I just pray Papi forgive me aint seen my son a while  I pray 
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin smile  facts 
Somebody save me save me
Tryna please a bitch it almost drove me crazy

Twentythree and one it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone cant let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby
And Im so tired of makin moves and gotta keep the tool
Gotta hide it from my son I pick him up from school
With them papers with it some would tell me Im a fool
But all these hatin niggas wanna see me on the news
And they debating on a nigga if Im gon win or lose
Bout this paper I seen real niggas forget the rules
And I cant trust these bitches I know they gon pick and choose
No I cant trust these bitches I know they gon pick and choose
Amen
I fell in love with these streets I seen a hundred thou
