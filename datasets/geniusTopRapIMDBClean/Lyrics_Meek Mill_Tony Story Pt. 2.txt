Tony Story Pt 2 Lyrics
Paulie killed Tony right  Right 
And Tony killed Ty so it was only right  Right 
Thinkin back twenty years they was homies tight
Sixth grade for the love of the paper aint nothin nice  Uhuh 
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles blowing paper balling hard he know they hating
But they gon respect it cause he rocked Tony  Tony 
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding they ready to fall for him  They ready 
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that  That 
Used Key gold digging ass to get back  Back 
Text him through her phone found out where he live at  Yeah 
She woke up in the morning like I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth fitting to start a war
Cause Tonys little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law  Lord 
And Paulie on a rise now  On a rise 
Niggas that played the middle pickin sides now  Pickin sides now 
Plus he heard Tonys brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head he gotta die now  I want this nigga dead 
Paulies youngest on the corner
Tonys little brother he slipping yeah hes a goner
Fuckin with that lean he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too reachin bet you they get up on him
The gat jam he bang back tryna avoid em
Them niggas dumpin he get up running and hittin on em
He hit the alley get a body he dipping on em
Said its on now try and kill em its war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feelin like he dead it aint no remorse now
Gettin high and he thinking bout kicking in doors now  Get on the floor 
Momma and little kids get on the floor now  Ah 
Finger on the trigger he feel it its going down  Ooh 
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain its really gon pour down
And its raining like Katrina he got thirty in his Nina  Strapped 
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer  Thirty 
Paulie wasnt in it when he heard it he was steaming  Kill this nigga 
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin
And he want this nigga dead fore Sunday hit  Hit 
But youngin tryna live on some Sunday shit  Yeah 
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And Paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show em how its done so he loadin up his gun  Murder 
And show this young nigga he fucked with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin the long gun
And its on sight he dont give a fuck if the law come


So he out here
Ridin dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurkin
They tryna murder heard he out there
Niggas spinin they try and hit him
Hittin every corner seein niggas but he aint with em  He aint 
A youngin layin low he know Paulie aint playin though  Nah 
Theres money on his head and niggas is sayin Go  Its real 
But youngin he aint scared he cool as a fan though
He know its get down with that burner or end up a taggedtoe
It was four in the morn  Morn  Paulie goin home  Home 
Windshields wipin middle of the rain storm  Storm 
And Paulie he aint slipping yeah he got that thang on  Yeah 
You know what he did to Tony he wont get the same song so  Damn 
When he hit the crib he spin the block fore he park it  Park 
Paulie aint a bitch nah Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talkin  Talkin 
And out his rear view its like he seen a reaper walking  Yeah 
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparkin
Shots hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching trigger squeezin trying get him off him  Ah 
Them shots ringing youngins squeezing clip empty
Thats when Paulie rose like Derrick put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face You aint learn from your brother nigga
Baow baow baow
