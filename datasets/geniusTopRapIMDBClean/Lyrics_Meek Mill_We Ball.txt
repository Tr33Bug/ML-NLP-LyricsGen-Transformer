Yeah
RIP Dex Osama Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter Truce
When they killed my nigga Snupe I seen my young nigga
In the casket he aint even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Aint got no patience for these motherfuckin fuck niggas
I watch everybody change they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin Uies its gon cost em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin  Truce 
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So Ima hold it down til we all win
Weve been at the Clearport ballin
I just want to see my niggas flossin
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill youll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama she cant sleep I come here early mornings  mama 
But mama I got thirty in this dirty 40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of moneyll get your lined up
And I cant trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but aint nobody roll bout it
Three felonies aint graduate no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us
When they killed my nigga I seen the footage on the tape
Man I mustve threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like hes Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and Im built Ford Tough
And Im going through stuff
I dont feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come Im gone
I wan see my brother with the Patek not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused I done noticed all the damages
I dont see no purpose in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas I went crazy I couldnt balance it
You cant question God yeah yeah and then theres challenges
Sipping on this Actavis I swear I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip accurate
And Im leaning like a project banister
Im a boss I aint never need a manager
Got rich with thugs scandalous ayy
Fuck it we ball yeah
All the soldiers we lost yeah
Fuck it we balloohall
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
All the soldiers we lost 
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag
All the soldiers we lost 
She just got a nose job and it wasnt that bad
Fuck it we ball 
I was juggin round the city I came back ayy
Fuck it we ball
Yeah fuck it we ball
Tear down the mall yeah
Fuck it we ball
Tear down the mall ayy
