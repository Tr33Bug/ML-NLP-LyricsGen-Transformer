You know what free is nigga
Whats free
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV aint controllin what we see
Told my niggas I need you
Through all the fame you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this aint where I wanna be
Before Im judged by 12 put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas I need you
Stay up I know these times aint true
Real life whats free
Since a lad I was cunning just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin my money Ill need a ladder by summer
AK shots niggas duckin stray shots
Been a top dog thats before the KDots
Crackin in 06 immaculate showmanship
Talkin like you Mitch disastrous on the strip
Holdin on your bitch coulda never sold you a brick
With them people you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me aint nothin but a bitch
Hangin pictures like niggas swingin from his dick
We so different you thought these didnt exist  MM 
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
Im from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest but Satan been on his shit
Walkin the pavement I pray Im illuminated
Over a decade and never nobodys favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo a million grams and we countin em up  MM 
You was dead broke I let you hold a pack
You paid for it but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming gang gang now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin for a bond lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
MMMaybach music 
Whats free
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV aint controllin what we see
Told my niggas I need you
Through all the fame you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this aint where I wanna be
Before Im judged by 12 put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas I need you
Stay up I know these times aint true
Real life whats free  Yeah 
Fed investigations heard they plottin like I trap
20 mill in cash they know I got that off of rap
Maybe its the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy and the way they got my back uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I wont snap uh
Twofifty a show and they still think Im sellin crack uh
When you bring my name up to the judge just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin all these wars stoppin violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced  Shush 
Oh say you can see I dont feel like Im free
Locked down in my cell shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin that gavel turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin a wheelie my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin like Bad Boy in 94 Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant aint busy
Thats five milli in twenties sit up and count til Im dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin or rappin I might just pop up with Drizzy like
Whats free
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV aint controllin what we see
Told my niggas I need you
Through all the fame you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this aint where I wanna be
Before Im judged by 12 put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas I need you
Stay up I know these times aint true  Run it down 
Real life whats free
In the land of the free where the blacks enslaved
Threefifths of a man I believes the phrase
Im 50 of DUSS and its debt free  Yeah 
100 of Ace of Spades worth half a B  Uh 
Roc Nation half of that thats my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs uh
Cause most of my niggas wont ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat dont Michael and Prince me and Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Princes DNA uh
I aint one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort my house bigger than yours
My spou  Come on man 
My route better of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested we made the project a wave
You came back reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas sense of pride now how thats free
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s huh
I aint got a billion streams got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we posed to be happy about this
We was praisin Billboard but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like Is you dumb
To this day Grandma fraid what I might say
They gon have to kill me Grandmama Im not they slave
Hahahahaha check out the bizarre  Ah 
Rappin style used by me the HOV
Look at my hair free carefree niggas aint near free
Enjoy your chains whats your employer name with the hairpiece
I survived the hood cant no Shaytan rob me
My accountants so good Im practically livin tax free
Factory thats me
Sold drugs got away scotfree
Thats a CC Ecopy
Guilt free still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say yall killed me
Sucker free no shuckin me I dont jive turkey
Say Happy Thanksgiving shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free all of yall callin out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free seasoned but Im salt free
You lay a hand on Hov my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter you cant ignore the hand speed
On god its off the head this improv but its no comedy
Sign I fail Hell nah
Hahahahaha  Hahahahahahahahaha
