One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends
Somebody who youre around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know just make sure you know who youre around
Yall was like my brothers
I considered yall as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga we was fam first
Looking at me balling know that Instagram hurt
Cuz you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same hearse
Same cemetery bury me in the same dirt
We had a plan but I guess it aint work
BH we straight that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first you was supposed to follow my nigga
Im gone
Somebody who youre around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know just make sure you know who youre around
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I cant believe you  not you 
Thats what that syrup and that weed do
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was screeming free you  Free Dat Nigga Lil 
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I dont even stop aint a need to
And you the one that left nigga I aint leave you
Shit got realer niggas got richer
I said the money train coming niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister
Somebody who youre around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know just make sure you know who youre around
They want more than my mother
More than Omelly and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it I dont hate em I still love em
I might have said things I never said fuck em
But Im a live my life get the money ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick aint complaining he got life behind bars
And he still calling me bet you he aint calling yall
Cuz none of yall niggas aint send him shit yet
None of yall niggas send him pics yet
Im still writing money orders sending big checks
And remember when it rains niggas get wet
Gone
Somebody who youre around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know just make sure you know who youre around
I still love niggas
But its like we just grew apart
If you dont grind you dont shine
Half my niggas still around and we all shining hard
Gone
