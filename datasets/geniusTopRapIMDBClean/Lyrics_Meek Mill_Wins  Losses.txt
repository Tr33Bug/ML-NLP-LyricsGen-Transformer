You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when its not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles now we eating lobster
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
Im the realest nigga in it I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck em
New jewelry new whips on the way now
Brr brr thats yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall never stay down
Stand up nigga I can never lay down
Wins and the losses it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou lawyer said we lookin awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs take them off us
Lil bitch call me Lil Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out its still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns man this shit getting borin
Half a milli last week you wouldve thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out I guess they thought I was normal
They aint know I was different Im like Lord be my witness
Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon do division break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen they aint see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I aint see them bitches
So Ima ball on em
Magic City let it fall on em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah
My nigga bail half a milli he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how Im rocking I go on them streets
Glock 40 keep it on me we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything just let me know if its beef
We bring the war I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe oh
Pushing the foreigns drive through the trenches  Trenches 
Top of the food chain head of commission  Mission 
We wackin niggas without permission  Mission 
Never was personal it was business  Brrrrr 
Settle down let it settle down
Couldnt tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon tell me now
Im running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds  Brrr 
If it was Fuck them niggas then
Its fuck them niggas now fuck em
Never change on my roll dawgs

Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldnt make it like I told yall
