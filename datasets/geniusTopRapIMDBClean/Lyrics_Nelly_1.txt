You better watch who you talkin bout runnin your mouth like you know me
You gon fuck around and show why the Show Me get called the Show Me
Why oneonone you cant hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France but you swear Im from Paris
Hundredsix karats  total Naw thats per wrist
Trying to compurr this  my chain to yo chain
Im like Sprint or Motorola  no service out of your range
You out of your brains thinkin Imma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin its time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off
As much as wes floss still hard to please boss
Dont be lyin bitchin and cryin  suck it up as a loss
Cause your acts is wack your whole label is wack

Willin to get in the drivers seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say she say did he say
What I think he said Squash that he probably got that off eBay
Or some Internet access some website chat line
Mad cause I got mine dont wind up on the flat line

If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the down down
Cant leave out the store now better wait til they calm down

Taking nothin for granted blessin erything on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak The Truth

And Ill do it again if it means Imma win
