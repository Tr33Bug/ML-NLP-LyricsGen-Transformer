I am so faded might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow money in the bag
Im so faded might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow money in the bag
50k today a 100 more tomorrow
Hustle what I want man Ill forever ball
Money coming heavy never weigh a little
Its either high or low its never in the middle
Ice buckets nigga for the gold ace
Big cash duffle bag with the gold lace
Heard a nigga say throw in the towel
Numbers speak the truth these niggas out here in denial
I am so faded 10000 square feet gated
100k tomorrow money in the bag
Im so faded might put fifty on the ladies
100k tommorrow money in the bag
50k today 100k tommorrow
Rollie Sundays Monday Audemar
Tuesday in the photo Wednesday in the two door
Thursdays made for fucking Fridays back to getting you know
You in that right place again
Face not American body saying African
Fuck you with an uppercut baby that wont take a lot
50k today we running money like a marathon
Yo bread yo bed yo booty lights on
Her phone playing your music like your music our songs
Give her that banana clip most of all her clothes on
Beatin on my chest went through the roof top
So dope you could snort every line
When its reppin time whe when its reppin time
Told her I take her shoppin after we fuck
Soon after we fuck I had to tell her never mind
You wouldnt know swag if it slapped you in the face
This that macaroni tony A1 on the steak
And designer shoe laces gold on the bracelets
Got her in the back seat balls on her braces
Photo grails full of money stacks
You a blocker and nigga I got a hundred sacks
Ya this the luxury distribution
Up so early got me arguing with the rooster
Tru university is my institution
Niggas couldnt graduate if you had tutor
One thing for sure two things for certain
My crib got blinds my car got curtains
