Big boy
I said  give me two pairs
Cause  I need two pairs
So I  can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
I like the allwhite hightop strap with the gum bottom
Theres somethin about em now dirty thats why I got em
I leave em strapped and laced and come up out em
The last person that touched em I damn near shot em
Now if you look and see limegreen Forces its Kiwi
You couldnt get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hiphop may niggas flipflop
Yeah my Force Ones in tiptop  me  now form a flip flops
Me I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where Im at
Dont get me wrong man
Now Murphy Lee aint dumb man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none man
You may not have three or four
But you got one man  big boy 
I said  give me two pairs
Cause  I need two pairs
So I  can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
We up in Foot Locker Im lookin like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo
Cause shes just standin there as if Im shootin free throws
I said Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes
She said I love you Murph especially in the white n blue
I said The white n blue sound nice make it twice
And I signed an  yo  autograph  yo  Thanks for the advice
I keep it real dirty dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops which the clear sole
But its Timbs and fat laces when its cold
But when the winter go  burrr  and the hot summer flow
Then its back to the all purpose wit them lil dots in the toe
Aint nothin stopping this dough that Im spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force NE behind the O
Okay Lee I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole I got a wider shoe
You see that lowmid Skittle purple coupe Im drivin in
Kyjuan were you getting dem colors are you dyin them 
Ten is my size in dem no point in tyin dem
Aint no point in tryin these on they know Im buyin dem
Now dont nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them three quarters them lows they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff em you fucked up your whole night
Whats my basis The look on store owners faces
This kids outrageous hes buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop em I gut em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my Daytons
I said  give me two pairs
Cause  I need two pairs
So I  can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn when those came out So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem
Look Im tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all  you wildin  fish bowlin em all
I got some fifteens  security buyin shoes and all
Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what Im bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum and leather gray
Ones in the back and  yo  the pair you got on display  check 
Now in the box is where I keep mine  keep mine 
You should peep mine  peep mine 
Maybe once or twice but never three times
Im just a sneaker pro I love Pumas and shell toes
But cant nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl
I said  give me two pairs
Cause  I need two pairs
So I  can get to stompin in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin in my Air Force Ones
