You know what I found out
Sometimes no matter what you do they only look at you one way
At the end of the day
Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin broads
And I still was gettin called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Call me Mr All That all that
Erything you have Im all that
Call me wack you better call back  Crawl back 
Or fall back before that black mack bust all that

You hear that beat thats Drumma Boy
When I see you thats trouble boy
Just say the word and Im in thurr
Name the time and that whenwhere

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin broads
And I still was gettin called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
