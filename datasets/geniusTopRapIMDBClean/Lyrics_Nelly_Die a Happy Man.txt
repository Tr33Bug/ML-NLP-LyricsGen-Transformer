Oh baby girl last night
Hands down
One of the best nights
That Ive had no doubt
Between that bottle of wine
And that look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Well then we danced in the dark under September stars
In the pouring rain
And I know  and I know  that I cant  that I cant 
Ever tell you know enough
All I need  all I need  in this life  in this life 
Is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all Ive got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could baby
Die a happy man baby
Yeah
Oh baby that red dress
Brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress shawty
Makes it hard to breath
Youre a saint youre a goddess the cutest the hottest
A masterpiece
Its too good to be true nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know  and I know  that I cant  that I cant 
Ever tell you enough
All I need  all I need  in this life  in this life 
Is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all Ive got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
I dont need no vacation
No fancy destination
Baby youre my great escape yeah
And we can stay at home
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Drive a sports car up the coast to California
Oh if all Ive got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh if all Ive got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could baby
Id die a happy man baby
Yeah
I could die I could die a happy man
Id die a happy man baby
Yeah
