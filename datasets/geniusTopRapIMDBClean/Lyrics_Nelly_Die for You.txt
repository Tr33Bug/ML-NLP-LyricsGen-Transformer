I remember February 27 1994
Tryin to make it to the hospital through three inches of snow  Hey 
Somethins goin wrong I can tell but I dont know
I got this feelin in my gut this aint how its supposed to go
Three pounds two ounces and two months premature
I tell the incubator is she gon make it They aint sure
Automatically I place the blame on my health
Hell Im her father mayne I place the blame on myself
Was it somethin that I smoked did I eat or did I drink it
Or was it somethin I was doin that I did or did I think it
Huh watchin her breathe through her holes in her nose
Whats this EKG machine Whats this shit on her toes
Its 94 Im 85 so Im spooked as can be  Cmon 
Im prayin and Im askin Why He do this to me
See I used to hold you in the palm of my hand
And just to see you pull through
Shit I knew youd pull through


Yeahhhhhhhhhhh  Yeah 
Dont you know Ill die for you  Die for you 
Ill lay down my life for you
I would die for you  Die for you 
March 22nd 1999
The year and the date I got my lil man
I guess I felt how my father felt and his father felt
And his father musta felt to see hisself
Its like a lil me in the flesh
He got my blood and my heart in his chest
Needless to say man I love him to death
Teach him if he disrespect me Imma love him to death
Left to go out of town right after he was born
I got a record deal three months later Daddy was gone
Its like Im tryin to raise him over the phone
He barely know my face when he see it but he know my tone
Im hopin Im like  Do he know who his Daddy is
Im real close to sayin fuck the showbiz
But when I hurr him call his Daddy now
And when I hurr him tell his friends Ima be just like my Daddy now
Hope he forgive me for the sacrifice
So he can have a better life 
Than I had
X2
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh  Yeah 
Dont you know Ill die for you  Die for you 
Ill lay down my life for you
I would die for you  Die for you
