Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh wait a minute now
Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Uh uh
Can you hear me out there
Lunatics is yall ready
Let me hear ya
Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Im a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes  hey 
Fendi capri pants and Parasucos  alright 
The rise of Diddy and City with one or two throws
Im draftin em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows I know and I love it when you make your knees
Touch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo
And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme baby Gimme Some Mo
You say you like that when I hit it from behind and Ill be
Right back yeah thats my very next line I use it
Time after time when Im speakin my mind
Its no matter if Im shootin game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her Who that is talkin that shit about the tics
Somebody probably jealous cause they bitch got hit
But aint nobody else droppin shit like this
Should we apologize Nah fuck em just leave em pissed hey
Andele andele mami EI EI
Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh whats poppin tonight

Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh if the head right Nelly there erynight
We can gamble to the break of dawn nigga money long nigga
Pass up the skirt to talk to the thong nigga
Some say Im wrong but fuck it Im grown nigga
If you aint bout money then best be gone nigga
Im flashy  uh  double takes when you walk past me
Nasty dont be scared boo go head and ask me
I drive fastly call me Jeff Gordon in the Black SS with the navigation
See the joint blazon somethin smells amazon
I got a chick rollin up half black and Asian
Another one pagein tellin me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V12 powers weight loss powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room cause she used the word ours hey
Andele andele mami EI EI
Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh whats poppin tonight
Andele andele mami EI EI
Uhohhhhhhhhhhhhhh if the head right Nelly there erynight
Ayo I smashmouth a whole ounce of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout when feelin icky Let
Go off in a hos mouth I aint picky
Start frontin when the shows out whatchu mean
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut is you wit me
Dont make me pull that fofo ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut then I
Slide up in the Escalade me and E gettin solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy Frosty Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me wrapped wrists like mummies
If you compare me to your local grocery then
Youll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al B meet the tics in Maui hey
