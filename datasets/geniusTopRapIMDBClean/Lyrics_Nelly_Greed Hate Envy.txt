Right up in here is the sweet spot
Stay right up in here and dont bend under presure
Is that what it is The cake will do
Uhh uhh uhh the cake will do
Tell em fuck the shame tell em
Fuck the game dont let the game fuck you
Check it out
I opened up shop at 13
Dimes dubs quarter sacks and OZs
From handheld digital to triplebeam
Now my pagers an email flip screen
Expanded my game off into amphetamines
Looked around and had a small Walgreens
Put the word out on the street dont you fuck with my fiends
Them niggas around the corner then let the thing beam
Now they done let it burn out phone a ching ching
Just another hustle to add to my schemes
Just another piece of the puzzle to my dreams
Cause the house the cars and the coffee take cream
I might ride the Range with the Rollie on the rocks
Or push a candycolored Cutlass with a matching G Shock
When the spot get hot dont stop move shop
Find another block restock and take it from the top now

So you think youre the shit nigga Ya smell me
Shouts out to my nigga Nore
Ill never take another mans glory
Shit dont mix like Shaq and Kobe
Now you know me I be low key

And hoes ignored me now they blow me
Them niggas that loaned me now they owe me
Oh me oh my I can see tha greed and tha envy in yo eyes
Now call me a lie
While you five stand by I stand by the captain
Ho play now did somebody page Samson
I stay cheefin higher than a hooker on the weekends
Seven days a weekend man I walk in yo church reekin
Aunt Esther called me A heathen old fisheyed fool
Bitch had the nerve to repeat it Old fisheyed fool cmon

Pocket full of Gs and two tickets across seas
So me and my boo can lay under the palm trees

Doin the right thing drivin his ass insane
And if I wasnt in his face he probably be callin me names
