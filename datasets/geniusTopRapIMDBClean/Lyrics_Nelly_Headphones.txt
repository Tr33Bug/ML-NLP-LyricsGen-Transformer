Imma turn my headphones up
And fly away  blast of to the stars
Cause i dont wanna think
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain  Uh 
Can you help me   Yeah  to  uhuhuh  live with me  today
Today  today i wanna fly away  Uh 
Today  Yeah   today  uhuhuh  i wanna fly away
Wish that i could fly  fly away
Looking for a brighter day  a brighter day
Run Away from yesterday  yesterday
And take all of my Ghetto boys and girls with me
And  even if we dont know when were in a race
And put a big smile on our mama face
FFly away  flying down the Highway
Livin in the moment  with my shawty right beside me
Touch the sky up  take it higher
Way up till we floating  we let everybody know
That we go make it righter  make it righter  oh yeah
Today 
Imma turn my headphones up
And fly away  blast of to the stars
Cause i dont wanna think   I dont wanna 
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain
Can you help me  to live with me  today
Today  today i wanna fly away
Today  today i wanna fly away
Lets go  
I wish that i could hit the block  chillin with the Homies
Posted on the corner  with no cops checking on us
Take everybody thats with our houses and make a monastery
Health  care  i swear  i do it right now
Tell every boy that had a father at home
If i could i would make you my own
No single women should have to raise you alone
Gimme youre hand  yeah understand together we can
Touch the sky up  take it higher
Way up till we floating  we let everybody know
That we go make it righter  make it righter  oh yeah
Today 
Imma turn my headphones up
And fly away  blast of to the stars
Cause i dont wanna think   I dont wanna 
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain

Never turn his head hurt
Im flying Awaayayayayay
Im flying Awaayayayayay
They cant stop you  cant stop you no  
They cant drop you  drop you down   
Imma turn his Headphones up and fly away 
Imma turn my headphones up
And fly away  blast of to the stars
Cause i dont wanna think
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain
Can you help me  to live with me
Today  today i wanna fly away
Today  today i wanna fly away
