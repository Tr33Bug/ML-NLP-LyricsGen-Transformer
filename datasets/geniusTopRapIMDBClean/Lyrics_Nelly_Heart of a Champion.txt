Nelly exercising and breathing hard
I guess hes back urr derrty STL derby
Im like Magic to Kareem mayne you tell me I aint Worthy
I aint speakin bout a jersey Im speakin bout income
DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH HERE COME THE BIG ONE
I put mo money in the community than you got in yo budget
I wipe my ass with yo advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custer
I hot dog cause I can I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer  in just two records
Thats why Im back up at the Super Bowl with Julius Peppers
I got that cant stop wont stop in my veins
Thats why they cant stop wont stop screamin the name
NELLY NELLY Go tell a friend to tell a friend
Imma keep the same grin whether I lose or win
Up or down ten Imma fight to the end
breathing hard Lets go
Aint no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause Im on my way I can feel my ring comin
Its the blood of a champion pumpin
Deep inside my veins too much pride to be runnin
Imma get what I can and more even if
My blood my sweat and my tears dont mean nothin
Its the heart of a champion  its the heart of me 
Its the heart of a  in me
Im the first pick the first round signing bonus profound
Playin for his hometown reppin for the home ground
And gettin bucks like Michael Redd tell em again
I gets bucks like Michael Redd heard what I said
The MVP of the game intensity still the same
Im shootin out from my reign with Peyton Manningtype aim
Cant stop me from scorin so they resort to just hackin
So theres three of us now  me AI and Shaqn
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentines Day
Im the one that youve been ravin about like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you dont know if Im blitzin or if Im sittin and readin
Waitin for you to go and trip drop back and throw up a pick man
AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW
AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW
Aint no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause Im on my way I can feel my ring comin
Its the blood of a champion pumpin
Deep inside my veins too much pride to be runnin
Imma get what I can and more even if
My blood my sweat and my tears dont mean nothin
Its the heart of a champion  its the heart of me 
Its the heart of a  in me
Its like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit aint no habit man I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talentll surface
So now its curtains and drapes on anybody who hates
Dislikin what Im recitin bitin what Ive been writin
Ive been dogfightin scratchin and clawin on every hike
Tryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans
Cause Im a WARRIOR my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet lil derrty I thought I told ya
Im supposed ta whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne Im young black and rich
As good as it gets and givin your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne but he aint seen shhhh
AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW
AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW AINT NO WAY THEY CAN  BLOW
repeat 2X
