Heaven Lyrics
Said it feels (Yeah)
It feels like heaven (feels like heaven)

Yeah, take it to the head then take it to the floor
This feeling heaven-sent
Every single time me and you roll
Ten bottles and up, yeah we livin' it up
Fly high ‘bove the clouds, you'll never get stuck
And you can take your take your time, my attention’s on your angles
Oh say can you see? Ya got me seeing star spangles
And I’m going for the Superbowl field goal
I know you feeling it right, hard liquor tonight
It ain’t no stopping when we poppin', girlfriend, go in
Yeah ya got high, all because you touchin’ and rubbin'
Plus I’m above it. I know you gotta be sick
Let your light shine, baby, every time, you're tick
It feels (it feels good)
It feels like heaven (feelin' like heaven heaven heaven heaven heaven)
And I don’t wanna go there no time soon
So won’t you please come down here (Better come 'round here here here here here)
It feels like heaven!

Don’t hold your breath, don’t listen
Feel like you going through hell – it’s just a visit
Feel like everything you going through — you’re on your own
Take a shot of the Silver Bullet, thank God for Patrón
Thank God for the men that hurt you
You can separate the boys from the men now ‘cuz you see your virtue
You know when you're in comfort and it feels like heaven
Even though we wasn’t gonna work your body
Shake it up and down to the ground
Baby I just wanna feel right here, right now
One time, one choice
Baby, it’s called for
I’ll hold you down, never let you go
Cause it feels like

It feels (it feels good) (Hey)
It feels like heaven (feelin' like heaven heaven heaven heaven heaven)
And I don’t wanna go there no time soon
So won’t you please come down here (better come 'round here here here here here)
It feels like heaven!
(Oh the sun shine every time we roll)
It feels like heaven!
(My arms around her, love her, never leave her, never let her go)
It feels like
(Yeah, Rolex still spinning, so we good on time)
It feels like heaven
(No braking lights, baby, go hard it’s fine)
You might also like
Never hate the ladies that make the babies
Girl you could be anything you want
And you deserve it, I know you’re worth it
Never ever let the feeling go
Never hate the ladies that make the babies
Girl you could be anything you want
Now put your hands up high, ‘cuz you’re going for a ride
As the feeling overloads, keep the feeling inside

And it feels (it feels good)
It feels like heaven (feelin' like heaven heaven heaven heaven heaven)
And I don’t wanna go there no time soon
So won’t you please come down here (better come 'round here here here here here)
It feels like heaven!
(Yeah, the sun shines every time we roll)
It feels like
(Got an angel, gonna love her, never leave her, never let her go)
It feels
(Yeah, Rolex still spinning so we good on time)
It feels like
(No braking lights, baby, go hard it’s fine)
(Yeah)Embed
