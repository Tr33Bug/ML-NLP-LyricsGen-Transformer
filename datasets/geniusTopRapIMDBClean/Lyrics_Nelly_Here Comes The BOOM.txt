Its the NEDouble LY
I said it so I keep it realz up in my hood on the dirty like Bledsoe
Aint got no twist in my hair but Im still dread throwin
I gots plenty of bread so I go to bed full now
Aint in it to win to win it Im all in
I might call you my cuz youngblood but we aint kin naw
Ya think of jumpin man you best think again
Lil dirty Im the type of man that might could go for revenge
Have some not so nice friendskick the door off the hinge
Take the door of ya Benz pppop 4 of your friends
This here aint cynical  Uh uh 
Mental subliminal Im physical financial and mental to be a general
Lil mama come she want a soldier
Not the type be in the tank but in that Rover
Im in the zone like AIDS full blown
Im killin it like a blind man readin Im feelin it like  BOOM 
He really think he gutter
When he know he soft as butter
He aint never been a fighter
You can go and ask his mother
Im a lover and a fighter producter and a writer
Give your girl a quick fix and give ya man a nice shine
Yall dont really want it  And I can tell just by lookin
That you the type to run and go and tell just by lookin at ya
You want a mission for recognition by dissin
Then have no problem till the record started rippin
Yall dont really want it  So let me tell ya the deal
Im oh so serious Im dirty Im no longer for real
LIKE A HOP SKIP AND A JUMP a Glock grip on the pump
From leavin you in da trunk somewhere prepared to dump
Yall dont really want it  So quit actin like you deaf
Im LOOKIN TO MY RIGHT tryna see whos left
So uh you better watch it fore I stick to the plan
And be the next Artest to run up in your stands like  BOOM 
Yall dont really want it dont really want it
Yall dont really want it with me
I know ya shook man you aint built for
As scared as a nigga can be
Its gon sound like  BOOM 
When Im comin like  BOOM 
When Im comin like  BOOM 
When I come for ya
Its gon sound like  BOOM 
When Im comin like  BOOM 
When Im comin like  BOOM 
When I come for ya
Its gon sound like  BOOM 
Hook
