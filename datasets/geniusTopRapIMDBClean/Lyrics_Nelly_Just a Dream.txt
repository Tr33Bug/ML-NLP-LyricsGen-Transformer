Uh uh uh hey
I was thinking bout her thinking bout me
Thinking bout us what we gon be
Open my eyes yeah
It was only just a dream
So I traveled back down that road
Will she come back No one knows
I realize yeah
It was only just a dream
I was at the top and now its like Im in the basement
Number one spot now she found her a replacement
I swear now I cant take it
Knowing somebodys got my baby
And now you aint around baby I cant think
I shoulda put it down shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face run my fingers through her hair
My lover my life
My shawty my wife
She left me Im tight
Cause I knew that it just aint right
Uh uh uh hey
I was thinking bout her thinking bout me
Thinking bout us what we gon be
Open my eyes yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Will she come back No one knows
I realize yeah
It was only just a dream
When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher on but I cant let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn  for
More and more I miss her when will I learn
Didnt give her all my love I guess now I got my payback
Now Im in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey she was so easy to love
But wait I guess that love wasnt enough
Im going through it every time that Im alone
And now Im missing wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong
Uh uh uh
I was thinking bout her thinking bout me
Thinking bout us what we gon be
Open my eyes yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Will she come back No one knows
I realize yeah
It was only just a dream
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now theyre gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Everything  Hey 
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now theyre gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Uh uh uh
I was thinking bout her thinking bout me
Thinking bout us what we gon be
Open my eyes yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Will she come back No one knows
I realize yeah
It was only just a dream
Uh uh uh
