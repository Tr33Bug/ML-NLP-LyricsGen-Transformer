Uh uh uh
Ayo ma how you doin Its your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now Im tryin to do some things thatll make you proud
Instead of every time I call its to bail me out
Oh why didnt I listen to things you used to tell me
Knowin that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya aint nothin I can do
When them laws get they hands on you but I aint listenin
Even payin attention Im just tryna get mine
Takin advantage you workin two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful complainin about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through and what do I do
I wreck both your cars stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard stayed into with them laws
Tryin to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want
Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh I said whatever you need
Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh I said you dont have to work no more
Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh uh cause ya son will be there for you
Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh uh
Now verse two yeah thats for you boo
I send you props cause you the only one that stuck through
When Im upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When Im depressed you give me head off in the bathtub  EI 
On your Ps and Qs on your Qs and Ps
You hear my beeper goin off and you just throw me my keys
Aint even askin me yo is it coochie or Gs
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin but you toast with me
Livin at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldnt hesitate to go to court for me
Need money My booll go and work the avenue
My booll fuck you up if I ask her to
Thats why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want


Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh I said whatever you need
Dont stop ever lovin me 
Uh uh I said I dont wanna lose you no
Dont stop ever lovin me
