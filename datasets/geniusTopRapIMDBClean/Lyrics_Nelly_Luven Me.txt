Luven Me Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh huh uh uh (Woo!)
Uh uh, uh

Ayo ma, how you doin'? It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do
When them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'
Even payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send you props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)
On your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want
You might also like
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

I'm doin' this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D
D Quick, Boo Gees and Fatty
My nigga Lil' Erv, Gino and Poochie
And everybody over on Euclid and Labade
Young Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby
Rio, J.T. and Big Money
Herky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody
J.E., K-Ug and Odie
Toe-Fa, M.J., and Colby
And all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday
My Lunatic fam, Kyjuan, Murphy Lee
City Spud, T-Love and Big 'Li
Yellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B
The rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C
And without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, 'cause y'all my niggas for life you know
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, you can always smoke with me
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, uh

(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
Just like that, you know
Anybody else I forgot, in the city
(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
North side (If you feel me, pop it and lock it)
South side, all the shorties, you know who you are
All the BC's, you know who you are
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
I ain't got to give shouts out to everybody, y'all know5Embed
