I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now its flipped and I dont want you with no other man
Why cant you understand that anything Im offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on me at the mall again
Its all his fault again thats what youre telling all your friends
I aint pointing fingers ma I just wanna call again
See how your day going I know they stressing on you
I know them times get hard thats why Im checking on you
Its yours truly ma I got a little message for you
Anything he can do girl I can do better for you cause
When we laugh or we cry its together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one its forever
Its forever its forever
Wont you come on and go with me  come and go with me 
Oh girl come on over to my place  my place my place 
Wont you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl we gon do it our way  our way 
I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this aint the truth then hopefully its not a lie
Cause I aint got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma but the sex wasnt one
Now check it I know you get excited  still  when I come around and bite it
Girl  quit frowning up and quit acting like you dont like it
I like it  I know you like  I like it 
You really like it  I really really like it 
I want it  I know you want it  adore it 
Adore it  so come let me enjoy it 
When we laugh or we cry its together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one its forever
Its forever its forever
Wont you come on and go with me  come and go with me 
Oh girl come on over to my place  my place my place 
Wont you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl we gon do it our way  our way

Feels like a long time
Long long time since I seen you

And I know I said some fuckedup things to you before
But girl you know I didnt mean it

If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
Would you believe it

When we laugh or we cry its together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one its forever
