Welcome to Nellyville where all newborns get a halfamill
Sons get sedan DeVilles soon as they can reach the wheel
And daughters get diamonds the size of their age  Im talkin
One year get one carat two years get two carats
Three years get three carats and so on into marriage
Nobody livin average everybody jangalang
Nobody livin savage erybody got change
Even the paperboy deliver out the back of a Range
Its not a game its a beautiful thang
Imagine blocks and blocks of no cocaine blocks with no gunplay
Aint nobody shot so aint no news that day
Aint nobody snitchin they refuse to say
Every month  we take a vote on what the weather should be
And if we vote it rains  know how wet we want it to be
And if we vote it snow  know how deep we want it to get
But the sun gon shine 99 percent in Nellyville
Theres no way I I could explaiiiiin
The way I feel right now
Theres no way I I could explaiiiiin
The way I feel about livin in Nellyville
I got that good at ery gas station pull on up
Give me a half a ounce of that shit fill it up
We got straws for the bottles outlaw the cups
And we gon make it happen aint no need for no luck
Aint no lotteries no pick 3s or pick 2s
Keep the money in your family gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon do what the dice gon do
And if you take a life you gon lose yours too
Aint no trials its automatic you drop em right where it happen
You do unto others if you dont want it dont do the cappin
Think thats cool 40 acres and a mule
Fuck that Nellyville  40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms full bath with a jacuzz
Sixcar garage pavement smooth
Both front and back deck nough room to land a jet
And you aint reached the city thats just the projects
Theres no way I I could explaiiiiin
The way I feel right now
Theres no way I I could explaiiiiin
The way I feel about livin in Nellyville

 Everybody uh now everybody say
Well I want to go please let me go
I need to go  down to Nellyville
I need to see what I can see
Wont you and me  go to Nellyville
I want to go so bad
I just want to go and look
Wont you please take me on in
I just know I gotta be there
No unexpectancy like teenage pregnancy
And physical mental attraction your only ecstasy
Your own destiny create your own recipe
If you aint livin accordin to dirty then you stressin me
And who are you Who me Im the mayor
And any problems you got I live up thurr
Wheres that The house on the hill welcome mat of fur
When you pass by that thang be polite and dont sturr

The way I feel about livin in Nellyville
