You know back before the records
Before you went to college and became this person who you are
Oh congratulations on that anyway too so
But for a long time its been somethin I need to tell you
Uhh uhh uhh  listen
You see we been knowin each other since we were about this high
Same elementary shared the same bus stop
Even as a youngster I knew you was so fly
Even back then I knew you were the one
I watched you grow I watched your transformation
Right through school to your current occupation
It took this long for me to man up and have this conversation
But fuck it here it go
I want you to want me
Girl I need to know that I can be your one and only
I need you to need me
See you were my worst mistake girl and thats why
Its hard to keep my cool when I see you with him
Cause I really wish that you were right here
Tell me whats it take to win just a  piece of your heart
My only kryptonite is you thats why anything you say Ill do
So let me stop for a minute take a second to say
Girl you take my breath away awayyyy
Girl you take my breath away  awayyyy 
You take my breath away you take my breath away yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh
They say one mans trash is the next mans treasure
Where one finds pain the next might find pleasure
I dont pay attention to them haters now or never
I dont give a damn who was before me  me 
All that matters is youre with me now
All I need to know is that youre down
Man its somethin special about roundtheway ladies
Rideordie baby girl

Uhh uhh its like I die a little every time I see you with this guy
Thinkin to myself Now why the hell she with that guy
While she aint by my side we would be so fly
We would live that life
The life you used to dream is all about rappin
Back when I used to pull my BMX up alongside of your Schwinn
See and here we are again
Funny how fate brought my Phantom up alongside of your Benz
And still

Yeah so I mean like I said
You know we been knowin each other for a long time
You seen me go through I seen you go through

Will let me know what you think about this right here aight
