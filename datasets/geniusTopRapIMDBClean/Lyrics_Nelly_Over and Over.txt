And I cant take it yeah I cant shake it no
I cant wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And its a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again

And I dont know what else to do
I cant go on not lovin you
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I cant keep picturin you with him

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
Yeah and I cant take it yeah I cant shake it no
I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
