And I cant take it yeah I cant shake it no
I cant wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And its a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
