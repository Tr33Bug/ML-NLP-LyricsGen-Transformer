Roc the Mic  Remix  Lyrics
You know we hadda do a remix right
Ho Ho Ho Ho
All you Young Gunnerz
Hey Just this the one right here baby
I told you dawg
Its B Sig in the place with State P
And we got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah
Still watch what you say to B Sig
Cause I still will knock your ass the fuck out
I bring the hood when Im travelin
Scrap backwoods unravelin
Scrap smoke good when we travelin
Forget the Macs cause the Ks fit good in the Caravan
I clap up your hood like the hammer man
Bring your gat better bust it if you get that close
Scared to clap better strap your folks  strapyourfolks 
Who want beef with State P
Enemies try to speak to me
Negative they dont get that close
Its Free listen
Blow trees with Mac Mittens
No we didnt  Yes we did
Switch beginnings Smith and Wesson precision
Bring the broads down with ribbons
Leave a mess in your crib 
Not a brave nigga
Fuckin with some made niggas 
Hit him with the AK nigga
Free no you didnt 
Yes I did
Overpayed shit Wait a minute
When this fakin snatch the cake up out his crib
Then slide uh 
Im like the baker with your pies
Then rise 
Set up shop and distribute where you live
Its Freeway in the place with my squad
And we got what it takes to DUMP the K
FLIP your ride


Its B Sig in the place with State P
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah
Still watch what you say to Young Free
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out
Its Freeway in the place with State P
And we got what it takes to the rock the mic right Yeah
Still watch what you say to B Sig
Cause we got what it takes to dump the DE
Its Nelly in the place with Murph Lee
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah
You better watch what you say around herre
Cause theres somethin on my waste to make the whole place break
Its Murph dun in the place with Nelly
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right Yeah
You better watch what you say to my face
Cause I got what it takes to shake the whole place
Murphy Lees eighteen entertainin em
Twentyone when Im clubbin it
Fake ID for the fuck of it
Im just a school boy somewhat new boy
If you cant get Nelly youa settle for who boy
Two toy carrier two stashes
One truck that seats six asses
22s to confuse the masses
Remove glasses blow smoke up in my ashes
I used to drive my mama stuff
Now the school boy puttin twenties on the Bomb Pop truck
I make rappers go back to the block
They be like maybe I was better off selling rocks
Im Murphey Lee in the place to be punk
And I got enough skunk to fill the whole blunt
I take trips with chumps up in my trunk
And I take em real far to a safe place to dump
Its Mr Down down Im witcha dirty get down and lay down
Finance a paydown heard what I said now
See how I procede with caution
My whip crack fast all you niggas is horses
Randy Moss I play when I wanna
Nut check gut check cause I say what I wanna
Around six in the six with the throwback
Sixers number six Julius Irv
Cris and the herb make it hard to swerve
Throw your hands up if you didnt bang your rim on the curb
You couldnt hit while you was makin a turn
I strike a nerve in old MCs wantin a comeback
I got the strength that hes lost and thats fact
Like K  Know one here even said your name
R  You really feelin guilty bout somethin mayn
S  Sad to see you really just want just
One  more hit please please
You the first old man should get a rappers pension
No hits since the cordless mic invention
Im snitchin matter fact stay the fuck out the kitchen
Nelly kickin with too many dimensions
Midwest and we aim about midchest
Duked on my side too many in my tribe
Coupe outside who the fuck want a ride
All a yall need to one yo self
Go get the burner nigga clap yoself
All a yall need to one yo self
Go get the burner nigga clap yoself
Yeah Its the its the Roc nigga
Ho Ho Ho Ho
And another one
