St Louie Lyrics
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
Im from the home of Red Fox Ced the Entertainer
Jettin off with Brian Cox Ill see ya later
Maybe not cause I got somethin hot
In the Navigator waitin in the parkin lot
A Bad Boy on a Ryde Ruffer than The LOX
I keep em both cocked Nina and Sabrina
Now tell me boys have ya seen her
Have you seen her nine millimeter
Makin niggas believers
Hop out the twoseater in a Vokal wife beater
Levis fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff
Like fuck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the Galleria Plaza or Chesterfield
Rollin down Hanley Hills in a black Sedan Deville
I used to love it when they hit me for a rocker
Maybe a bopper I kept it proper
A nonstopper around the clocka
Now its cool to pull up the Benz and helicopta uh
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
Sunday mornin crack of dawn and Im yawnin
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway is where Im goin
Wake up man and start blowin
Gotta get those juices flowin
Now Im gonna tell ya one more time
For you cats that just aint knowin
Hey you can find me in St Louie
In the hole with me Fetty and Leezy gettin swoll
Grabbin the Optimo sharpin up my flow
Practicin for my shows thats usually how it goes
We be ready to go the chronic already rolled
Swingin through OFallon Sounds knockin out of control
Like a boom boom boom who is it Its Jackie Frost
The one whos gettin where he at and he showed you who was the boss
Im like a human hot sauce
Thinkin Ill burn your thoughts
Your information was false
Ill show you just what it costs
In the M I crooked letter crooked letter O U R I
No one could do it better hey


You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
Now in the middle we keep it crunk and jiggy
Love Pac and Biggie
The way that you love your sticky
Call Louie he have you pissy
Mix with hen and crissy
Bumpin Tim and Missy
With Slim that used to diss me
In the red Expedition
Thats okay though she can ride just for the day though
Cant even be a house guest like Kato
Im a dog I said it woof woof
Now call me Snoopy
Wouldnt have me in a hooptie
Now you see me in a coupie
In front of utopia Im hopin ya
Come down here chirpin may Im toastin ya
Thanksgiving round these parts yo we roastin ya
And when the heat come down
Get ghostin ya  god bless us 
Loax with us just how he folks with us
My daddy told me that Im supposed to bust
Dont be provokin us
It aint no joke in us
Just the North South East West coast and us
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St Louie
Where the gun play ring all day  nanana 
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
