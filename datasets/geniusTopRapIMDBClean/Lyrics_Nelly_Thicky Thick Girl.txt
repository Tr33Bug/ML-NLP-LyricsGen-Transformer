Thicky Thick Girl Lyrics
Skkkkrrr
Yah
Ay ay ay ay you thick
Just tell her to come
Come here

See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
So basically I'm a joke right?
Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie
When I use that, shoes untied before you know it, method:
First step we getting naked, pants gone in 20 seconds
It's gettin' hectic, wreck it just like a hooptie with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles twistin' and pullin'
I'm like shorty help me (come on)
Help me (please) don't blow my high, cause I'm too horny
She giggles and gives a horny smile...
So I take advantage
Kisses in gentle places tryin' to get myself established
I'm comfortable, wanna be in that moe with no control
Concentrating on my every lick her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know
IT'S ON, put my penis in accurate, just relax a bit
Now it's my time to party like the lunatics at an after-set

See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
You might also like
Now I comes first like the front porch, in a Polo Sport shirt
Skirts, there they are, gots to flirt cause I'm far
From Average Lame with that "What's your name?" game
I'm stormin' on your brain like a surgeon in the rain
Take the fame if you can, watch me wrap like Saran
All up in these sheets, now you on me like a tan
Leavin me like a van in reverse, that's the worse
Playa curse put up on me now, we spreadin' on my homies
Like a germ, watch me turn into captain kill a ho
Fill a ho strong watch me last long like a penny broke
Many motels I got a rich coupon
I'm doing dismounts on futons, comin' out like Keyuan
I'm ill like ceramic in a hammock, goddamit
That's my words, ooh's and aah's slurred like a verb
Showin' action like an ass like a metaphor
Now I'm headed for the highways selling me by's sideways

See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
I spit mo' shit off into they ears than dialtones and telephones
Just to get their ass back home
Come watch the Bed-rock like Flintstones
But son too strong, so I smoke a sack as fat as Santa (y'know)
Drive me nuts like Planters, hawkin' a nigga like offalana (swish)
I ban ya from the smoke house, trick
Who you think you fuckin with?
Trying to play me like Jim Carrey and pull some dumber and dumber shit
Stomp me like a step show (grab hold) then I let go
(Flows) split that ass like g-strings up on these rat hoes
I pose as a threat, to hit any one of you niggas rattin'
Spit some game and get a bird
Come watch us tag team like free bird
Say the word, I be at rest with all my partners
Straight loungin' with a pocket full of rubbers and have it bouncin'
Go make the announcement, spark more Dynamite than "Good Times"
Want both girls like prime time, want real highs and thick thighs
Take pride in my stabbin', headboards you be grabbin'
Got 'em bangin' the walls so hard the neighbors callin'

Asking you, "What happened? What's goin' on over there even?
Sounds like you guys are goin' crazy"
See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Could be a crime that I'm waiting to commit, girl?
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
See now you could be a lady or a bitch, girl
Still, you're thicky thicky thicky thick
Lookin' like a lolli-pop waitin' for the lick, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick
Remind me of my 6-4 waitin' at the switch, girl
You're thicky thicky thicky thick1Embed
