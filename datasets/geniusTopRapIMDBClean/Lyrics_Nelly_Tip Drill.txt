Tip Drill Lyrics
I said it must be ya ass cause it ain't yo' face
I need a tip drill, I need a tip drill
I said it must be ya ass cause it ain't yo' face
I need a tip drill, I need a tip drill
I said if ya see a tip drill point her out, where she at?
Point her out, where she at?
Point her out, there she go...
I said if ya see a tip drill point her out, where she at?
Point her out, where she at?
Point her out, there she go...
We throwin' money in the air like we don't give a fuck
Lookin' for a tip drill, I mean a tip drill

Now mama girl you gotta friend that don't mind joinin' in
I'm a tip drill, cause I'm a tip drill

Now baby girl bring it over let me spit my pimp-juice
I need a tip drill, I need a tip drill

I said it ain't no fun 'less we all get some
I need a tip drill, we need a tip drill


Now come on girl, you know what we came here for
Is you a tip drill? We need a tip drill

You lookin' good in them shorts, but they look better on the flo'
Cause you's a tip drill, cause you's a tip drill
You might also like
See I wanna let you ride, but the rubber might slide
You's a tip drill, girl you a tip drill

Toot that ass up mama, put that dip in ya back
And let me tip drill, just let me tip drill


We be like andele andele mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ay! What's poppin' tonight?
I said andele andele mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Well If ya head right
I'll be there erry'night

It must be ya money, cause it ain't yo' face
You a tip drill, nigga you a tip drill
I said it must be ya money, cause it ain't yo' face
You a tip drill, nigga you a tip drill
My apple bottom lookin' right, I know you wanna bite
You's a tip drill, I heard you was a tip drill
My apple bottom lookin' right, I know you wanna bite
You's a tip drill, I heard you was a tip drill
I got you payin' my bills and buyin' automobiles
You a tip drill, nigga you a tip drill
I got you payin' my bills and buyin' automobiles
You a tip drill, nigga you a tip drill
I know you a trick go an' spend that shit
You old tip drill, you monkey-ass tip drill
I know you a trick go an' spend that shit
You old tip drill, you monkey-ass tip drill
