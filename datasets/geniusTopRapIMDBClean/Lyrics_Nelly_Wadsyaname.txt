Sad to say I'm only in town for the night (ya see)
I got like 8 hours left before my flight (look herre)
Heyo I'm trying to stay respectful and polite (ya dig)
Now you can tell me go to hell, if ya like
Now I ain't one of them niggas that wanna trip
Get mad cause you ain't interested, he yellin fuck you bitch
Now don't get it twisted, yeah I'mma look when you pass
But I ain't the one to pull on your arm or grab your ass
You see its the swagger, It won't allow me lookin thirst
Now I ain't attacking unless I get a signal first
And I ain't the one thats gon be playin and do the do
Before its over you gon say (shit I should pay you)
Please believe it

You might also like
I like to see ya independent wit ya job
I like ya got ya own house and ya own car
But ya say you gotta lame ass nigga in your life
And he can't get the mental and physical part right
You playin wit ya toys but ya toys dont bite
See they dont talk shit and they dont hit it how you like
See I just want the first right of refusal, when you catch mood
Just call and I come through and sock it to you, promise you booboo
He said he got the magic stick, well ma my shit is like voodoo
That there stay harder than a rodeo you can ride like Isuzu
But all you need is your leather boots, we riding in birthday suits
My time is movin fast, so thats why I ask ya
