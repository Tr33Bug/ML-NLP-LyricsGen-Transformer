Somebody said they saw you walkin up out the salon
Switching up your hair got your freaky dress on
Said that you were fresh like you were bout to perform
And Ima fucking mess I had you on my own
Wake up  you was gone I cant even blame you
Now you in the arms of a stranger
And now Im all alone with this anger
You used to feel safe now Im danger
So when you had to leave without a warning
Such a whirlwind I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten I cant even pretend
You used to love me but now you aint here
And I hope youre happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I no longer want it
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away yeah 
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanting
All the things that you wanting
But the presence Im holding
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away 
Girl you got me all this stressing and this manic depressing
Im switching up how Im feeling and listening to suggestions
Hey your expression is new thought you knows all up in her IQ
And I could write a book on how to
Ruin a good thing living without you
Thought I paid for my wrongs cause I aint have enough
Told me Im living I had to call you bluff
Now Im calling your phone but you aint picking up
I should have gave you love I should have gave you trust
And now you moved on and youre forgetting us
Im singing this sad song but you dont give a fuck
And I hope youre happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I no longer want it
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away yeah 
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanting
All the things that you wanting
But the presence Im holding
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away 
Theres nothing that hurts more than heartbreak
No one wants to take that fault
Youre thinking about her all day
Nothing else matters at all
And the only thing worse than her living
Is knowing its your fault
And now Im going through hard times
And I hope youre happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I no longer want it
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away yeah 
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanting
All the things that you wanting
But the presence Im holding
I guess I walk away
Guess I got you to walk away
