Work It Lyrics
Let's go oh

Baby, show something (Uh)
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to see you work it
(Come on baby work it for me, yeah)
That ain't frontin (No!)
Show me something (Let me see it, girl)
I just got to see you work it
(I just wanna see you work it for me, yeah)
I heard her talking loud
But she ain't saying nothing
What up with all the frontin
Come on and show me somethin'
You know you wanna do it
Go ahead yo man ain't coming
Please do that thing when you dippin'
Keep yo hips poppin'
What's up with all these questions
And what planning baby girl
You talking to me like you talking to an adolescent
I like to - jump off, jump off
Clothes - come off, come off
Her place, freaky beats, and so and so on
Let your waist pop when the bass knock
I flood the watch to the top 'til it's no clock
Can't even tell the time, but you know it's mine
What time is it ma? It's twenty karats after nine
Are you dehydrated?
Well let me quench your thirst
First thing first, let's do what we rehearsed
Know dem numbers now, it show be break break it
Get up and take a stance and let me see ya...

Baby, show something (Uh)
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to see you work it
(Come on baby work it for me, yeah)
That ain't frontin (No!)
Show me something (Let me see it, girl)
I just got to see you work it
(I just wanna see you work it for me, yeah)

She still talking loud but she ain't saying nothing
Why you ain't moving ma, DJ ain't playing nothing
You tell him to, play this here until these speakers blow
Birthdays, pick a place, baby, we can go
I like yo adllics, she showing no back
She showing up attacks, you wouldn't know
It's like you ghetto ghetto, she bourghetto zhetto
She 5'5 brown eyes, in stiletto letto (Yeah, yeah)
Well did you come alone, or you got 2 or 3
That ain't no thang baby girl cause I got 2 with me
And we gon' all kick it, and you about to see
Just what a day would be if you were in the ride with me
Turning on the headlights, and we be
(Running all the red lights) Oh!
It's full steam ahead, and ain't no stopping now
Now come on heere and drop it, and he gon' tell why

Baby, show something (Uh)
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to see you work it
(Come on baby work it for me, yeah)
That ain't frontin (No!)
Show me something (Let me see it, girl)
I just got to see you work it
(I just wanna see you work it for me, yeah)
Now all my midwest shorties, come on do that thang and
Dance with me, dance with me, yeah
And all my down South shorties, come on do that thang (Come on)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
And all my East coast shorties, come on do that thang ( I said)
Dance for me, dance for me yeah
And all my west coast shorties
Come on do that thang
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

She still talking loud but I hear her better now
She keep a thong print on in any weather now
No sight of a band but I can hear the horns playing
(Da-da, da, da, dat-dat, da-dat, dum)
She got me hypnotized just like that Biggie guy
Cause she been trying to prove her point since we been inside
So we can get it on, just wait 'til we get home
I'm on something, call my partner J
(Momma, come on)

Baby, show something (Uh)
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to see you work it
(Come on baby work it for me, yeah)
That ain't frontin (No!)
Show me something (Let me see it, girl)
I just got to see you work it
(I just wanna see you work it for me, yeah)
I just want to see you work itEmbed
