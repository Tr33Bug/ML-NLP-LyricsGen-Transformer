You see Biggie be like Whats Beef
Me Im like whats weed
Weed is actually a medicine for me you know
Every 4 hours like a prescription Im smoking
And Im thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
Im like one of those halfbaked thugs Im in love
Then after that roll cool Js I mean bud
Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friends a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day Im gone stop
But thatll be the day when my seeds dont pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand as soon as Im sober I forget
Shit Im still stuck at point A ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Yeah I get high you might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
Im sick now I think Im catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner looking for weed donors
You know how we do it kid we get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out the way we smokes absurd
Thats my word Wrap Sumden  Wrap Sumden 
Make a nigga clap something get all mad and slap something
Yo grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time roll up its clutch time
And I burn mine dont you ever ever touch mine
Fire it up dog but watch out for 50
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows and get blowed
Ayo this is no lieieie

Ayo this is no lieieie

All I know is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasnt high Id probably know a little more
But since I dont some might consider me slow
Dont worry though
I keep the pants sag bubble eye hands rag
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but dont the blunt pass
What we doin today Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
50 behind me my niggas so hold up
Okay made a left so continue to roll up
Dont get me wrong police yo I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave Ill be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab
Ayo this is no lieieie
Me and my niggas gettin highighigh
Yo if you look up in the skyyy
You might see us floating byyy

Me and my niggas gettin highighigh
