Yo
Man
Man
Uh

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
Uh, man, I been did that, man, I been popped off
And if she ain't tryin' to give it up, she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie, bitch, bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off, no joking, like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South, but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat (Bow!)

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing (Tru!)
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap (Yeah)
I beez in the trap, bee-beez in the trap (2 Chainz!)

Okay, now, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this doohickey
If I weren't rapping, I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping, I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping, I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no Bobby, but my denim be from Ricky (Ricky)
Got your girl on Molly, and we smokin' loud and drinkin' (Drinkin')
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin' (Thinkin')
I—If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin (Franklin)
Money (Money), thousands (Thousands)
True Religion trousers (Tell 'em!)
Got a private home, started from them public houses (Damn)
Hair weave killer (Killer), causing her arousal (Tru)
Audi A8, told them "outtie 5000," uh!
