You should say it right now
Anybody wanna buy a heart
Anybody wanna buy a heart
Anybody wanna buy a heart
Cause I dont use the shit anyway
But okay I guess its my fault
Westside shorty with an eastside nigga
They say its levels to this shit Im a G5 nigga
And every city I be in you know she fly with us
Its like Hov got Bey its like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take yall back
09 double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up double parked hopped out tried to spit my game
It didnt work got shot down
But I can tell by the bag by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team shorty mine now
And we dont ever ever ever make love
And we dont ever ever ever say love
Unless Im all up in it she tellin me she love that D on that I dont ever say uh
Bad bitch aint nothin made up

Rihmeek Ima have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play you aint say this the other day
You said you was in love and I still didnt budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
Im not even sure if this is right but it feels good 
I could tell you was analyzing me I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasnt looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say Im busy yo
Cause its too much and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when youre away I cant get you out of my mind
But what if Im not the one and youre wasting your time
But you waited
