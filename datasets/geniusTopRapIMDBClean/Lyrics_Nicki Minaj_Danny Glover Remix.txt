Danny Glover (Remix) Lyrics
I got somethin' for you lookin'-ass niggas
Week and a half, I'ma be in that ass... pause
It's like I'm working on an album and a mixtape at the same motherfucking time!

Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

Who the fuck told you
That Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' layup
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab
You might also like
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

Every time I come out, I ainâ€™t ever with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'ma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious (vicious)
Every time I fuck him, I say "Whose is it?"
Yo! Who the fuck told 'em that, "They was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!"
I'ma give bitches a minute of shine, then I'll tell 'em good riddance (good riddance)
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know, cause these bitches my sons
Yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign, and then I said, "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion, I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
B-b-b-b-but, bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake, that I am comin' for Jessica Biel
Bitch, I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomorrow
Doors go up, 'cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink, just so I could take pictures, while you rented yours
H-H-H-Hell of a ticket, h-h-h-h-hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but let's be precise
'Cause if she pretty then watch it, 'cause I'ma be fuckin' ya wife
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thugga tenant
100 bands at a time, I fronted you bands, but you
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy, I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof, all the niggas' dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets255Embed
