I came to win to fight
To conquer to thrive
I came to win  JR  to survive
To prosper to rise
To fly
To fly
Uh yo yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe thatd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin but I think Im still an angel away
Angel away yeah its strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin at me
But I become Neo when they aimin at me
Me me me against them
Me against enemies me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin and I start risin
Must be surprisin Im just surmisin
I win thrive soar higher
Higher higher more fire
I came to win to fight
To conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive
To prosper to rise
To fly
To fly
Uh yo yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin every time it locks me in
Paintin they own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Cause I am not a word I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I aint got no motherfuckin time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes


I came to win to fight
To conquer to thrive
I came to win to survive
To prosper to rise
To fly

Get ready for it

I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
