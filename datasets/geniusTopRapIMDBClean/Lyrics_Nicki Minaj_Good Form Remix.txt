You see a bad bitch coming through yo whats the hold up
Im in that new new me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up
Yo hold up hold up hold up okay hold up
He see me lookin pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up its a hold up
Run me the money  Go 
Cause I be the baddie B Barbie tings banging body B  Go 
Everybody be on my D yo I gotta be  Go  in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the Bach back of the Bach
Back of the Bach back of the Bach  Woo 
Who on Barbie D Who on Barbie D Everybody  Go 
Ooh you gotta see honestly on my odyssey  Go 
Im the baddest B I dont even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax you in the back of the Bach
Come on 
See a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we aint ever hatin in TheShadeRoom
See I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you aint ever in the same room
I tell him eat the cookie cause its good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I dont never cheat because Im good to him
Might gotta have his baby nurses yellin push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie cause its good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when Im pullin up Im in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me ooh he love me good for him
Come on come on come on
I be like ooh he love me ooh he love me good for him
Come on
I slick slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say Kiss kiss
Im in that new new De La Renta channeling Bugs Bunny
Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
Im only loyal to the niggas thatll bust guns for me
The jig up its a stick up run me the money  Go 
Cause I be the baddie B Barbie tings banging body B  Go 
Everybody be on my D yo I gotta be  Go  in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the Bach back of the Bach
Back of the Bach back of the Bach  Woo 
Who on Barbie D Who on Barbie D Everybody  Go 
Ooh you gotta see honestly on my odyssey  Go 
Im the baddest B I dont even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax you in the back of the Bach
Come on 
See a bitch get more press than a keypad
Before you suck me off get a knee pad
See I pull the strings like a tea bag
Im prolly with my jeweler playin freeze tag
I tell him eat the cookie cause its good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I dont never cheat because Im good to him
Might gotta have his baby nurses yellin push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie cause its good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when Im pullin up Im in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me ooh he love me good for him
Come on come on come on
I be like ooh he love me ooh he love me good for him
Come on
Barbie  Yes  I think you gnarly  Ooh 
I think you fly these other bitches just larvae  Haha 
When you make that ass jump like my heartbeat
And if you let me eat the pussy then its shark week
Hello may I speak to Tunechi May I ask whos callin
Everybody got the juice without a glass to pour it
I want my cake and eat it too and after that Im starving
I feel like Adam but Im bout to eat a apple on you uh
Rollie on the right side now yall on my time
Please get off my dick before it turn into a pipe bomb
Eyes lookin like Im somewhere outta Taiwan
Faded as fuck as always hi mom
Look dude Ill stomp your ass out in my good shoes
Be my foot stool
Told my lawyer dont call me less its good news
Then my phone started ringing off the hook snooze brrr
Cause I be the baddie B
