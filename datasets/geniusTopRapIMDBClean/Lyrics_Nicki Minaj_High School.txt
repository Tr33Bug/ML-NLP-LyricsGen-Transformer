He said he came from Jamaica he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway I felt him helped him put him on lock seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium welcome
Bitches this pretty thats seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
Im Momma Dee in that order I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk but I like it when he be sober
Thats top of the toppa I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
Im in the zone
They holler at me but its you
You this aint high school
Me and my crew we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby its yours
Anywhere everywhere
Baby its your world aint it  Alright 
Baby its your world aint it  Uh 
She got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money she tell me Make me a wife
I tell her Bitch you crazy fuck wrong with you
And excuse my French but Im a long kisser
And then she try to tell me Im the only one thats hittin
And I say What about them niggas She say What about them niggas
You right what you doing tonight
Put on something tight dont judge me I get life
She love me like a brother but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet Ima need goggles
She tell me thats its mine I tell her stop lyin
Mine and who else She say worry bout yourself
Lil Tune
They holler at me but its you
You this aint high school
Me and my crew we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby its yours
Anywhere everywhere
Baby its your world aint it
Baby its your world aint it
I know you want it boy

Just keep on pushin
Ima let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
