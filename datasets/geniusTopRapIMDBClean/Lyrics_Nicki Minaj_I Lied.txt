I lied I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart
Even though I said I didnt love you  Love you love you 
I lied I lied
Even though I said I didnt need you

To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
Even though I said Dont touch me  Touch me touch me 
I lied I lied
I cant fall for you cant give my all to you
Cant let you think that Ima let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said Lets see
But I aint mean that I need some fuckin proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heartbreaker wont let you break mine
Cause Ill be smashin windows and cuttin them brake lines
I lied
Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows Who knows So I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
Even though I said Fuck you  Fuck you fuck you 
I lied I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasnt real it was magic
If it was a record it woulda been classic
But fuck you though orgasmic  Orgasmic 
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin stallin the truth
Who knew what youd do if I let you in
My mama aint raised no fool I
Im not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide
Fallin so fast Im afraid of you
So I lied
I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart ooh whoa
I lied ooh baby

Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you  Ooh 
Its over now goodbye love  Ah oh 
Youll stay youll stay in my heart  Youll stay in my heart  forever
