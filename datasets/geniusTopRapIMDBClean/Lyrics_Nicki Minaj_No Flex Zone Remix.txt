No Flex Zone (Remix) Lyrics
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter

Hell no, you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a Perc', now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off
Get it, get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off
Bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years, guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought you knew better, do your fucking research
You ain’t know, this the no rip zone
This the you can't beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home
I like bad bitches, 'cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up, ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch, I’m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wan' see her
Muhfuckas flexin', muhfuckas actin'
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Whack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
Whack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone

(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (Hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (Hey) they know better
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getterYou might also like214Embed
