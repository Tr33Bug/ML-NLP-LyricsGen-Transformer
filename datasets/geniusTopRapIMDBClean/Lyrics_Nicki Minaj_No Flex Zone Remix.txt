No Flex Zone  Remix  Lyrics
Hey  No flex zone  hey  no flex zone
Hey  They know better  hey  they know better
Hey  No flex zone  hey  no flex zone
Hey  They know better  hey  they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes got several they tens or better
Im a trendsetter Im a gogetter
Hell no you cant use my lip gloss
Pop a Perc now Im on lift off
Ass still fat its on Rick Ross
You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch ball like Im at tip off
Get it get it wet then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans I can slip off
Bitch Ive been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years guess thats why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me do these bitches teeth hurt
Yes I am an icon thats me on your Tshirt
Thought you knew better do your fucking research
You aint know this the no rip zone
This the you cant beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitts home
I like bad bitches cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick magnitude
Even if they had a longitude latitude
Listen up ho this is my territory
You are my son like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER bitch Im hotter than the DR
When it comes to rap skills nobody wan see her
Muhfuckas flexin muhfuckas actin
Bitches is my sons and they causin contractions
Aint pushing out Ima give them to the clinic
Cah wait we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Whack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if youre ugly its a no text zone
Its a no sex zone its a no flex zone
Whack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if youre ugly its a no text zone
Its a no sex zone its a no flex zone
Hey  No flex zone  Hey  no flex zone
Hey  They know better  Hey  they know better
Hey  No flex zone  Hey  no flex zone
Hey  They know better  Hey  they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes got several they tens or better
Im a trendsetter Im a gogetter
