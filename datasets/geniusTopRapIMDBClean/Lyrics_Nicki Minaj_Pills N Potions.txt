Pills N Potions Lyrics
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin', be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earn that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you when, really, they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
You might also like
Yo, people'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
Bu-bu-but I sped off in the Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy (Kyuh)
So I pop pills for 'em (Rrrah)
Cop cribs in the hills on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry, but
I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it, but
I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I get high off
Your memory
I get high off
Your memory
I get high off
Your memory
In due time
We'll be fine
In due time

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love649Embed
