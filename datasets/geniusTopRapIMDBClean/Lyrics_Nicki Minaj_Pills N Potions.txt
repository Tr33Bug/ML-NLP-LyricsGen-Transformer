Pills and potions

Pills and potions
Were overdosin
Cant stand it but

Ayo they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin wasnt tasteful
Even though you out here lookin so ungrateful
Ima keep it movin be classy and graceful
I told em its no friends in the game you aint learn that yet
All the bridges you came over dont burn that yet
Niggas want respect but niggas aint earn that yet
Selfrighteous and entitled but they swearin on the Bible
That they love you when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still dont wish death on em I just reflect on em
Pills and potions
Were overdosin

I still love you

Yo peoplell love you and support you when its beneficial
Ima forgive I wont forget but Ima dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin good now its kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they cant come and live lavish wit you
Bububut I sped off in the Benzy
I see the envy when Im causin a frenzy  Kyuh 
So I pop pills for em  Rrrah 
Cop cribs in the hills on em
