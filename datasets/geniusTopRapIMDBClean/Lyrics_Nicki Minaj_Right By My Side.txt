Right By My Side Lyrics
Go!

It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, oh, boy

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, no, woah)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (woah, oh, oh, yeah)

Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one
Right around the block from the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girl, just sit down, let's talk it out
One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, and she's just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, girl
You might also like
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (woah, oh, oh)

I can't eat, I, I, I, I
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I
What I need, I, I, I, I
Is you right by my side, I
I can't eat, I, I, I, I (you)
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I
What I need, I, I, I, I (I, I, I)
Is you right by my side, I (yeah, yeah)

It, it, it, it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, I'm not livin', oh, yeah)
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (no, no, no, no)
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (oh, yeah, I'm not livin', I'm not livin, ooh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (ooh, baby)
I (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
Life (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
Right (woah, oh, oh, yeah)
If you're not by my side (woah, oh)

I can't eat, I, I, I, I
I can't sleep, I, I, I, I (I can't eat)
What I need, I, I, I, I (I can't sleep)
Is you right by my side, I (without you, baby)47Embed
