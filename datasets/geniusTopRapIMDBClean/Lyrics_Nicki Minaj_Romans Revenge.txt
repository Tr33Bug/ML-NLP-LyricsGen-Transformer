I am not Jasmine I am Aladdin
So far ahead these bums is laggin
See me in that new thing bums is gaggin
Im startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Im startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzin
So fuck I look like gettin back to a hasbeen
Yeah I said it hasbeen
Hang it up flatscreen

Hey Nicki hey Nicki asthma
I got the pumps it aint got medicine
I got bars sentencin
Im a bad bitch Im a cunt
And Ill kick that ho punt
Forced trauma blunt
You play the back bitch Im in the front
You need a job this aint cuttin it
Nicki Minaj is who you aint fuckin with
You lil Fraggle Rock beat you with a padalock
I am a movie camera block
You outta work I know its tough
But enough is enough
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
I aint into SM but my whips off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twistedass mind got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head fuckin pencil for a frame
You dont like it then peel off bitch
Every last woman on Earth Ill kill off
And I still wouldnt fuck you slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God Ill piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning spin and wheel off
Snap the axle in half bust the tierod
Quit hollering Why God
He aint got shit to do with it
Bygonesll never be bygones
The world aint finished swallowing my wad
I aint finished blowing it nice bra
Hope itll fit a tough titty bitch lifes hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin face and called me a fuckin tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is lifes treating you like dry sod
Kick it back in its face my God
Its Shady and Nicki Minaj you might find the sight quite odd
But dont ask why bitch ask why not
The worldworld is my punching bag and
If Im garbage youre a bunch of maggots
Make that face go on scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a rah rah like a dungeon dragon
You fell off off they mustve bumped your wagon
You mustve went off the back Im bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane you just jumped in traffic


Is this the thanks that I get for puttin you bitches on
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone
Shouldve sent a thankyou note you little ho
Now Ima wrap your coffin with a bow
Nicki shes just mad cause you took the spot
Word that bitch mad cause I took the spot
Well bitch if you aint shittin then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn thatll off your top
I hear the mumblin I hear the cacklin
I got em scared shook panickin
Overseas church Vatican
You at a standstill mannequin
You wanna sleep on me Overnight
Im the motherfuckin boss overwrite
And when I pull up vroom motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin buck overbite
I see them dustyass Filas Levis
Raggedy Anns holes in your kneehighs
I call the play now do you see why
These bitches callin me Manning Eli
Manning Eli these bitches callin me Manning Eli
All you lil faggots can suck it
No homo but Ima stick it to em like refrigerator magnets
And Im crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah look whos back again bitch keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have yeah right
Still hungry my ass you assdicks had gastric bypass
Aint hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin balcony
Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is so why ask
When Shady and Nickis worlds clash
Its high class meets white trash
Rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Rah rah rah like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon like a dungeon dragon

Wash your mouth out with soap boys
