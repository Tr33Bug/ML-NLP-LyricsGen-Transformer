The Crying Game Lyrics
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three, three words that you're missing?
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)
You might also like
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone
'Cause the tears don't end

Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

I could've given everything (Everything)
Don't wanna let the tears begin (Everything)
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

Oh-oh, oh-oh
