Here we go again its the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You aint play your cards right you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin a wedding Caucasian doves
You was just tellin your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game heart laced with slugs
Are you alone Do you need someone
Is it too late to talk Did I wait too long
Thousand words dont change a thing
Is it only three three words that youre missing
Whered you go Couldnt see I was too busy
Couldve just said no where would you go I think I know
Ohoh ohoh
Were back to playing were back to playing
Ohoh ohoh
Were back to playing the crying game
I couldve given everything
Dont wanna let the tears begin
Were back to playing the crying game
I couldve given everything
Dont wanna let the tears begin
Were back to playing the crying game
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it aint no EZ Pass you gotta use the toll
Aint no cruise control you bout to lose control
Aint no smilin faces here we slammin doors and dishes
Sayin we dont miss each other but its all fictitious
Sayin that we had enough but enough of what
Another slap to the face another uppercut
Im just abusive by nature not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know its hard I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin or goin
I couldnt breathe and you aint even know it
How come you never show it All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved  To love and be loved 
Im losin a thing I thought Id win
And Im comin undone
Cause the tears dont end
Whered you go Couldnt see I was too busy
Couldve just said no where would you go I think I know
Ohoh ohoh
Were back to playing were back to playing
Ohoh ohoh
Were back to playing the crying game
I couldve given everything  Everything 
Dont wanna let the tears begin  Everything 
Were back to playing the crying game
I couldve given everything
Dont wanna let the tears begin
Were back to playing the crying game
Ohoh ohoh
Ohoh ohoh
