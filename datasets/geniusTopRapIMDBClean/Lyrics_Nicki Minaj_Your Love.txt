Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama lil mama I call him baby

When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
