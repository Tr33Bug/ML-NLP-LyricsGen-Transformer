And he keep a dorag keep the wave on swim
Wwwaves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
S on my chest cause Im ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama lil mama I call him baby

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb
Hot damn make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
S on my chest let me get my cape on
Hes so thugged out Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict just like Akon
