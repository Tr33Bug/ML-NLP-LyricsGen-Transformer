Yuh me and my nigga Rimpau was on the way to the studio
And cuz had that um that Wiz and Curreny mixtape in the tape deck the CD changer
And I heard this beat Im like What the fuck
Yahp
Ya know only thought its right for my 58000th leak
Shit hear we go
Like this look
Seven days a week seven different freaks
But I got tired of fuckin hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watchin Godfather leather couches flat screens
I say Im on this marathon she ask me What does that mean
Aint no puff and pass please roll your own I do the same
Girl get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame thats why youre not used to this game
And if you lookin for me Ill be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin gear cause I dont need no runway
My final destination is a cloud its a oneway
Fuckin with them streets aint no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I dont never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets never on no sober shit
Posttraumatic stress I feel like thats what Im copin with
So I smoke the best impossible not to notice this
30000 feet up I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time aint even over yet
Im tryna live my life so when its over I got no regrets
The keys to success multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it til its over with
Napa Valley Dolce my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof ayy you know who you rollin with
Hussle
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You aint gotta worry and we aint gotta rush cause we not in no hurry
You cant be afraid to let go you gotta let go of yourself
But you aint gotta worry cause this gon take some time
But we not in no hurry
58000
This marathon continues
