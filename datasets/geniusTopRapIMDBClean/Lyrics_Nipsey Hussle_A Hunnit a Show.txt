Yeah  Yeah 
Plug  Plug 
Bidness  Bidness 
Yeah look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you girl you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And nigga Ima die for my fuckin respect
You fuckin with a young nigga
Two twelves in the trunk nigga
Havin everything he want nigga
Life in the rush nigga
Probably never good enough nigga
All he wanna do is stunt
Niggas always lookin up to him whole spot goin up to him
New money gettin stuck to him
Life it was rough to him
Skinny nigga he was buff to it trying to do it like Puff do it
Do it like Russ do it real life said Whats up to it
Need a Benz nigga fuck Buick
Made a plan and I stuck to it
Im the man you a bluff to us small talk such a sus to us
The money is a must to us
We came from these corners but we at it til we affluent
You gotta bring your guts to it
Tryna get it to the point they gotta bring it in a truck to us

Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you girl you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And nigga Ima die for my fuckin respect
Smoke with me


All em blogs never shook a nigga
Hundred racks just to book a nigga
Greatest ever like a Brooklyn nigga
All this ice here is hard to overlook a nigga
Fell in love with that fast money
50 racks on that back end
Walk through cause four bricks
Maybachs when I back in
LAX Nip roll that pound
Poolside at that polo lounge
MOB bitch hold that down
Pinky ring gold Rolex crown
Testify never go that route
Black bottles that Mot out
My first mil I had a Kodak smile
Tell the plug Bring more back now
Fake jewels never tolerate it
Pray Boobee case exonerated
Every night I thank God I made it
Every night I thank God I made it
My bitch bad like Paula Patton
Big ass mansion from all that rappin
Tell the police Call the captain
Motherfucker Ima start the clappin
Yeah look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you girl you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And nigga Ima die for my fuckin respect
