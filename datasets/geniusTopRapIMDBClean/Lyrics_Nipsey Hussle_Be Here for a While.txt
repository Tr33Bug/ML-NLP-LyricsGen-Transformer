Thats right
Yeah look
Blue cup black gun
Paid dues thats done
Favors from me cant ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me I kept this shit super solid
Came up and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe I got stupid dollars
Im a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic Im honest
I get paid to speak my mind and its crazy to me
Just pay me fooly if I wrote a script itd be a crazy movie
About my life about rolling dice
About taking risks you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself on the coldest nights
Cant turn it down you gotta own the fight
Win lose or draw you could ball
You couldve kept it real but nigga yous a fraud
Before you get the shit you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that yous a God
And thats real shit thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit like How the fuck did we build this
Real shit look
Blue cup black gun
Paid dues thats done
Favors from me cant ask none
Came in the game then I passed up
And I cant stop wont stop
Im the type to get more guap
You the type to fa sho flop
Im from Brynhurst and them dope spots
Now look
Its hard but its fast see these haters dont care
When they see you they stop and stare
See you they stop and stare 
Rollin on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin kush and switchin lanes  Switchin lanes 
See the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See we wont stop until we reach the top
And we gon be there for a while
Aye check it out look
Im still runnin laps takin fades I still run it back
Talkin guns I got a hundred straps
And I be in your bush if you fuck wit Fats thats a fact
I dont fuck wit rats
This boss life I got a lust for that
Pullin up at Saks blow a hundred sacks in my V12
I dont fuckin slack not at all
I gotta ball they shot my dog
Rest in peace my nigga Frogg
Life is short nigga then its gone
But in the meantime we tryna get it all
You should get involved Im really raw
Before this rap shit I really balled
Alpinas nigga on white Lincolns nigga
Black Beamers nigga they cant see us nigga naw
Sometimes I get so offended by it
Dont compare me to none of these fuckin liars
Im fuckin flyer Im fuckin realer
Play wit me Ill be a fuckin killer
Dropped seven tapes wit no fuckin filler
Now Victory Laps my fuckin Thriller uh
If you broke I aint fuckin wit you
Unless you went broke while you was fuckin wit me
Then we bounce back cause its nothing really
Gon do it big til they fuckin kill me
Its hard but its fast see these haters dont care
When they see you they stop and stare
See you they stop and stare 
Rollin on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin kush and switchin lanes  Switchin lanes 
See the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See we wont stop until we reach the top
And we gon be there for a while
Yeah
I could remember like bangin on the MPC late night
Gettin kicked outta the house because of that shit
Catchin the 108 to the Blue Line
Niggas sittin on the bridge loadin up they burners sweatin
We were just kids tryna get to it
Takin losses stayin down
Frustration
Go looking back at the shit right now its like its nothin
Its gon feel like that for you too
Hustlers
Its hard but its fast see these haters dont care
When they see you they stop and stare
See you they stop and stare 
Rollin on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin kush and switchin lanes  Switchin lanes 
See the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See we wont stop until we reach the top
And we gon be there for a while
