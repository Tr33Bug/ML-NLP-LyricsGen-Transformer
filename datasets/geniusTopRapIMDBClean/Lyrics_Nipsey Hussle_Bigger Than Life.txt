What up
What it do  Music Corner 
Id like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new Marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need yall hands up though
Yeah look
No I dont want your love
Its not why I make music
I owe myself I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach
And just seem so confusing
That I felt my place in life
A young black man it seems so useless
But I dont want no help
Just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife thats in my back
Will be the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us
Is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it
I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunists
Hoping as you walk across the sands you see my shoeprint
And you follow til it change your life cuz its all evolution
And I hope you find your passion cause I found mine in this music
But I hope its not material cause thats all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institutions double standard
Acting like they not the reason why we ruthless
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history
Look at where I started and look at where Im standing
Yall can say its luck
But I know that its planning
Shout out to the pain
That gave me understanding
Shout out to my gang
It turned me to a savage
So niggas say what they want to
But I go through what you havent
And its not ego driven its not me boasting and bragging
This road I chose to go down
Hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits
And its easy to say Im on now cause you see it and it happened
But before it ever did had to believe and get it cracking
So Im gon take you back then 32 shots in my mack 10
With a dream minus the means my early teens was fucking tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you cant imagine
That I wrestle with at night demons that I fight I cant get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get
It dont matter if you plastic
We was looking for the lights and all we stumbled across was flashes
But tonight
Bigger than average life
Im brighter than Vegas lights
Feeling like I cant lose
Any other day I do
Feels like Im 
It feels like Im 8 feet tall
Tonight is my night
For sure for sure
So if its meant then its gon be
People love it cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it so they hope my homies kill me
But I aint want the fame I just wanted yall to feel me
Its my time so Im going in
We ball till we fall fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin
I know you hoes plotting
I aint worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Got me got me
Say I know God got me
Got me got me
Yeah I know God got me
Got me got me
Yeah I know God got me
See I aint worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Once in a lifetime shit you know
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafucking dream
Fuck what they say do your shit
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history
The marathon nigga
This shit aint gone stop until I say its gone stop
It aint gone stop until you say its gone stop
And it aint gone be unless you make it
Its yo time get up off yo ass
Ten toes down out here you know
I swear to God I shed tears in this muthafuckin booth nigga
For my niggas thats gone
My niggas that cant be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful lil girl Imani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout my nigga Fats

You know what this is its the muthafuckin marathon
This shit aint gone stop man
