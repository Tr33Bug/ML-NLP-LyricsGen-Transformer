Look Im from Westside California they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo tats under yo clothin
Hustla go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it say the wrong hood bullets explodin
I trust few people these days cause thats golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with
And chose to keep inside they circle
Satan sittin on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit my whole clique notorious
Youve heard of us six Os is murderers
You still servin clucks jealous nigga you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts spillin Patrn out my cup
She cant get enough buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin too much I just do my stuff
Yeah I just do my stuff
Hussle Hussle
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
I got Slauson on my back Ed Hardy on my hip
Weight of the world on my shoulders gold rollie on my wrist
Neighborhood chucks blue checkerboard tint
Dickies saggin off my ass walk with a hoodsta limp
Two bricks on my white tee same color cocaine
I aint talkin dope I mean the price of my gold chain
All money in no money out that was my slogan
What I mean by that is stack it up and dont spend no change
I started small time dope game cocaine
Seven grams was thirty rocks that was my program
The block propane young nigga no change
Shootout with no aim so they know yo name
Cause where yo mama paid rent that was yo gang
So when yo homeboy bled that was yo pain
And if yall both catch a case you dont say no names
Thats just the code of the color of my shoe strings
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
Been so many places seen so many things
Niggas stood against tryna chase that cream
This aint livin
This aint livin no
You thinkin you gettin paid hustlin everyday
My homies passin away no
This aint livin  Hustle nigga 
This aint livin no
Look
What happened to the code Streets all in shambles
Niggas powderin they nose put the shame to what we stand for
They think we on some kill another nigga shit
We really on some stay down and diligent
The streets is cold turn innocence to militants
Young niggas gangbangin for the thrill of it
Pops was gone moms was never home
But the streets was right there so they took you as they own
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
Blue Laces shell cases we catch bodies we dont leave no traces
Big faces suitcases if you aint know hoe we gettin paid bitch
