Crenshaw and Slauson  True Story  LyricsPART 1
Look relate to you I cant if yous a fake nigga
Where Level 4 in the state what your mistakes get you
Rap niggas they just wanna double date with you
Twitpic and show these hoes that they affiliate with you
Labels used to treatin rappers like a slave nigga
Starvin artist Just be happy with your fame nigga
Shit changed now its such a different game
All the niggas like myself is controlling everything
If you pay attention see exactly what I mean
Fuck the middleman I said that in 2003
Was 18 White Lincoln chrome feet
Black 40 was my pillow every night I go to sleep
Grown niggas treat me like they OG
Holdin on to every word that the tiny loc speaks
I had a vision that nobody else could see
Sold my shit to DMac a little less than 10 Gs
Brought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam
He matched a nigga next day we went to Sam Ash
We bought a Pro Tools and a microphone
Studio was far from plush but them lights was on
Couple hunned thousand stashed at my mamas home
Real estate in Atlanta but aint nobody know
Mac 11s in the safe hidden in the floor
My bro did it like nobody that Ive ever known
Screens on every wall with 16 camera angles
Double pane bulletproof glass pushin past the haters
Cuban links and Rolexes fold a check from Epic
This industry aint gotta like us but they gon respect it
Built the label up from money we was savin up
No details til the statute of limitations up
Couple niggas got flipped tryna play with us
The demonstrations speak loud so I aint sayin much
Was a charismatic nigga I dont play as much
Cause life is real when you live it in a place like us
School pictures crackin smiles now my face is stuck
Shell shocked to see how much they really hated us
Couldnt keep a kind heart get yo hatred up
Streets smarts nigga get yo information up
Watching Belly smokin blunts take Jamaican puffs
One day Ima have a house and car like Jamaican cuz
Credits roll back to stress pound breakin up
Had to fight before we hustled and it made us tough
Early 90s neighbors rooster used to wake us up
Mama had a bucket and a shack but we aint make a fuss
Blue Cutlass no license 380 tucked
96 Caprice Bolt Da Fatts was savin up
They gettin packed out if niggas try fade with us
Crenshaw and Slauson True Story Zo play the drums
PART 2
I got to this paper no industry favors
Speaking to they soul so they tell me Im they favorite
Been through it myself yeah I know how it make you
Never let em judge you cuz they aint you
I could tell a long story or just say Im grateful
I could tell a gang of reasons or just say Im faithful
I can sell a million records or just mixtape it
They dont really give a fuck long as I just keep pacing
Quiet for a year gave no explanation
Now Im bout to drop I got em on that Proud 2 Pay shit
Half of a million cash he gon offer me a label
Told him that I need to own it so Im cool kept it gangster
Holla back real niggas what you calling that
You see the game fucked up look what part is that
They compare where Im at to where I started at
They put me in the Getty Im a artifact
They cant never hang me on the wall though
We presidents nigga we push buttons
The rest of yall just react
Victory Lap nigga this Marathon
Still dont stop though
Count me up count me up
Im in this shit you niggas is out as fuck
Im used to people doubting Id amount to much
I thrive off the challenge Im a childish fuck
I love toys so Im by the buck
I hate to lose so I play too rough
I speak my mind and say I say too much
Minus the hiphop cops say I dont say enough
I know they listening to my raps
While Im out running these laps
Tryna make my paper stack
Its like this and like that
I think Im KRS
I think Im dead prez
I think Im 2Pac nigga I need some fuckin meds
I think Im Eminem Im going crazy
Shoot in front of the shop Nas  AZ

I never planned to make it to a old nigga
Plant the bag 560 off a zone nigga
Dip my Giovanni feet in chrome nigga
Drop them bitches on Pirellis hit the road with em
I should get the cover of the Rolling Stone nigga
I should perform at the Old Republic or Rome nigga
Im not a rapper or a poet Im a poem nigga
Aint it amazing how Im standing on my own nigga
Always pull up in foreign thats never loaned nigga
Always speaking my music straight from my soul nigga
My business partners Jewish but Im all nigga
Still ghetto that aint wrong is it
Way I see it long as I ball nigga
Im a California don nigga
Hundred thousand on my car nigga
You know very well who you are nigga
PART 3
I been that nigga before the fame happened
That tell them hoes go get my name tatted
I rock a Roley cause my game classic
And repped LA before it came back in
I know yall see me in my lane smashin
I know yall hate me with a strange passion
I made examples out yall lame asses
I love my life yall could hate that shit
All the smart money got they bets on me
And all them real niggas wish the best for me
All these bad bitches got some sex for me
Shout out them bad bitches getting dressed for me
They down to stand in line cause its well worth it
Pull up to my shows in Chanel purses
They jeans fit the worst but they smell perfect
Never argue with they niggas but they yell verses
Ay Im true to this game
Gimme that pussy fore she tell me her name
Ay Im true to this game
All Money In No Money Out on my chain
Ay Im true to this game
No guarantees you gotta live for today
Ay Im true to this game
Do it big til they remember your name
Hustle
Ay Im true to this game
Gimme that pussy fore she tell me her name
Ay Im true to this game
All Money In No Money Out on my chain
Ay Im true to this game
No guarantees you gotta live for today
Ay Im true to this game
Do it big til they remember your name
Hustle
We still them same niggas that we used to be
Blacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me
Hundred thousand for the car so the roof was free
While Im in it flashback on how it used to be
Wildin nigga cant relax it was the youth of me
That make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree
Found myself same time family losing me
But all that violence from the past is what produced a G
All the real LA niggas know the truth is me
No hotline homie I could tell your future free
Get on your Marathon til you bruise ya feet
Or run the streets til the reverend write ya eulogy
Fishbowl in the six with all my jewelry
Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me
Ill never let a broke bitch influence me
Slauson Ave getting money and the proof is me
Cause I tell everybody all the time
Own your masters own your catalog
Cant none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog
If they do theyre lying to you
Or they gon say own some of it or they gon buy it back
All that is bullshit
Just had to get our little thing together
We picked up distribution
Now were strong now were legit nawmean
And were a force to be reckoned with right now word up
