Look my nigga this is dedication this is antihesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy the separation
2Pac of my generation blue pill in the fuckin Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he cant change it
Know he a genius he just cant claim it
Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you cant fade him
How long should I stay dedicated
How long til opportunity meet preparation
I need some real nigga reparations
Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation
Dedication hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice Im done waitin
Im done waitin told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication
Its dedication look
I spent my whole life thinkin out the box
Boxin homies threeonone got DPed but I aint drop
Chirp on me here I come brrt spin around the block
They blurped on me said I ran a stop sign but thats a lie
I spent my whole life starin at the stage
Playin Sega daddy smokin sherm mama playin spades
Catchin vapors grandma said Id get some Jordans for my grades
Thats my baby when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided tryna break it
You take a loss Shit dont cry about it just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback thats my favorite
My nigga L said You do a song with Nip K Dot he a better Crip
I said He a man first you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses
Level four yard livin given to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga
Its bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga yeah straight like that
I give you the game go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin out Grand Ams
Im at the premiere politickin with Top Nip and Snoop
Damn Pac watchin the way we grew from dedication


If it aint congratulate then it look like hate
If it aint congratulate then it look like what Nipsey
Hol up
Look
This aint entertainment its for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I sets not contagious
Lock us behind gates but cant tame us
Used to be Stay safe now its Stay dangerous
Cause aint no point in playin defense nigga
Thats why I dove off the deep end nigga without a life jacket
Couple mil tour the world dawg my life crackin
Cook the books bring it back so its no taxes
Royalties publishing plus I own masters
Ill be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin this out I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin out the eightyfive in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen you got to have it
Dedication hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice Im done waitin
Im done waitin told you that I wasnt playin
Now you hear what I been sayin
Dedication
Its dedication
