Yea all this stress on my brain right
Poker face Im in the game right
Need a week to think maybe 8 nights
Some promethazine and a straight flight
Let me cut off my phone let me get in my zone
Let me center myself just leave a nigga alone
I be back in a few got some rappin to do
Got some stacking still runnin got some lapping to do
All Jokes to the side nigga know that they aint fucking with the flow I provide
Yall notice how I started and now a flow has evolved
And me and Ralo Styles like Wade and Lebron
And its all money in and your bros is in charge
Hoes in mnage for those rose carte blanche
In them out of town suites cus they know we the ones
Equity nigga what ive chosen of course
No 360s clothing and tour
When I do drop Imma blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas like I told em before
Got flow got whores
Got dough get more
Fuck mine get yours
And the show just started nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look you gotta go up floors
I put the 6 on stock I was runnin through tires like chicks on tour
And if im at the game you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
And if im at the fight you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my whore
Wont take no loss wont take days off
We go so hard until we fall
Wont take no loss wont take days off
We go so hard until we fall
A nigga used to dream my realitys a dream now
Nigga used to dream my realitys a dream now
Im livin out my dreams now
Livin out my dreams now now now
Sittin in the trap like damn tryin to turn
Couple grams to a couple hundred grand
I grew up in a town they dont make it out of
If you black you dont live to see a man
You see 21 you done won the lottery
Talkin friends when the streets there
Took a lot from me I washed up from a robbery
Now your name 4657239B state property
Yea you had a dream now you livin out a nightmare
You almost made it little nigga you was right there
Now your release date is in another light year
Yea and its quite clear
All you needed was a little bit of guidance
And your household it was just silence
You was your own mother and your father
How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Gang flags in the land with no hope
Where every fitted hat mean a different hood
Make it out  they still want you in the hood
Your own homies dont want you livin good
Niggas for they self get it understood
Its just a playground full of mood swings
Die for the color of your shoe strings
Wish I had a different way to view things
You either had a rap hook or a hoop dream
From El Segundo to Slauson
Me and Nipsey we young bosses
Never takin no losses
Check the garments nigga lifes marvelous


Wont take no loss wont take days off
We go so hard until we fall
Wont take no loss wont take days off
We go so hard until we fall
A nigga used to dream my realitys a dream now
Nigga used to dream my realitys a dream now
Im livin out my dreams now
Livin out my dreams now now now
