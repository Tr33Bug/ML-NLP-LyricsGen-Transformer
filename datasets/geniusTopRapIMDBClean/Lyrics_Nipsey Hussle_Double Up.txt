Young rich nigga bossed up on his own man
My new shit sound like its Soul Train
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC we for sure bang
Tiny Locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game
Was you born in the 80s Did your mama smoke cocaine
Have you ever seen a whole thang
But you drove to the streets cause you grew up on short change
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drivebys that was road rage
Then we park and hop out learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the OJays
Tryna make a slow change mama still slavin for a low wage
Tryna

Its hard to catch what you cant see

The more niggas talk Ima shine

Posted with my back against the wall
Life is a bitch but she mine
The rag sixdeuce yeah its mine

Your poster on the wall at the dealership
Leave her in the bed legs tremblin
Gettin banged on for your Pendletons

Your response be the reason you exist
Lucky I aint get caught up in the twist
Young nigga blue pager on my hip so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon cry
I be goin to the bank at least three four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut
