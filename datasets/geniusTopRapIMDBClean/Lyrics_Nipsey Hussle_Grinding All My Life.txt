Im married to this game thats who I made my wife
Said Id die alone I told that bitch she probably right
One thing thats for sure not a stranger to this life
Got a safe thats full of Franklins and a shoulder full of stripes  Ah 
Dont know a nigga like myself
I say selfmade meanin I designed myself
County jail fades you could pull my file yourself
Spot raid swallow rocks Im gettin high myself
Look and damn right I like the life I built
Im from Westside 60 shit I might got killed
Standin so tall they think I might got stilts
Legendary baller like Mike like Wilt
96 Impala thug life on wheels
Up against the walls squabble at Fox Hills
Like a motherfuckin boss ask me how I feel
Successful street nigga touchin them first mils  Woah 
All my life been grindin all my life
Sacrificed hustled paid the price
Want a slice got to roll the dice
Thats why all my life I been grindin all my life look

In addition to that fact I went legit Im the shit
Now accordin to the way that Im positioned in this biz
It look like Im just gon keep on gettin rich  Ah 
Know them Westside RSCs is us
LAPD on my dick Ima squeeze and bust
If a rap nigga diss Swiss cheese his bus
All this rap money nigga look I need too much
Money loyalty and love in the dream we trust
You be switchin up the players on your team too much
Tiny Cobby thats my Loc Young Supreme whats up
Aint we travel round the world gettin cream or what
Aint you get off on whoever Hussle seem to rush
Las Vegas strip pop yeah you creamed them punks
After all that lookin tough all he seen was stumps
50 Cent and Mayweather fleed the scene with us
