Pull up in motorcades I got a show today
This all Im tryna do hustle and motivate
Choppers a throwaway hustle the Hova way
Thats why they follow me huh They think I know the way
Cause I took control of things ballin the solo way
And if you pattern my trend I make you my protege
Slauson Ave soldier raised niggas dont know them days
Take you in back of the buildings make you expose your age
Take you across the tracks make you explode a face
Now you official now but you got a soul to save
I just been cookin that new Im bout to drop in a few
Think if I call it the great the people gon call it the truth
Aint really trip on the credit I just paid all of my dues
I just respected the game now my name all in the news
Trippin on all of my moves quote me on this got a lot more to prove
Remember I came in this bitch fresh out the county with nothin to lose
And I dont do this for nothin nah from the ground up yeah
But I dont do this shit for nothin no no not at all yeah
My mama need rent ma need rent yeah she do aw yeah
So I dont do this shit for nothin no not at all all
I told her I got it oh yeah
So I dont do this shit for nothin not at all from the ground up
Hustle and motivate  Woo 
Back in this bitch like I never left
Stand for some shit that you never rep
Passing through stages in life
Through the ups and the downs like its all just another test
Live by the rules like a fuckin ref
I got respect in a hundred sets
Too many chains need another chest
Playin no games if it wasnt chess
Cut from that cloth that you couldnt stretch
Cut from that circle you couldnt test
Heavily pressured and under stress
Even though niggas aint show it we was a mess
Honest attempt play him to the left
Judge a young nigga by they address
Left us no option what they expect
Only thing we knew for sure was to bang the set
Fuck livin basic Im takin risks
Fuck what they sayin Im sayin this
Dont waste your time it dont make you rich
It dont mean nothin so fuck em lets make a grip
Double up triple up make it six
Ballin so hard you could pay a bitch
Lead to the lake if they wanna fish
Make sure them niggas around you stick to the script
This should be written in stone
You should come visit my zone
Dont take my word doublecheck all of my flows
Ask em how Hussle got on
But fuck what you heard
This is for who walked down that road
Sold everything but they soul
Straight off the curb real niggas rich as you nerds
Addressed to whom it may concern
I dont do this for nothin nah
From the ground up yeah
But I dont do this shit for nothin no no not at all yeah
My mama need rent ma need rent yeah she do aw yeah
So I dont do this shit for nothin no not at all all
I told her I got it oh yeah
So I dont do this shit for nothin not at all from the ground up
Hustle and motivate  Woo 
Hustle and motivate hustle and motiv  Cut the bass out

Hustle and motiv hustle and motiv
Hustle and motiv hustle and motivate
Victory Lap
