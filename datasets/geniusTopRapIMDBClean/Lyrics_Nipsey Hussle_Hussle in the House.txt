Look Im comin straight off of Slauson
A crazy motherfucker named Nipsey
Im turnt up cause I grew up in the 60s
Caution to you rap niggas try and diss me
I go hard thats why your bitch wanna flip me
Big guns nigga turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips I give a fuck who you posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now its rap money no advance its all royalties
You broke nigga you could follow me
Its fuck bitches get money keep some hollow heads logically
And Im from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work its a policy  Hussle Hussle 
Its white chalk on the corners
Its yellow tape on the gates
Choppers up above
Thats cause the Tiny Locs runs the streets where Im from
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches thats the way that we do it
First get your grind on then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on  Hussle Hussle 
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah its Hussle in the house
Yeah its Hussle in the house  Hussle Hussle 
Blue rag Shat gold on my neck fat
Gun case catch that cuz Neighborhood I rep that
Shoot first ask last move work fast cash
Brynhurst 10th Ave squabble if you get mad  Hussle Hussle 
And in my lifetime I seen a lot of death
A couple cold nights it look like it was nothin left
But God got me so I got him tatted on my flesh
Slauson nigga you aint heard shit yet
Cuzzy Cobby Hoodsta Rob Tiny Draws
Infant Stone when he come home then baby we dog
And cant forget my big brother Blacc Sam
Just a young hood nigga with a million dollar plan
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches thats the way that we do it
First get your grind on then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on  Hussle Hussle 
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah its Hussle in the house
Yeah its Hussle in the house  Hussle Hussle  look


I came from nothin so did every other rapper
Save the speculation real banger gun clapper
Silence hit the opposition with the MAC
Ill turn him into candles on the curb over blood splats
Fuck rest in peace shirts nigga where your guns at
It done been two weeks and we aint seen no get back
Type of shit is that Your Crippin is wack
You aint poppin you aint turfed up nigga you offdeck
I promise Ill be out lurking with the pump
Gooned up black hoodie on chopper in the trunk
Ready to hop out and do my motherfuckin stuff
Sixoh nigga thats whats up huh
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches thats the way that we do it
First get your grind on then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on  Hussle Hussle 
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah its Hussle in the house
Yeah its Hussle in the house  Hussle Hussle
