I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
Look my mama wanna know why Im bangin
She told me Ima lose my life
I aint trippin Im a crip and Ima do it right
Fore I run from a nigga Ill lose the fight
I gotta hustle Mama Ima move the white
If I died and came back Id do it twice
Brainwashed by the block it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howlin at the moon at night
Mama its cold outside aint no hope outside
Couple niggas gettin money most is broke outside
Rocks in the house sellin dope outside
Reminiscin on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner on my lap and Im dippin in my bucket
Lifes a bitch nigga fuck it
I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
Chyeah they say we probably die slangin bangin pressin the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a chopper for the coppers keep a TEC in the ride
Every nigga got a limit never step on the line
When the set say its on Im expected to ride
When the world say Im on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy the world aint ready for that
Nigga its cold in my hood aint no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldnt cope smokin dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I rode chrome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil off what I wrote in my hood
I aint trippin cause niggas know I spoke for my hood


I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
I dont give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin and my window down
Chunkin up my hood when I hit yo town
Bigger Than Life  Starts at 420 
What up
What it do
Music Corner
Id like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need your hands up though
Yeah look
I dont want your love its not why I make music
I owe myself I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach it just seems so confusin
That I felt my place in life a young black man its seems so useless
But I dont want no help just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife thats in my backll be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hopin as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print
And you follow til it change your life its all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion cause I found mine in this music
But I hope its not material cause thats all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institution double standard
Actin like they not the reason we ruthless
But tonight
Tonight is my night this is my moment
Feelin bigger than life but I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history
Dont judge me by my progress
Look
Look at where I started and look at where Im standin
Yall can say its luck but I know that its plannin
Shout out to the pain that gave me understandin
Shout out to my gang it turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you havent
But its not ego driven its not me boastin and braggin
This road I chose to go down hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits
And its easy to say Im on now cause you see it and it happened
But before it ever did I had to believe and get it crackin
So Im gon take you back then 32 shots and my MAC10
With a dream minus the means my early teens was fuckin tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you cant imagine
That I wrestle with at night demons that I fight I cant get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get it dont matter if you plastic
We was lookin for the lights and all we stumbled cross was flashes
But tonight
Tonight is my night this is my moment
Feelin bigger than life but I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history
So if its meant then its gon be
People love it cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it so they hope my homies kill me
But I aint want the fame I just wanted yall to feel me
Its my time so Im goin in
We ball til we fall fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin I know you hoes plottin
I aint worried bout it cause I know God got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Say I know God got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Yeah I know God got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Yeah I know God got me
See I aint worried bout it
Cause I know God got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Got me  Got me 
Once in a lifetime shit you know
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin dream
Fuck what they say do your shit
Tonight is my night  Marathon nigga 
This is my moment  This shit aint gon stop til I say its gon stop 
It aint  gon stop til you say its gon stop 
Feelin bigger than life
And it aint gon be unless you make it 
But I gotta own it
Its your time get up off your ass 
A victory  10 toes down you here 
I swear to God I shed tears in this booth nigga 
Lets make history
For my niggas thats gone
For my niggas that cant be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful little girl Emani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout out my nigga Fats
Shout out my bro Adam
Shout out my A and Bs
You know what this is its the motherfuckin marathon
And this shit aint gon stop man
One hundred  One hundred one hundred one hundred
