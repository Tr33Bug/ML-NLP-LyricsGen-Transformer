I Dont Stress  Stressed Out  Lyrics
I dont stress out nigga
Poke my chest out nigga
Weight on my shoulder bring the best out nigga
Get it right or you get left out nigga
Playin Pac in my cassette loud nigga
I remember feelin like a stepchild nigga
I would hate to see my momma stressed out nigga
Black Sam would tell me poke your chest out nigga
I could die today Ive made the set proud nigga
And I could fly away but I respect vows nigga
Used to always say Id make the whole world feel this
Now Im on the tour around the whole world nigga
Paparazzi waitin at my hotel nigga
Smokin while Im drivin thats with no Ls nigga
20 bands a month just for your bills nigga
Princess cut diamonds up in your grill nigga
Now smile in every camera and show youre a trill nigga
You feed em what you want cause thats your kill nigga
And through the darkest days I was like oh well nigga
Westside neighborhood against the whole world nigga
I dont stress out nigga
Poke my chest out nigga
Weight on my shoulder bring the best out nigga
Get it right or you get left out nigga
I never fold under mental pressure
I get better aint no code to yall misconception
Im just special this an ode to my innersection
And God bless and save my soul from this imperfection
I cant measure with a number all these niggas restin
But its a lot when you that young to witness life and death
You shellshocked but aint no tears involved
Accept it all thats how the world revolve
Every 12 months you live another year you ball
Hindsight its 2020 that was really God
Cause lookin back it aint no reason why we aint get caught
Mission after mission we was trippin
Me and Baby Bolt Da Fatts in Lil Killa Daves kitchen
Police in the front pistols in the court
When it hit the fan you get to find out who you are
Nervous as a bitch was sweat drippin down my palms
And think through it thug you got to stay calm
I dont stress out nigga
Poke my chest out nigga
Weight on my shoulder bring the best out nigga
Get it right or you get left out nigga
Playin BIG in my cassette loud nigga
I remember feelin like the best out nigga
They aint feel me then but Im a threat now nigga
Im the one that represent the West now nigga
Almost didnt make it cause the set foul nigga
Shitll chip you quicker than the West now nigga
Lock you up in cages how it went down nigga
Ship you out of town you need to pen pal nigga
Plenty times Ive felt like this the end now nigga
But I catch my 2nd wind around the 10th round nigga
Only God knows to where it went down nigga
But if you see us up thats cause we been down nigga
Stand up we dont never sit down nigga
Man up go and get a Benz now nigga
Damn cuhz look at how my campaign killin
Panoramic views chillin under 12foot ceilings
I dont stress out nigga
I dont stress out nigga
