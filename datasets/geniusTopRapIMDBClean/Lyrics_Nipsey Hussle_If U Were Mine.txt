If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
We still up all night
And I breathe your air
Runnin this marathon
You only can
Look now I cant promise commitment but I swear well have fun
If you ask Ill be honest girl you not the only one
Just a man on a mission with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me but way more people show love
Niggas tryin too hard they dyin to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like its a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different too ashamed to just listen
See Im way too 100 so now they hate on my niggas
Tried to hate on my Crippin tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch but they gon hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider you gotta know your position
So if its cool then we can hop in my Mercedes coupe
Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv
Crank the music blowin circles out the roof
And just enjoy the view
She said
If you were mine
I said
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
Let me hit somethin wit you lil mama
Matter of fact
You only can
Ay Im not trippin back and forth with your nigga
Scared to lose what you got as you lookin for something different
Me Fly Crippin international trippin
I got my numbers up and now they pay for my statistics
Yeah young nigga started off with a vision
Built this shit up from nothing to the critics I aint listen
Now transition so check out how Im livin
We V12 pushers and they transmissions is slippin
Nigga get yo bitch cause I be bitchgettin
Treat her like she wanna be treated but I aint trickin
Beat it like she want her shit beated but I dont kiss it
Just blame it on that shit that we smokin plus we sippin
Look double cups she tryna double up
Cause I just hit it once but she caught a double nut
Nasty since she use to double dutch
Too quick to fall in love what the fuck
She said
If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can
Look now if I was yours and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side
So keep yo nigga while I stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon spend some time
Look if I was yours and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side
So keep your nigga and Ill stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon spend some time
Right
If you were mine
All Money In No Money Out 
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
