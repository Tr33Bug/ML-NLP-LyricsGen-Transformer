455 I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted cause I do what I need
And thats the reason that they love me
Cause Ive been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Listen black on black MercedesBenz
Tattoo all my lady friends
Nipsey on they titties
More game than ESPN
I turn these hoes to lesbians make her fuck her best of friends
Get head for one hour smoke a blunt and catch my second wind
Hopping off that tour bus she probably just had sex with him
Shes out of your possession you cannot protect her then
South Central thats my residence
Deadly like them seven sins
And if Im not the king of this
I must be the president
OMG Im ill as shit money is my medicine
Shout out to my niggas in the pen text messaging
Shout out to them bitches getting it in in their crevices
Conjugal visits make sex seem so irrelevant
Forget about the risk we took I never can
Rebel in this white man world until they bury him
Being broke is so unAmerican
Thats why Im screaming all money in til the end
Nigga
455 I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted cause I do what I need
And thats the reason that they love me
Cause Ive been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Pull up in that old school me and lil Shady Blue
Fresh up out the county jail they held us both without no bail
10 stacks to my lawyer said a prayer that we prevailed
Jealous niggas hated that love to see a nigga fail
Miss me with that Bro I love you
Sucka nigga be for real
Fake as four dollar bills
Hit the gas were out of here
On our way to Fox Hills spending like we got a mil
Smoking so much kush it got us feeling like were off a pill
They know we got dollars still
And bitches know they got the bill
Eatin Benihana daily drive my baby mama crazy
Name a nigga that could fade me
Pussy that does not persuade me
Got a swag that make em hate me
Plus we never shop at Macys
Louis V and Gucci maybe
Neiman Marcus blue Mercedes
We was both familiar faces
Spending thousands dodging cases
Fuck a bottle bring the cases is what we told the waitress
Then pop Clicquot for all of yall that tried to play us
455 I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted cause I do what I need
And thats the reason that they love me
Cause Ive been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Hussle hussle Dre past Def Jam Capital Atlantic too
Thought that Ill be dead or doing life cause what I rap is true
Just another you know who
Sam had some time to do
And yea Steve is cool but I heard Big Us an animal
Fuck what they was talking about
We just did what we had to do
Became the most valuable after I dropped Volume 2
From the West Coast at least now for the West Coast I speak
Cause on a level four with Gilbon is where Im posed to be
I be on some business shit
Yall bring out the loc in me
Like a broke weed head my pistol will smoke for free
Emani aint gonna know the streets
Got to keep her close to me
Put that on the man thats on the cross on my rosary
Wasnt always banging but I speak about it openly
No shame in my game
I did my thing on the coldest streets
Whos the hottest on the West
All you niggas know its me
So tell whoever got it lock that Nipsey Hussle stole the key
455 I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted cause I do what I need
And thats the reason that they love me
Cause Ive been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
