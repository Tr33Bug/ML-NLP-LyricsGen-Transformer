Uh rollin up some good pourin up til we get faded
You know how we do it everybody takin flicks of me
I got the keys to the city I dont need no limousine
I turn out when I pull up and tell my bookin agent book a show
Runnin round with the paper bag
Runnin round with the paper bag
Goin crazy spendin all this cash
Goin crazy spendin all this cash
If I spend it Ima get it back even when Im ridin round dirty
A nigga dont need a seatbelt a nigga dont need a seatbelt
Nah it dont cost to keep it real run up get done up
Shit can get real fuck around and get your ass robbed
Nigga fuck around and take your shit got you askin God why
Drag your ass into an alley pull out aim for the target
Shouldve never been around the killers
In my town we the fuckin realest
No Cheddar Bobs round here
I get to sprayin they gon get down
Ski mask over my face
Catch a body in broad day
Catch a body in broad day
I got the key to the city I got a ho thats saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili tattoo my name in graffiti
Whack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of yall niggas cant see me
None of yall niggas cant see me
Yall aint got nothin like this over there
Bunch of frontline millionaires
Bunch of selfmade out the trunk paid
Gainst the odds really took it there
Any prob Ima reappear with a squad you already fear
All this time Ive been playin fair seven digits every single year
Niggas died niggas disappeared alibis I was really there
Life of crime til I get the chair Columbine in my trigger hair
Still I rise and I took the stairs
Feel the fire its a different glare
All these fights it was never fair
Bustin knuckles still Im swingin fierce
Taste the salt inside my drippin tears
You should know I never had a fear
You should know I never had a shot
Never had a chance still I took it here
Manage pride but I see it clear strategize Im an engineer
Pick a side gotta keep it there switchin up nigga lookin weird


I got the key to the city I got a ho thats saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili tattoo my name in graffiti
Whack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of yall niggas cant see me
None of yall niggas cant see me
Tappin in
Say they waitin for it tell the streets a nigga back again
Ridin round inside the Bach again
Rollin flame inside the Bach again
405 another traffic jam
Improvise another master plan
Sit outside a nigga family pad
Another seven grams inside a sandwich bag
My whole life is like a balance act
Peoples champ but could you handle that
I pull up inside the black on black
And park this bigass Benz inside the handicap
What I done they cant imagine that
Oneofone its like a magic trick
Matter fact its like a lotto pick
Thats why I gotta talk a lot of shit
