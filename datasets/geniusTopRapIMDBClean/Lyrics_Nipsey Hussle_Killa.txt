My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
Light my backwood count 100 racks smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black smoking killa
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
I wake up in this state of mind like skys the limit
My niggas said you crossed the line well Im gon kill you
Im focused on a million cash thats the vision
Speeding and Im finna crash thats the feeling
Until my tires burn though and my wheels give out
These backwoods burn slow like my bills dish out
When them people come for you they gone steal yo house
Put yo name on them papers they gone fill you out
Couple moves from yo quota come fuck up yo count
Have you thinking bounce back when you out
Look Im tiptoeing over traps
Tightroping at a height you fall you knowing its a wrap
But Im gon keep this balance cause it aint no turning back
Aint no looking down my niggas aint concerned with that
More concerned with cash
More concerned with running laps running rap
Getting rich then run it back
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
Light my backwood count 100 racks smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black smoking killa
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
Whats the deal nigga Whats the deal nigga
How you feel Now you know this shit is real nigga
Once upon a time was in the field nigga
War time really kill or kill nigga
Gunfire shooting out civills nigga
Young wild police gon deal with you
Not too many still living
So I gotta paint it real vivid
Im surprised that Im here nigga
Naw Im blind to my fears nigga
I shine like De Beers nigga
And fly like a Lear nigga
Climb like the stairs nigga
Spend time out in Paris nigga
Come from where the grannies gotta bury niggas
And money make these hoes wanna marry niggas
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
Light my backwood count 100 racks smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black smoking killa
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
I think about them late nights
Drive to Vegas across the state lines
Finally did it it just take time
Since I was ye high my only goal was get this cake right
And what they say right
You on your own its what you make life
You was out there everyday right
Tryna push foreign tryna eat steak right
Put some hunnids in yo safe right
Hang some flat screens in yo place right
Life insurance just in case right
Gave something to the lawyer just in case right
Sitting solo first class on a straight flight
I remember waiting on my day like
Everyday Im on this paper chase like
Stand between these buildings til the daylight
Wiggle through the prisons and the grave sites
Then you finally get it and you take flight
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
Light my backwood count 100 racks smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black smoking killa
My AC on my ceiling cracked smoking killa
