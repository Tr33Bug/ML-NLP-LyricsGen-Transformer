Look
I let the beat bang I dont claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when its winter time
Im still waitin on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then its adios  Killa 
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the moneys grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the moneys blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
Ill never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when Im not functioning in tiptop shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy
Uh
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa killa killa killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame
Now that Im around shit will never be the same
Im a killa killa killa killa nigga
Listen look
Before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that yall said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and youll see what Im bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammas out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bump you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
I go for mine like its overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle
Im tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
Im a muhfuckin killa killa killa killa
Uh
And Im the one to blame
Now that Im around shit will never be the same
Im a killa killa killa killa nigga
