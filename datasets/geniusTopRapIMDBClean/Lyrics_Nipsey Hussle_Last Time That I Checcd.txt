Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked  Checked 
I was sellin zones in the set  Zones up in the set 
Make a quarter mil no sweat
Last time that I checked
Im the streets voice out West
Legendary selfmade progress
Last time that I checked  Checked 
First you get the money then respect
Then the power and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked  Checked 
I been selfmade from the dribble
I was been sayin Ima kill em look
Playing no games with you niggas
Pop clutch switch lanes on you niggas look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Reinvest double up then explain for you niggas
It gotta be love who run the city It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And yall niggas false claims it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth or you gotta be charged
I doubled up tripled up nigga what
Banged on the whole game I aint give a fuck
Nobody trippin handled business got my digits up
And when I drop you know Im bout to fuck the city up

And I come through fly  Check  no cosign
I aint need radio to do mine I done fine
And I take my time  Check  and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary either Im genius or you niggas scary
Maybe its both and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in these streets tryna feed the babies
The single mamas working hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set thats doing it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
Thats how you end up in penthouses end up in cars
Thats how you start off a curbserver end up a boss
Thats how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat dripping down your face cause the mission was hard

Last time that I checked  Checked 
I got the front end and the back
We on the way and thats a fact  Facts nigga 
This real this aint rap
Where everybody wanna act proBlack  They dont really wanna fuck with us 
The last lie you heard this aint that
This that I done made it out the gutter shit
Nip told you Fuck the middleman I told you Fuck a bitch
Fuck wearing they clothes I wear my own shit
Yall can own yall label I own my own bitch
Ayy Nip I remember all that game you throwed me
Dont fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas Adrien Broner
But secure the win though dont let that game fold you
Cause when its game over its really game over
And all they do is play the game til this game over
And you be giving game like a big brother
Mission never let em take it from us no
