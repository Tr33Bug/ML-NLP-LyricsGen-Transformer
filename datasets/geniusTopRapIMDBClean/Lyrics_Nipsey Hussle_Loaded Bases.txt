Loaded bases thats my motivation
A nigga feelin lucky we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin overanxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and Im more creative
Signed a couple big deals but its no paradin
See its a couple niggas every generation
That wasnt supposed to make it out but decode the matrix
And when they get to speak its like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas at the Mobil station
Full circle mogul motivation
My selfeducated shrewd negotiations
Got the sharks that Im sittin at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes thats for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck like the fuckin 80s
Westside Slauson Ave know my demonstration
Born and raised yall affiliated
Its really greatness ridin round like I really made it
Loaded bases Im gon Wille Mays it yah
Listen to my ambition cause Im on one
Swingin for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every seconds being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball Ima take it home
Bottom line Im gon make it home
Look I was sittin on my Lincoln I start thinkin
Nigga aint gon make a hundred mil off in these streets and
More than likely Im gon end up in somebody precinct even worse
The horse and carriage front the church laid off in a hearse
I dealt with it I aint just out here for my health with it
I weighed the risk and the reward and seen the scale tippin
Lets all get on one accord and take the world niggas
Take the money take the power and the girls with us
Cant buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
They breed drugheads and jail niggas
Look all these ways they derail niggas
Thats why respect me to the utmost when you see mes how I feel nigga
Cause I aint fail niggas
I seen it comin didnt I tell niggas
Different lane same passion for them L niggas
Switch lanes allblack two glass ceilings
V12 too fast nigga gone
Listen to my ambition cause Im on one
Swingin for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every seconds being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball Ima take it home
Bottom line Im gon make it home
