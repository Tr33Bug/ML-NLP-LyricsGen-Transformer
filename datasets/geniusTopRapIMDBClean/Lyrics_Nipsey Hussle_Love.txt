Now I dont ever wanna hear you niggas say you doubtin shit again
Look look
Fake niggas dont show me love
And all you fake bitches I dont want yo hugs
I got this pistol and a gang of hundreds
In this drop MercedesBenz gettin dumb blunted
Dont be surprised if you dont get what you never wanted
Im on my fifth fly whip while you aint never stunted
Never going broke funny cause I never budget
Lotta niggas round now that I aint never fucked with
Thats why Im in and out of town out in other countries
Its like the less I come around the more I get money
And I been catching wind lately that the feds want me
But Im gon keep getting rich so its gon get ugly
Told my mama Ima gang bang graduate
Pioneered the transition from this Crippin wasnt easy nigga but I mastered it
Thats why I still deliver raps so passionate
Built my own lane aint no nigga ever hand me shit
Slauson Avenue do you understand the averages
The fact Im still standing speaks volumes to my savages
We lust lavishness and aim for extravagance
Even if its only temporary
Least we had the shit
I press the gas til one60 on the dash is hit
My bitch lit the blunt and passed the shit
Look iPhone 4s and life on tour
Get five racks every night whats the price on yours
Im down to splurge on my bitch cause I dont wife no whores
Get the whole fall collection if she like that store
Baby rhyme crazy thats just how this life made me
Trust funds for Emani in case this life take me
I live it to the fullest never let this life break me
Thus far its been a cold demonstration
Number one question now is Did the fame the change me
Fuckin right young nigga should I be still gang bangin
Wait hold up hold that thought take these shots
And tell my niggas SIP The Marathon dont stop
Before I sell my soul I give my life
Its been a minute but we gon get right watch
Im out here on a mission and Im all alone
Im far from where Im going and Im far from home
Somehow I know Im moving in the right direction
Mama always told me I was gon be special
