And Im actually gonna get right into it
And they really wanna know how
You know how can I blaze my own path
Uh how can I be successful
Um how can I follow the path
That someone else has laid for me to be successful
Im sittin on deuces while the blunt burn
Still rapin rap music cause I want more
All Money In its just us four
Its just Cobby its just Hoggy its just Rimpau
Its just Adam its just Blacc Sam and Bolt Da Fatts
Where your 600 Benz Where your Rovers at
Where your Cuban links Nigga where your Rollies at
Where your big booty bad bitches stay preposterous at
Where you hustle Where you run from the police at
Where you ever represented hope where the hopeless at
Where you had to take an oath fore you sold a sack
Dealt with all the pressure played it like you never noticed that
Amongst it all put yourself on the map
Turned into a booming operation where your focus at
Where your 600 Benz Where your Rovers at
Where your Cuban link Nigga where your Rollie at
