Ocean views small circle its a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know its true
Ocean views small circle its a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know its true
Blessings bitches in my section
Young with all this money Im obsessive weapons
Turnin off yall extras
Turnin off this bullshit direction
Turnin up my grind
Wakin up to more pressure
But its all in your mind so I never feel pressured
Knew its all in due time now hundreds stackin like Tetris
Hustle hard is my message then double back and get extras
Know I spaz when I catch it
Yellow Bone white Lexus all black tint two white cups fat gold chains Sprite Texas
Im just young and Im reckless Im just on for my section
Im just out here on top speed with my top down and Im revin
I dont know about Hell I dont know about Heaven
All I know is bout right now and this lifestyle is interestin
Iced out in my session I just write down these confessions
Niggas died and got life around me I guess that Im an exception
Blessings

Look Im in these streets with my Cuban on
In my Benz with my music on
Old friends like What you been on
Shit Ive been on my grind
I aint usually home focused I aint usin phones
Lately Ive been usin songs to get my point across
While niggas round me lose it all but thats your coin to toss
I guess I always knew to ball
And as this world revolves Im crackin cause I do my job
Look from fuckin hood rats to fuckin stars
Spendin all cash to slidin cards its the definition of livin large
Smokin top flight in the biggest cars
Told you 08 this shit was ours
Gettin this cake yeah nigga then gettin more
Look at this world young nigga this really yours
Nigga this really mine my niggas is really for it
Them buildings is really high
Them cars is really foreign and all I see is

Yeah early mornin off that flight though
We gon go hard then get right bro
It seemed simple thats not life though
Ten years later Im alright though
Look these niggas act like they dont like dough
They be mad cause niggas shine bright though
Look I got a Ruger and a Bryco
But Ima let you pick which way tonight go
I got my dough right plus the right dough
I mean its legal pay taxes to them white folks
My procedure stay crackin til my lifes low
Then when I die blue rag around my rifle
Hundred thousand in my coffin thats just life though
Play a Stevie Wonder song smoke some flight bro
Crack a pint of Actavis then pour in some Sprite bro
Until that day Im walking toward whats in my sights though
Cause all I see is
