I can feel the excitement like I can sense an indictment
Swear I hope that Im wrong but just in case Im on my tip
Forever on some fly shit however illogic
Spend a regular nigga monthly income on my outfit
See I was in front of they house with rocks inside of my mouth
When jealous niggas that hate me had they feet up on the couch
And then we made it out
And now we standin here
Hope niggas dont think this type of shit going to magically appear
And so I got some news for ya
They say lifes a bitch and shell sang the blues to ya
Pay attention to Hussle I got the rules for ya
Made my way through the maze and I left some clues for ya
Now its up to you are you going
Take heed and get paid
And scream all money in until your dying day
Say fuck the middle man get on your grind and save
Or are you more the type that have your mind enslaved
They tellin me they believe and I got style for days
And when I drop an album theyll be proud to pay
Still out here on this mission and Im miles away
Somehow I feel like recently I found my way  yeah 
And aint no feelings that can rival those
And you can pop a molly you can sniff a pile of coke
You could make a hundred million fuck a thousand hoes
But when its all over all that counts is how the storys told
So write my name down write my aim down
To do this my way and carve my own lane out
Shit changed they say I dont act the same now
But it was either that or blow my fucking brains out
Niggas dissin me got me tempted to change routes
Pressure building up gotta let this pain out
Gotta think smart gotta map my plays out
Before I kill these niggas broad day and yell my gang out  my gang out 
And I stay in this game and get my change out
Figured how to deal with it and see what fames bout
I got the secret to success do your thang now
Or you can keep watching cable on the same couch
Whatever niggas reap they sowing
Me Ill be out in Vegas smokin
Stupid view city lights glowing
Wine tasting filet mignon and knows who grows it
So many people call only a few chosen
And thats why I go hard cause I do notice
She tells me that I am wrong for not using emotion
Too busy to love a broad and I cant lose focus
But maybe in a different life
Maybe when we make it well meet at the finish line
Maybe this is fate maybe god will send a sign
But more than likely hell say nigga grind
Yeah so here I go on my second wind
Im checking shit off my bucket list and its getting thin
Run out of shit to buy in places you aint never been
And what youll value most is a honest friend
Calls from the bank theres more deposits in
Seven days a week I be at my offices
Keys to the city nigga Im the hottest even if the OGs dont acknowledge it
Gone
