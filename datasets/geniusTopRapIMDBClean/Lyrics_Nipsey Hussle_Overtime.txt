Gotta light up to shit like this nigga
And I aint even said it or wrote it yet
I just feel it you know
Yuh
Overtime cause I aint have a mic
I was in that Chevy
Yuh
Overtime  Overtime  cause I aint have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin Savage Life
Niggas lookin like I had it wrong  Wrong 
Now them niggas know I had it right  Right 
They dont know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin for a reason nights
They say its six degrees in life
Opportunity preparation they meet its nice  Nice nice 
You see me up in Neimans right
My chain and my pinky bright  Bright 
I valet this Mercedes Benz  Benz 
Lookin like somebody that people like  Like 
Cant but help to think how fake it is
This world and this music biz
I just want all of this paper though  Paper though 
So maybe I could try and change this shit
Maybe me Im too ambitious
Or maybe this a new dimension
Maybe them they too religious
Maybe they judge my intentions
But either way Im on my mission
In the sky for our love Ima tie a ribbon
Lifes a bitch lady luck my woman
Forever you my lady Im your fuckin nigga
Overtime  Overtime  cause I aint have a mic  Overtime 
I was in that Chevy playin Savage Life
Niggas lookin like I had it wrong  Wrong 
Now them niggas know I had it right  Right 
They dont know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin for a reason nights
They say its six degrees in life
Opportunity preparation they meet its nice  Nice nice 


Cappin for a cheaper price
Hustlin for a bucket keep your sneakers tight
Shoot a box catch the cheapest flight
If it land thank you Jesus Christ  Christ 
You aint gon get it till you see it right
And jump off in this legal life
Feel the pressure from your people right  Right 
Still choose to lead em right  Right 
Sometimes I rap about my feature price  Price 
Or all of my defeats in life
They told me dont believe the hype
But I felt like this bout myself before the mic
And you know if you look at like the movie industry
You dont you dont base the success off for how many tickets sold
You know like whats the gross How much it gross
Period right
When it come to business the bottom line is you know we in business to make money
How much you gross
So its like I feel like its a looming question mark over Hollywood over the entertainment music industry
Whats the new business model
And to me you know the people that lead to that answer
That lend they intelligence they hustle they effort they mindpower you know
Whatever they can offer to that question and stick to that and come up with answers to that
I feel like thats one of the most important things going on
Like in the city theyll try and disrespect
and youll try to go to you know the moon
And then it was like uh it had industrial revolutions
Like now I think its the business model creators of the new era thats gon be able to be the type to keep the business moving forward
People that create new business models you know as well as products that you know are sold and consumed services that are consumed these models
But I feel like the giants gon be the ones who create the business models
But thats we trying to do with this Proud2Pay
Fuck the middle man
And uh this disruptive multimedia
Collab and Im going with uh Ryan Legend
Overtime  Overtime  cause I aint have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin Savage Life
Niggas lookin like I had it wrong  Wrong
