Picture me rollin tippin my chaueffer
Niggas look jealous you gotta control it
Reachin my quota mixin my soda
Feeling connected to God tryna get closer
Steppin on roaches me and my locsters
Just tryna get over tryna not get swallowed by locusts
Tryna to stay focus kinda like Moses
Like somebody chose us this weight on my shoulder
I feel these emotions but still I keep going
A pen to a poet
I been through the motions
Im feeling heroic but life is a dice game
And they dare you to blow it
You might get a stripe man but that aint gon pay for the strollers
Its never enough to console her
Telling your daddys a soldier
She needs you right now in this moment
Not dead on your back pushing roses
To me Im just carving this sculpture
You fine tune with my  approaches
Doubling back as a owner
The moment of truth Is upon us
Call the promoters
Picture me rollin rollin rollin
Me and my friends not worried
Then we get stopped by the police
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause these days niggas goin crazy
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause this is they say me
Gotta make it home to my baby Holla up yeah
Look I bet Ima make it home to my baby  bang bang 
I bet Ima make it home to my baby
I say I bet Ima make it home to you baby
