Yeah I was ridin round in the V12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin round in the V12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ay
I was riding round in the V12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud you cant imagine this shit
I been pullin up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check  Mhmmhm 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck  Mhmmhm 
Tryna put the water on my Patek  Mhmmhm 
I got killers to the left of me  Mhmmhm 
We was lurking on em aint show no mercy on em
We was goin back to back we put a curfew on em
It was dark clouds on us but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn but it was working for us
Limo tint the V12 double check the details
Gotta cross my Ts and dot my Is or I cant sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin solo tryna rebuild
Look
I was riding round in the V12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud you cant imagine this shit
I been pullin up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check  Mhmmhm 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck  Mhmmhm 
Tryna put the water on my Patek  Mhmmhm 
I got killers to the left of me  Mhmmhm 
Look under no condition would you ever catch me slippin
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit it gon send me off to prison
Judge aint sympathizin court dont show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop hope I splurge foolish
Closin Escrow twice this month both commercial units
Damn I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin after banging all them years
Grammynominated in the sauna sheddin tears
All this money power fame and I cant make you reappear
But I dont wipe em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me I would tell you Nigga live your life and grow
Id tell you Finish what we started reach them heights you know
And gas the V12 til the pipe in smoke
I was ridin round in the V12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud you cant imagine this shit
I been pullin up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check  Mhmmhm 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck  Mhmmhm 
Tryna put the water on my Patek  Mhmmhm 
I got killers to the left of me  Mhmmhm 
Another million dollar bail thats just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet some shit Ill never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas with my Puma connects
We break bread we aint new to success
Bleed music invest enterprise take lucrative steps
Cold game but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game you a student at best
But its a couple things you can expect
Look just like money know money nigga shooters respect
Other shooters we was both dont want my crew on your neck
Im on the freeway in a drop it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
