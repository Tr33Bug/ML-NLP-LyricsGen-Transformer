Real big real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time locs on
Cant even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this
Tryna walk to school get your jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas get your car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time locs on
Fuckin young bitches while they folks home
High school didnt go
Couldnt understand my plan now you niggas know
Selfmade wellpaid
Im from where they tell you never touch the shell case
Im from where they teach you never trust a pale face
Lets talk bangin I can tell you bout a failed race
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time locs on
Fuckin young bitches while they folks home
Real big real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time locs on
Cant even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this
Soldout shows thats a door split
Niggas aint show up thats a forfeit
Left my record label just got more rich
I switched it up thats me singin on the chorus
But still I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars no stutter top floor no clutter
Hardwood floors though
White wall thats where my awards go
Runnin from the law til they foreclose
Sit with myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question only Lord knows
What Im doing out in Copenhagen spendin euros
Night time locs on
Do it big nigga til my Locs home
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this


Real big real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time locs on
Cant even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this
If I could stay in this moment I would forever
If I could live in this moment said I would forever
Real shit real shit
Yeah yeah
If I could give you the stars baby I would
Wanna last to share in this moment baby this moment
And I would give you the stars baby I would
Real big real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time locs on
Cant even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this
