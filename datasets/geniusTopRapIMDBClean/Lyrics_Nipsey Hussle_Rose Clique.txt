They call me Young Nip CNote Rose Clicquot
Talkin to my girl while your bitch give me deep throat
Shootin at the world dog cause life is just a free throw
Shoppin on rodeo in some dickies thats my steelo
Played out pussy please dont offer me no
If sex was a weapon she could not kill a mosquito
Little mama lost her grip pastrami around her pee hole
Got too many miles baby thats a repo
Shortys in denial really tryna fuck with me though
Im way out your league so please excuse my ego
Diamonds in my Cuban link my Rolex presidential
Penthouses and beach homes perrier and patron
Told you way before about this baller shit I be on
Young Nipsey Hussle aint some shit that you should sleep on
Rich before rap had to let the streets go
Faith in my transition I knew Ill be back in beast mode
Catch a case thats the tradition either that or six believe no
Still somehow I understood that I could make the seed grow
And that one day that tree will bear fruit to feed my people
That one day is upon us grab your fork its time to eat bro
Slauson Ave hes so
Rapper CEO
And if were all actors I guess Ill be Al Pacino
And it was all after when they thought I was finito
Not my Valentino its what I got up my sleeve though
LAX to JFK then on our way to Heathrow
At the polo lounge in here sippin cappuccino
Spendin pounds every purchase man this feeling has no equal
If you come from where I come from its rare that you see folk
That did it like I did it but do it cause we need more
Cuba Gooding Juniors kill em with that submarine flow
Like every man of honor had to conquer Rob De Niro
Like Ginger in Casino or that runway light in Heat
That shadow in the grass from when Vincent shot him off his feet
In other words life is just a fight against your disbeliefs
Thats why Im screamin Im the greatest of all time like Young Ali
Play Mohammad to these false prophets in this industry
But Im just me catch me cruising solo in my 2seat BENZ
Or at the Roosevelt with Rimpau smokin weed TMZ
Flashing lights like Kanye album number three but Im gon be
From RSC til the day I DIE so I crank my beat and hit the gas on em
