Almost forgot what I was doin
Almost forgot where I was goin I been drivin I been smokin
Almost forgot what I was doin
Almost forgot what I was drinkin what the hell have I been thinkin
Now Im just ridin through the city
Now Im just ridin through the city
And aint nobody rollin with me

Rollin solo dolo this a trip trip trip trip
Ayy almost forgot what I was doin
Almost forgot where I was goin I been drivin I been smokin
Almost forgot what I was doin
Almost forgot what I was drinkin what the hell have I been thinkin
Rappin for my section roll with my protection
Who gon die next Aint tryna get elected
Ridin by myself time for some reflection
I feel like a young boss nigga thats thankful for his blessings
I cant even lie  This a trip trip trip trip  I aint even flexin
Block for me Black man know they tryna stretch us
I aint tryna preach I aint tryna lecture
When you make your first mil in cash you gon feel the pressure
Just wanna feel the thrust wanna feel the texture
Wanna feel the droptop breeze wanna feel successful
Wanna change the game never change the message
Never stop grindin cherish no possessions
We aint get accepted  This a trip trip trip trip  we just reinvested
Thanks what I expected cause we aint even set trip
60th the Mecca choppers for protection
FBI invest us but they cant arrest us

Turn the headphones up for me G
Little bit lower yeah
Always had the passion nigga this a classic
How we came from nothing went and got established
Livin like a savage tryna make some magic
Everybody starving tryna take the sandwich  This a trip trip trip trip 
I know its elaborate but nigga just imagine
Felt the right to ask it we can make it happen
Weavin through the traffic I can take you back then
Everything I said I meant I was never cappin
I was never scared to stand front line with MAC10s
Raise and shoot at Black men never felt the satisfaction
When I seen the game collapsin guess they took the rules and whacked it
Started movin at a different frequency and it got me livin lavish
All my partners steady passin tryna wiggle through this madness
Tryna fight this gravity every time I swear I can feel it pull me backwards
Puttin thousands on they caskets tryna pick the right reactions
I appreciate the progress but Im so conflicted by the status  This a trip trip trip trip  look
Almost forgot what I was doin  This shit can happen 
Almost forgot where I was goin I been drivin I been smokin  On this road to these millions 
Almost forgot what I was doin  To success 
Almost forgot what I was drinkin what the hell have I been thinkin  Dont let the money make you different nigga 
Now Im just ridin through the city
Now Im just ridin through the city  Stay focused 
And aint nobody rollin with me
And aint nobody rollin with me  The marathon continues 
It aint a problem Im gon get it
It aint a problem Im gon get it  Lets get it 
This a trip trip trip trip
Ridin round smokin by myself  Solo 
Dont you know I do it so well  Off probation 
Dollar signs all on my head  License good 
Rollin solo dolo this a trip trip trip trip  I just be trippin sometimes nigga 
Ayy almost forgot what I was doin  Thats what I call a full threesixty 
Almost forgot where I was goin I been drivin I been smokin
Almost forgot what I was doin  Foot on the gas on you niggas 
Almost forgot what I was drinkin what the hell have I been thinkin  Just watch
