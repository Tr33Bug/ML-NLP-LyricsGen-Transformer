Yuh
Me Im gettin back rubs from these leather seats  Yuh 
Negotiatin equity positions youll never be  Nigga 
Rap sheet full of felonies  Yeah 
Status symbol on my set of keys they say I was sellin dreams
Back to the brick wall Im inhalin trees
Visualizin hella cheese you can smell the weed
Niggas doubt pessimism aint affectin me
Fuel to the fire took it higher than they ever see
Frequent flight seat like seven seas
Shoppin spree spent about eleven Gs
Eyes bloodshot I dont ever sleep
My niggas act on instinct we dont ever think
When confronted with a problem we dont ever flee
We connected at the bottom like the letter V
So accustomed to the pop we dont even blink
When them shots go off get the Glock show off
Yellow tape a nigga he grew up to hate a nigga
Nothin major nigga just a demonstration nigga
Within the matrix nigga I drew illustrations with him
Words that is for sure that is
Look that nigga got his off the curb that is
So how the fuck is niggas so concerned with his
I be baffled by the fact when niggas burn their bridge
And try to double back like What the fuck is that
Like Niggas want this rap life way too bad
We aint gotta worry no more well be just fine
And we aint finna wait no more so dont waste my time
Remember when we had no way no way
But well be okay for now
Well be okay for now
And here on out
Now you up huh Make it hard to trust huh
Got you fucked up sayin it was luck huh
Pulling up huh Limo tinted trucks huh
Open trust huh Then you fill em up huh
Every time a nigga drop its real as fuck huh
Every time you hit the road you fill em up huh
Whole city know that you became the one huh
They seen it from the jump huh
The pressure weigh a ton huh
Especially where you come from
Every night brbrbrbrap bump bump
Heavy price but its just the cloth you cut from
Its alright its just life if you want one
Learn to hold yourself down with a big gun
All these niggas playin tough you gon chip one
For these dollars a decade you a risk one
Fuck it though cause when you flat broke you aint nothin bro
Seen a gang of rich niggas get comfortable
Then lookin at their watch like Where the fuck it go
Through my eyes I learned lessons like
Time is of the essence and my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless
Put myself in the game but batteries sold separate
Question since when do real niggas come second
So I kicked the door down gettin more now
Nigga need at least like thirty for the show now
Woah now realest out of So Cal
Baby wanna fuck Im like Mmm slow down
Im eatin cheese eggs in my hotel
Hussle sold out nigga retail and wholesale
Me ballin hurt your feelings Oh well
All money in I pull coattails nigga
We aint gotta worry no more well be just fine
And we aint finna wait no more so dont waste my time
Remember when we had no way no way
But well be okay for now
Well be okay for now
And here on out

Oh you rap nigga

Look I was stuck in these streets tryna make it out
I seen most my homies change man they fakin out
And my brother really gone straight taken out
So a death spares a life and it really play about
Cadi finna make it oh yeah niggas thats without a doubt
Hoe dont interfere cause all they wanna do is run they mouth
I been out chear really tryna chase the paper route
Fuck wit me Ill knock you out
Talkin Manny Pacquiao
I really do this music so that I could see my mama smile
Im tryna go major but I know that its gon take a while
I dont even know if Ima live to even see a child
Cause niggas in the streets with a gun and they be goin wild
Cadi super hot all you other niggas stuck on mild
In this Audi smashin man this jug got fourthousand miles
I aint never stoppin til my money stacked up in a pile
On TV haters watchin me I hope that yall could see me now
Everyday I wake up I just thank God for another day
Damn I really cant believe they killed my fuckin nigga Tay
I remember goin to school chillin up smokin eights
And now my nigga gone and his body gon be on display
These gangbangers serious shit got me curious
Losin homies to bullshit this shit got me furious
My brother gone too he aint never comin back
How you think that make me feel nigga All I do is rap
Anytime I spend money all I do is make it back
Anytime Im in these streets all I do is watch my back
Cause niggasll wet you up chicksll set you up
You think your days ones with you but niggas be switchin up
I seen it all
I seen homies go before my eyes
Some homiesll make it some dont come out alive
My mom prayin and she hopin that her youngest survive
Cause she know that Im gettin high
Bills steady rollin pie
Wasnt no father in my life big brother in the sky
Every night Im in my room and I sit and ask Why
Bitches choosin on a nigga so you know I still reply
And they speakin on my name so I know Im that guy
Yeah thats right my nigga
