Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
I seen it I thought it I dreamed it
I said it I did it I meant it
I taste it I loved it I need it
I want it more of it I fiend it
Im godly Im gutter Im genius
Im prolly of cheese grits at Four Seasons
Fresh squeezed no stressants no reason
Toast champagne to achievements
I think we should dive off the deep end
Take you on vacation every weekend
Look I be up at six niggas sleep in
I be at the Ritz puffin G Pens
Them other niggas soft Im the cement
Fourteen Bonnie and Clyde we can be them
These rich nigga rules I believe in
Manifested gave me blessings and thats how I know
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
Thats how I knew thats how I knew

Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew
Yeah Thats how I knew that i was different though
Rap fast this a different flow
Different deals gettin different dough
Yeah my life doin different shows
Catch a flight do my shit hit a lick and go
Oh now I got a different goal
Cause I reached all my old ones
I be feelin like somebody reached out and chose us
I be killin life nigga we got it rollin
We pop and pour shit
Standin on them couches with my whole clique
Our jewelry on some 1994 shit
Champagne flutes watch em go click
Afterwards baby fucked the whole clique
West Coast shit
Own the masters to these classics Death Row shit
So when that check come I get mo chips
All money in I went and got my own shit nigga
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew

Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew

Life and its like you know you can look a gift horse in the face and not know what you lookin at
And I feel like you know Im lookin at the gift horse
Im just one of the ones that notice what Im lookin at
You know what I mean Its actually an incredible time
Its like a gold rush its never been a time like this in our generation
Its our equivalent of the Gold Rush with everybody movin to California
This technology has empowered everybody
And its giving people you know its as big as you wanna make it and you know its as far as you take it
And we can quote a gang of things going on in the world right now
Or just you know accept it as being true
But you know its like man giants gon crumble
Bigbig companies gon crumble
New companies gon pop up outta nowhere and itsits gon be dramatic
And I believe that
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew
Thats how I knew thats how I knew that I was different
