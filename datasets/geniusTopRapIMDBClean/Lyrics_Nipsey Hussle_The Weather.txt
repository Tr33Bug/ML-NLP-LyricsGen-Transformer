Most the time when it rain it start pouring
But how we grind it make the weather change for us
repeat 3x 
We roll through but we never change for em
So smile for us when you see us drive foreigns
Nigga watch us ball
Stop or stall nigga not at all
Im poppin broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin mall
All money in the squad boy Im not involved
Cant pay the cost to floss I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin off
Dress well when its time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when its poppin off
Couple times a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit buzz cut exmarines
Crenshaw Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone Lil Shady Baby Bolt Da Fatts laid a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions LA streets crazy
Shoot it out thats what this crew about
Hangin out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yoself killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong but who is you to doubt
Look my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day Ill put this music out
Trippin now seeing that its movin out
Im buying spots nigga movin out
My fan base I see em movin south
Im overseas eating fuckin crote
Yeah so I can tell you what this hustling bout
I couldnt tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers nigga
Look a lot of stress I couldnt rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ball
Gotta let it breathe
And put the weed out
Double M
Niggas get it and they fall off
Its cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm thats on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say its levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with the pink ice
All natural momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trappin to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
Im Kanye when it came to ye
Im JayZ when it came to keys
Im Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls now the charge is federal
Money bags Im placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You aint really know these was the Basquiats
You aint really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind number one all charts


Reporting live from the land of the hopeless
Representing for the team that won rings with no coaches
We stay strapped and we cockin so dont approach us
Price Johnson with a big gold chain and Louis Loafers
Been hiding guns in the sofa since toy soldiers
Thunderdomes up in Hyde Park didnt nobody know us
We took all fades our introduction was from the shoulders
We was kids honestly we just needed someone to hold us
Grindin hard on them corners with cane boulders
Fascinated by the green all we wanted was Range Rovers
On the block politicking with brain blowers
Real niggas that got love in their hearts but cant show it
We live and die for the fame and the lights glowing
Fox Hills buying Jordans but still the pain showing
When I die put me next to the dead poets
Tell em God had a plan for me and I didnt know it
Victory
