Like the beginning of Mean Streets you could  Oh 
Like the beginning of Mean Streets you could
Like the beginning of Mean Streets you could
Im prolific so gifted
Im the type thats gon go get it no kiddin
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin
Sitting on the steps feeling no feelings
Last night it was a cold killin
You gotta keep the devil in his hole nigga
But you know how it go nigga
Im front line every time its on nigga
Hunnid proof flow run and shoot pro
458 drop playin Bullet Proof Soul
Every few shows I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller everybody cant go
Downtown Diamond District jewelers like Yo
Hussle holla at me I got Cubans on the low
Flew to Cancun smokin Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean cruisin
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
Im integrated vertically yall niggas blew it
They tell me Hussle dumb it down you might confuse em
This aint that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Im an urban legend South Central in a certain section
Cant express how I curved detectives
Guess its evidence of a divine presence blessings
Held me down at times I seem reckless F it
You got an L but got an E for effort stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert then left him
Aint no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin Nip straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Ricos til T show
Whatever nigga playin chess not checkers nigga
Thirtyeight special for you clever niggas
See bro if you aint live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions up and down like a seesaw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
We gotta make it 
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Yeah look
Im finna take it there
This time around Ima make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say its worth it I wont say its fair
Find your purpose or you wastin air
Fuck it though yall niggas scared
Eyes opened I can see it clear
They dont make em bar none they dont make em real
They dont make it where Im from they dont take it here
They aint see in due time I be makin mils
Bossed up in this game I been makin deals
Get your lawyer on the phone we can make it real
I got checks and balance I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck just my reckless habit
Aint no pussy on my rep disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
Its just another front step with candles
Lil message from the set We accept your challenge
