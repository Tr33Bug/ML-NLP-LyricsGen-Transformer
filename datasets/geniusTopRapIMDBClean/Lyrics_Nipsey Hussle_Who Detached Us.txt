Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
We used to be respected now they laughin
Weve turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less than average
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
With no collective identity 
You You You You
Its every man for himself 
Me Me Me Me
We need a black mafia 
Us We We
Look 
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
No separation 
Who Who Who Who
You You You You
Divide and conquer 
Me Me Me Me
Its the Art of War 
Us We We
Who detached us
Look 
Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life
Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And now I wish that for you
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
