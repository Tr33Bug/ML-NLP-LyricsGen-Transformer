  female 
Now Lo how did this all start for you 
I mean it started for me you know watchin the Fat Boys
Listenin to the Fat Boys beatbox on the radio and you know
Seein Turbo and them cats breakdancin on Electric Bugaloo
And you know you seein graffiti over here
And you seein breakdancin over there
And beatboxin over there and MCs over there
And hiphop was like a brand new thing a brand new culture
And everybody wanted to be a part of it so it was fascinatin for us
So this started while you were little huh 
I mean  You knew this is what you wanted to do 
I mean I think it was somethin that I was born to do
You know and you just go through different stages
You know its like its like school you learn your alphabet
Then you take the alphabet to a whole nother level
And thats how hiphop was for me
You know I just took the different stages and grew with it like
AAy B Csee what I mean
Dsdese MCs is not Eeffective especially on the FM
All you fake Gs I Hate you like pastries
You need to get your own and stop tryin to be JJayZs
You livin OK puffin your Ls in your limo
But I aint tryin to live like that you know my MO
Rhymes stay fresh cause I rapwrap like Reynolds
Wack No question the answer is NO
Ppeople come to my shows in big numbers
Tossin they hands in the air like lettuce and Qcucumbers
They know who we Rare Sespecially Lamar
Biggest fan before Senim Silla and Lo Fat
Was Binary Star before I was on the dLo
But time goes on unless Allah calls a TO
And if Uyou like what we create
Then pay attention to the flow dont deVate
See we aint tryin to go pop like a bubble do thats another crew
For any rhyme you got I can double double double youWWF
Tagteam steady slammin
Binary Star empire Xexpanded
I dont know Ywhy they underestimate the B crew
Sleep if you want my crewll help you get your Zs true
Rip Van Winkle style what was you thinkin bout
I bust a rhyme solid nine millimeter style
Itll be a while before I run outta ammo
OneManArmy rap Rambo
See most of yall need micMike skills like Chicagos rock
Outta bound two down three seconds on the clock  say what 
You need micMike skills like Chicagos rock
Outta bound two down three seconds on the clock
And I got the skills thatll beat the shot clock imitates buzzer
Fade away on Dikembe avoid the shot block  he shoots he scores 
Cant avoid the cock block
Cause theres a lotta snakes and the grass grows tall
Ringalingaling Lo be screenin phone calls
I only deal with a chosen few
Everybody else get a How you doin
See you later nice knowin you

Nice knowin you you knahmsayin
Some Alphabet Soup we gon say peace and we gon be out
