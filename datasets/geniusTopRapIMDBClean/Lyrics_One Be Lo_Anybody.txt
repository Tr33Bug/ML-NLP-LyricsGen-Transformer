Beatboxing Aight Im ready
How yall doin out there
Whats goin on
Yo check this out
November 7th 1976 now thats life
Believe I was born to rock a mic  believe it 
If seein is believin my rhymes is outta sight
I headbutt the mic one bite could stop the fight
But not tonight Lo go the whole twelve strike
Then everything changed like a Cinderell night
I used to freestyle now Im jail cell tight
You cats livin lies seven slide into hell twice
The real mic rhyme Christ what is you deaf
I already told your blind ass thrice like blind mice
But the Price was Right and you was in the limelight
Now every other word you say is wine or ice
What the hell you gon do when the truth comes to surface
And all your fans recognize fools gold is worthless
Anybody can think of a dope punchline
Anybody can make three syllables rhyme
Anybody can flow for a long ass time
But how many cats you know can feed the mind
Now who got skills is the real question
I teach these wack MCs a real lesson
I draw the crowd like concealed weapons
Thats why they feel threatened I kill seven
MCs that thought I need the weed to spark an ill session
Been writin rhymes since the age of illleven
Now Im supervarsity pardon me your skills freshman
Your styles no match like Jada and Will Fresh Prince
Before OneBeLo hip hop was illdestined
This industry fulla Uncle Toms dickheads Dirty Harrys
Legendary makin majors millions in monetary
But check it that money thats only momentary
Whos the master My mentality is plantation
Lyrically Proclaim to be wackfree Emancipation
The honest president how I represent how benevolent
Now or never kid we promise Harriet  promise 
The land of the chosen few
Poetry in motion in the ocean split it open
You know how Moses do
See my plans goin through long and overdue
Sleepin on my crew  wake up  wake up and smell the Folgers brew
My rap photo shoot snap Polaroids
Represent hip hop like Matlock you just a court appoint
Stayin true I hold mics that the Lord anoint
Hungry for milsmeals but wont fork it if I know it oinks
And the name of this jam is
