Flute playing in background 
They assassinated Dr Martin Luther King and everybody got uptight
Ah they assassinated Dr King
They gunned down Bobby Kennedy Oh they killed Bobby
They assassinated JFK and everybody Ah they shot the president
None of nobody in America got upset when they assassinated Lincoln Rockwell and Malcolm X see America is not a nation that gives a damn about an assassination until you kill somebody we love
Weve got to make this a nation that gives a damn about assassinations regardless to who it is or you have to make it a nation that dont care about nobody getting assassinated
