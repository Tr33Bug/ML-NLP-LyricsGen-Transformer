Man its a trip
Man its a trip  turn 
Man its a trip trip trip  turn 
Now as the world turns when will us black people learn  damn 
Before we had a perm we came from Adams sperm
You see with plain vision we live in the same system
Cocaine victims once was able cant even raise children
Wheres the village when you need it
A question for the person in the looking glass
Our communitys lookin bad like a bucket full of crabs
Thats the crooked path
If we dont straighten this out how long would it last
Every night you hear the bullets blast
Even if you in the suburbs every night you see the footage flash
Across your screen Ill tell you my biggest pet peeve
You lookin at it thinkin like It dont affect me
You livin large Im thinkin like It dont impress me
Rockin them chains Sojourner Truth is tryin to set free
It dont take a professor
To see the opressor got the whole treasure
Now how many Africans slain for one platinum chain on yo dresser
Im no better just because I think I know better
Tell me who you trust when youre in your new trucks
Some of us dyin over a few bucks killers old enough to ride a school bus
With brothers like these tell me who needs the Ku Klux
Women walkin with titties out cause the truth sucks
Its time to breastfeed knowledge is the best key
We got us pourin liquor out for all the dead Gs
Rest Please in the grave you gettin less peace
Man its a trip Turnin turnin
The world keeps turnin
On its axis
See in America they flamed bottle rockets when slaves was not abolished  true 
Slayed a lot of fathers and raped a lot of mommas
Them days cotton products we blame our modern problems
New ways they got us bondaged the chains is psychologic
The media be feedin us napalm atomics
While the schools brainwash us the crayons is toxic  blah 
Dont believe the hype they can save all the drama
Cause them apes not evolving I cant swallow ya vomit
My rights as a human they change laws in congress
Now Shaytan in office we cant call him honest
What part of the game do they play cops or robbers
In this land of Pocahontas natives lost to conquest
Your false gods get framed buffed and polished
If you ask who the prophet they say Nostradamas  who 
No ways of Muhammad no pray five at Kabbah
Definition of a terrorist they call Islamic
So many brothers puzzled and cant solve they problems
Smuggle crack juggle rap or play ball in college
But Uncle Sam hustle man take all your dollars
Break yall sink them 8balls in your pocket
Im chosen like Moses here to take yall to promise
My quest started when Tip say Lost my wallet
We all gotta get it the mules acres was promised
But the skeletons came out the closet
Now some of yall black folks is still patriotic
Dyin in wars so who you think make the profit
One day old fool you gonna get this country
In a war that they not gonna fight for ya
Which means you gon have to fight it yourself
What makes you think you can be a black hero
Im here cause I cant stand whats happening in this community
And somebody has to make a change
Now brotha will you help me
