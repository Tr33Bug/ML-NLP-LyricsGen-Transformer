VERSE 1
Now thats some Bullshit
A lot of rappers talk a lot of beef
Got gats wit full clips
Balls bout as big as those RockyMountainOysters
You Aint sayin nothin just makin a lot of noises
They aint tougher than leather you gots to keep steppin
In videos
Look at the rumps
On these heifers
Young tenderloins
Gotta skin their hides
For the meal ticket
Xzibit can Pimp dey rides
What the USDA say
Grade A Prime
So thats a primetime slot
Just to say they shine
For the 30 seconds of fame
You cant resist
But seven days in your colon and you still aint sht
VERSE 2
Its waay too many lives at steak  stake 
YES SIR NO SIRloin
The soldier say
He supposed to be the Macho Man
See you holdin on to some Beef Jerkey knock it out yo hand
Cookin in a foreign land
Watch the beef stew
The women and the Children on the ground
Thats beef too
And both sides claim God missing the focus
Cuz one say Halal
The other say Kosher
They Both hate pigs
Love Abraham
And Moses
So why we see commandments broken
Moses talked to God on the mountain
When he came back down
The people started worshipping cash cows
Today we got the USDA
Trynna leave their mark
Its all politics
Slaughterhouseschop those parts
Now ANY grade less
Than the USSelect
Still serve you that beef
But did you know it was Processed
VERSE 3
America consume mo beef
Than every country on the earth
Even toddlers Obese
A quarter pound burger you can pick on the Menu
Some people dont like it  rare 
Forbidden to Hindus
And vegetarians wont be beefin against you
The same category
Pork chicken and fish too
Get all their Protien from Soy Rice and Beans
Now these vegans on another level
Rebel to Ice Cream
It might seem crazy but the flow dont stop
Hippies say they dont need roast
To smoke no pot
Now da USDA say recall that beef
Cuz the COW was MAD
But the farmers keep fillinem up
We keep killin for what
Meatgrillin
The Beef keep sizzlin
Mike was a Bull Now we got King james
Some n99z dont like Kobe but he still got game
Who want Beef
