Somebody asked me what my inspiration was when I write rhymes
You know what Im saying I mean it aint no one specific thing
But this is what I told him
I was telling him about the time I was laying in my room you know
Trying to meditate
I got all the lights off Im sitting here with my matches you know what Im saying
I lit a candle closed all the doors the windows cut the lights off
And Im meditating you know Im looking at this candle and this flame
Im fascinated cause the flame was just dancing you know
Its dancing got a mind of its own you know and
This flame controlled everything in the room you know
It was like the darkness paid attention to it you know what Im saying
Its like I wanna be that light
Thats my inspiration
Your thoughts are the flame of a candle flickering in the wind
Beads of sweat like melting wax rolling down the side of your face as you meditate
What are you thinking
See you are the candlestick
Oh how you shine
Rebellious to darkness
Let there be light
Your very existence brings life to the shadows that dance on the walls in my
Mind
Creatures with no faces no expressions no colours no emotions wait
Dimensioning no mind of their own
These are slaves of mimic
See they mimic you
And they are your slaves for as long as you shine
Tears of sorrow signs of grief threaten your very existence
Let your thoughts remain calm
And you will shine forever
Candlesticks echoes
scratches
The situation is this sitting the days of time
In this world full of darkness and crime
Im trying to shine like torches
Help from divine sources
Cats wanna act live but mentally they like corpses
If I could Id resurrect all the dead
Place a tantalum on their heads
No more political divisions we all live
By one universal law the Ten Commandments
Now peep the damage
And understand as its time for repair
But first feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare
Feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare
Feast your eyes of the man in the mirror and stare
