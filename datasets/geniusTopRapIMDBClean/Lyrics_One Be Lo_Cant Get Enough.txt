Look at you now

Ah dont start bitchin up now
You dont have my product and you dont have my money

Look the brothers dont wait to get paid
Money talks bullshit runs the marathon
So see ya and I wouldnt want to be ya
Livin in the fast lane and cant slow down
Some people cant get enough of it
Even if ya livin slow lane take ya chain
Cause they cant get enough of it
FBI smuggle the crack to ya city
Cause they cant get enough of it
Got niggas on the block everyday all day
Because they cant get enough of it
Shorties in the club shakin ass for cash
Because they cant get enough of it
All up in the casino watch ya luck run out
Because you cant get enough of it
The poor stay poor the rich keep gettin richer
Cause they cant get enough of it
Blood stained brothers like Able and Cain
Because they cant get enough of it
Yo
They say moneys the root of all evil its got to be wicked
I seen million dollar preachers robbin church senior citizens
A lot of cats buying lottery tickets
Somebody offer u a mill you probably with it
Cut ya finger off suck a cock pose in a magazine
Get some life insurance for your loved ones
And make it seem like a boat accident
You know Uncle sam be taxin it
Cash your shit you dont know the half of it
Its like roaches in the ashtray
Anyday can be your last day but when u leave the cash stay
Schools full of students Cuz these students score wealth
Got seven eight figures but they cant afford health
Soon as you meet your death soldier
This country sacrificed millions for the millions
While your familys strapped for left overs
Checks in the mail Cuz they cant get enuff of ya dollaz
Hustles schemes and crimes is plotted
Sometimes  sometimes  you gotta  you gotta 
You gotta do what you gota do
I cant judge you not me Im not you
We got guys hidin tools in drivethroughs
Like give me all the money Oh yeah And some frys too
That same lootin makes em that big roller
Now he can hit the club an play some strip poker
You know the girls on stage take it off for dollars
Tell they moms an dads they work as fashionshow models
Tell they boyfriends Im trying to work my way through college
They go from dacin to servin cats wit plates an condoms
And now they sellin crack too but not as bad as them pussycats
That push they crack where they moms live at
They punch the gas and never be lookin back
Tis rumors splashed And now they all fucked up
Cause they moms cook crack

Yo I bust out the door wavin cash drawer
Empty the money in the the bag
Watch my back wit the fourfour
Niggas hardcore we about to splurge at the hideout
We laid low just to get away
Then we swerve and ride out  ride out 
We Out
Lyrical escapades over the break burn rubber accelerate
By any means like Malcom X would say
Time to celebrate
Soon I get a record deal and be extra paid
First I think Ill buy an escalade
But no escape is what I didnt estimate
This is bullshit
If my money aint on the table then Im through with you labels

Im sittin here makin my music and not gettin paid
Ah but you havent recouped yet
I own you and your music
You signed the contracts
Thats the deal 
Yo
You really wanna know the deal  whats that 
These new jacks is gettin lost in the shuffle
Cuz they didnt know the game was a hustle
But watchin all the card sharks aint the hard part
The hard part is knowing how to play your cards smart
These greedy record labels make it so damn sickening
Not only sign a wack MC but sign they whole damn click
Im tryin ta make a honest livin from expression of self
These record labels only usin me to register wealth
Promised to buy moms a house  what  a large bank account
If I crisscross it over Rock it inside and out
Some rappers cant get enough of it
If you talkin bout a plush budget
Man they even do a song with  gunshots 
Doobdoodoo Doobdoodo Doobdoodoodoodoodoo
