Yo Labelled as a problem child doing what was not allowed
Got kicked out of mamas house now Im stepping out of bounds
Had to find some solid ground Seventeen without a doubt
Attitude was sauerkraut boxing bout I tried to knock my father out
Too proud to throw the towel me and family falling out
Lonely til the OG told me When you hit the bottom bounce
What you talking bout Shit I never thought about
It made sense to cops with hounds not around Im outta town
Started with a small amount once an ounce now a pound
All I got balls and clout Money aint no stoppin now
Fortune Wheel of White Vanna can I solve the puzzle now
That BS was out of style damn I shouldve bought a vowel
Escalate the drama driving pissy off the water brown
Paranoid turn the volume down heard the sirens sound
They wanna lock me down Fthat Im hoppin trial
Lost em once but now Im found Namelessjust number now
