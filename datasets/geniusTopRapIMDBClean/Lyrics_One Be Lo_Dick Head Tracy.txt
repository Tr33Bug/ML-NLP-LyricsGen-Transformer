Shouts out to Boom Bap Project take one
Lets go
The life of a gangsta danger
Known to bust Glocks rush spots underworld nuttin major
Been to the pen I was in it for the paper
Stick em up try to get with us get sprayed up
Came up hustlin Im comin to your city smugglin
Dopeheads lovin it Feds buggin it
Dont say it twice peep my latest heist
Most wanted skills most flaunted thats my way of life
Tellin cats all this summer run the funds through the numbers
Accounts on free status I let my Gs have this
We got this stored up through the routes and through regions
We keep em shortchanged so they thugs pledge allegiance
Run a monopoly monopolize economy
Lets operate it sloppily with quantity over quality
Two fuckin riddlers true to life swindlers
The checks in my hand and Im callin off my ninjas
Dick Head Tracy
Tryin to play me
Especially when it comes to money things might get ugly
Call me every day tryin to make that sale
Tall tales cash advance when all else fails
We sell retail make noise well
When its time to get paid all I get is voice mails
Now I gotta threaten your life and heckle your wife
And kidnap your kids just to get the rest of my rights
Dick Head Tracy
The wellknown bigot
I cut a deal with you Narc you out the next minute
Thugs in suits and we know when you recruitin
If my worker bees happy I hit them on some smooth shit
Street executives through bars substance sedatives
With emphasis on conniving your mentalitys prejudices
Fuck bein sensitive Im clockin when you rockin it
Its all signed and sealed in these top secret documents
Boom Bap Project

Dick Head Tracy Im one in onefive
Ill take that signin bonus on the New Jersey Drive
Its organized crime through the scope of a rhyme
Extortions design for payin on time
Strong arm and side swipe we scheme for necessity
Intricate instances like cats see complexity
Blacktops and laptops discreet with the cameras on
Well laminate a card read Welcome to Babylon
Dick Head Tracy
Walk into the room
Like everything is cool room fourthousandandeighty
Smile fake handshakes hide they hate
Anything to capitalizecapitalIs like sideways H
Criminal mindstates increase crime rates find waistlines
Laced with nines dont waste my time
Fake cats waitin in line to take my place they cant fade me
Or make me or break me they hate me
Dick Head Tracy
John Wayne Gacy
You beat around the bush cause you scared to come face me
Even the arch repeat flaws on complacents
And headcrackin video budget to Big Tiggas Bassment
You want success when you F and suck the minimum
And the pendulum shifts through your time space continuum
Kareem swarms with the OneManArmada
Ingredients for jack moves and the whole enchilada
Dick Head Tracy
Street credibility
I push weight with more intensity mostly mentally
Moses ministry all of yall cats is mortal men to me
Who am I is more a mystery moral victory
Normal tendencies for me to form an infantry
Swarm your airwaves sound speed oral symphonies
Mass capacities yo Im doin this for salaries
Fuckin with my dough I fuck up your whole anatomy
OneBeLo 
All you shady record labels  fuck you pay me 
All the distribution companies  fuck you pay me 
All you wackass promoters  fuck you pay me 
If you bootleggin my shit  fuck you pay me 
All you shady record labels  fuck you pay me 
All the distribution companies  fuck you pay me 
All you wackass promoters  fuck you pay me 
If you bootleggin my shit
So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me
My money my my money my money
So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me
My money
No equation
For real Im just watchin watchin my dough
Tryin to stop my checks

So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me what you owe me echoes
So for the cake I spit this for you to pay me what you owe me
Im just curious yknow I got a question aiyyo
