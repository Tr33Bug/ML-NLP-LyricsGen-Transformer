Double EssaySSA  Remix  Lyrics
Yo man sittin over here tryna put together this
This paper man  word  tryna go down to the university
And um Im tryna teach this course on how to be an MC
So  aight aight 
They wanted me to like submit them an article
They tell me to write a double essay
Or somethin like that so  a double essay 
Yknow Im tryin to work on that
Word oh so they want you to prove your qualification 
Yeah so  damn  tell me what you think about this
So so amazin so so amazin
So so amazin so so amazin
Secret Service agent surely slowly aging
Shootin suckers amazin supersoaker aimin
Silent skill assassin surfer sayin Awesome
Still slammin anybody Stone Steve Austin
Sorta sour apple spittin slang atchu  ahchoo 
Senim Sillas anthem stealin shows in action
Sixty seconds and sexy shorties admire
Somebody should acquire sixtyseven amplifiers
Silky smooth adult soakin soapy aloe
Storm shadow attackin swingin swords ample
Soldier solo Army
Stop shootin archery shell shocked armory
Skills symbolize artillery
Scratch sniff activated sensory super auxiliary
Some sail away south Sydney Australia
Souvenir shops always see some aliens
Solar system apparatus scale stratus
Atmosphere scary Spielberg actress
Soul sister Asian
Sweet sixteen adolescent sweat shop accommodations
So so amazin  so so  so so amazin  so so 
So so amazin  so so  so so amazin


Ay turn those beats up in my in my headphones
scratched If you ask me they going out ass backwards
