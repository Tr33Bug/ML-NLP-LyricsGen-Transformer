VERSE 1
One Be Lo is like Shaft wit the fro
On an African coast
Even if the action is slow
Im rapid with flow
Anybody making hits
Tell the rappers you know
My vocals pitch from the Booth
Like Satchel the pro
See me lookin like Atlas when he handle the globe
I see you lookin like Alice Wonderland is your home
It makes me wonder if you practice your flow
Or it must be a practical joke
You aint tough cuz you pack in your flow
You the type to lose Bladder control
The only thing you shootin is cameras to capture a pose
I can tell be the stains in the back of your clothes
Whos runnin sht
But you aint after the gold
I aint gotta say it twice
We know who got gadgets to go
Like the Inspector got under his Hat and his coat
Q
And you can still get the message like the caption is closed
You can still have somethin from a gat in your nose
You can still have service but the casket is closed
Its Too late to act friendly now youre casper the Ghost
Obituary in the back of the post
CANCEL THE SHOW
VERSE 2
They was hoping the fat lady would sing
Instead here comes the Rap Phantom
Whip Johnny Cash in a black fabric
Dont hate me in Haiti they call it Black Magic
White shirts civilised now the Man savage
Half man half dragon
Pants sag in a trench where they sand bag it POW
Whats the difference between a Flag and a bandana
Uncle Sam son of man summer jam Santana
Im the opposite Imagine attract magnets
On top of lillie pads deep as Atlantis
Deep as El Hajj Malik El Shabazz family
With a ham sandwhich
Time to think fast
You cant handle
Immo keep paddlin and splashin you kings in your sand castles
Im the master
