Ayo my rhymes be the tightest like bones with arthritis  thats tight 
Rockin with the SUB thats why they like us
These crews like computers is filled with megabyters
And Im the new virus in town I shut em down
Sound wack Not the slightest they filled with new surprises
Rap SCUBA diver deep like tuba choirs
Rappers cant handle it Joe just use your pliers
No doubt about it baby I got what you desire
I coulda had way more hose than firefighters
But I choose not to date those roles Im striving higher
I got more game than ESPN
Just walk over to her like lets be friends
Went to her house like  Little Pig let me in
She opened up the door with the sexy grin
And then  eheh  then  eheh  that was all she wrote
A lotta motion in the ocean throw me off the boat
Like Jonah I want it in a special way
Cause she shine in an extraterrestrial way  what 
I said she shine in an extraterrestrial way  what 
She shine in an extraterrestrial way ET
Shine shine shine 
Yo that night we both shined like a binary star
I still cant believe we let it go this far  far 
This shorty was a forty on scales of 1 to 10  yeah 
Thanks come again I was like I wonder when
It really didnt matter cause yo she had a pen and some paper
put my number down  Gimme your number Ill call you later
Just like she said ringaling Hello
ET phone home I played it smooth like a cello
Mastermind the plan and pulled it off like Velcro  I did it 
Hit it and now she feelin all funny like a elbow
Why you holdin back She said Im not
Communication is the key unlock
We put our heads together like a Mt Rushmore
I found what I was lookin for plus more
Now with you I wanna spend the rest of days
Cause you shine in an extraterrestrial way
I said you shine in an extraterrestrial way  uhhuh 
You shine in an extraterrestrial way ET
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Yo we all know the women outnumber the men
But I wanna play you close like my name was Glenn
Put me in a cornfield Im lettin all ears know
So fly momma shoulda named her UFO yo
She beamed me aboard we headed back to her planet
Outta this world man you wouldnt understand it  nope 
Now everybody think Im all crazy and shit
Cant believe I did a song about this alien chick
But its true you can ask Decompoze and Phrikshun  yup 
Im known to drop science but this science fiction
Close Encounters of the Third Kind kinda
Broke telescopes like you could never find her  shine shine 
Shinin like a Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Now everybodys wonderin who you are
Dont mean to break your concentration if its any consolation
I was thinkin me and you could make the perfect constellation
She said Aint nobody never told me that
I replied Girl cant nobody hold me back
Kick a flow while my man Decompoze the track
You better recognize the signs like the Zodiac  Scorpio 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way  what 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way  what 
We shine in an extraterrestrial way
Homegirl she was outta this world like ET
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine shine 
Shine shine shine 
Shine shine sh
