Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army army
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army
With the eagle I begin
Spread wings ride the wind
My story never ends
I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bust
Nowadays what I touch dont need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was Able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a subterraneous cut
You only get honest expressions when I spit in your ear
That means even when Im dissing you Im being sincere
That means even when Im dissing you Im being sincere
That means that means that means that means
Dont need a major indie cars drive me
Highly effective cause my crew selected
Never take the cause lightly
Get inspiration from the Almighty
I pray Allah guide me
Even underground cats be all sheisty
False grimy wack emcees need to floss nightly
Cause they never seen as raw like me so their jaws bite me  ouch 
Check me now quarterback style
Every time they pass the microphone
You would think I was a Moss Viking
My style touchdown your style need a touchup
Even with a Rick James sample you couldnt touch SUB  cant touch this 
Wack emcees wanna act stuckup when you kick it with em
Thinking Im dissing cause I aint feeling the shit they spitting
Know the difference between dissing and constructive criticism
They should try to pen a written that can fit the rhythm
Too busy trying to hit the ism hit the women
Feminine get the Benjamins watch my SUB Zero  Finish him
Finish em finish em finish em
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army army
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Uh Id like to say something about that
We dont procrastinate how many times I got to say to you
We aint the type of cats that only talk about what they would do
For years weve been paying dues
Staying true to our self while we making moves
Thank God we made it through
Wont stop until I do what I came to do
Kick a flow and get the dough thats just to name a few
Now every rhyme I say to you is here to stay with you
We stick in your head like it was said with the crazy glue
You wanna battle One Be Lo is not afraid of you
I could care less about your reputation
Even though it may be true
The truth is Subterraneous your favorite crew
And all them nonbelieving cats that came with you
Can catch the vapors too
I rock their minds like the slingshot of David do
Liver than PayPerView
You couch potatoes dont believe me call the cable crew
Every time I bus kids think they on their way to school
This grown man aint got no time to play with you
Theresa didnt raise a fool
You try to play me Glenn Close nah we cant be cool
Cause Ill be damned if I let it be a Deja Vu
With the eagle once again
Spread wings ride the wind
My story never ends
I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bust
But nowadays what I touch dont need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was Able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a subterraneous cut
You only get honest expressions when I spit in your ear
That means even when Im dissing you Im being sincere
That means even when Im dissing you Im being sincere
That means that means
Back on the scene is the incredible one man one man one man
