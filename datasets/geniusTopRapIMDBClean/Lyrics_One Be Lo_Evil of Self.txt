What you want
I am the Soul Brother like none other
This story takes place in a place called Self
Take in Mind everyBody no other than Soul Brother
Was living in awholenother State all help
He received he believed was the way God dealt
With his life but some would consider it trife
The ignorant type caught up in all the biblical hype
He wasnt feeling it right
Time told he would let the blind old man in the mirror give him advice
Sincere he kept his friends near with Devotion
They hang in a neighbourhood gang called Emotion
Who wasnt usually good for this community but
He knew of The Danger he grew up with Anger
He wasnt worried thought they was the best for him
If he wanted anything Lust was there for him
Sex Money Power Love would let him care for them
Hatred was the strongest he protected them
From a Truth he considered Evil hear no see no
His profile dont smile you know how Ego 
Conscience told Soul how to go legit
He said You know Doubt He told me dont believe that shit
Thats when he hooked up with Jealousy and Envy
Scoping out this Benzy rolling spokes about twenty
Pulled out the driver who now wanted to fight him
Fear told him You the man Pull the heat out and fire
This is how he living how he feeling hardcore
What he do that for Mr Greed said More
Remind me of a cat named Influence
Been proven to make men do it just like a sin student
Now Conscience had a question Whos your biggest enemy
He didnt know Shame so he blamed it on Hennessey
Reality wrote him a cheque  and let him have it
But they jumped in the ride Pride wouldnt let him cash it
He crashed it
Hook  x3
The Evil of Self
Everyday its the battle with the Self few are victorious
Many fall victim of wanting to be vainglorious
The Evil of Self is what drives you into destruction
Kids caught up in crack calling full of corruption
The youth need encouragement Evil of Self
Dont wanna hear about selfevaluation or development
Fall victim of the negative extravagant and competitive
And all kinds of irrelevance we blame it on environment
The Evil of Self causing destruction of his family
Jealousy and greed are poison in places of society
The Evil of Self the justification for foolishness
Its sad any form of ignorance we grew immune to it
The Evil of Self dont wanna hear constructive criticism
People get a sense of arrogance when somethings given to em
Surrounded by devils I find myself performing exorcisms
Worlds got us going in circles chasing materialism
The Evil of Self is what plunges you into error
AlHamdulillah but most worship the mighty dollar
The Devil blinds us with the love of money and power
The Evil of Self the content is the soulseller
The backbiter the slanderer the instigator
The divided conquerors that established the legislator
The player hater the fornicator sooth sayer
Selling you stories but they sold their soul Shaytan became the regulator
Idolaters violators and hardheads
Women thats fine thats selling bodies to bad men
Most men are in jail due to women and drugs
Everybodys on life support pulling their plugs
Inordinate love the Evil of Self your worst enemy
The different classes of people claiming superiority
The battle that discourage many from wanting to strive
Against the Evil of Self viewers discretion is advised
