Yo its the One Man Army General Subliminal aka One Be Lo Rockin with the Subterraneous beats by the Trackezoids
yaknowhatimsayin This is the Subterraneous movement
Like Moses taking my people on an exodus here we go

Spotlight operator aim at Yaktown
If you dont know the time its time to act now
Ayo my pen uncontrollable notepads are over Lo
Going up these quotables to move up the totem pole
Would rob a hood I pay dues with stolen shows
Wax pads thats harder than cast over the broken bones
And gristle officially swing ropeadope
Butterfly floating and bees stinging you swollen dome kings
On the throne like rats on cheese provolone
Soandso selling your soul genes and chromosome
Blood sweat and tears for what appears to never be treasury
Haters get mad green incredibly
All over the globe emcees the same destiny
Same bit of taste most reckon its the same recipe
Sugar coated sex drugs violence aim the weaponry
Blasphemy amahkiyama this weighs heavily
How you gonna battle the truth I say let it be
I came to bless the seeds on streets that aint Sesame
Feel the vibe in the place when its prime time
Dont need no light on the stage I got my own shine
The facts right on your face no need to claim blind
Proceed follow my lead or get left behind

If you dont know the time its time to act now
Whether its college we living some street knowledge
I wanna hear them lyrics make sense no stink garbage
Listen whatever you doing just do it with skill
Just because its positive dont mean its something I feel
Keep it real
Though still a fan of villain grans who spit it grand
Sometimes you dont understand how I could kill a man
Violence in his plans no time for ill advance
Guerrilla hands go to war before you get a chance to score
You wanna battle kid Ill damage your pride
Make you feel like when planets collide travelling time
Centuries before the Africans was sent to get beat
To cave blocks play the hard rock Ill chisel you deep
Bring it back
The lyrics you speak can never reach the topspittin
Theyre so sick that my fans should bring a doc witem
So tremendous gang members run to the cops snitching
Im not thrilling your squads realer than Godzilla


Feel the vibe in the place when its prime time
Dont need no light on the stage I got my own shine
The facts right on your face no need to claim blind
Proceed follow my lead follow my lead

If you dont know the time its time to act now
I keep the slang tight ready for fangtypes
Like Dracula vernacular expose you to daylight
You hoping it was left in the dark left in the past
But two lefts dont make a right you really need to take advice
After a handful of record sold you shouldve stepped to Lo
Make the question known but you let it go
The point is you want something you need to let me know
Dont start buggin this forced me to call the pest control
Back in the day when Cube was screaming F the po
Seemed like we never had beef only the vegetables
Never thought itd be like this I guess you never know
Friends come and go this world is for the eskimos
Feel the vibe in the place when its prime time
Dont need no light on the stage I got my own shine
The facts right on your face no need to claim blind
Proceed follow my lead or get left behind
Feel the vibe in the place when its prime time
Dont need no light on the stage I got my own shine
The facts right on your face no need to claim blind
Proceed follow my lead or get what
