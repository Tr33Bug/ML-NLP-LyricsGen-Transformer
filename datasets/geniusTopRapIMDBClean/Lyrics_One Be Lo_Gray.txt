Sunrise sunset sunrise sunset
Sometimes sunshine is only a phase
Sunrise sunset
Now let me take you to a place where the rays off the sun
Blocked by the gray lofty rain often come
Single parents apparently raise all their young
When they once took a village now they call it a slum
People dont greet or smile theyre pokerfaced
Call em tough a wildcard may call your bluff
Blades dont pay off they blaze all their guns
Maybe take all your bucks maybe paid all for drugs
They know whats up hey officer
They all corrupt somebody might pay off the judge
See knowledge is the key and the truth shall set you free
But its so hard to take off the cuffs
When the laws of the land dont scrape off the scum
Bags bum politicians waste all the funds
Schools dont teach so the playground is love
Till a stray blow make a soul take off above
His momma dressed in black she make all the fuss
He couldve been the next MJ off the jump
Hang out the tongue freethrow take off and dunk
The newspaper say all for what
The police was looking for witness but they always dumb
Nobody wanna cooperate not with fuzz
They use us to make all the busts and toss like hero
Sandwich to dogs who make off with lunch
Another gray matter like a brain pattern
Confused when her colour changed parents
Family on the light side dont accept the dark side
Sort of like apartheid pass each other by like The Pharcyde
Fat lip like a daddy flat butt like a mammy
Nobody can relate in the family
She cant sit with granny cause her skin too brown
Aint from tanning whatever
She feel like a Big Boi and Andre together without the umbrella
And this aint rain weather and thats an outcast if your brain aint clever
This gray could be a change for the better
mistakes
Now as I walk through the valley in the shadow of death
Real jihad the battle itself Im not a superman
Everything sat on my chest except S
I be okay crush kill destroy that stress
Pimp the rhyme skills like a prostitute in high heels
Walking through a minefield trying to blow the fk up
Neckhigh in bills indie on the driving wheel
Maybe I should sign a deal maybe thatll slow the buck up
And I cant afford it my fam gotta stay supported
Dont wanna grow tall in the charts theyre getting shorted
By the corporate you need more than Trojan type horses
To penetrate their fortified fortress
They hire more lawyers thatll run circles around your office
Shady ways often rights get waived
Gotta be Navy trained sometimes sunshine is only a phase
Maybe making this paper save a little for a rainy day
