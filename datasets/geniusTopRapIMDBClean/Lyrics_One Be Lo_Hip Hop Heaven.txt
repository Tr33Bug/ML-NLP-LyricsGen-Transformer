So think twice before you step
Yo yo last night it was dead
I feel asleep early woke up this mornin right side of the bed
The rest of the fam was sleep I didnt want to wake em
Im in the mood for makin some music and so I hit the basement
When it comes to writin this song Im not as patient
More like a doctor performin a operation
In this particular day Im hearin dope beats
The lyrics was steady comin combination so sweet
Im not tryin to eat so I skip breakfast
Im in a zone like Jordan when the clock ticks seconds
Two songs later One Be Lo is gettin hotter
Than thermometers and monitors Im just gettin started
I hear the kids upstairs they didnt even bother
To interrupt they father cause they know that Im an artist
And I be workin harder than most I got a daughter that boast
They learn a lot cause they follow me close
Still early its 1030 I tried to call Majestic
His phone didnt ring I didnt leave a message
I need to keep writin so I didnt even stress it
I finished another record Im in hiphop heaven
scratched samples
Yeah record pace I was runnin through the pages
Of my notepad excited but my heart aint even racin
Progress I was makin in the best time
Workin like Im gettin closer to my deadline
I guess its just another day in the life of One Be Lo
Five hours of work an hours worth of material
Like what Im hearin so Im turnin up the stereo
Neighbors usually complain the noise was unbearable
But somethin about today was different
Everybody was doin they own thing cant wait to give em this shit
Im feelin so alive thank God for the blessin
Heart and soul of my profession give you hiphop heaven
scratched samples
Aaaand now its time to switch directions I end the session
My young ones usually by now theyre gettin restless
I float upstairs they face is glued to the TV
I walked to the kitchen guess they didnt even see me
I wasnt even lookin for a meal anyway
Kinda strange cause I didnt drink or eat all day
In the sound booth standin on my feet all day
Im dead tired now maybe I should sleep all day
On my way to the room I hear my lady on the phone
She moan cryin and dyin inside feelin alone
Almost finished packin said she gotta get goin
Need a change and she can no longer live in this home
I stand lookin confused with boxes before me
I called her name three times she only ignored me
She held a newspaper in her hands it read
Local rapper One Be Lo age 30 found dead
Im in hiphop heaven echoes
scratched samples
HipHop heaven echoes
