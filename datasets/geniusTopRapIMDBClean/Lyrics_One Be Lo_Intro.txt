This apples hard to the core this aint about metaphors
Given the spiritual war we all a part of it
So much emotion inside I spit with passion and pride
Feel the rhythms I ride I put my heart in it  I put my soul in it 
Originality grace my personality traits
Nourish reality based see how my world turns
Sets anybody in weeks I practice first what I preach
Experience what I teach you gotta live and learn
And for the hiphop addicts another Sub classic
