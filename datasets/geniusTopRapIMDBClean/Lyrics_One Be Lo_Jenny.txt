Its so alone In that broken home
She knew her daddy was a rollin stone
Momma stay working her fingers to the bone
To keep the light rays on
Not raising her own
Grandmother playin the role
Too gray and too old
So shorty had to teach herself the card play
Now wit a BrotherFather missed
She learned a lot of this the hard way
The fast lane got nothing on her car chase
Bar place boyfriends
Keep her looking Scarface
Line snorters call her crime soldier
Confiding in her fake ass friends
Good luck trynna find Solace
Denim linen over shed skinning cobras got the best feelin venom inem
Told you not to mess witem
Women
Grinnin
Grillin
Behind ya back bending
Killin momentum
Lifes OVER
Its time to rise like the Pipe smokin
Hydro and
High rollin and Dozin
But only wit her eyes open
Thermostat every where she turn
See her own Breath when she breathing
Believing not even Ice colder
A bitter taste the only thing she ever got out of life
Can you explain how she made it this far with out God in her life

Twenty Birthdays lived without Pops in her life
Strange how da man change wanna pop in her life
Apologized at her gravesite
The victim of a shooter Thats right
No happy endings
And no reunions
