Verse 1
Back up
One Be Lo was doin art for the love
Stick up
Plea bargains with judge
Dont sleep wake up
Smell the Star to the Bucks
Wise up
Now its all profit property market and such
Pay up
Skills sharper than a dart in my clutch
I aim High for the Bullseye targets destruct
Adrenalin startin to rush like a car with a drunk
I seen my door of opportunity was startin to shut
I forced my way in like Jediswith Jabba the Hut
HutHutTwenty yards Steve Largent and cut
Had to leave alone Phillies no more sparkin the blunts
Now my game like Barkley with Suns
Stars and above
Im a thoroughbred emcees be talkin to us
But you aint sayin much you mutts you barkin with pups
I be sayin What the fk
Pardon my cuss
I leave better lines in heads than barbers who cut
Ahhs and oohs ooze 
Sorta like when lava erupts
From the crowd permanent smile Im carvin a pumpkin
Somethin outta nuhthin pockets with none
Now I know about the profit  Prophet 
Ark and the Flood
Other rappers make it rain for the stripper showin parts in the club
LoRaina make you Bobbit and tuck
In a photoshoot all ofem Mug
Acting like theyve been to the Core
Theyre barely even hard to the crust
Sit you on the edge of the street
They pick you up like the garbage on trucks
I keepem sittin on the edge of the seats
Like Rosa Parks on a bus
Or see me in the Hood sparkin the plugs
Animated like Curious George
Parliament funk
Jumpin outta the trunk
While you watchin cartunes
Saturday afternoon
Outta ya bunk
Two different levels
Like bass and the trebel
Ya equalizers gotta adjust now people turn it up
They ask me why I do this I do this for
Love Allah Bills Opportunities Revolution
For years people
Land Agriculture Beasts Occupation Resources

Large animals Bovine Obedient Reliable
Or like the little animals
Locusts Ants Bees or Roaches
