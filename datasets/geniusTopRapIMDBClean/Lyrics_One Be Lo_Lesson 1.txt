Yo lesson number one when you get a chance to grab the mic and get before an audience or get in the recording sound booth and like drop some lyrics man you gotta make it you gotta make it happen You gotta make sure that its some worthwhile shit because everybody aint got that chance you know what Im sayin
I remember way before I ever had a fan and held a mic in my hand
I couldnt really freestyle I wrote some rhymes with my man
Back then I Got It Made was my favorite tune
Shorty wasnt booking shows my first crowd was a lunchroom
1992 I started sneaking in clubs
First time I grabbed the microphone the crowd showed me love
Thats when I realized I had a real gift
Of course my parents didnt understand like I was Will Smith
But I was dedicated as an emcee
So much inspiration 1993
I wrote rhyme after rhyme for a past time
Shared lyrics with my man Decompoze during class time
Met Senim the story goes on
If it wasnt for the love then you know it was wrong
I cant recall a conversation about deals and dolla bills
Since day one its all about the beats and the rhyme skills
Lesson number one you know what Im sayin stay true to yourself know who you are and what you about you know what Im sayin Forget what them fans is talking about what the other crews is talking about know who you are and what you tryin to do and what your mission is on the mic you know what Im sayin and Im tellin you you always land on your feet straight up lesson number one
Im on a mission with soulja vision
Tuning my engines rhymes switch over tracks during pole position
You need to stop and listen to this coalition aint no competition
I roll with Friction and Decompozition  
Gotta take my time when Im dropping wisdom
Operating with Dr Frankenstein creating monster rhythms
It aint about making lots of millions
So I avoid major propositions for my hot inventions
Cause all I need is a pot to piss in
See what I say No way you need to see an optician  
Lyrical Lego doing lots of building
Who is he busy man no time for time Tonka children
That shit is dead instead Im coffin digging
Any opposition come up coffer missing
I drop lines similar to salt water fishing
Murder with the mic they be talkin bout some killings
You know what Im saying a lot of cats out here be talkin about you know what Im sayin what they gonna do you know what Im saying I mean even if you talking about something positive dont talk about it just do it man lesson number one action cause talk is mad cheap you know what Im sayin take that from somebody who knows man yo keep it movin
Now lets keep it moving me and you haulin off
Blowin spots like molotovs the black Gorbachev
Boston hogs walkin dogs and never fallin off
Palmin mics ace in a hole like Arnold Palmer golf
The whack emcee holocaust to the world
To my family and friends they call me Lo they call Silla Ross
Bust rhymes without the blue balls
Rebel with a new cause I used to move yall
But now I make the whole room pause
My lost and found box was a mirror on the bathroom wall
Mystery man revealed be still this wont hurt a bit
We only murder kids that talk abouts they murder kids
Just because you wrote it in pen dont make it permanent
Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit
You know what Im sayin Lesson number one
Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit
