Yo Check out this high voltage I got the ACDC
To shock emcees and leave them Winan like Cee Cee
So Bee Bee on the lookout Im live wire
You cant handle me gzzz gzzz  I start fires
Crossing my path dont make me laugh it aint worth it
Call the nurses all my verses blowing all your circuits
Peep the current cause what I bring to the mic is like
Benjamin Franklin with a string and a kite
Electrocute emcees who battle weak
Wait a whilemy flow is like death row have a seat
Every sentenced executed every time I said a verse
My frequencies hit your measurements where it megahertz 
Even with rubber gloves you still couldnt touch it
Make sure you ground it when I bzzz bzzz buss it
You catch a heart attack I take the headphones off my ear
Put them on your chest and tell the room to stand clear
This is how I operate you dont know the half
Im halffreestyle innovator half power generator
Got a short fuse when it comes to whack emcees
Smack the taste out their mouth like a ninevolt battery
I strike with a thunderbolts accuracy
Zig zag zig through the crowd hit the tallest kid in back of me
Electromagnetic draw the crowd with my polarity
And lyrical origzigzigziginality
