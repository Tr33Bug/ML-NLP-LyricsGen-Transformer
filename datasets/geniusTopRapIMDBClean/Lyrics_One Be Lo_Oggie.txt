This is dedicated to the third George aiyyo I miss him in the worst way
The bullet killed him on his nineteenth birthday
Now what a sad way to lose your life
At that time he had a newborn daughter and a future wife
I never got a chance to say goodbye
I heard the news from a county jail cell facin twentyfive
Cant explain how I feel inside
Cant explain the actions of the trigger guy but still I try
Did I cry Man I probably ran a river dry
Thinkin to myself tryin to figure why
They say its always the good ones that have to die
What they say  Its always the good ones that have to die
They say real niggas dont die they multiply
At least a million cats demand low supply
Thats a million man army march and open fire
When MCs grab the mics and spark with no desire
Know they sire wont shine control the tide  tide 
True Zodiac when most dont know the signs
Rap Christ miracle mic dont be surprised
Who else you know talk to the deaf and lead the blind
Once dumb now I got a lot to say
Once blind now I focus on the world today
Dont think you got wisdom lifell pull your teeth
I got peeps in the dirt from some bullshit beef
Walkin a straight path these last days is even steeper
Action inflated talk is even cheaper
You dig it We livin in homes thats gettin deeper
The more niggas grim the more the Grim Reaper
