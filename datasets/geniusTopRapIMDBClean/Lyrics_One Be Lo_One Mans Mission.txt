Yo now when you got a joker ace
You gotta keep a poker face
I know Im holdin weight
But these critics prone to hate
I still motivate even though these corporate snakes
Wanna swallow up my profits like whales in Jonahs days
Some of yall flow is straight but it dont amaze One Man Army
You lack the soldier traits
You anorexic Im overweight
I represent the motor state real estate low mortgage rates
Speaking of rates emcees I pulverate
Aint nothing nice like your cell phones roaming rates
I got the Juice I got police on the chase
Now these Marcia Clark Chris Darden niggas on my case
I wanna place first in the Indy 500
These cats bet their soul on the race
They tryin get paid so they stay in the fast lane
In the long run get wrecked and slam on your breaks
See I be on some real live shit
Many rock the mic but never quite  like this 
The one mans mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin  like this 
repeat 2x 
Ive been verbal since Moses was jumpin ten hurdles
Splittin red pharaoh since Abednego was infernal
Deadly with pen journals MAC10 verbals
Cock this shitBLAOWApocalypse Now here to kill colonels
Actually Im here to win turtles
So many unlucky rappers sleep BeLo travel with twin turbo
Super cockadoodledoo I keep the hens fertile
Wifey cant stand the groupie chicks they just my friend girl
Record companies are Shady like Slim Marshall
Keep running or youll never walk again Herschel
All they do is spin circles and pretend service
We cant share you cant even keep your syringe sterile
And what I got is too dope even for ten Darryl Strawberrys
Twenty Marrion Barrys
The Binary visionary
Spit a very literary piece
On vanilla sheets
Train militaries on a beach
With my very speech


Im on some real live shit
Many rock the mic but never quite like this
The one mans mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin like this
repeat 2x 
This is a new day
When dues paid and callin shots
Like Im pool playin pops
Told me not to lose patience
Heard Justin bustin cross Ross and knew Damon
Made a few changes wisely now a Isley brother smooth sailin
Tooth Sabre crews hatin cause I represent the Wolverine scene
Snooze takers get the rude waken
Truth bangin spit a few statements just to prove Satan
Use majors never lose faith in Subterraneous
A new nation under God
Too sacred get your shoes taken
In these new places just a few make it
Refuse takin food bacon
All these dudes fakin
Tapes get ejected like a Piston with the two flagrants
Blow the whistle get the SUB in the game
Dunk in your face
Flavors that your tongue wish to taste
Nothing you say comes into play
Bullets in your gun ricochet
I dont think you bust anyway
But any day I be on some real live shit
See many rock the mic but never quite  like this 
The one mans mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin  like this 
See any day I be on some real live shit
Many rock the mic but never quite  like this 
The one mans mission is to blast competition
With the ill composition representin  like this
