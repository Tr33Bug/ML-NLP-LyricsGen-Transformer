One man army  feat one be lo  LyricsYo its the one man army
General subliminal
Yo its the one man army
General subliminal
Yo its the one man army
General subliminal
Flyin through the sky ready for war with syllables
Literary military top secret mission
You aint see nothin yet its like a selfcheck
My mental plane takes flight I airstrike the mic
The mystery pilin in the cockpit all night
See how I keep the shows live
I never lost a dog fight
See how my enemies know style the name of my plane is the pitbull terrier
Keep my targets locked in the more the merrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly my voice need a aircraft carrier
Tribal airways every track is a runway
Keep your jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinkin they shall overcome one day they must be dreamin
Its the one man army
General subliminal
Yo its the one man army
General subliminal
March across land ready for war with syllables
Literary military top secret mission
You aint see nothin yet I roll up on ya set
With speed movin like a German blitzkreig
I got what they missin in action
Stand at attention military fashion
And listen to the rapper Rambo the Mic Commando
Fully equipped I write rhymes for extra ammo
Too much to handle you had the nerve to try to grab the mic
Im too marvelous when Im droppin this watch the mic
Turn it to a nuclear test site
MCs better hear the words of Tina cause we dont need another Hiroshima
Check it out
Its the one man army
General subliminal
Yo its the one man army
General subliminal
Yo its the one man army
General subliminal
Dive into the mine ready for war with syllables
Literary military top secret mission
You aint see nothin yet how deep can I get
Six thousand leagues beneath MC level
A submarine hero with torpedo steelos
My strategys turn MCs into POWs
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battle ships
I send em up the creek and they lifeboats paddleless
Sought by the Navy Seals strategists
Aint interested if the sharkinfested
You cant see my style and Ive shown this
Too many times Ive been in war missions than a homeless
Always on point like a compass
360 degree all around Emcee
The one man army
General subliminal
Ready for war with syllables
Literary military top secret mission
You aint see nothin yet
