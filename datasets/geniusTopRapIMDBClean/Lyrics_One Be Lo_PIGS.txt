HOOK
When the Street Lights come on
And the Darkness sets in
Watch yo back
Cuz we might catch you
Cuz we know yo naame
Yo crew and your ways
What you you say
When the street lights come on
VERSE 1
In Uniforms Blue they storm thru
With Lightening Speed
The Sirens Scream
Inside the Streets
Heads Turn Wheels Burn
In pursuit of a Thief
Another Bite out of crime
More food to the Beast
Similar to what a carnivore do to the Beef
Keep the Belly all Swelly
tell he true to the feast
Sprinkle salt in the game
Take it bitter or sweet
They the reason why you Niggas aint feeling the Heat
Block Hot
You might seem walking the Beat
Pop Pop
They chalk bodies under the sheet
Lock up the precinct
Thats what we all think but
The Judge dont throw away keys or toss sinks
They aint cleaning the streets
They makinem stink
Hands dirty in the Pig Pen
Shit where they eat
No Justice or Peace
With corrupt Police
Crime Pays
You just wont get a reciept
VERSE 2
Now this what we about to do
Take you on another mission with the Boys in Blue
Theres a few out there that serve and protect
But the Pigs on the other hand get no respect like
Here they come in the Police Car
Abuse the P to the O to the WER
Pull over them runners that make Drug connects
Wont putem under arrest
They come to CollectChaChing
Crimes Progress
Its all about Green
They can roll up on the Scene
But they not here to help
She got pulled over for not wearing a Belt
But the Ticket aint written if she not wearing a Belt get it
So watch what you say kid
Undercovers tape it
Thats what you call a Pig in a Blanket
No matter what the Rank is
Gettin that Bank
Do our tax Money pay dat shit
Yep
VERSE 3
Okay
Lets explore
Pigs never sweat through pores
So what they wanna sweat you for
Why the Black Brown youth feel less secure
Patem down
Hands up
Feet spread the floor
Poverty leads to crime
They arrest the poor
Some people cant afford a lawyer
When they step in court
So when the suspect is caught
You can rest assure
They use no less of course
Than excessive force
And its next to Norm
Get beat like you stole
Leave ya cheeks all swole
Like Gilespies horn
What if cameras in LA never pressed record
Do you think Rodney King would be dressed in court
In a lawsuit
Bless the Lord
It aint like we aint never seenem outta line step before
Black boot with the Heel out
Spill out
Coffee when they peel out
Then fill out
The next report
