Who put you here  Allah 
What is our purpose
Whats the result  Justice 
Do I deserve it  Ask yourself that question 
What do you have  All those who come to this surface 
What are you giving  Sudaka 
When will you die  Allah knows best 
How are you living  Sirat al mustaqim 
Incur calamity to bring about tragedies and casualties
Whats your way of life is it blessed or is it blasphemy
I look around me everybodys living so savagely
Trying to stay sane in this world full of insanity
Repeating our mistakes as we havent learned from our history
Kids disrespecting their parents like   
Billions of dollars are being wasted to drop bombs
On poor Bedouin families because they tamper with Bushs poppyseed
As long as I speak the truth I will always think    enemy
Welfare recipients turn to warfare participants
Watching the news is like reruns of incidents
Fulsom prison filled with citizens thats proven innocent
Positive man defeat the rights of the indigenous
Violence the number one form of entertainment
Guide us we need to free us from mental enslavement
Alcohol sex drugs guns
A few tools the devil uses to entice what you love
When the dramatic scenes of a movie make you cry
But no remorse for the garbage that we see throughout our lives
Weve got eyes but can we really see
Or hear what we want to hear
Act like we wanna be
Guard your faculties you cant afford to live haphazardly
Your kids with potential not knowing their capabilities
Justice isnt really given to the society
Your love of anything can lead you blindly
This life is a deception
Full of selection
So people use created objects for protection
When death comes you dont have no choice but to surrender
Surprise attack like they did the World Trade Center
