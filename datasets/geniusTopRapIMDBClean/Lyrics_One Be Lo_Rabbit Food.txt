VERSE 1
Lettuce Begin
The veggietable of contents
I give you a parsnippet
When then DJ start to Spinach
I put the songs on wax
They want a couple pears  pairs 
Search da barrel for bad apples
But none is there
Now I plant seeds and bury the bone
In different area codes
On blackberry
Macintosh
Or windows
Easy a peel  appeal  like bananas
The man with the plantain
Keepin it organic
Over deez golden beets
I yam so sweet
A different grain
Im known to rice on a beach
U could say Im a fungi
Party in a plush room
You feelin blue in ya small world
Like mushrooms
It aint hard to tell a smurf from a Gargamel
Father Sun Tzu strategy behind my art of sale
Protect ya Necktarine
Cuz all these crabs in a bucket
Just wanna see ya record sales Plummet
VERSE 2
Crime pays but you not a felon
Honeydew jail
Waiting for dispatch like a watermelon
Im in the lime light
Not because my art is sellin
Rhymes Automatic
Lemon squeeze like mac 11
Now Whos that Pecan thru my window
Pow
Nobody now dats tamato
You might say tamayto
Im 24 carrot underground
Just imagine if my sound made it mango
They say its for the love and the Passionfruit
Thats when I say get deez nuts
We got checks to cashews
I got a academia in macadamia
Neva like pimpartichoke slappin ladies up
I metaphor  met her for  pickles in the jar
Or I might blaze grapes in her face
Still raisin  raising  the bar
And you granola emcees cant handle those
I see cabbage folks
They  see Cantelope

Green Machine like McHale Kevin
Im chile chill
Red is familiar
My name ring a bell pepper
Stalking ya ears
You might turn corn
Same rappers turn pop
When the heat turn on
When the flame turn orange
Time to do dat shit
If its still hard to be leave
I prune that shit
Pomegranate dont panic
Im the cherry on top of the Ice Cream
I squash beef
Thank you berry much
Peas
