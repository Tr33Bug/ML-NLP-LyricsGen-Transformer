Nothnothnothing has done more to unite the people of the world
Than this daring venture into the unknown
His decision was to make the journey
And the world watched and listened echoing scratch
No doubt scratches blastoff
Ten nine eight seven six five four  lift off  three two
One Man Army on a solo mission but Im still starrin
Still starvin still marchin
Train of thought like a drill sergeant
Turn you battle rappers into real martyrs but the real target
The industry cause the real harm is when the deals bargain
Kill the real artist ever since the Sugar Hill started
When Suga Ray was still sparrin I was ill sparkin
Skills far from real dark and Late Night was still Carson
Skills sharper these days these emcees
Still bitin still barkin still talkin real garbage
Explains why Im feelin so trash bag Glad
I get the last laugh you get the half mast flag
Bent cash quick fast these rappers phony
Thinkin this craftKraft is all about the cheese macaroni
I see the path before me act like you know me
Internationally center of attention not even Shaq could post me
Category Trackezoids beats classic only
Feet tappin for me thats the story til Im Casper ghostly
Every joint Im on point no need to ask Shinobi
Swingin at your throat be not Breathin like you Braxton Toni
Rocketship scratches
Rocketship scratches
Yo Im flowin now to blow the microphone out
I spit the flows out Mr Skoal Mouth no doubt
Tickets sold out black and white kids Diffrent Strokes house
Transform you pessimists to optimists and roll out
Decepticons style Megatron bloaw
Check the rhyme files 007 stretch beyond bounds
Of the earth moon universe soon to burst through
Three sixtyfive prepare live you April 1st Fool
These wannabe best rappers hold the wet bladders
Need a step ladder still couldnt reach my best status
Inspector Gadget extra baggage I was blessed to have it  skills 
You must be still guessin at it still testin average
Im never slippin even if you peeled a fresh banana
The moves I make are checks and balance like a chess fanatic
You less advantage manic depressin impress the panic
Lyrics hot enough to melt your plastic burn your flesh to ashes  ouch 
Thats what you earn when you not well rehearsed
Somebody gotta help preserve this art form myself preferred
Check the verse its like a Magic spell with words
These wack emcees prolly felt it worse than a Celtic Bird


I remember when Bam was hot Planet Rock Jordan was the man to stop
Knowledge every chance I got keys to the master lock
Deals not real unless its Gods will
Got NASA job skills call me astronaut Neil
I reach for the top and be the first to leave orbit
Report it Phrikshun Decompoze reinforce it
Im here to paint a portrait untainted by the corporate
Defy forces of your gravity with fly orders
These accomplishments via rocketship compliment my confidence
I be among stars without your documents
Big budget marketing demographic targeting
All I need is beats and rhymes  so go and spark it then
