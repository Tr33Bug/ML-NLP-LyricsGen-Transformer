Yo how many people hear they alarm clock go off in the morning
You know what Im saying
And then you hit the snooze button
Its time to get up
Lotta cats still sleeping out there
Ya know what Im saying
They not on Subterranean
Watch this
Never denied better than Clyde I glide from the three
Third eye verbally Im certified with the beat
I drop one verse other cats be rhyming for weeks
Im thinking if he ever rest Ill be climbing his peaks
Rappers speak about how they packing nines on the beat
Pat him down thats the clown that be quiet in streets
Ask around blast around he crying for peace
Ironically Im getting down five times in the East
Every time I release classic material
You get a CD for ten but Ill sign it for free
Capitalism have my children dying for cheese
Damn fashion grand dragon be designing your jeans
Buckle pants sagging Uncle Sam taxing me describing the thief
Bar codes thats the sign of the beast
Now the latest pagan faces be the flyest MCs
Hands shaking like a Mason with the highest degrees
Buzzing off the Vitamin C no Heineken please
Gifted like the 25th dont have to light up the tree
Right of the free hiphop is Private Ryan to me
That means Im moving up to bank it while you lying asleep
Wake up 
Mothers crying  Wake up 
Brothers dying  Wake up 
Can you feel me  Wake Up 
I cant make you  Wake up 
When we gonna  Wake up 
Can you feel me  Wake up 
Put your hands up  Wake up 
Make it happen  wake up 
Midwest  Wake up 
East Coast  Wake up 
Down South  Wake up 
West Coast  Wake up 
Middle East  Wake up 
Worldwide  Wake up 
Everybody  Wake up 
Everybody  Wake up 
Hard work sweat and bloodstains did it for chump change
I didnt really complain cause it was a love thing
Thats when I was a kid black now I know this fact
That love is gonna get you evicted from where you live at
Home is where the heart is yours I open with facts
I strike like when I swing first then you pitch black
Running round your diamonds and rings you thinking baseball
You in the box of unconscious Im tryna wake yall
Take yall from blind vision leave with divine wisdom
My ride rhythm never sideslippin my times tickin
I flow to the end used to hang mostly with friends
Now I keep my enemies closer than them
Cause I know how it is when theres fear in the sky
Weather change hella fangs wanna tear in your spine
I never really trusted cats that couldnt stare in my eye
No surprise yo even blessings wear a disguise
Sometimes Im riding in the hood me and my man saw
Some big teeth hands and feet yo that aint grandma
Big chains cars and clothes yo that aint hiphop
Spit your flow backwards huff and puff your blush but
You still aint big or bad enough to blow up my bridge spot
Excuse me if Im on some rude shit but fuck the flipflop
Just chilling building even at your show my hands deep in the pocket
Like Doug Williams cause yall wasnt thrilling
