BRIDGE
Made for love
Made for love
Made for love
Made for love
VERSE 1
So many Struggles to get here
I packed a lot of gear
Cuz momma said I got some mountains to climb
My step father showed me how to work
So I gave it a shot
Everyday the clock started at Nine
Ended at Five
Thats not enough
I started walking with Cane
Like people do
When their opiticals blind
And reading Braille lines
That hustle and Rob landed jail time
Finally I asked God for a sign
Parole
Free style
Plus the Option to Rhyme
I do it for the Love
Plus the Wallet and shine
For Blue collars alike
For anybody getting dollars with crime
For college minds
Hip Hop is alive
But now a days the real shit is harder to find
And if you spittin real shit its hard to get signed
Cuz the game is full of Decepticons
I even had to transform
But I did it like Im Optimus Prime
I must have been ahead of the clock and my time
Jottin these lines
cuz years later still you gotta rewind
Now record labels come with the contracts
To lock me in a bind
Nigga pleez
Is you outta ya mind
BRIDGE
Its not enough time
Its not enough time
Its not enough time
For me
To change your mind
VERSE 2
So many Snakes in this Game trying to gain your trust
So many Haters make it seem like it aint no Love
Is it the egg in the Skillet or my brain on drugs
Got me addicted to this music til my Gray grow much
You can feel it when you hear it in the way Lo bust
They aint livin what they spittin they just make flows up
But if your beats aint loud
Or you got a weak style
You can try to move the crowd
But it aint gon budge
Never will go pop
But I will Blow up
On the Internet they sayin that I changed so what
All my real fam know me and you aint Lo judge
If ya boy cant change
man he cant grow up
Time to get that Raid
Gotta spray those bugs
Gotta make those moves
Time to lace those Dunks
Trying to see new thangs
Gotta make those bucks
Money on the table
Record labels bank on us

VERSE 3
And they charge us the Interest
Gods Intervention
This talent got me looking like a Star from a distance
They argue and defend this
To grab their slice
I should Arson the building
But that aint right
