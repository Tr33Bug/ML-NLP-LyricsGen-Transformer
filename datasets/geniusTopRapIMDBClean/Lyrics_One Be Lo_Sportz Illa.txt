Yo its time to get ready for the season yknahmsayin
With the program you dont know what the program
We gon have to show you how we keep it Sports Illustrated
Thats right mental practice yo lyrical scrimages
Yo wont my man step out the dugout and lead this off
Straight out the batters box steppin up to your mental plate
Throw me everything you got grand slam is what I innovate
Lyrically Im bases loaded this is it pitch a bitch if you want some
Somebody in the crowdll catch my home run every time Im on the mic
Just gimme somethin I can work with I knock em outta sight
The bottom of the 9th Im swingin like Kirby Puckett
Chewin on tobacco aimin for the bucket
Spit cancerous rhyme after rhyme
Rookies ride pine while the crowd ride mine
I ride with Compoze Trackazoids family
We told you Whos on first like Amos told Andy
Southpaw pitcher on the microphone
Easy as 123 gettin down in your strike zone
Fireball fastball how you like my pitchin
Swing batter batter swing you still missin
How you get a record deal You aint a DH
I aint a PH you just got lucky and made some contact
Now you wanna act pop fly
What the hell was you thinkin of
Knowin that my Glove show me love
You tried to play defense but still we made it
So you wanna bring your lyrics to the field and play it
Anybody make it rain then we will delay it
The Trackezoids always keep our Sports Illustrated
Somebody said wack MC thats when I thought of you
Let me tell you what you oughta do before I slaughter you
Go ahead and call your crew itll take at least all of you
To drop a article equivalent to this atomical
Try to spit your verse if at all possible
Cause when its my time to pass I call an audible
Watch the back black call me Barry Binary
Run with the tongue at least 20 yards per carry
Handoff bust through the hole and break tackles
Touchdown throw your hands up Im in the zone now
Instead of Icky its the Binary Shuffle  do the shuffle yall 
Whoever wanna scuffle better work on their rehussle
Cuz every song strong like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Jerry got the contracts on the table from the labels
Man just because they bringin home the bacon  see you later
I crave soul food without the pork flavor

  OneBeLo
