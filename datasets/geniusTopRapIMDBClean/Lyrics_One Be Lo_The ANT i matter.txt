The ANT  i matter  Lyrics
I draw more crowds and more pictures than McGraw
But more quicker
Than New York minutes
You forfeited
When the Beef is done I stick a fork in it
When it rains it pours
My brain got a storm in it
Spit a rhyme it shine just like a torch lit it
Same as the end of the world
Sinners get tormented
Daaamn
You dont come back no more get it
I Slam
You can let the door hit it where the lord split it
Wide open like the legs on a whore get it
Income  Incum  butt the Outcome is horrific
More vivid than King or Speilberg
Im bringing these real words
Like Damien I was born witted  with it 
You used to see me on the floor sittin
Now you see my face in a space where Elroy and George livin
Now you see me in Source and on a tour with it
Rap is a science you can study in ya dorms with it
Its heavy enough to forklift it
Ornaments a skull and crossbones you being warned with it
What you hearing is real
We killin ears in this field
But you probably thought the children of the corn did it
Who wanna test
Im the best
Im the OneZeroZero  100 
BelowGOD
The One equal Neo
The Black wearin villian
Or the white wearin hero
My raps tellavision
Sorta like Terrantino
Anything dealin with a speaker Im the key note
So while youre freestylin Im the one getting C Notes
The dope fiends needle
The dope mans Kilo
Now am I my brothers keeper YES I am Nino
But I dont need no
Coke to Blow I am HIRO
SHIMA on that ass
Comin fast
Im Libido
These ladies wanna gas me
Im already diesel
When niggas act foul like Shaq
Im the freethrow
The Only one can see Lo
The man in the mirror
I am He
I am We
These other rappers Coleco
Vision When you listen
Im the voice of the people
You want bars
Im not hard to find
I am Nemo
