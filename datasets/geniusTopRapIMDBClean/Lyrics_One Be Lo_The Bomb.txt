Its like a catholic word to the mother
UPS rapper at your door ringing your buzzer
With another special delivery full of drama
Sorta like you getting fan mail from the Unabomber
I hit a rhyme your mind is out in left field
You blinded by the sunshine you cant catch it
Your skills wretched you far from a Ken Griffey
I speak Jedi talk and Skywalk the force with me
This track lit me Im dynamite with the mic
I explode instrumentals my production is combustion
You a MC but Im more like a M80
Now which one of you jerks wanna see how this fire works
You crazy cause Im known to blow the set
Tick tick tick means I aint exploded yet
You whack crews is hit when my rap fuse is lit
I pull pins from grenades to write my rhymes with
Nuclear reaction from the crowd when I split
My rap competition like atoms like fission
Bomb squads try to take position
But I refuse to be defused so it proves to be a dead mission
Listen to this lyrical display
I blow your mind microphone Timothy McVeigh
A warning to you pilots leave your planes in the hanger
Cause terrorist attack fly at your track danger
Im a stranger never seen it before
This type of rap style is similar to C4
I combine with the rhymes like flames with gun powder
United we stand ignited we make noise
