What are you thinkin about right now
Right now echoes
The past specifically the days I remember
In mind body soul I was far from a winner
Poor sinner my fork in a pork dinner
Drugs sex alcohol Lo is not a quitter nor a forfeiter
A vagabond talkin back to moms sold dope out her home
Stole everything I owned  told lies
Ignored the old wise glitter caught my cold eyes
Didnt really know why truth is where the gold lies
What was present then past now
Had me thinkin thats how life was sposed to be for every black child
Strange words same feathers flock together
When the cops endeavor lock together better off a caged bird
Sight closed minded Lo find it hard to believe
I could lead by example I was so blinded
See every action has a consequence but then
I didnt beware or prepare or really care
If I thought about  the future  lets talk about  the future 
The children are  the future  whos ready for  the future 
What happens in  the future  we not promised  the future 
Only God knows  the future  the future  the future 
Lets think about  the future  lets talk about  the future 
The children are  the future  whos ready for  the future 
What happens in  the future   we not promised
Everyday is just an extension of yesterday
Now in the present day Im blessed to say let the record play
Usin my music as a movement to correct mistakes
Knowin my death awaits I hesitate to question fate
Boys and girls this world is nothin but a test of faith
So now Im plannin every step I take must be a better way
Deeply meditate on these ahead I pray
Seek to elevate bein lead astray flee the devils face
Evil separates reach the heaven gates  gates 
Easier said is the known rebuttal
The mind is willin but the flesh is weak peacepiece form a puzzle
Jihad means the struggle so I sacrifice
Satisfy todays seed could be a garden in the afterlife  afterlife 
Think about it  the future  lets talk about  the future 
The children are  the future  whos ready for  the future 
What happens in  the future  we not promised  the future 
Only God knows  the future  the future  the future 
Lets think about it  the future  lets talk about it  the future 
The children are  the future  whos ready for  the future 
Only God knows  the future  only God knows  the future 
Only God knows  the future  the future  the future 
Not the gypsies not the crystal balls
Not the fortune tellers not the horoscopes
Not the Chinese cookies you know them joints that you be crackin open
Not Nostradamus he dont know the future neither yknahmsayin
Not the palm readers not the psychics not those tarot cards
Not astrology yknahmsayin Stick to the program  yo

I heard the future was impressin when you doin some investin
Allah multiply 10 times one of your blessings
Quran full of wisdom it answer thousands of questions

Life humble essence wife operation stomach section

So many fathers exit dont bother this one is present
Even under pressure familys a treasure  follow my lead

So much I wanna say that I cant put it in pencil
Or verse just remember what I caught at your birth
A voice sure could show the world good works  good works
