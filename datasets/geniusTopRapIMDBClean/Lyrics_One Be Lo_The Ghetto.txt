Ay this is life man niggas out here talkin
Rappin about shit you aint never seen or had no parts in youknowhatImsayin
Shit aint cool man ay Lo take em where you from
Let me take you to a place where the sun dont shine
Killers dont talk little kids dont mind
Men dont work dont take care of babies
You bought my album but bootleggers dont pay me
City runnin wild cats dont give a fuck
Junior High students dont say no to drugs
Liquor stores dont ask shorties for their ID
This is a place where dont nothin surprise me
The ghetto
The ghetto yo
Now you can get shot everyday its a struggle to be alive
Mentally physically only the strong survive
Cant hide from the fact ghettos is filled with blacks  blacks 
Crack  crack  smack  smack  roaches and rats
Thugs totin they gats this aint a nice place to visit
The people that you live with hearts cold and frigid
That girl over there dont even bother with her  why 
Shes a hoodrat golddigger never had a father figure
Her older brother was a big time drug dealer
When he was young his role model was a drug dealer
Now that hes older everybody wants to cop a boulder
He took a bullet in his head now hes in a coma  bloaw 
You callin 911 this aint a joke
You rollin like a blunt cause you might get smoked
The sad part about it aint the money or the dope
The trigger man wasnt even old enough to vote
Shit aint all good in the hood
Touch mine wish a nigga would
You knowhatImsayin  In the ghetto 
Landlords dont do nothin but collect rent
Police dont patrol serve or protect it
Brothers dont allow others to hustle on they block
Always carry heat cause the beef dont stop
And it dont quit everyday the same shit
Hustlin to get you what your job cant get
And I aint even talkin bout a Benz or Mercedes  what you talkin about 
Im talkin about toothpaste diapers for your babies
The basic necessities of life
The homeless sleepin in a cardboard box every night
The only playgrounds is vacant lots and burned buildings
You gotta feel sorry for the children
How they gon do they homework when they homes dont work
They cant read books cause the lights dont work  nope 
They cant take a bath cause the water dont work  nope 
The stove in the kitchen plus the heat dont work  nope 
Its cold at night they mommas cant afford jackets
She too busy tryin to support the crack habit
The State took her kids now they all doin bids  man that sound crazy 
I know it sound crazy but thats how it is in the ghetto
The ghetto


All I see are hearts thats hollow from Detroit to Chicago
Just hopin you can follow
Shits real I know it sounds crazy
Shit its how it is how it is
This is a place where  Nothin surprise me
This is a place where  Nothin surprise me
