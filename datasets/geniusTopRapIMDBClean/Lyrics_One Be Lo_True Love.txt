Thats what I want to talk about this morning
Love true love unconditional love check it out 
Yo
Once upon a time he used to call the fellas and hang
Met her they said he was never the same
Started seeing them together like umbrellas and rain
You would think that spaghetti put a spell on his brain
This shorty was a forty on scales of one to ten
Tight midsection light skin complexion
Sugar and spice and everything delicious
Did I fail to mention that she payed tuition  not yet 
She said Im trying to get the education
So she could get a good paying occupation
Maybe with a big name corporation
Full benefits with the paid vacation  here we go 
She liked poetry said Ill read you mine
Ill never lead you blind or feed you swine
If you would be mine it would be sublime
But I still need some time for beats and rhymes
They would talk a whole lot about this and that
Which reminds me hop the broom stick in fact
Got her daddy thinking what kind of ish is that
But I guess he didnt know opposites attract
True Love
OneBeLo 
The way she walks with me
It must be true love 
The way she talks to me
It must be true love 
The way she looks at me
It must be true love 
The way shes hooked on me
It must be true love 
The way she trust in me
It must be true love 
The way she lust for me
It must be true love 
The way she stuck with me
But check it out If you find true love hold on to the end 
Conversation in the place integration we flossed with envy
You tossed and hit me in the slug like Ross and Ritchie
We solved a mystery Mens evolution and wars eventually
Involved in history barriers dissolved immensely
With all she gives me she got my back like a tail bone
Radiate like antennas on cell phone
And make it straight see when its time to display the truth
You get the point like a saber tooth
See in the mix we stand you seen in this tan hand
Behind the dissed pen hands its time to fix the plan
Cuz to her loves infinite but the future get ended quick
Beware all the moochers and benedicts
We made a mark like exclamation  explanation 
Her only expectation is love with no expiration
After 6 long years no longer a friend
So if you find true love hold on to the end
Sample mix  Find True Love X4
Hold on HoHoHold On X6
Yeah
Ever since I met you I knew it was special
Now Im just taking my time to make a chess move
Dont wanna violate that cuz I respect you
But soon as the weds through hand stroke your body like pet zoo
All over the bedroom down I never let you
More like up in the way come to the rescue
Used to have an ex who bought jewels and gems
But his money cant buy true love that wont impress you
Im talking love unconditional
If thats what you in it for
You could lock me down like prison door
But if your vision go to abide the superficial
Surprises do to diminish you to ride the stricted issues
Besides Im with you regardless of the hardships
My squad gets to spaces only reached by the star ships
Cuz Im an artist paint pictures a destiny
And your love is blessed to me when the truth sets it free
True Love
OneBeLo Hold on to the end X3
You know what Im saying
If you find that extra special person you wanna be with dog
Be afraid
You find that hand Hold it tight
Walk on the beach or something
Everybodys got love in their life
