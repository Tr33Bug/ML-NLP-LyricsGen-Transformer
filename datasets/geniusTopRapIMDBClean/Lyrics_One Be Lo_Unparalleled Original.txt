Unparalleled  Original  Lyrics
Its a matter of bombing knowing that I can do it
Everytime I get on the train almost everyday I see my name
I said Yeah you know what I was there I bombed it
It doesnt matter its for me its not for no body else to see
I dont care I dont care about no body else seein it or the fact that they can read it or not
Its for me and other graffiti writers that we can read it
All these other people who dont write theyre excluded I dont care about them
No they dont matter to me This is for us
We hard to the apple core raps galore at your door
Pull crowds like a magic sword excalibor
Travel north on a saddled horse on a battle course
Rap in codes tap in morse Lo never lack the force
You need to practice more you aint in my categor
I rap for sport Decompoze got my back support
Just pass the torch and of course I can rattle yours ask for more
The more the Marry  merry  get your raps divorced
Slice like a razor blade mix tape brigade
Raps erase ya data base snatch your flavor call you Gatorrade
Trying to get major paid like the upper class
You cant escape from the wrath sufferin succatash
Bust your ass with a duffle bag full of mustard gas
Fingertips equipped with a touch of class
We touchin fans we trust no man here comes the plan
All we need is just a chance we must advance
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Decompoze
One Be Lo ripping mics unparalleled
Trackezoids on the beats unparalleled
Subterranous hiphop unparalleled
scratches My beats and rhymes perfectly configurate  One Be Lo
Just clowing you circus acts and nervous cats
With gerber raps I murder wax similar to Roberta Flack
Killing you softly with every word no time for stress
Petty herbs get addressed like the gettysburg
A hundred miles and racing with a wild imagination
Even if I get the job halfdone its halfamazing
My only obligation Trackezoid collaborations
Go together like masturbation and ejaculation
Coming with accurate calculations configurations
Like the pyramids lyrically theres no equivalent
Michigan citizens shouldve been sittin in Switzerland
Listen to lyrics I roll like a michelin
Tired of rappers smoking phillies
Not really sayin nothin like Milli Vanilli my style Dont be silly
Dont need a filthy record deal people still feel me
Big willies hillbillies I rhyme without achilles


scratches from New Hip Hop by Binary Star
We keep it hot like the summer time when it comes to rhymes
What my tounge designed is nothin but thoughts from the mind
And Ive come to find most cats is deaf dumb and blind
So I gotta scat and get mines scratches underline
I hold my own weight most of yall cant say the same
Dont know the rules but still wanna play the game
What type of stuff is that Always trying to bluff a cat
Talking about your fake power moves I heard enough of that
Im trying to stay positive give it all I got to give
Retired with the wifey on the mountain ridge
Allah blessed with lots of kids grow old get burried on my right side
Everybody missed me but look on the bright side
I passed on the legacy through my wifes pregnancy
The family reunions will be more like a concert
CDs and TShirts HipHop collectables
Some cats couldve got hurt for acting unprofessional
Try to play me Glenn Close but you had the wrong one
Couldnt hurt me in the long run peep the song son
scratches You name it weve done it  One Be Lo
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Drop fades
scratches from New Hip Hop by Binary Star
When the beat drop
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
