Once again you are listening to 1013 WSUB
Im your host with the most CoolLoDee in the place to be
Whether youre moving your butt or cruisin in your truck
Turn the music up
We gonna get into this SONOGRAM jam by OneBeLo called Unparalleled
Cause no body does it like the SUB you dig
We hard to the apple core raps galore at your door
Pull crowds like a magic sword excalibor
Travel north on a saddled horse on a battle course
Rap in codes tap in morse Lo never lack the force
You need to practice more you aint in my categor
I rap for sport Trackezoids got my back support
So pass the torch and of course I can rattle yours ask for more
The more the Marry  merry  get your raps divorced
Slice like a razor blade mix tape brigade
Raps erase ya data base snatch your flavor call you Gatorrade
Trying to get major paid like the upper class
You cant escape from the wrath sufferin succatash
Bust your ass with a duffle bag full of mustard gas
Fingertips equiped with a touch of class
We touchin fans we trust no man here comes the plan
All we need is just a chance we must advance
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Magestik Legend
Now let me some hands in the air
OneBeLo
When the beat drop
Magestik Legend
You can wave them like you just dont care
OneBeLo
When the beat drop
Magestik Legend
We moving unparallel
If you feeling this well
That means somebody need to say Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Im just clowing you circus acts and nervous cats
With gerber raps I murder wax similar to Roberta Flack
Killing you softly with every word no time for stress
Petty herbs get addressed like the gettysburg
A hundred miles and racing with a wild imagination
Even if I get the job halfdone its halfamazing
Only obligation Trackezoid collaborations
Go together like masturbation and ejaculation
Coming with accurate calculations configurations
Like the pyramids lyrically theres no equivalent
Michigan citizens shouldve been sittin in Switzerland
Listen to lyrics I roll like a Michelin
Tired of rappers smoking phillies
Not really sayin nothin like Milli Vanilli my style Dont be silly
Dont need a filthy record deal people still feel me
Big willies hillbillies I rhyme without achilles
We keep it hot like the summer time when it comes to rhymes
What my tongue designed is nothin but thoughts from the mind
Ive come to find most cats is deaf dumb and blind
So I gotta scat and get mines underline
You lyin
Its raw talent no gimmicks no eye shadow
Keep yo costumes Im like hydraulics to shock value
Im not on clown labels Im black but not Sambo
A FuManChu swing karate chop samples
To body rock avenues while you shark mammal pop channels
Mock hip hop battles for stock capital
I can not help you lasso the black youth
Step into my classroom kid Ill take you back Roots
Ill give a Uncle Tom a shell toe with no lace
Im free from Amistad cant sell me no chains
I follow that mirage sell  boat til one day
I found the underground railroad the SUBway
