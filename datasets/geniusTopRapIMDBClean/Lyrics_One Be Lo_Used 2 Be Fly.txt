Hi guys clapping
Imma try to do a little poetry for yall  alright do it then 
This original piece written by me fly guy  alright 
And I wanna dedicate this piece to all you playas  yeah yeah 
And all you ladies out there  ohh baby 
I aint got no time for no games doper than your cocaine
Hiphop took a loss Im here to bring it back like Rogaine
Check it you know it aint no thing
I get inducted in the HipHop HallOFame
See me and mines ride the track in the soul train
Doin more things pullin mo strings than Alice Coltrane
We puttin in work cause gettin jerked is so lame
Thats why not too many people get to know Los name  they call me clever 
Call me clever cause I never say the same old thang
When OneBeLo came I made your hero change
See I was rockin mics when I had zero change  for real dawg 
Now I rock the mic and I can see mo thangs  this is real yall 
We used to blow flames  yup  now we blow spots like a tank of propane
What I do to wack MCs no remorse and no shame  no regrets 
Code name 00 James got you in range
My aim trained to blow brains  bloaw 
F what you proclaim
Seein me is like seein Superman when Clark is with Lois Lane
Or sayin my flow is lame when you know it bang  you know you lyin right 
Just because we dont play dont mean we dont know the game
Im tryin to get paid yeah Money it Aint a Thang
But life is more than drop tops switchin fo lanes
You was just another star in the astro plane
Your whole flow changed when your cash flow came
Your manager your label who your ass gon blame
When you used to be fly but you crashed your plane
You used to be fly but you crashed your plane
sample
I said you used to be fly but you crashed your plane
scratched I defy gravitation when I take off
See I speak up when I as soon as my foot hits the plane
I speak out  Hope the plane dont crash laughter
I tell you that boys a genius Im tellin you
Verse two I met her at my JOB
Everybody thought she looked like TBoz from TLC  she was FINE 
We was friends in the beginnin talkin on the phone
One time I spent a night ever since then had it goin on  bang bang 
Now guess whos movin in the crib with her and her two kids
Her crazy baby daddy on some Glenn Close shit  crazy dude 
She told me how he used to beat her and badly bruise her
Said if I was the man of her dreams this other kid was like Freddy Krueger
nightmares 
All men aint shit I felt like I had somethin to prove to her
Tried to stay faithful  I tried  tried to keep food on the table
Plus start a record label  damn shit  Im breakin my back
Cause I aint got it like that see I was only 21 and thats a lot of weight
To carry
Plus we wasnt even married
We had ups and downs yeah I made some mistakes
Now she all up in my face talkin bout she needs space
Confused and dont know who to choose
It was a blessing in disguise cause it opened up my eyes
It helped me realize that it wasnt meant to be
I guess she figured if she satisfied me sexually
Then Id be a sucker for LOVE
But guess what Im not a sucker for LOVE  hell nah 
And just because you got the good sex girl
Im out like Guru  girls look sooo good  exgirl to the next girl
Time go by Im still rockin the mic
I heard through the grapevine she got back with Ike
One day I see her at the store surprise surprise
She wore sunglasses  sunglasses  to cover up the black eye
Talkin bout she wanna give it one last try
Smiled but I could tell she wanted to cry
She said Think about it  I said Nah baby chill
You could tell I wasnt jokin by the look on my grill
She said Whats the matter dont you love me the same
I said you used to be fly but you crashed your plane
You used to be fly but you crashed your plane
scratched Shes not even worth it
You used to be fly but you crashed your plane
scratched Shes not even worth it
Nah now this aint a joint to disrespect you nah nah
Yo yo this aint a joint to disrespect you
