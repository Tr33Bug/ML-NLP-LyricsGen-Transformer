They told me to keep my eyes on the road
And my hands on the wheel I am
But Will I am not
NOT willing to trade spots
But if its Lords will
Come as you will
Let them Devils know I got a force field
And swords to wield
One day it will make sense
Somebody leaving Prints in BelAir
And I aint talkin Will Smith
Im writin this
Like a will with six mills
Whether im making millions
I gotta make six meals
So will I William Shakesphere
YES I will
When youre gone
Will or will not
Theyre stuck with your nick name Bills
Head spinnin like a PinWheel
Or wind mill
If you can make it stop tell me when
Will
The checks come and you got fired or layed off
And you aint even got the rims paid off
Im on the road again like Willie Nelson till the wheels fall off
Elmer Fudd said he will make the heat go off
And you aint Wheely twynna see no loss
Poppin off like a wheely and you will get your ego tossed
I still got it
You used to be fly but you Will Rogers
My heart brave and my Will Wallace
Like Christopher gotta gimme the loot
Got plenty rhymes to shoot John Wilkes in the Booth
Leave ya widow
Weepin like a willow
For many days
I will amaze
say Hey Kids like Willie Mays
Without a ball team
Without a will
Still a way
Heads bob or get slayed  sleighed 
I got a dog team
D Will get props throughout the verse
From KC to Williamsburg
Touring the earth
We conquer ya turf
Lo killin the verse
Like William the first
Lets buy a vowel
Wheel of Fortune flippin these words
I stand tall for all I wheel and deal fair
Nobody got yo back you need a wheel chair
With big wheels
I handle bars like a wheel barrel on construction sites carrying big steel
I got a strong foundation so I build towers
They say I couldnt I reinvented the WillPower
Im spittin like a real mc a Wildabeest
Spittin like a real mc a Wildabeest
One Be Lo do what I will I will da Beats
