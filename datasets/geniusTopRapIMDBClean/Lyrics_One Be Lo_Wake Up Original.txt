Wake Up  Original  Lyrics Hook 1 female vocals 
Its not easy this isnt how it oughta be
Cuz at the end of every day I gotta live with me
And no one else determines my destiny
So why bother trying fit in someones thought of me
Verse 1 
Never denied better than Clyde I glide from the three
Third eye verbal live certified with the beat
I drop one verse other cats be rhyming for weeks
Im thinking if he ever rest I be climbin his peaks
Rappers speak about how they packin nines and have beef
Pat em down thats the clown that be quiet in streets
Ask around blast a round he be cryin for peace
Ironically Im getting down five times to the East
Every time I release classic material
You get my cd for ten but Ill sign it for free
Capitalism have my children dyin for cheese
Damn fashion Grand Dragon be designin your jeans
Buckled pants saggin Uncle Sam taxing me describing the thief
Barcodes thats the sign of the beast
Now the latest pagan faces be the flyest MCs
Hands shakin like a mason with the highest degrees
Buzzin off the vitamin C no Heineken please
Gifted like the 25th dont have to light up the tree
Write it or free hip hop is private Ryan to me
Ayo we rude enough to bang it while ya laying asleep
Cuz itll wake ya upwake ya upwake ya up
Vocal sample  whats so damn important you gotta wake me outta my bed
Hook 2 female vocals 
See this world of big solutions for my eyes to see
I pray to god hell have my head and he will guide my feet
Stayin true to myself til my time to leave
Cuz sleepwalking it aint nothing but a crime to me
Sometimes I wish the pressure would just go away
But I know thats not gonna happen so this is what I have to say
Hard work sweat and blood stains did it for chump change
I didnt really complain cuz it was a love thang
Thats when I was a kid black now I know this fact
That love is gonna you evicted from where you live at
Home is where the heart is yours I open with facts
I strike like when I swing first and then you pitch black
Run around your diamonds and rings you thinking baseball
You thinkin in a boxn unconscious Im tryin to wake yall
Take yall from blind vision leave with divine wisdom
I ride rhythm never slide slippin my times tickin
I flow to the end used to hang mostly with friends
Now I keep my enemies closer than them
Cuz I know how it is when theres fear in the sky
The weather change hella fangs wanna tear in ya spine
Never really trust the cats that couldnt stare in my eye
No surprise yo even blessings wear a disguise
Sometimes Im riding in the hood me and my man saw
Some big teeth hands and feet yo that aint grandma
Big chains cars and clothes yo that aint hiphop
Spit ya flow backwards huff and puff your blunts but
Ya still aint big or bad enough to blow up my brick spot
Excuse me if Im on some bull psh  but fuck the flip flop
Im just chillin son building even at ya show
My hands deep in the pocket like Doug Williams means I wasnt feelin it

Awakeningsmake the dead come alive  repeat 3 times 
Hook 3 female vocals 
Its not easy existing in ought ta bes
Cuz At the end of every day I got to live with me
No one else determines my destiny
So why bother trying to fit in someones thought of me
