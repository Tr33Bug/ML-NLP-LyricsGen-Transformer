Yo you know my fame  who  you know my title  what 
Every rhyme I kick get it started like a motorcycle
Harley Davidson  every
Time I grab the mic I got you savorin the moment
Tell opponents that I play to win
Dont try to test me son leave you headless with the tounge
Restless like the Young knowin that the best has yet to come
Thats how the West was won
My content house you like a convent competition must be nunnone
I just begun get in line and take a number
Stay off the dick racin sometimes the boy wonder
Most of you MCs dont know Jack about Lumber
My rap chomp contenders like axe I yell timber
Im fat like the wife and like Jack Sprat you slender
Theres no comparison you got beef its probably tender
You still wanna battle me What for
I rock heads like Mt Rushmore fourfor dead presidents
Its evident I got it made
If you a slave to the rhythm you givin I freestyle like Honest Abe
For every promise made I fulfill with the skill
No matter what the doctor prescribe I stay ill
I can barely hear the track but Imma do it anyway
You put me on the stage with wack MCs oh shit
Thats like puttin piranhas in the same tank with goldfish
Hypnosis keep the alphabet under my spell
Sometimes I wonder myself
Lyrically can anybody test me
Exorcist please help me find what possesses me
I speak demonic ebonics into electronic devices
Leavin my opposition lifeless
My crew terrorize your whole town
Stay inside lock your doors dont be stupid like Nicole Brown
Word is bond yall
I got more Juice than Orenthal
So just acquittedquit it
Im takin out you suckers and you dont know how I did it
When Im on trial
Guilty as sin my murderous flow remains a freestyle
The only way Im goin to the pen is when
I slaughter with alphabetical disorder
BAD MC hit you with spellbound
Bust that wicked ass greyhound hell bound
One way ticket aint no comin back here
I drop bombs 365 black year
Jap style on ya Pearl Harbor rap style
Antisocialist I play the background
Spotlight operator aim at Yac town
If you dont know the time then its time to act now
