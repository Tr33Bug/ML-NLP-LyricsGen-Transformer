What its All About  Remix  Lyrics
You say you keepin it real it sound more like you glamorize
But what I do with mics you can only fantasize
OneManArmy swing it like samurais
See for yourself and tell me what you analyze
Search and youll find these lyrics I design
Be the greatest thing to happen to a button that rewinds
My styles plenty
Me without mics is like Luke without Force without MDs without 2020
Vision I see through your competition
You might be fly but Im a hawk youse a pigeon
My lyrical equipment like the stuff NASA got
You shoulda woulda coulda like them seven astronauts
You know you cant rock it what you grabbin for
Keep comin at me with that bull I aint a matador
Im just a microphone metaphor specializer
I blow your mind like a drunk driver with a breathalyzer
I recognize the fact that Im so phat
So when it comes to speech Im an exercise it
You in a wack crew and this is what you call terror
You carry dead weight you shouldve been a pallbearer
You disintegrate with time you cant innovate a rhyme
Wanna impress me son imitate a mime
I demonstrate the line thatll penetrate your mind
Let me emirate how Im gonna generate the shine
That keeps you squinting twice Im fly like Vincent Price
Disperse one first your thirst like Quentin Ice
With the flow freakin flip sines like cosecant
My shows your rose beacon when you know Compoze speakin
Step to me Im refereein like its foul two
But Ill do a style you cant barebear like Cal U
Now you is who Im against with the constant
Comments the content of my consonance
The consequence will be the first down like ten yards
Thats why I send hard emcees have been scarred
With my metallic D I want my space in the galaxy
So just remain calm like Mallaby
If youse a hiphop fan put your hands in the sky
Cause as long as we around hiphop will never die
It dont take a GED to figure out
That the SUB is what its all about
No doubt this is what its all about
No doubt this is what its all about
No doubt this is what its all about
No doubt this is what its all about
If youse a hiphop fan put your hands in the sky
Cause as long as we around hiphop will never die
It dont take a GED to figure out
That the SUB is what its all about
No doubt no doubt no doubt
This is what its all about
No doubt
