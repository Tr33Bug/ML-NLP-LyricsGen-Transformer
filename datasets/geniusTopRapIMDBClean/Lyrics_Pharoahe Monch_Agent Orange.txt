Uh cmon
Uh cmon
Uh yeah
Uh
Please Lord forgive me for my sins  Cmon 
My life is all I have to give
Please Lord forgive me for my sins  Woo 
My life is all I have to give  Uh 
Them youth have lost their will to live
Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn
I threw a rock then I ran
Cause I couldnt stand anymore within the grips of the man
Yall wanna ask me whos sane
These biological gasses are eating my brain
Its a political grab bag to rape Mother Earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged Dad for what hes worth
Thousandsll die now so millionsll smile later
This aint the Rockford Files nigga they stockpile data
From satellites where you discuss whose style is greater
In this killing pool you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When yall ready to rock like Led Zep then Ill cater
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
Whats your identity today
You on some John F Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh
This Hennessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity your life is the penalty to pay motherfucker
Yall ready to rock
We ready to rock
Yall ready to roll
We ready to roll
My life is all I have to give
Please Lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Them youth have lost their will to live
Trapped in the game just tryin to win
Just tryin to win just tryin to win
Its not a Vietnam song
I know women from Desert Storm who came back deformed
Missin limbs and disease in their legs and arms
Chemicals twice as strong as Agent Orange
lortnoc dniM  Its messages in the bass drum
War goin off in your mind no man is safe from
Its not a Game Boy Xbox or PlayStation
Its Resident Evil when every presidents a mason
Robbin yall fools like Dick Grayson
And yall inherited roots and you dont know how to retrace them
Place them back face them facts
Disgraceful faceless tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes the authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like Minority Report
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Catch me on the block in the hood in the trenches sayin
Yall ready to rock
We ready to rock
Yall ready to roll
We ready to roll
My life is all I have to give
Please Lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Them youth have lost their will to live
Trapped in the game just tryin to win
Yall ready to rock
We ready to rock
Yall ready to roll
We ready to roll
Lock load into positions
Rocks hold its primitive conditions
Lock load into positions
Rocks hold its primitive conditions
Lock load
Rocks hold into positions
