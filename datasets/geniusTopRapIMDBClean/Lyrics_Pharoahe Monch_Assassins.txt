In 2013 the World Government placed sanctions against freethinking individuals in order to force people to adhere to one way of life An independently funded organization called poh pih evas nac ew dna eerf rof cisum gnidaolnwod gnikcuf pots hired one hundred assassins to infiltrate the headquarters where files were kept Of these one hundred ninetyseven were captured tortured and executed Only three remained The third of which was said to own an arsenal that would rival an entire citys police force The second was rumored was to be able to move throughout space and time And the first  One 
Fasten your seat belts for the last of the three assassins on earth
The first flashing her purse with a heat stealth
They call me Jean McCoy beast in me employed deploy deplorable
Through audible destructive actions attractive decoy
Then pass to the Troy after Im passing your life over
Hell deliver it through river Styx Hades Im cold deliberate ladies
My foes limited pray me some praise  Whispering 
Stay on your toes villains its Grae and your days whittling  Hey 
Blistering lines packed in six stick to spine
Wracked with a sick mind trapped in thick bitch frame
Drug you with strychnine in nine drinks you drunk
And its my kidney you dick brain Im just itching to slit veins
Stitch lines Rick James fuck yo lives sip brains bitches
Niggas kick rocks or kick rhymes its to the pain
Liquorriddled liver sieve in it sipping it like Capri Sun
Ignant as ever shes clever equivalent be none
A ball breaker call fakers out with passion
You got the gall bastard to brawl with the broad brashest
The balls in your court pass it but warning fall faster
Than asses with age slack on the back of a Kardashian
The walls crash in you all on the floor gasping
The gas pour in the corridors racking your jaws blacking out
Catch Grae backing out the back door cackling
Still make it back to the bar for last call
Two 
They ask me why Im highly regarded this God body probably
Monch is a mixture of Marcus Garvey Miles Davis and Bob Marley  Radical  Never skateboard slang like gnarly more like
Weed in my whip on the way to get top like Charles Barkley
You are hardly prepared to spar with a marksman spark me
Im Gambit with the ace of spades a master in archery
Vehicular particularly the vernacular
Specifically the fit so when I spit it its spectacular and accurate
When I attack Im more legend than Acura
Flip Bloomberg the bird bitch more blood than Blacula
More Crip than cryptic scriptures
Encrypted with backwards vernacular
Plus sicker than most like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction
I am that nigga for real per capita
Smacking the next rapper that uses the term swag or thereafter
These three assassins get to ass whipping
Prepare to for a professional ass that can
Shape shift spit hollow tip clips mainly
Sick aint he Mind control
Make you shoot your best friend in the face Dick Cheney
My life is like a documentary film depicted in black and white
Flicks grainy  Geronimo 
Im on Guantanamo Bay taking pics in a Captain Morgan pose
With my left foot on a pile of detainees screaming
We are renegades Fuck you pay me
Two Where the fuck no Where the fuck is Three
I know I know Hes gonna be here He gave me his word trust me
Yeah but he does this every time
Hes gonna be here trust me
Hes gonna ruin this mission for us again
Look here he comes now
car crash 
I be riding round with a stripperslashburlesque model
I make it pop like my cock in a Durex condom
Im a opposite artist I find irony in going
From being like a stone in the grass to rocking the Garden
The same irony as going from fully automatic in the backyard
To having a whole machine behind me
I take my Australian bitches show her some other thangs
She know my stroke is deadly so she gave me bloody brain
Dont try to get familiar if I dont feel you in person
Ill flip the script and Ill accidentally kill you on purpose
The bad is what Im flailing I got so many furs
PETA gon paint splash me when they see me
No matter what Im wearing
Your bitch about to open up sniff some blow off of my dick
Guess you could say she on my coconuts
Im on point like Chris Paul
You on point like an Atlantic City hooker that licks balls
Im bout to flip in this bitch like Dominique Dawes
And shut shit down like a car when it stalls
I am the deadliest rapper you claiming that you flow like water
But really yall niggas Evian backwards
Marshall hit the jackpot with this flow that I got
I know when Im hot its my show to stop holding my crotch
My whip cleaner than Amish men in honest ends
Two dimes with me like Im a twin cause Im a ten
Okay Im in
