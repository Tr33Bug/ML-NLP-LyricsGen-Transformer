Totally intoxicated when he drove across the state line
Rapper gone insane story on Dateline
Lost his wits didnt take his meds
When they pulled him over this is what he said
Im a Bad MotherFucker man  shut your mouth 
Well we talking about Pharoahe
Mashing in that Aston Martin on the Verrazano Narrows
Greatest of all time in the latest apparel
80s baby ladies crave me on some Mercedes shit
Go tell your favorite rapper eat a bag of baby dicks
They keep singing the same ol song
Im a bring em the pain for saying the name wrong
Got me going insane Ima ask you again
Who put these pussies on top
Putting out that pussy music call it pussy pop
Playing them pussy games sucker shit
Fucking around but they dont know just who they fucking wit
x2 
Im a Bad Motherfucker man
Universal worldwide you know my circle
Renegade on the mic I might just murk you
Putting in that work cause I do work every verse is a virtue
The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars
The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired
When the truth walked in the building every liar retired
Deception was defeated and deceit became deleted
Uh they mad cause they cant stop me
Cause I said fuck swag I got moxie
Lyrically ecstasy I got that oxycontin poppin
They cant carbon copy or mock me
Reign independent off the books
Off the chain off the hinge off the hooks
Its not a game Im not a rook
Yall Know The Name you love the look listen
