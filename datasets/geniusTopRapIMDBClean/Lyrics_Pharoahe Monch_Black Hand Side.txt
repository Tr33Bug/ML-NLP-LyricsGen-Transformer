The great Pharoahe Monch yo
Yes sir what up P
The great Styles P the ghost
One two
I say open the door and let me in
Teach us all preach ya sins
Turn the cheek let it slide
Give me five on the black hand side
The black hand side oh
The black hand side oh
The black hand side oh
Give me five on the black hand side  Give me five brother 
Ill tell you what I see through the black mans eyes  Look at me 
Fly chick in the Cadillac a black man ride  Ride 
But every different day a different black man die  Damn 
Shorty momma tripping off of crack mad high  You know 
Now he watching TV loving the bad guy  You know 
Pisspoor with a Welfare check he know he African  Pssss 
Cause he aint get help there yet  No help 
Now he put down his knapsack got a crack pack
You dont overstand if your vision aint abstract
You dont overstand 
Me and the projects a lot of us is lab rats
Voted for Obama hoping he wouldnt have that
Dont have that brother 
Now I can tell you that I felt hell  I felt it 
I still remember how a cell smell  I still remember the stench 
I still remember how the pigs act
Family crying up on the VI I couldnt dig that
Open the door and teach us all
Pass a blunt around hoping that it reach us all
Now give me five on the black hand side  Give me five bro 
Ghost and Pharoahe Monch watch the black man rise  Yep

Give me five on the black hand side
The black hand side oh  Give me five bruh give me five 
The black hand side  Give me five bruh give me five 
The black hand side oh
Pharoahes a Navajo chief the way Im making it rain
But never for a stripper with emotional pain
You wouldnt despite the system nourishment for the brain
Cause rain sea plus soil equal fruits and grains
My hood told a nigga keep it simple and plain
So let me explain the game
Break it down a couple levels like Tetris
These younguns kill they own blood for a necklace  Gimme that 
Leave slumped over the wheel of your Lexus
Smoke kush wake up and eat breakfast
What the fuck he expect
A generation overly obsessed with mobsters
Our revolutionaries won Grammys and Oscars
Impostors fake auras or weak chakras
Makin a mockery of the music to be pop stars
And they say Im insane
Because I see the remains of the whips and the chains
In my hood where it aint all good
Peep the pain of a single mother she struggling
Young child slain give me five on the black hand side
Lets maintain like its Soul Train
And keep it movin together Im saying
I say open the door and let me in
Teach us all preach ya sins
Turn the cheek let it slide
Give me five on the black hand side
The black hand side oh  Give me five bruh give me five 
The black hand side  Give me five bruh give me five 
The black hand side oh
Yeah   Give me five bruh give me five 
Styles P  Give me five bruh give me five 
Uhhuh Pharoahe Monch  Give me five bruh give me five 
Yeah uhhuh  Give me five bruh give me five
