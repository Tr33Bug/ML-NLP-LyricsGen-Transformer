America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister separated my brother
Murdered my children hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said Never
My minds too sharp my brains too clever
My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy
Plot  gettin my money like the Kennedys
Flip it  put em in stocks collect indemnities
Rock  roll behold my epiphanies and
Read em and weep heat em I beat em to sleep
Mislead em til we even Steven defeat em with freedom of speech
And let em know that Im the motherfuckin firestarter
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort whats real
Only truth will set you free
Id rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
We dying over black gold they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous they starving in Sudan
Its obvious you walk a blind path to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses its medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
Youre caught in the mainframe Ive seen the maze man
They watch you from the street lights you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
Youre lost in a strange land no thoughts of a game plan
All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort whats real
Only truth will set you free
Id rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta
Piss on the Constitution then burn the Magna Carta Carta Carta
