Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Wouldve opened my eyes if I wouldve known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That Id turn around and be broken again
2x 
They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin
She rescued me my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep I would tie a shoestring
Tap five times to find a vein in there
Squeeze 7ccs so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So I guess they just wasnt seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
Im relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it wont stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But its so hard to learn
