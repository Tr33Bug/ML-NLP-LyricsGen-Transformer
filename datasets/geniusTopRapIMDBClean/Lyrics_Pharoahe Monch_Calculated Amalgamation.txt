Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Uh
I was determined as damaged psychologically
But still managed to gain a new perspective on the term
Surround yourself with greatness
Found myself standing in a room full of mirrors
But even my reflections disrespect you
Like a freshman during hazing  What an amazing assessment 
The police booked me for Booksmarts
But who the promoters book now
Raised the bar so high that the bars afraid to look down
Spent nights in a casket at dawn Im a king
Play pawn to a queen put her throat in the tabernacle
So actually you should build a statue
Of my likeness in the center of your city
Your women riddled it with rose petals 
No justice no peace no settle
We are renegades fuck your gold medal
The people are the majority
You cant survive without us you need us
Attitude never defeatist
Rebels so please believe its
War on the streets of Egypt
My vocals a total eclipse of totalitarianism
You seek to mistreat us
So this is calculated amalgamation
One shot fired inspired by hope to arouse a nation
I  I am the renegade
