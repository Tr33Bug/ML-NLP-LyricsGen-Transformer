Clap  One Day  Lyrics
You should never in your wildest dreams shit on a nigga
Police eat a dick straight up you know why
Clap  clap on clap off
Clap at them and I do not mean applause  Nah 
Rap nicer than Santa with no Claus
Track twice as bananas with no chorus
Uh yeah its suicide murder
In the hood like catalytic converters
On the block like Lego in the streets like street light
Three Little Pigs is what I be on these beats like
In other words the police say it say it like Pac the police
Fuck em and thats straight from the underground
Where little kids got it bad cause we brown
Now who am I PMonch from Do or Die
Nah South Suicide Queens where I get down
I peep surveillance in the street every summer
You may not play lotto but you know these numbers
The 105th the 103rd
My peoples in Queens doing 13 if we get the urge
To get on some Todd Scott shit my brains a Glock clip
My lames be on some 1800COPSHOT shit
Say we were gonna say we were gonna get it together
Yeah yeah yeah
One day one day one day one day one day
I said the people gon clap
Watch me clap to this
We went from niggas to porch monkeys to negroes to blacks
Back to niggas again yet niggas is still hungry
Abolish the Nword the plans so corny
While Homeland Security cams are all on me
They watch through the fiber optics it dawned on me
That cops can just run in your spot quick without warning
They educate the masses to follow its so boring
I sat in the back of the class asleep snoring
And they ask me why Im vocal and adamant
Cause I lost my focus like Governor Patterson
And the ghetto is impossible to escape
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen
Spearchucker fuck that I toss javelins
And fivethousand dollar bills in the face of James Madison
This is an American postmortem
To focus on you bogus Novus Ordo Seclorum clap
Say we were gonna say we were gonna get it together
Yeah yeah yeah
One day one day one day one day one day
I said the people gon clap
Watch me clap to this


Now everybody watch me clap
No respect no manners its Mad Max with multiple macs
Mad banana clips and a black hammer
That hits the back of a black talon
A slew of hollow tips through the wall of your blue silence
And selective theatrics collective dramatics
Im systematically pissed clap automatics for Mumia Abu Jamal
Maybe Im Crispus Attucks
Ps a fanatic for peace but you angered a pacifist
The Gospel I spit it like Jesus of Nazareth then emphatically clap
At any obstacle an impossible feat the fathom is not logical
But chronicle the thought of the people
Cause one day we gon clap
