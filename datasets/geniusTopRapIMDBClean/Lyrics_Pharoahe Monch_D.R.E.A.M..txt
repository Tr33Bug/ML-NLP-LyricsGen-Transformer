DREAM Lyrics
Pull myself together put on a new face
Climb down up the hilltop baby  ooh I get back in the race
Cause Ive got dreams yeah dreams to remember
Yeah yeah Ive got dreams oh dreams to remember
Help me out
Yo my destiny rules everything around me dream get the money
Dollar dollar bill yall
Everybody put their palms in the clouds get your hands in the sky
So its not a problem to feel yall
Even if I was broke as fuck I would lend you my last so you can holla at me still
PMC in the place to be on the MIC still spitting that real
Yo you know the limericks are limitless not limited in sentiment
But increments of infinite potental in the scenes
You could benefit from getting off of the internet
For just a minute its a simple song
You could sing or Memorex I meant mimic it
When it hits the spirit it pulls the heartstrings
Infamous and kindred its intrinsic when its still in us
From the genesis when we remember to dream just dream
That means you 
Ive got dreams to remember
Ive got dreams yeah dreams to remember
Help me out
Yo my determination runs every aspect mentally Im no dummy
This scholar got skill yall
Cant take what I visualise from it you pull the wool over my eyes
I swallowed the red pill
Even if I was broke as fuck I would lend you my last so you could holla at me still
Everybody put your palms to the clouds get em up in the sky
So its not a problem to feel
Welcome to the Age of Aquarius in the stages of various schemes
Precariously I escape when I dream
Each scene should win an Academy put it up on the screen
My strategy Pharoahes the king of Queens
Who fiends for teens to view it as the new theme music
Use it to shape their futures when they daydream to it
Never elusive never claim stupid
Lucid boost your recruits when you sing to it and just dream
That means you 
Ive got dreams
You know Im down right excellent about my scrilla get the money
Dollar dollar bill yall
I got you strung out on the music so Im sort of like a dealer to a junkie
Swallow that pill yall
Sometimes it rains in Southern Cali and Philadelphia aint always sunny
Just keeping it real yall
Talib Kweli in the place to be yeah you better believe
Come on you know the deal yall
Five oclock in the morning just getting home from last nights performance
When Im dead tired from touring I hit the coffin
Im like a vampire required to stay dormant
Out of the range the sunlight with a doubt itd remain
I used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain
I took a break had to find lifes meaning again
Without the smoke in my lungs I started dreaming again
I dreamed of candycoated cars and panties that go with bras
Hurricanes named Sandy Im floating on Noahs ark what
Policell bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns  thats ridiculous 
The truth is Im one of the best
And when you snooze thats when you meet the cousin of death
So when I say I never visited the cousin I dont sleep
I stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep  dream 
Ive got dreams to remember
Ive got dreams yeah dreams to remember
Help me out
