Ooh listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage damage damage damage
They cock them hammers wave them llamas
But thats that in front of the camera drama
So when the cameras are attached to dollys I call them dali lamas
Mold me loathe hold me in the palm of your hand load me
You know exactly what I am murderer
When Im inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
Its the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter the martyr
This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity
Profofofanity when they manually hammer me annually
You dont figitty faze me yo
I wont tigitty tase you bro
Figgity fucking cut you in half like its nothing minus the laser scope
Then I will ring your bell like Avon
Before displaying some of my various tattoos  Trayvon 
The  Oscar  award winning  Aiyana Jones  hey  Sean 
Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
Fuck a stray bullet I take aim when the gun draws
For everlasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder ask any vet Ive worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus
Ooh listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage damage damage damage
Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver  TWIST 
Scratch your name off my calendar
See that was me thru a silencer
What you just heard was a 44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause Im willing to flip
See Im sort of certified Im fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what Ive seen
Horrified holy Bibles rivals vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies bridal gowns coffins
Morphine gang bang gangrene slauson swap meet
Meet greet pop I dont sleep I dont stop
I love hate hate cops
Thats why I laugh when you pull it
Im motivated and crass
Im so elated when I see them on the news  you fuckin pigs 
They flying the flag half mass
See theres no need for conversation
When were discussing the bullets point of view
Ooh listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage damage damage damage
