Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Oh  Oh  Oh
Said its my desire yes it is yeah
Yes it is yes it is oh yes it is ugh
Comprehend the guidelines
My chest out chinchilla all relaxed on the sidelines
Im so famous understand
New York City respect my game like Joe Namath
And I protect my name like your anus
In prison yall dont hear me yall dont listen
Yall just wanna shine yall just wanna glisten
Floss knowing that the soul is still missing
Who am I  Im the poetical pastor
Slave to a label but I own my masters
Still get it poppin without artists and repertoire
Cause Monch is a monarch only minus the AR
When my brain excels your train derails
Pop shit make you feel The Clipse like Pharrell  Woo 
You will feel me you will admire
My  Struggle  My  hustle  My  sole desire
Oohooh oohoohooh ah
Said its my desire
Yes it is yeah yeah
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Oh  Oh  Oh
Said its my desire  Hey heyyeah yeahyeah 
My book is a ovary the pages I lust to turn
My pen is the penis when I write the ink is the sperm
Desire the fire that ignites the torch to burn
This is not rocket science  This is easy to learn
My mics the gavel when I talk courts adjourned
Respect even if you was ashes you couldnt earn
I embody antibiotics you are infected with germs
Raps fatally ill please get concerned
Players pick turns to play get burned
I color commentate the game like Chick Hearns
This is the moment of truth for my opponents and liars
Vocals alone invoke the emotion of Black choirs
Fire you dont wanna get burned like Rich Pryor
Move back whos that there The livewire
You will feel me you will admire
My  Struggle  My  hustle  My  sole desire


Oohooh oohoohooh ahah
Said its my desire
Yes it is yeahahahah
Its my desire
Keep pushin keep strivin  Myy yyy ohoh 
My passion my fire
Thats my desire
I keep pushin I keep strivin
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Thats my desire
Keep pushin keep strivin
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh
Thats my desire
Keep pushin I keep strivin
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh
