Desperate wait for those in a desperate situation
Homeless and hungry
Having stands displaced reliant on aid
disaster may be unfolding right now
It has been hit by a  earthquake
Yes how many gorillas who actually killers really rhyming
Artists that actually signed still killing
And when it comes to killing the mic theyre not willing
And Im supposed to be shook Thats the shit that kill me
Take the bullet for Barack on the balcony then vanish
Extinguish the sun when I drool play pool with the planets
We are renegades the movement outlandish
My shit straight from the soul goddammit
Its the one time only vernacular original
Miraculous spectacular flow computer digital
I piss upon the pitiful ridicule the minuscule
Pharoahe Monch need to park that ass like municipal
And listen to an enigma
The anomaly your momma nominated me phenomenal
I dominated without a sixpack abdominal
You could get 19 put through that like Amadou
So what Ima do is separate the false from the truest
Youve amassed nothing trying to ball like UMass
So phenomenal with mics I dont like myself
Sadomasochist MC I bite myself
But not cameo though theres no Grammy to show
For the love that people hand me on the street now overstand
Grade school mathematics examining thugs
They discuss Bloods Crips techs jammin and drugs
I speak of world peace war famine and flood
Watching Pans Labrynth while Im unraveling bud
Gambling on the next rapper to die in the hood
If God shall choose that artist to be me
Let one verse of a song be a reflection of a pedigree
Better than your back catalog recipe
The legacy by which the entire world remembers me
Quote do not edit me let it be said
Im top five all time  Alive or 
We know thats misstated and so overused
So heres an overview of why Im six feet over you
And a million fans think this statement is so overdue
And pardon if it sounds a little wheezy
Not Wayne motherfuckers I got asthma its not easy
Shotgun lyrical cock back squeeze me
Women case my anatomy touch me tease me
Please seize the moment in the struggle against Lucifer
Renegade 13 the Executioner
Spit with a crucifix
So that you can expect a rant from Pharoahe Monch like Mucinex
Get used to it get used to wisdom
Get used to usage of a backward euphemism
