Oh oh oh oh
Ohohohohohohoh
Free free free free
Free free free free
Free free free free
Free free free free
You can clip my wings shackle and chain me
Back straight standing tall a child of God and Im free
Spit in my face hold me down
Imma keep my feet firm to the ground cause Im free
Yeah your ARs a house nigga the labels the plantation
Now switch that advance for your emancipation
MCs in the field like pick cotton for real
I pop blocks like Beat Street with a notch and a kill
They take the strongest of slaves to compete in a track meet
For the king of the city sang songs of back streets
Choruses of cocaine tales and black heat
Only to trade niggas like professional athletes
Dont take that merchandising snatch that publishing
Package that black ass ship you to London
By way of France Germany Dublin
A railroad to underground like Harriet Tubman
While yall stay struggling we smuggle MCs through the streets
Til we bubbling on mix CDs hustling
Klan see me on the block and say Freeze
I say Fuck you Im a man Im free
You can clip my wings shackle and chain me
Back straight standing tall a child of God and Im free
Spit in my face hold me down
Imma keep my feet firm to the ground cause Im free
Okay yo I give birth to verses in churches with no confession
So please pardon my postpartum depression
Alist MC to spit it in CSections
For immature minds that get it with each lesson
Threefifths of a man ass jigga with no plans
How you discussing publishing figures without a band
They got digital codes on our music for them to scan
So even when you sample a snare you paying the Klan
So Google Pharoahe Monch search triskaidekaphobia
Ill explain why these city banks watch over ya
Ill peep the future in my sleep to be honest man
We never had a mutual relationship with Washington
Why Because I believe they put the virus in the latex
Condoms that they sell us call it safe sex
What I spit not only causes a glitch in The Matrix
But another listed terror threat that they aint even faced yet


You can clip my wings shackle and chain me
Back straight standing tall a child of God and Im free
Spit in my face hold me down
Imma keep my feet firm to the ground cause Im free
You can clip my wings shackle and chain me
Back straight standing tall a child of God and Im free
No you cant define it
Youre blinded by the light when I rock the mic cause Im free
Got you sick with emotions drink this potion
DJ MC free like the thief in the night
Brown skin ready to win if youre prepared to fight
