I said I aint gangsta even though I grew up in the hood
I just wanna feed my people so misunderstood
Struggling  Struggling  hustling  Hustling  trying to make it right
I just wanna spread the light to help us free our minds
Well oh yeah you are now in tune to
www dot fuck them motherfuckers radio
Where you will only hear the real shit
E Pluribus Unum allseeing eye ocular exam
The Apocalypse back by popular demand
Innocuous but still leave a stage
With blood in my hand for the populous
Put a fist in the sky
Licensed to kill italicized into my ID Iraqi Illuminati
Haile Selassie karate John The Beast Mugabi
King Jaffe in the lobby with the fur made of a lion
The eye of Horus Mount Zion vibrant
Prominent constellations of Orion  Whoa 
The reason why my stars are in alignment
The renegade an Allahu Akbar rock star
Tossing homemade grenade CDs at NYPD cop cars
Just to get the revolution to pop off
Fraudulent stock funded with Louis Vuitton knockoffs
Hijacking helicopters detonate your metropolis
While Im in the cockpit politicking like Stephanopoulos
And my esophagus is quite atomic when I vomit
This is bioengineered ergonomics
The formula truth divided by innovative ebonics
Times Goose lime crushed ice and a splash of tonic
Nigga my past lives are astronomic
Smoking hash in a cathedral with Nostradamus
At mass discussing Martin Luthers Free at Last speech
Step on my British Walkers get your ass beat


I said I aint gangsta even though I grew up in the hood
I just wanna feed my people so misunderstood
Struggling  Struggling  hustling  Hustling  trying to make it right
I just wanna spread the light to help us free our minds
