For no formidable fights Ive been formed to forget
For Pharoahe fucks familiar foes first
Before fondling female MCs fiercely
Focus upon the fact that facts can be fabricated to form lies
My phonetics alone forces feeble MCs into defense on the fly
Feel me for reala
Lets get the skrillas out the hands of these gorillas
Make the whole world feel us
From the crack to the cap peelers
To the niggas in the back shooting craps with the axe wielders
Relax til its time for the immaculate miraculous
Thirteen ow The illest
To all my niggas who been shitted on lets get it on
Dick Im gonna let it hang and sit it on
The desk of any redneck record exec
I strike em with the right hand send em a step
And this is
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell incest kids under pressure
In the corner clutching their genitals by the dresser
A hundred CCs of the uncut cleanest
In the vein twentyfour hours of intravenous
To the left we have rightwing extremists
On a screen a man exposes his breasts with no penis
My team is probably just as raw as Lady Saw and Chaka Demus is
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
Hell  this is 
This is this is this is this is
This is this is this is this is
Yo yo I feel like Im one of the livest
One of hiphops finest elite rhymers
And I plan to graduate with honors
But one day well all be a bunch of oldtimers with Alzheimers
Lookin at our labels roster
Wonderin how the fuck they forgot us
After we done recorded dozens of albums
And made em hundreds of thousands of dollars
They still dropped us
We givin niggas what the fuck they want
A Holocaust stompin niggas with a thousandman march
I aint livin in Hell Hells livin in me
Thats why Im always screamin on you fuckin MCs
The shit that I quote float with the buoyancy of a boat
With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose thats extremely fatal
Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you
You cant breathe your chest feels painful
Your skin colors goin from dark brown to beigeblue
Your whole room is full of angels
All in your ear tryin to tell you which God you should pray to
You pray to Jess but he dont wanna save you
Cause you unfaithful so he gives you to Azazel
Youre paralyzed on the operatin table
Prayin for Canibus to slice you from head to navel
You banned from TV banned from CDs
Banned from DVDs and downloadable MP3s
