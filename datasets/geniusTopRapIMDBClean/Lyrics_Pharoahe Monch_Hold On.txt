Youre beautiful you know that Uhhuh
Do you know that Yes
You do Uhhuh
You know when those kids tease you Uhhuh
Dont you ever worry about that because youre very beautiful
Do you know youre beautiful Uhhuh
Are you ready Ma I love you
I love you
He pushed down and called her black and ugly
She asked Why must you tease me
He laughed at her said Youre from Africa your hair is peasy
Your skin is dark and greasy and plus you are so beneath me
Please trust me it wasnt easy for Diamond it scarred her deeply
Plays like a Fender bass
To myself thought how much does gender play
Rememberin such hatred at this tender age
If I could send a mental page my thoughts would end the rage
Reminiscent of the looks to her in class I gave my eyes would say
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain  No more pain  no gain  No more pain 
Please be willin to fight for your will
Despite writings from William Lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium
But died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling it quenches
A thirst and a feeling thats endless
The prize like a rain that wrenches the soul
And cleanses your mind from white picketed fences
Heads up your ass splinters in face mentally ridin benches
The masters pastors disastrous but fascist bastards
They crafted this hazardous plan
That still has us broken and battered
We shoulder the struggle with the weight of a boulder
That muffles the sound of provocative thinking
The pieces of puzzles incompleted only deleted
To be pushed to the back of your mind
Like a hairline that has receded
Now we repeated the process but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress its obvious the soul is gone
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain  No more pain  no gain  No more pain 
See now Diamond is priceless
Timeless how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world it reminds me of Isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from UV rays in this negative time of crisis
Like a knife through butter slices
Easily to anger she reacts pious
Like a cell protecting itself from a virus
Twice is strong is her demeanor now she is righteous
God is what you see now when you peer inside her eyelids
Hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
If you hold on thingsll change
So come on be strong
And hold on Im sure
Theres so much more to live for
As you grow strong thingsll change
No pain  No more pain  no gain  No more pain 
Youre so beautiful
You can change this world
If you want to girl
Oh ooh
Now come on hold on
Grow strong
