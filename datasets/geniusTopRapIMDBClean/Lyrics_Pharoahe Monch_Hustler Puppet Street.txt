Hustler  Puppet Street  Lyrics
This here is cocaine city
Got four dames with me in the slow lane
Coupe Deville so hard
They told me they want to sniff some unemployment lines
I gave them equal opportunity blow jobs
Menace to society
Drink a flask of Bacardi fast crash claim sobriety
Still pass a polygraph
Nina in my right hand her cousins on the night stand
I aint never work a day in my life for the white man
I am the most imaginative pimp
Slick sentences diatribes defenseless
When soliloquies set in its like cyanide
Lord I have tried to learn these hoes
But they are hard headed so god please let it be known
That Im a hustler
Im glad we could make it out
Youre so cool
Youre so cool
And it hurts now
Kleptomaniac they used to call me Lefty
Poppa was a rolling stone the streets is all he left me
So now its better when I jettison
Jet set jet ski cool out
You know man kick back Jet Li
I even use to sta sta sta sta stutter when I talk
But now the cops know that I bop with a ca ca cane
When I be walking up the block
The way they jock my whip I call it Secretariat
Various horses inside my stable its hilarious
Scavengers live vicariously thru the hustler pimp
And bottom feed  SKRIMPS 
No woman is exempt  I hustle so that I can see weed
Scrilla deceased commanders and chiefs seaweed
Liberal I do not discriminate with customers
Its the shit you couldnt sniff if you was Mr Snuffleupagus
Stay after that green bitch Captain Kirk muscle up
Or eat a knuckle sandwich cause I will never struggle
Im a Hustler
