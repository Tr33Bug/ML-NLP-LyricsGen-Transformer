Intro  Internal Affairs  Lyrics
Introducing the star of the show
Bring it on if you think you can hang
Represent one time time time
May I have your attention please
What you are about to hear is undoubtedly
The most incredible MC of the year
Nononono no wait no please no wait no listen um
All that I wish to do is to display
A brand new rendition of style that I have
Itll only take a moment of your time four minutes
Then it will be beneficial when it is replenished
But then again you might never return
To the shit youre hearing on the radio get burned
I have a dream one day we will get to the promised land
Then the president will be me
The government will be Shabaam Mos and Kweli thats it
All wackness is now banned obtain access through retina scans
Voice verification enhancement
The man who moves his hand and will motion light detection
For genetic confirmation DNA verification
Access Pharaoahe Codename 13
Residence Southside Queens Armed and dangerous and 
Smack the nigga in the mouth stabbed his mother in the eyeball
I brawl like Mike Tys in his prime
My advice you think twice before you grime
Cause Ill wink once  one time  your bitch is mine
Cause shes feeling the flow best believe Im drilling the hole
Heads high kill em with the low
Revealing chilling filling up position to be killing the show
Stopping em on top feeling plus Im grilling the dough
For a couple of million or so Ill be willing to blow
Pharoahes a chameleon
A million niggas are feeling em on the low
Every syllable of mine is an umbilical cord through time
For the sick typical niggas who choose to pick pitiful rhymes
Spit shit its more dimes to get
More higher levels of spirituality to reach
And Im trying to win
Refuse to lose
Refuse to lose
Refuse to lose
Refuse to lose
