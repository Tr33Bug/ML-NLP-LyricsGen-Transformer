Spit miraculously sip Draculas blood exist for centuries
The body chemistry mends wounds heals injuries
My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin
Ha I push the envelope like US mailmen
Ha we need a leader who is not mischievous
Devious from Satans grip to lead us
Wont retract the facts then act facetious
In fact the raps are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us easily leave MCs speechless
Read from the palm of the nonbelievers
Sell em they wondering how they become underachievers
One of the best of the perennial keynote speaker
My guidance you want it come get it so Ill flaunt it
And I will show you a way to let my people go today

Ill knock your ass unconscious
Put it up on YouTube then film the sequel
So its free for the people huh
Go on ahead and download it Ima teach you how
P is a prophet a pastor a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
Im trying to learn your monkey ass Im trying to reach you now
But still youre like Whos this dude
Return to fix shape the game like Rubiks Cube
Chicks see hes brolic now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax what he chooses to do damn
Open your eyes man youve been bamboozled
By the usual plans hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If yall are telling me todays music is suitable and appealing
Then Im telling you the feelings are not mutual

Let my people go
Ill make you feel so good you dont need to wonder
Let my people go
Ill take away the storm cloud the rain and thunder
Let my people go

Young children pull your pants on up
Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt
You need to let all the people go
Pass the collection plates and give me all of my dough
And if youre wondering whats under my robe
An old rustyass 38 snub nose
And just because youre thinking that my shit dont work
Thats a gunshot
Go on and try robbing my church
Im too high to get over too low to get under
Let my people go
