One for the money two for the show
Three to get it crackin in the hood lets go
My rhymes pop like them nines they claim they tote
But they rap lackluster shine
My shits busts like Busta Rhymes sniffin lines of coke
Wooha  Ha thats all she wrote
On the quest to qualify for these inquisitive quotes
Quirkass MCs be as queer as folk
Talkin about Nigga can rap No shit Sherlock
Yall MCs cant see me like Matt Murdock
Im the pinnacle rhyme kid
And any line of mine is criminal minded
And I blind her with original rhyme shit
Fall in line with the sick cynical grime shit
Clinically approved for you to move your behind with
Timeless all world girls wiggle their spine to Pharoahe
Do you need to be reminded now
Stick em up its that get em up its that
Put em up its that lets go uh
Yeah how we rock show them how we roll
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Lets go 
Line em up light it up fire it up
Wire me up let it blow
One for the money two for the show
Three to get it crackin in the hood lets go
They research my stem cells clone ten of me
Send one of em back in time just to get rid of me
Stop Pharoahe Monch from having verbal epiphanies
Now thats new definition to your own worst enemy
Ock listen man stop snitching man
You use sex to sell your Nextel to Sprint
Everything you represent is immoral singular not plural
You and your sidekick get rid of that whack trio
I freeze MCs zero degrees below
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
You need to get loose to the heat I produce
From Long Beach to Boston
Your chicks text us like Dallas and Austin
I spark tireless illumination
Fire sixteen bars wireless communication
Lets go


Yeah how we rock show them how we roll
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Lets go 
Line em up light it up fire it up
Wire me up let it blow
One for the money two for the show
Three to get it crackin in the hood lets go
Show them how we rock show them how we roll
Yeah yeah yeah
Show them how we rock show them how we roll
Yeah yeah yeah
Pharoahes flows blows shows
The MONCH MONCH
Yall know the name  Lets go 
Hallelujah Pharoahe Monch will do ya
The MONCH yall know the name  Lets go 
Line em up light it up fire it up
Wire me up let it blow
One for the money two for the show
Three to get it crackin in the hood
