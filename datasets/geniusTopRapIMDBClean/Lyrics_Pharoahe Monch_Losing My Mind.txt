A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls thats hard to climb
Im losing my mind
No medicaid no medication
Thinking youre better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder
Would someone explain whod leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon Im screwed saw more war than Warsaw Poland viewed
An infants insides outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship ungodly
Out cries tears Dear God where are we
Thats what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash if i could only put the past on a flashdrive Id
For peace of mind install an external drive
So Id be more driven internally to survive
Im
A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder on my revolver 
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
I spin the cylinder on my revolver 
My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void I defected employed self annoyed
Went independent enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rents cheaper in the ghetto but you cant go back
So I spin the cylinder on my revolver
Then maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues Ill do it for medical science
Its better to be levelheaded than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sunshine never vibrant Im
A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I can see through walls its hard to climb
Im losing my Im losing my mind
