Ohh hear me though
Theyll bury me with my SP1200  For sure 
Fuck the trinity inseminate the earth now take its virginity
In my vicinity rap is like energy pack
Sending me back behind enemy line to rap too melodic
Melodies never melodramatic
But hypnotic like cellos for fellow fanatics
I fiend for who fuck wits inappropriate
Fill em with so much lead Ill call Berger and Associates
This rhyme will remain in the minds of my foes forever in infamy
The epitome of lyrical epiphanies
Skilfullyplaced poems and carefully planned symphonies
Who would be ignorant enough to have the audacity
To fuck with the likes of I and my tenacity
This is what you get when you fuck with the likes of
The magnanimous flows of total assholes and ignoramuses
MOP slash Pharoahe Monch cause damages
The advantage is we banish artists labels and managers
Amateurs found six feet deep in metal canisters we
