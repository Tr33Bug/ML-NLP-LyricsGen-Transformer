I live my life one day at a time
Hold my head so I dont lose my mind
Sometimes you might fall down but you get back up
Get on your journey yeah keep on

I walk by faith and not by sight
Done pushed my struggles endured my pride
I fear no man I know wrong from right
We push until the day we see the light
And we keep on
Pushin

You weakass CompuBox power shots miss and fly over me
My accurate jabs connect like rotary
Make you notice me be like Damn dudes awesome totally
When he rides the bass line like Ginbili
Imvocally unmatched globally
With the flow so underground but more public than notary
Push in this era of GW Bush
We must load mental ammunition and bust
Thus Ima hold you down I got you
One more repetition Ima spot you
This is for my blue collar workin beer guzzlin
Bootleg DVD sellin keep hustlin
Push if you represent the struggle then push
Peep the pieces of the puzzle and push
Never let em place a muzzle just push


Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Push push push push push push push push 
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Push push push push push push push push 
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
