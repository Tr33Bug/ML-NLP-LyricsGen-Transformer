Theres a place I know where the bitches go
Where they rob you for your dough and chill on the low
In Southside
Queens Queens
Where if you say The Ave
People automatically know the path
You dont have to do the math
In Southside
Queens Queens
I knew this nigga named Donovan
Astonishing the way he used to handle the pill God  Word 
Let me speak about the way he used to dribble off his knees
And in the middle at the same time guzzling a beer
Like a puzzle or a riddle discovering his path to the hoop
Scoop shot tipped up the backboard oops
Son got hops never knew he wouldve grew it
Cool nigga when it came to school he blew it
A scholar in acute niggarisms and metropolitans
Kids hollering Yo Donovan hey come around the block
Youngest of three sons fucking with coupons and refunds
Food stamps still he was a champ
Time to get loot for boots and kicks now
Fuck hoops gotta impress the chicks now
His mama said Donovan why are you
On the corner of Linden and Guy R Brewer
He said Mama listen close Imma tell you one time
Youre killing my high plus I got a nine  What 
All I be doing is putting in work
So you can get a brand new dress for church
I know the Devil lurks outside man its cold
But I dont wanna get paid slow and grow old like Papa
Plus Im on parole I gotta
Get paid off the streets to make ends meet
With the back of her hand she smacked him in the face
Walked out of the cribpiece pissed with no taste
That night rocking Nikes eating Mike and Ikes
Slapboxing with a dyke on a bike too small
Thinking This time next year Mama be able toOhh shit
From across the streets niggas approach  Slow 
Well get the metal out too late the guns flash
In the melee they wet him like Reggae Sunsplash
Son dashed with the quickness back into the ride
With a smile on his face the picture of pride
Blood coming from his mouth now Im at his side
Kneeling over Donovans body before he died
Eyes fluttering up and down in his head
And with his last breath this is what he said
He said Why
Why
Then I closed his eyes
Theres a place I know where the people go
Where you could catch dough and chill on the low
In Southside Haha
Queens Queens
Where if you say The Ave
People automatically know the path
You dont have to do the math
In Southside
Queens Queens
And if you got a Glock you could bust shots
Like Todd Scott when the block be hot
InInIn  What we talking bout 
Queens Queens
Ugh cmon ugh
Cmon ugh ugh
Its New York right
I know where people go
Where you can cash dough and chill on the low
