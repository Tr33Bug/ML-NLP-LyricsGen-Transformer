Uh ah uh ah uh
Its not Latin or white or black music
Its that cooked up coke ccrack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe the rap duet
Its that lucid rapid eye
My think tanks like a piranha tank think multiple bites figure
Mega reality tera giga
Grand Theft Auto modern day Mickey and Mallory
Small but Im sick enough to walk into an art gallery
And piss on a Picasso crack statues
Rub my balls on a Banksy shit on it and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face after he rinsed his eyes no wait
I actually grew five times my size
Grabbed Mae by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now thats practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle and practical rap with wisdom
Actually its pragmatic capitalism
For actors that crack under pressure and collapse when I get em
Monch is medicinal manmade medical marijuana
With a phase plasma rifle like Im searchin for Sarah Conner
And shortys got brains shorty not playin
From 40 blocks Im a killer with 40watt range
With an arrangement of bullets that Ive arranged
Encrypted in scriptures specific individual names
That shall remain anonymous
Me and the ammunitions in a relationship thats monogamous
Its like Im married to the silencer
Until I file for divorce and release my excalibers
Do art with your arteries place that for my adversaries
Push your snapback cap back cap your capillaries like
Its not Latin or white or black music
Its that cooked up coke ccrack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe the rap duet
Its that lucid rapid eye move
Vocally twice as magnifying as ever hearing Chewbacca scream
Through a megaphone with the significance of Dr King
Philanthropic cause Im trying to see
Man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy
The opposite of Mephistopheles eye inside an isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities
And nobody can copy me stop Its not possible
But probable that its only philosophical mockery strange
Change copper to gold switch properties bang
Stay on top of the globe flip monopolies aim
Take stock in the soul spit properly
Take stock in the soul spit properly
That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
Im diabolical follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze
Sending shots to ancient Greece to pop Socrates
I bear arms like buttondowns without the sleeves
Manic depressive and possessive like apostrophes
My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen quit watchin me so I can breathe
National Association for the Advancement
Of drugs for performance enhancement
And its tough taking so many chances
But Ive been a bad seed from the womb they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart although Im totally handsome
And I take the love of your life and hold her for ransom
And my tactical cam that never stood for any national anthems
Whats hood I am the actual answer
And Ill prove it black attire rapid fire rapid eye movement
Im from a species that is higher I am not human
Extraterrestrial alien a monster
Killer of conscience chillin in a barrel of lobster
Exslave sadomasochist that gave the massa my ass to kiss
A dyin breed Im the last of this
Black is as miraculous as Jesus of Nazareth
When I vocalize the crowd rise like Lazarus
Its the Rhode Scholar my coat collar piss off PETA
Your hoes holla hes on top of the bars meet a
Mr Globe Trotter in my Adidas pure cheetah
Hoppin out of this exotic European 4 seater
Hollerin cheeba cheeba like Im Parkside
Killin is the dark side villain Im God Im Godzilla
Sometimes Im Bob Dylan put blood on these tracks for real
So Godwillin youll feel what Im spillin
Yeah I never quit Im still syndicatin up
Me and Pharoahe Monch did it for the benefit of us
This is straight razor behavior I never get enough
Get the picture my militia gettin ignorant as fuck
Yeah its suicide murder
Straight from the underground through the fiber optics
Pharoahe Black Thought complete the cypher
The movement outlandish
Its not Latin or white or black music
Its that cooked up coke ccrack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe the rap duet
Its that lucid rapid eye movement
