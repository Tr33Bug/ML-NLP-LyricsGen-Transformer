Comstock cell block shit cops are minimal
Rock your snot box top notch watch for sentinels
Hide like Sasquatch squat the revenue drop
Pull out Glocks hot spot pop your genitals  Pharoahe
Generally a general for generations of jams generated for criminals
Retractable claws cut country club cardigans
Both parties party with me bipartisan
Kick start a starter kit pull out dick on a charlatan
In Harlem when youre romancing these hoes like Harlequin
Listen my cockll leave em in a coma
But the Glockll leave you messy like you play for Barcelona
You are now working with a renowned
Master with mastery over conjugated verbs and nouns
Yo you are now working with a renowned
Master with mastery over conjugated verbs and nouns
Go
Civilian sings I drink I lean
I see dead people when I dream
This war with self is so extreme
Sometimes I think I need to  scream
This war with self is so extreme
Sometimes I think I need to
Scream scream scream
Press your luck fuck a press kit press cant harm me
But chest presses a deadlift bench press zombies
Hysteria rap burn the flag fuck America
Start the revolution poison the water with malaria
Fuck it I came back from the war of scorn
Like Uncle Ruckus throwing bananas on the White House lawn
Cryptic anarchists spit that apocalyptic dark shit
Communists radicals racism Marxist
You couldnt possibly wanna lock horns
Spit holy water on your throne wearing a crown made of thorns
Ouy Kcuf  just thought I should say that
Every rhyme is like a time bomb strapped beneath your Maybach
Cop the range stop the strange lock the game rock the chain
Stop the train smoke a fag pop your brain
Unless you can inject me in your arm like a narcotic and squeeze
Please never say my name in vain lets go
