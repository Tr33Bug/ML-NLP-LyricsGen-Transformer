Simon Says  Remix  Lyrics
Get the fuck up
Simon says Get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky  Bobobobobo 
Queens is in the back sipping gnac yall whats up
Girls rub on your titties
Yeah fuck it I said it rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm the witty
Yo shut the fuck up
Luck said Shut the fuck up
Bitches in the back like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked smacked the fuck up
Pull the truck up Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shitting on the game
I suppose what youre spitting is flames cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal I could smell the douche powder
Summers Eve I drop degrees chill
Come four by four lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly till you get airsick now thats ill
Two choices either squeeze or peel now thats real
What the fucks going on here Just a minute now hold up
Sinister with it the time I diminish him finish him roll up
When Im in a cinematography state of mind
My rap trip rip flip clip say the rhyme
Shit I spectacular run hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow back track to the immaculate
Binaca blast nigga thats fast son Ill box you
Ladies rub the tatas bras titties and knockers on the floor
Oww 
Fellas pull your cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for thirdround knockout
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from his fam
He dont know how to behave now
Drag his ass bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a niggay twentyone gun salute
Thats seven shots for 2Pac seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
Hows that Fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin Monch aint a damn thing changed
Yo yo get the fuck up
Funk Doctor Spock said Get the fuck up
I got a bitch named Nina and I tuck her
I leave a nigga hanging like your moms muffler
Snuff her then my boys follow up
Respect like The Fonz you see the collar up  Ayeeee 
I spit out a bullet load the barrel up
I kamikaze your town off a Arab bus
Karat cut yeah mami pull over
I bend your pussy like for years I knew yoga
Im too smoked up I cant remember me
Off Hennessy thats why I carry MiniMe
I need fifty feet when my performance starts
I push an armored car with Lowenharts
Nineteen inches Im not on the charts
Doc turning dark off a warning shot
Drive off and pop six in your hood
Fuck the limelight we rhyme tight plus snatch the goods
Yeah yeah my nigga one rhyme and you fold over
Im hotheaded cause I walk with cold shoulders


Yeah get the fuck up
Simon says Get the fuck up
Throw ya hands in the sky  Bobobobobo 
Jersey in the back jacking cars now whats up
Girls rub on your titties  Yeah 
Thats right I said it rub on your titties
Brick City gritty committee pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm the witty
Yo yo get the fuck up
Yo yeah I said it Get the fuck up
Walk through Shaolin after dark you get stuck up
Seek and destroy baddest boy when Im puffed up
You know my name and Pharoahe Monch why we came what
We off the chain plus we plotting on the game what
Know your role by the way tuck your gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions everybody got to have one
Shooting in the sky trying to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin they hate us with a passion
Mashin still fresh in threeday old fashion
Youre plaid Im stripes together we be clashin
Heres a Tunnel banger
WuTang death penalty the gas chamber
This gon hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap you like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me the same way Ima feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still Imma still be
Underground and filthy gotta have our way like the Milky
Innocent until Im proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice raider ruckus
Underground til we under ground
But yall first motherfuckers
My thugs throw up your set
And shorties rub on your breasts
Get the fuck up out of that dress I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like Jeeps on mountain cliffs
Ill rip through your chest hollowpoint talon tips
DoubleS double the threat double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like BIG you sound like Jay you sound like D
And I bet when I go plat youll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq injure your fleet instant delete
Yall crabs are weak frail like a fiends physique
I stay on the street stay on the beat stay with the heat
Stay sticking fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link dummy shouldve insured that link
Straight to Canal appraise that link then pawn that link
You froze up Sahdeeq says Shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gunbutt up and tied up
Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Been thuggin lovin the way we flood jewels for nothin
Lay it over another ambush and take over
Yo we dont only get money we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right especially if its late at night
Or find your picture of your autopsy up on the website
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip Ill leave you with a fucking fat face nigga
Busta Rhymes the handsome Ill hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house Ill forever live in a mansion
Bitches snitches coming out and you know whos showing it
Like when the British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Yall niggas is seamless blends of seamless friends
Lip on about the results of a bunch of seamless ends
Colossal me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honchos getting this money like Leonardo  Dodododo 
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit thatll rebuild your whole selfesteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fucking area
Wild in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know whats good for you nigga
You better get the fuck up
