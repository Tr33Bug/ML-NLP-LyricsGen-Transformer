If speed is what you need
If progress what you want to possess
See when the system get you down
You got to just stand
I am just one man but I know my power
Its the final call were in the final hour
And we must not divide as we march toward our future
Who are they to decide when they conspire to shoot yah
Ahh that couldve been my mother
Ohh that couldve been my brother
As sure as we circle the sun and the earth revolves
Get involved get involved get involved get involved
Stand your ground
Theyll say Ive lost my mind claim that Im psychotic
Hes a fucking traitor hes unpatriotic
But I learned in life truth it must be slated
And I know my rights theyre unalienated
Descendent of the blood of slaves
Used to be the one afraid
Until I learned my souls divine
Amalgamate lets combine unify get in line and
Stand your ground
