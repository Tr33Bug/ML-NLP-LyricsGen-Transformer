Yeah uh okay
Yeah uh
Call me the hitman its kind of hard aint it
What most feared wed become in the game we became it
So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted
Its not a lithograph so its graphic frame it
The hitman  Say it again 
The hitman
The hitman  Uh say it again say say 
The hitman
Some people say Im extreme
Broadcast a beam live through a meme
Screaming as Jimmy Iovine as corrupt as Don King
Boxed into the ghetto to be champions of bling
Industrys the arena the internet is the ring
You train audible queens to sling music to fiends
Then Def Jam supreme team the same thing
Except more critical now its digital cocaine
The goal to control every individuals brain like
Cadillacs for contracts in the 60s
Now its rap til you 60 for contract 360s
The trick switch the degrees with the three sixes
Artists are left with zero you know who receives the riches
Which is the reason why theres only a few moguls
Globally the pioneers are left in a chokehold
Enough to make an individual go postal
Watching these old folks get fucked for their vocals
Call me the hitman its kind of hard aint it
What most feared wed become in the game we became it
So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted
Its not a lithograph so its graphic frame it
The hitman
The hitman  Uh 
The hitman  Say it again say uh 
The hitman


If you are not performing fellatio for radio rotation
Whats the ratio for radio play at your station
If youre not paying to play the record is dead
Puts a whole new spin on Radiohead
They got a thousand plays a week and we selling the same units
Put their best rep up they couldnt stand next to it
People wanna relate they wanna connect to it
Heres a lyrical check is this enough for you to flex to it
Huh Or do you need more clues
Should I be more black would that change your view
Should I dye my hair blond should my eyes be blue
Just a couple of questions I mustered up for you
But these elevenandahalf shoes you cant fill those
I make headlines like corduroy pillows
And probably get banned from television and marketing
Targeting music industry politics provocative
The hitman its kind of hard aint it
What most feared wed become in the game we became it
So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted
Its not a lithograph so its graphic frame it
The hitman  Say it again 
The hitman
The hitman  Say it again say it uh 
The hitman
Its kind of hard
Lets release sex tapes so we can become stars
Nude photographs of titties and asses
Increase our buzz impress the masses
I thought she was supposed to be so passive
Now you just another ass in the end with an asterisk
Cellphone songs you will never be classic
You sold your soul they call that remastering
See why does it have to be so drastic
Chemical skin peel makes the song more plastic
Follow the program man stick to the tactics
Twelve to eighteen you know the demographics
These kids want popcorn they want slapstick
Probably the chorus goes tisket tasket
But Im not willing to risk it and mask it
This might take a couple of listens for you to grasp it
The Hit
