It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground I was like Ohhhhh shit
Shes off the hook
I would dress her decently but look her body is immaculate
Im attacking it from all positions of thinking inside my mind
Hopefully it wont be too inappropriate if I walk over there
And say Excuse me can I have your number please
Ill get on my knees if I have to
Shell laugh through the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked down
No cockblocking please this ones mine
Dimepiece and shit son shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldnt lie I swear
Sparkling the whole time as I whispered in her ear
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
Now some say Im a little bit of thug slash bboy gentleman
But let me introduce myself also begin
So that you can further understand what I say
I took this last swallow of the Grand Marnier
And slid her to the dancefloor now she like Wow
Oh damn money got style
Funny how things change when you got a little liquor in you
Youre quicker with the tongue giving me rhythm now huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns lets blow this joint
Its pointless to stay here so let me anoint
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
We kissing and we wrestling sexual confessions
I never lack to pack prophylact I learned my lesson
First impression to be discrete use discretion
Back of the cab undressin uhhuh
Im here with you sort of like a bond spiritual
All night all I could do is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Aliz on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away nothing to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
Im her horizon right but in the night though
Night glow type shit
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
And I know you will see the light baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me darling
And I know can see the light baby
Once you understand
What what you mean to me girl
What you do no doubt check it out now
Now I know you can see the light baby
Once you understand
