Yo Busta Rhymes the imperial lyrical you heard
Kill like the one syllable word
The criminal of the lyrical killing you pitiful
Niggas leaving you in a critical destroying your mineral
Back when I was scrambling in front of the deli
Live on a celly which was in a street whipping on shiny Pirelli
Now every millisecond I try to reckon with niggas for jacking
Like they really thugging I aint even checking
How niggas could try to act like they really them foul niggas
Fucking with now niggas better bow niggas
For moderation niggas going to hibernation
While I legally chase the situation of hyper nation
Now that we credible I require a busy schedule
Collecting federals being put on a pedestal
While we clean and we keep on your feeding you know the meaning
Start to holler and screaming until your stomach start bleeding
The next millennium rap now everybody listen
Condition yourself to be knocked out of commission
Watch out cause this is a new world transmission
