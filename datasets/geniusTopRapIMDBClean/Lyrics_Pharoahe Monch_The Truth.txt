Yo truth had me up against the ropes
Semiconscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxidil
Watching the clock is ill when faced with the truth parallels
Observing amateur video tapes of
Twentyone topnotch NYPD cops get ill
Fill their minds not to kill still some never revealed true feelings
Me speaking on the truth right now in itself is a healing  Uh 
See the Creator created existence and balance
At right angles unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truths offcourse
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path enablin truth
To stay stable and cling to Earth
Sort of similar to the way static electricity sting  Come on  see
Truth brings light light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never be clearer
The truth is that you ugly
Not on the outside but in the inside
On the outside you frontin you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden
Thats the truth  Uh uh 
Thats the truth boy
In due time we will find
See it everywhere gotta recognize  Uh 
Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle where must one go to find it
Time is real we cant rewind it
Out of everybody I met who told the truth Time did
We find kids speakin cause its naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin us we born sinners
Venders of hate got me battlin my own mind state
At a divine rate I aint in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper the eyes of my nigga
If its only one then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonder why I gotta drink a sixpack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive cause niggas got to live
Said I gotta give more than Im given
Cause truthll never be heard in religion
After searchin the world on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth
Truth truth truth  Yeah 
Truth truth truth  Mm 
In due time we will find  The truth is 
Check it
On my neck I still got marks from the nooses  Uh 
The truth it produces
Fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis  Yeah 
The truth is my crew is the smoothest spitters of saliva juices
Like The Roots is more organic than acoustics  Uh 
Heavenly what will set you free and kill you in the same breath  What 
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death
Unless the way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
Cause the truth give the words the weight of a planet goddamnit
I ran with what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be to bring some light to the dark breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth  Why 
Cause we keep marching on  True 
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin on  True 
You cant see it if you blind but we will always prevail  True 
Life is like the open sea the truth is the wind in our sails
In the end our names is on the lips of dying men  Uh 
If ever crushed to the earth we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there its just the heart you gotta find it in  Find it in 
You will find you will find you will find
You will find you will find you will find
You oh
