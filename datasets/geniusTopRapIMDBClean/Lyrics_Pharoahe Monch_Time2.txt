  2x 
Lord lord lord
Well well well well well
Help me cleanse my sins
Help me lift this spell
We fight demons from our past only to face new monsters
I ask are we comatose or unconscious
My top spins perpetual make the connection
You sleep cause reality bites inception
Protection orders for my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Molested Mexican daughters stretch across the border
The streets paved in gold often fade
When the paint they use to pave the streets is henna
And greener is the grass on the other side
Except for when that other side is geno
Or sewer  suicide  you smile while you sippin a cup of Kahlua
That makes me wanna mainline a fucking fifth of Dewars
Im trying to utilize my time to shine here
I realize we only have limited time here
Dudes on my line tryna sell me a timeshare
Thatll be me with a nine losin my mind in Time Square
Like Is this how you wanna treat me
You know what this business was before you hired me
A piece of shit
Everybody on the floor right now
Everybody get the fuck down
Lalalalast yeyeyear they hired me
And thissss weweweweweek thethethey fired me
And I ggggot all these bbbbbills to pay
And what the fffffufffuck am I supposed to say
Ttttto my wife shes pppppregnant
And if the kid does not go to college his lifes irrelevant
And mymymy melaninnnn makes me a felon
Andnd I just wanna take this fuckin cccrack and sell it
To the planet
Panic Im a manic depressive mechanic that manages to frantically do damage
To his brain with Xanax and its like the word anxiety is branded panoramic
To the back of my eyelids in a variety of fonts
Ariel Bold Gothic
Lost it in Time Square and going home is not an option
Is this illusion optic
Perhaps its just a chemical reaction with my Zoloft and acidophilus
The section of my brain that forms sentences isnt operative
Danger Danger Danger Will Robinson
A bizarre ride Pharcyde Fatlip Collagen
My tolerance is volatile and it feels like Im losing oxygen
