I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may now kiss the bride
Act I
Cops comin shots fired
Babies cry I cry
Wishin I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin shots fired
Babies cry I cry
Wishin I could change what
This is just my life
God why is my wife bleeding
Sheet covers her face paramedics are leaving
Behind her clothes its apparent shes not breathing
Im a little confused about what it is Im seeing
Plus theres a naked man on my lawn
Police in the living room with all of their guns drawn
Out and the last thing I remember is
Uh last thing I remember is
I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cellphone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a sixpack of ODouls and some soul food
Yeah and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it cause my wife isnt back from her trip
I sneak the gifts into the house and shell never expect it
Except that though
Cops comin shots fired
Babies cry I cry
Wishin I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin shots fired
Babies cry I cry
Wishin I could change what
This is just my life
Act II
He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killing him wont make it go away
Its only gon bring more pain
I tied his hands behind his back to the nightstand fast
Ropes made bruises on his lightskinned ass
See I can play games too
Yeah thats what I told him when he came to
Now look see what the game and the fame do
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck man we grew up together
RunDMC tougher than leather
With the same outfits fortydeuce
Takin flicks like What Shit
Why did you fuck my wife man
You shouldve took my life man
I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead I saw red he said
muffled talking
Now was it worth it man
Was it everything you imagined was it perfect
He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killing him wont make it go away
Its only gon bring more pain
He put the gun in my hand
And told told me to go take my revenge  Take my revenge 
Killing him wont make it go away no
Its only gon bring more pain
Act III
Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have to hold to love to cherish but
Death did us part what a coincidence
Now perhaps the police will be convinced that it was an accident
If Im accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker says passing up my residence
And to believe those files set a precedence
From the start it shouldve been obvious it never did
Prevalent the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And the sadistic way you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art
And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
Threesixtyfive days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how I would achieve the murder would vary
Were closer than ever together well be buried cause
Evil eyes that bide how they go you so much
Why do we what did they see
I just lost control had to let you go
I cry cause slowly you try so slowly you die
Buried alive in the grave too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me come to find out
An old friend of mine she sleeping with committed the crime
In the past three years switched identities six times
And all the while Im devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishing checks and royalties
She thinking its true love hes scamming her for the guap
Got alone to devise my own intuitive plot
Put the prose on him launched the probe on him
And I haunt him pen him get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted
Guess we all bout to murder tonight
Miss Pretty Brown Eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce the keys to the crib
Youll find under the mat in the front of the house
Just do it word out
Evil eyes that bide how they go you so much
Why do we what did they see
I just lost control had to let you go
I cry cause slowly you try so slowly you die
