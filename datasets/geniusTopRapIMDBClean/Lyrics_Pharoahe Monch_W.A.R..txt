WAR Lyrics
Okay
Yeah
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army motherfucker this means war
I got a middle finger for mass media mute the news
Cause When The Gun Draws received a million views
Which gives me the right to break the rules
Say fuck radio if the people cant pick and choose
While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
Its not brush fire rap its five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions mysticism call me Mr Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
Cause when you sick and in bed youre indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated the water got lead in it
Population control make the babies sick
RFID chips RU486
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime said
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army motherfucker this means war


Alhamdulillahs a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
Its not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves you cant tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
Its not your average rap recording
This is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimulis supplied by my endorphins
The minds eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
Its not The Doors man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executives rooms where they walking on all fours man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine spreading the H1N1 flu
On some rabies shit RU486
Population control make the babies sick
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul sort of a psychological dictatorship
And I am on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime
We are renegades this means war
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades never slaves this means war
Onehundred percent uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army motherfucker this means war
