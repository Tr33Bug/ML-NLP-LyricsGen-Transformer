voice being scratched 
In a time when were spending billions of dollars
In a war to control oil in Iraq
Threethousand soldiers have come home in coffins
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq civilians have lost their lives
Our brothers and sisters in New Orleans
Are left homeless and hungry
They murdered Sean Bell
They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury
And its time to say no more
No more No more No more No more
I got so much trouble on my mind refuse to lose
Heres your ticket uh
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black attack
So I sat and japped then slapped the Mac
Now Im ready to mic it huh
Hear my favoritism roll oh
Never be a brother like me go solo
Lazer Anastasia maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way Im livin forgiven what Im givin up
X on the flex  Hear me now 
I dont know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man Ive had it up to here
Gear I wear got em goin in fear
Rhetoric said it read just a bit ago
Not quittin it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin jerked
Changin some ways to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause its comin from the heart
What I got better get some  Mmhmm 
Hustler of culture
Snake bitten been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin
Respects been givin hows ya livin
Now I cant protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An international wreck played off as some intellect
Made the call took the fall broke the laws
Not my fault that theyre fallin off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the terrordome


Come on down  Get down 
You can get it get it get it get it
Come on down
You can get it get it get it get it
Get down
You can get it get it get it get it
Theres a hole in an apple an apple has been rotten
Scheme like the Klan I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme screen writer slick street editor
Drop the LP and he hit like Hezbollah
Seven years later its the year of the Gods
United States government is just a facade
The Catholic Church got ties with the mob
I see it all like The Wizard of Oz
Now theres a yellow brick road the fame riches and cars
If you only had a brain you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation cut your education
Secret information world domination
Take over reservations trigger the energies
In the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes in the sky hidden observation
If youre over sixtyfive theyll take away your medication
Like Give me that  Give me that  Fall in line  Fall in line 
Go to war  Go to war  press rewind
Cause when I get mad I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin that you never had
Controllin fear of high rollin
God bless your soul and keep livin
Black to the bone my home is your home
Well welcome to the terrordome
Come on down  Get down 
You can get it get it get it get it
Come on down
You can get it get it get it get it
You can get it get it get it get it
