As we move forward towards the new millennium
We will no longer communicate with vocal inflections
It will be necessary to communicate through telekinesis
We will open your mind and concentrate harder
Focus focus focus focus
Hey brother what it is
Raps like Star Wars only the stars die its no sequels
Beat three cases see three POs
Before Morpheus and Neo was killing em
We was ducking bullets in the hood like Remo Williams
Understand the underground Dom sipper
Take it serious or die laughin like John Ritter
Young Eastwood just trying to eat good
Breathe easy relax mack like Fleetwood
Keep snoring keep sleeping Ill keep touring
Come back lay in the cut like Neosporin
Came out of the fallopian blasting
Pharoahe hungrier than Ethiopians fasting
Flies all in my teeth stomach sticking out
Niggas want dibs on the weed but aint kicking out
See this is not American Idol
This is me trying to eat human survival
Spit at your favorite rapper take his title
Stick needles in his eyeballs til his signs are no longer vital
This aint that Im not them
These aint those rhymes Im not him
This is more like cocaine all night
Shine like the new five halogen foglights
No more like sunshine
And one line of minell remind you of when you were nine
Before you were busting cherries it wasnt necessary to grind then
Now we all on our grizzly
And you got the nerve to press Frisbees
What it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
If Im not home on the range catch me at the range
Practicing my aim catch you in your brain
Shame they thought I was backpack
Slept didnt know that he kept inside the knapsack
Todays niggas do skateby hits
Run in your crib on some Queer Eye For The Straight Guy shit
But not homosexuals they mastering gunplay
Rearrange your furniture fix your feng shui
They be swearing its cute
But I be up in the club boxcutter in the boot
With the sex appeal and no ice either
The right to bear arms Im not talking wifebeaters either
When they see me they say Thats that nigga
My last name should be Thats That Nigga
Sounds kinda nice Pharoahe Thats That
Never catch me with them plastic halfass niggas
With the flow thats so influential
Niggas fucked up they get no instrumentals now
Next time you spitting on mine
Bet your bottom dollar you be spitting over rhymes
What it is


What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
What it is what it is what it is what it is
