Something is wrong in this nation
When a child can grab a gunsgrab a gun so easily
And shoot a bullet
Into the middle of a childs face as my daughter experienced
Something is wrong
First the gun draws and you know
That somethings happening
Then darkness falls and oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You cant be scared now
When the streets is calling you
Good evening my names Mr Bullet
I respond to the index when you pull it
The trigger so make a note take a vote
Quick man nicknames Quaker Oats cause
Whether domestic violence or coke deals
See I lust to change brain matter to oatmeal
And when I kill kids they say shame on me
Who the fuck told you to put they names on me
White man made me venom to eliminate
Especially when Im in the hood I never discriminate
Just get in em then I renovate
Flesh bone aint nothin for me to penetrate
And it can happen so swiftly
One false move just might shift me
If Im enlodged and your souls not claimed
I will remind that ass when its about to rain like
First the gun draws and you know
That somethings happening
Then darkness falls and oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You cant be scared now
When the streets is calling you


Would the new method of murder be arson or firebombs
If the cost of a single bullet was more than the firearm
Strange that is when all exits are final
Point blank range that is
My attitude is cold and callous
Killed kings in Tennessee presidents in Dallas
And if the past be known at last we know
What happened that afternoon on the Grassy Knoll
Its what made a widow of Jackie O
The government hired Lee Harvey to blast me though
Fatality shot entered from the right temple
Was not fired from a sixstory window
Can it be that it was all so simple
But yet remains so painful to rekindle
I come through your city Im hot
Whether youre jiggy or not whether youre Biggie or Pac
When the gun draws
First the gun draws and you know
That somethings happening
Then darkness falls and oh
Your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because
War is coming
You cant be scared now
When the streets is calling you
