Its realness over millions
You niggas fake it till you make it though
Its love over money
Wont put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch aint bad she basic
These niggas aint said shit
Uh uh
Hoes sell pussy and I be selling raps
I dont gamble with this game I aint in to shooting craps
I dont fuck with no dice and I dont play with no cards
But I know how to get some paper with my dick when its hard
I squeeze it like some lard Im a pimp like a hoe
I get down and dirty like a pit bull dog
Lose or fall all jumping love it
I got the Bentley through the fall with having money
Ive been hearing Devin since the Odd Squad
Original them other niggas broads and frauds
Walking over your for sure pussy
Tryna get some more pussy
Them nigga gave my piece to suck in the right lane
Tell my bitch she still on my team
Cause she know if I was with it was all about some cream
Tell my bitch she still on my team
Cause she know if I was with it was all about some cream
Its realness over millions
You niggas fake it till you make it though
Its love over money
Wont put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch aint bad she basic
These niggas aint said shit
Its time to roll who got a cigar
Oh shit I do let me get that hoe from out the car
Fix it up and twist it up right quick
Theres no surprise why my eyes like this
See I keep a cold blank
I smoke and hang all over the wall
The weed is good and stink
While putting my thing all over you love
But Im never hard on them I pet the cat softly
If papers involve I pull out my black sharpie
Because Im much too cool to lose
To hot to be held
Its time to bail when the pussy starts to smell
And grip the grain like my man C
Cause strangely mainly lames be tryna hang me
But I keep flipping keep stepping
Keep repping keep accepting all the head the hoes be giving
Its Devin in the house
Sweet off in my mouth
All the time Im high high high


Its realness over millions
You niggas fake it till you make it though
Its love over money
Wont put my bitch over my niggas though
Yeah I had done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch aint bad she basic
These niggas aint said shit
