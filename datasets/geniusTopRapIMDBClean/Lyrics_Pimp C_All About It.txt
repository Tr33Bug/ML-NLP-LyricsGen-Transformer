Now whos sleeping on the midwest better get your head checked
Niggas gonnna feel this even all the rednecks
Bounce to the beat when they hear this shit
Ive been underground damn near 20 years in the mix
I moved down south cuz old man was wild
My lil homie rapping on came to show you how
To take my skills and keep paying the bills
Fuck what youre saying cuz Im staying real
The young homies keep me on my toes still got the old flow
Book me in your town and therell never be a noshow
Kick it down south where they keeping it crunk
Cuz the niggas down south got they own funk
You heard about the West Coast heard about the East Coast
Heard about Miamibase but what about 
Or Kalamazoo they got MCs too
If you come around my crew you gonna have to say a few
Or you can just get your bitchass out
You come to me you can play sing rap no doubt
You got to go what the fuck is this
HipHop Culture or the music business

Cuz we all on the same journey
So as I roll Ima look out for you
If I see you do it wrong I take my time and show you
How to get it right make money every night
Gotta use your brain if you wanna win the fight
East coast West coast who got the best flow
Maybe at your next show niggas oughta test your
Crowd skills and check your record sales
Then well find out how you fake as hell
I said it aint where you from its how you do it where youre at
Real players from your town all knew that you was whack
Fake nigga in Cali fake nigga in New York
Small time you never be bigger than hort
Now why you trying to front so hard
You from a gangster town but yous a punk ass mark
Respect dont come cuz of where you from
Just keep it real in your heart from square one
And all you highly influenced followers on the wrong path
Im spitting game to make the motherfucking song last
Its a shame you cant make no cash
Everytime we roll out we gotta wait on your ass
Youre just slow cant be down with nation wide
Cuz we seriously trying to get the paper right
Talking bout contracts cash flow credit cards mean cars
Signin lot of that for the next 16 bars

Sweet Jones the pimp of the year
Riding drop elderado with two carrots in my ear
My baby momma brother put me down with the D
I bought my babe a lac and changed my name to PimpC
I put the pimping down to the hoes
Now hort got me rocking on the microphone
And all the trill niggas riding trues and vogues
And all the bitch niggas trying to buy these hoes
Got a bitch try to chip me on my cellular phone
Smelling like 64dollar cologne
Nigga got mad cuz his bitch chose me
But you just showed you aint no real PIMP
Like Kool Mack A Ace and Sir Captain

I dip from city to city squeezing ass and titties
The head was good but the pussy was shitty
She just wanna kick it with a rap star
The bitch got freaky tried to fuck my car
ATL the city of bless
Where hoes like to take big dick in they belly
Got two freaks from Decateur wanna lick our sacks
I tried hit you hort man where the fuck was you at
Out in Nashville Tenessee
Bitches in with me for sure
Sipping on the Remy X ho
With the hoes last night I did that
Every blue moon I got to pull out my big hat
Do some more shit other niggas cant do
Like hooking up this funky ass nation wide crew
We come from everywhere working under one roof
Come through front somebody might stump you
With a rhyme or a boot
What you finna do
Getting blood all over my niggas tennish shoe
You better take my advice and get lost fast
Before them boys from Texas get off in your ass
And it wont be pretty if my uncle Frank Middy
Come lookin for you shooting at you it gets shitty
But in your mind you rank higher than me
Put your money in the bank then come wire it to me
Cuz Ill flip it while you trying to buy a new car
Find me in the studio signing new stars
Take a hundred thousand dollars make a quick million
Start from the floor and go straight to the ceiling
You hiding from reality nigga yous a bitch
Niggas like me get used to getting rich
Signing autographs taking pictures of my fans
Hit the town and take your bitch to my place
She get a bigger and better deal fucking with me
I heard hort Dog ran up in your freak
She dissapeared heard she went to Cali
Jumped on the plane and flew the bitch to Maui
Or maybe Atlanta I got your bitch posted
Popping champagne bottles bout to get roasted
Chilling at the house me and four hoes
Jumped in the jacuzzi aint wearing no clothes
Bitch Im so all about it
I just cant live without it
Bitch Im so all about it
I just cant live without it
Nigga Im so all about it
I just cant live without it
Bitch Im so all about it
I just cant live without it

Say hort can I fuck
Smoke some bitch
