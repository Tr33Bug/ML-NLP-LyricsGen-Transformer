The player of the year is in it to win it
Cause Im gonna take the crown
In just about a minute
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Dont call me sweetie thats a term for a trick
Im more like your daddy eat my wheaties good dick
A Cadillac driver and a cross country max
Send your girl to Las Vegas she just brought my money back
Im USDA meet up out the pen bitch
Fuck with a pimp and I can show you how to get rich
I keep my money on my mind
Playing chess not checkers keep a girl out on the grind
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
8Ball big front row
Guilty or chasing dope
Sometimes high sometimes low
Gasoline no glow
Nigga go and ask your ho
She gives away them guts
I done been around the block bust nuts onto all them sluts
Handle that with care
A nigga like big Ball is rare
She texts and talking dirty while she laying with a square
He paid for her hair
Display her everywhere
Or would he be the same if he knew he had to share
I really dont care
Weed in the air
Stop crying like a bitch nigga life aint fair
A ho gon be a ho
Ima do me for sure
Every time I get a little bit I want a little more
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Pouring up smoking out
Swanging pockets poking out
Coming down on a slab boy what you know about
Pimp tight MJG 8Ball UGK stay down underground
For the crime till the day
Real pimping mink up pop that pussy go and bring it back
Baby daddy brother uncle tricking tell them bring the stacks
Tell him leave it on the dresser
If he even want to test her
If he even want to touch it
If he dont na fuck it
If I barely even like it then my bitch gonna love it
On my feet on the bus in the Benz or a bucket
Im a genius with this pimping break a bitch college scholar

Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Man Im an underground king
Got the pinky ring shining
Wood wheel with the diamonds
VVS gon leave you blinding
Know I seen you peeping them big rocks
Rolex that dont tick tock
Candy car in that traffic
Watch me swang and bang through the gridlock
Look me dead in my eyes bitch
See if Im telling lies bitch
And dont you be surprise
When the donkey dick hit you between your thighs bitch
Disrespecting that macking
Like its fake and Im out here acting
You already know Im reacting
With that open hand face smacking
Im cracking the code now I can see clearly
You always show love to those I hold dearly
Want respect but accept if you fear me
Keeping it trill if you aint then dont come near me
Been about my paper I stay on my note
Packing that heat better bring you a coat
Make you bulletproof you in a scope
Bitch and Ill do you dirty for a dollars a dope
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
Them other niggas they aint on it like Im on it girl
