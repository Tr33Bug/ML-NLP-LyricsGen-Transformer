I know you hoes on a mission to steal my dick
But Pimp Chad aint goin for the Georgia bitch  Georgia bitch 
It wasnt nuttin when I saw ya bitch  saw ya bitch 
She knew that I was on some millionaire shit
Everythang I say is the truth  is the truth 
I need five funky hoes for one prostitute
Just cause you sell pussy dont make you certified
You aint in it to win it I can see it in yo eyes
WWW dot Wonder why Im quickly gettin exposed
Breakin tricks for they money like a female is supposed  posed 
Im out in Neptune on some Space Age shit
All my diamonds got paper Emmitt keeping me legit  git 
When the welfare was over I be sellin cocaine  caine 
Im out in Las Vegas takin over bitches brains  brains 
Tony Snow dont sniff no blow  sniff no blow 
Pimp hard on a cracker but I love me a crow  love me a crow

I gotta big truck on some big rims
I get my dick sucked when I pull out the Bent
These hoes jockin me they wanna ride with me
They gotta be down ho Like Bobby Brown and Whitney
Life is a game of inches
You move up little by little to the fame and riches
Life be a game and a broad of visions
Some niggas is hoes and all women aint bitches
And your reach Keep the heat near
Games I dont play  Im tryna make it clear
You dont hear me nigga Open up ya ears
If you movin too fast slow down and switch gears
PA somethin ya life give ya nothin
The streets aint pokin you can get shot bluffin
Cash rule everythang keep that on ya brain
Get rich quick let pimpin do the blame
Midnight blue with the peanut butter guts
Chrome on my feet and bump in the trunk
Ball cap popped up raised to the back
Kush in my rillo rollin big like Shaq

Imma pimp sellin hoes to a chick on the track
Make my money bend her or over slap the dick on the back
They call me M  Jayyy  G Im the man in charge
If you read this application youll change ya job
I gotta order motherfuckin rappers teachers preachers and athletes
All make a personal visit or to the backstreets
I even gotta ho play away
With one rule til ya gray nigga stay away
See Im the reason why ya letcha girl stay at the house
And beat her up cause my name couldnt stay out her mouth
And I dont need to know if she just wanna join the team
Get down and kiss all my royal marines
I keep a Cadillac and I select a few in my car
If you dont own one then you aint got shit in ya garage
I go hard you motherfuckas aint breakin a ho
You just flyin bitches in showcasing a ho
