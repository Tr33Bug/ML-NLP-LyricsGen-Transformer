Uhhh Hold up young bitchbitch I just dont wanna stop cominup
Uhhh its never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas aint real them hos fake
Im Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know Im rich
I was in the ghettohad nothin
Sold alot of records and grabbed somethin
Now Im goin through movies in LA
Playin the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
Im tryna get my mothafuckin paper on
I want the new Brough and the new cell phone
I want the new twoway pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town Im a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up
I cant let nobody hold me downthese hos could never hold me  never hold me 
Cause Im comin down playa surroundinlivin these hos fantasy
Cause Im choppinblades and playin maze and these bitches they cant stand it  cant stand it 
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandinComin Up
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
Thats the reason for my uncontrollable ballin right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is too valuable for me to play with life now
Of course its gon be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guilty simply cause now I got diamonds on any thang
My mouth and my pinky ring my wrist and my neck
Im bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can vividly remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat sleep shit piss pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Moving rocks got us full pocketsplus knots in our socks
But now money be comin in wads like blocks
Lets go half on a YachtI got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I cant even hear you haters youve been muted by my paper chase
I cant let nobody hold me downthese hos could never hold me  never hold me 
Cause Im comin down playa surroundinlivin these hos fantasy
Cause Im choppinblades and playin maze and these bitches they cant stand it  cant stand it 
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandinComin Up
Who wouldve known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fiftythousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now Im smokin high dro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now Im rockin clubs
After Diamonds N Yo Face I was coppin dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 thats fortygrand
Rappers talk alot of shit but you aint stoppin us
Look you dont wanna bump heads with a mafia  Huh 
Look you dont know shit about UGK
Or Mr Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch Im wearin
Im the first cat in Houston with a black McLaren
Lil Flipper tote pistols for them non believers
Cause down here we poppin trunks on Cadillacs and Regals  Oh boy 
I cant let nobody hold me downthese hos could never hold me  never hold me 
Cause Im comin down playa surroundinlivin these hos fantasy
