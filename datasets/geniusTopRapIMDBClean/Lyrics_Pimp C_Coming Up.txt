Hold up we jammin
I cant let nobody hold me down
These hoes could never hold me
Cause Im comin down playa surroundin
Livin these hoes fantasy
Cause Im choppin blades and playin maze
And these bitches they cant stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin
On them dubs 
Choppin on dubs and showin em love
2000Fizive and you are not fly enough
Young bitch hold up hold up young bitch
Bitch I just dont wanna stop comin up
Uh its never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas aint real them hoes fake
Im Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know Im rich
I was in the ghetto had nothin
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin
Now I go and do movies in LA
Playin the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
Im tryna get my mothafuckin paper on
I want the new  and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they records sound shitty
When I see you in the town Ima hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up
I cant let nobody hold me down
These hoes could never hold me
Cause Im comin down playa surroundin
Livin these hoes fantasy
Cause Im choppin blades and playin maze
And these bitches they cant stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin
Comin up 
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
Thats the reason for my uncontrollable ballin right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I paid the price now
My life is too valuable for me to play with life now
Of course theres gon be some niggas who gon think I done changed
They find me guilty simply cause now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring my wrist and my neck
Im bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can vividly remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat sleep shit piss pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin rocks got us full pockets plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin in wads like blocks
Lets go half on a Yacht I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I cant even hear you haters youve been muted by my paper chase
I cant let nobody hold me down
These hoes could never hold me
Cause Im comin down playa surroundin
Livin these hoes fantasy
Cause Im choppin blades and playin maze
And these bitches they cant stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin
Comin up 
Who wouldve known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fiftythousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now Im smokin hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now Im rockin clubs
After Diamonds N Yo Face I was coppin dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 thats fortygrand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you aint stoppin us
Look you dont wanna bump heads with a mafia huh
Look you dont know shit about UGK
Or Mr Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch Im wearin
Im the first cat in Houston with a black Leclarion
Lil Flipper tote pistols for them nonbelievers
Cause down here we poppin trunks on Cadillacs and Regals oh boy
I cant let nobody hold me down
These hoes could never hold me
Cause Im comin down playa surroundin
Livin these hoes fantasy
Cause Im choppin blades and playin maze
And these bitches they cant stand it
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin
On them dubs 
Whats up Lets go choppin on dubs and showin em love
2000Fizive and you are not fly enough
Young bitch hold up hold up young bitch
Bitch I just dont wanna stop comin up
Young bitch
2000Fizive and you are not fly enough
