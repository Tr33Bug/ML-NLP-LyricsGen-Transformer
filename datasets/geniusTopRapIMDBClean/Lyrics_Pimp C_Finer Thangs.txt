Pimp C Baby wood grain and dome
I mess with you girl cause you got it going on
And I was locked up in here you was taking trips
While them other Niggas gone watching and shaking them hips
Not in the club I can see them dancing for tips
But they was not freaking for free now baby aint that a trip
You the Princess of the South
And I gotta be the king
So girl you might as well get used to having finer thangs Baby
Oooh boy was it this way to love me you
Now you got me feenin for the JUICE
Taking me on shopping sprees around the world
So good to me when I was just a country girl
Cant help the way Im turning out
Im in love with him without a doubt
And the boy can really turn it out
He got the whoole world in his hands
You got me used to all the finer thangs
You got me  infatuated by what money brangs  Yo money brings 
Cop Fendi rings and watches
Celebrate  everything 
You got me used to all the finer thangs  finer thangs 
Mane I met this chick so fine
So bad I had to hit one time and this bitch still sticking around
She was supposed to be a one night stand
Pussy was so good shit she ended up staying
Bout one or two weeks going at it like freaks
Every day all day had me walking around weak
Got me doing strange things like tricking out change
Partners looking at me like
Thuggy you gone mane
I cant the deny it I had it this chicks so tough
Only thing on my mind is trying to fck
They say do what make you happy right
So for now Im on set mode sleeping up with her for days
You got me used to all the finer thangs
You OoOoh  infatuated by what money brings
Oh baby 
Cop Fendi rings and watches
Celebrate  All those thangs all those thangs 
You got me used to all the finer thangs  finer thangs 
When I met you You was trying to smoke out
Get your do out Got with me and I showed you how to get the dough out
Nigga told so many lies that when I told you the truth
It was valuable to you like I bought a GT coupe
Not to mention Im USDA I got the meat
And Im highly respected and Im protected in the streets
You representin me so thats why you gotta ride right
Thats why were slamming magic doors
Thats what were staying and drink tonight  Its going down 
You got me used to all the finer thangs
Youu  infatuated by what money brings
