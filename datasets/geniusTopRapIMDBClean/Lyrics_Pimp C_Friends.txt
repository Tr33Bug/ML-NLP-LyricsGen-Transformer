Be careful cause you cant trust these so called friends out here
They be jealous
What about your friends will they stay on they grind
What about your friends will they be around
What about your friends will they let you die
What about your friends
With friends like that I dont need enemies
I had a lotta niggas that was down with me
Or should I say a lotta niggas hang around with me
But when I took my fall
I found out I really didnt have many friends at all
When I was out there rollin in the Benz and ball
My momma used to get a lotta telephone calls
Niggas tryna see how we was I had a buzz
But all that shit stopped when I got popped by the fuzz
A couple niggas kept that shit true indeed
But not the ones I used to bail outta jail and feed
We used to smoke weed and get drunk off brew
I went to TDC nigga I couldnt find you
You couldnt find me thats what you told yourself
But you couldnt tell that bullshit to nobody else
But when they asked you how I was doin you told em I was cool
Knowin you aint talk to me since I went to the pen fool
No pictures no conversary money to eat
And now you think its all good cause Im back on the streets
Im back on these beats and still blowing like the wind
But these is the niggas that we call friends
What about your friends will they stay on they grind
What about your friends will they be around
What about your friends will they let you die
What about your friends
With friends like that I dont need enemies
In these streets and these traps nigga you better be strapped
Niggas out here plottin be prepared to shoot back
Nigga aint no rules nigga it aint no love
A nigga put a knife in your nigga could be your blood
Kill a nigga over money kill a nigga over drugs
They killing niggas over hoes be careful who you fuck
One false move and you fucked and out here on that bullshit
Catch a fuck niggas and they hit his ass with the full clip
What about your friends 
Niggas aint real
Niggas aint trill
Niggas be jealous
Over the hoes over the whips over the crib
Niggas be broke pockets be hurt
Nigga be stressed
Nigga be learning
Whoop your friend you gotta murk em
Payback its closed curtains
What about your friends will they stay on they grind
What about your friends will they be around
What about your friends will they let you die
What about your friends
With friends like that I dont need enemies
Its so ill  pop no pills
Straight Henn a toast to Pimp C  now on to fake friends
Tina best friend husband fucking her cousin
Her cousin she think her baby by Tina husband
But Tina had a miscarriage by me
Ten months later Tina had a baby its deep
Soon the whole hood to be related
Like an African tribe misplace missituated
13 shes already ripping
So whoever daughter she is you about to be in grandpa position
And pot no pot to piss in
Man stop and listen
Your man from the sand box he on the stand snitching
His John Hancock got em lamb chops what is missin
Home exonerated cause he cooperated
I peep the bullshit coming the streets taught me
And in abundance now my circle a hundred
What about your friends will they stay on they grind
What about your friends will they be around
What about your friends will they let you die
What about your friends
With friends like that I dont need enemies
