Yall remember that shit  remember that shit  Talkin bout
Just another young playa havin thangs man 
Check this shit out uh
Its really goin down in the God damn South
Young girls poppin pussy with them golds in their mouth
Young boys comin up layin it down in the cut
Never fallin in a rut cause life was made for us to strut  strut 
Never take for granted take the bull by the horns  horns 
Sippin on somethin sweet blowing green popcorn  corn 
Im trill Im country til the end my nigga
The underdog young hog fuck the pen my nigga
Cuz its a waste of bodies  bodies  a waste of time  time 
A waste of spiritual energy and a waste of mind  mind 
You aint really tough cause you been down there fool
Everybody tryna get back to they families on the cool
I rather grip on grain  grain  get head in the lane  lane 
You can have them hoes bodies Im possessing they brains  possessing they
Brains

Hoping you aint forgot the name Im out here havin thangs
Fly hoes and chains and swanging thangs
Just another young playa having thangs man
Fly hoes and chains and swanging thangs
Just another young playa having thangs man
Yeah Big Mike yall Yeah 
From CD sales to jail cells
From diamonds that shine to eatin slop straight up off a chow line
From walkin that fine line uhh to 12 jurors decidin mine
From bein free to bein confined
From bein loved to bein despised many times I cried
For not allowin that bullshit to slide
It was a pill that I couldnt swallow  load up the strap with the hollows
After takin to the head a whole bottle
I did that not thinkin twice about the consequences
Til I served damn near 4 years behind the fences  Straight G 
All my folk were like Big Mike you trippin
Get it together if I could I woulda done somethin different
Uh From Gwalkin to slippin yeah to flippin them calendar pages
Day after day sweatin em out in them cages
Patiently waiting on the day when I can get back at it
Work that magic collect that cabbage I gotsta have it
Fly hoes and chains and swanging thangs
Just another young playa having thangs man
Fly hoes and chains and swanging thangs
Just another young playa having thangs man
