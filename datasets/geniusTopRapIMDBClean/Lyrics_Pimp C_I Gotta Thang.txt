Swang down sweet cherry
Everybody doing something
Know what Im talkin bout
I gotta thang you gotta thang  hold up 
Everybody gotta thang  thats the truth 
When we get together start doing our thing  smoke something 
We dont wanna hurt no body  bitch 
All we wanna do is party
I got some partners addicted to that pussy hoe
They got em fucked think its better than gold
I got some other partners like to go to Las Vegas
Addicted to gamblin cause they some table players
Fucking off everything they ever worked for
I know some partners that cant live without a dirty whore
Cause they addicted to that head and good mouth
I got some boys thats addicted to lean in the south
I know some old people gone off that medicine from the doctor that the people give em at Eckerd
Now check it
Heart medicine high blood pressure
Motherfuckers aint learn they fuckin lesson
You want to know why we die young
Cause we all got the fuckin pills under our fuckin tongue
I gotta thang you gotta thang  hold up 
Everybody gotta thang  and thats the truth 
When we get together start doing our thing  smoke something 
We dont wanna hurt no body  bitch 
All we wanna do is party
I gotta thang you gotta thang  hold up 
Everybody gotta thang  thats the truth 
When we get together start doing our thing  smoke something 
We dont wanna hurt no body  bitch 
All we wanna do is party
