I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge

PIMP
I know you strapped but you still a fucking bitch nigga
Ya talkin bumpkin cause I know you aint shit nigga
And if you dont shut the fuck up youll get hit nigga
And well put seven in your stomach through yo Hilfiger
I went to Dallas and some bitches tried to test me
But my nuts too big to let a pussy nigga check me
And I aint laugh bitch niggas dont disrespect me
You shoulda killed me bitch the first day that you met me
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa
I told you nigga I dont fuck wit no K Rude
When I was young that nigga fucked me out some paper dude
Butcha called him to the studio that was across
But bitch you almost got your homeboy broke off
Cause Uncle Paul was gonna hit him from the front door
The whole time I had my eyes on this yellow hoe
Tryin to talk like an OG better shut up
Before you get you and your homeboys wet up
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now yous a killa
The next night Im at the kitchen makin hits and ends
I see some niggas drivin funny in a squarelike Benz
And sure enough it was that bitch that put me in the cross
The first line in my mind was to pick him off
I said fuck him lets dont do it yet lets let him talk
But if that bitch go for his pistol we gon kill him off
I told that girl   of that mafia life bitch
And if you ever try it its gon be repercussions and consequence
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now yous a killa
You niggas week so you call Houston for the hit
But didnt know that we got gangsta niggas all over this bitch
So now you bitches gotta deal with the king hoe
Cause you done crossed me three times we just cant let that go
And to that phony 2Pac that threaten my precious momma
You and me down to get some beats for life youll feel the drama
They gon be flyin ya to the center for that gunshot trauma
You could get hit in your Bentley or your purple Impala
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of that weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now yous a killa
