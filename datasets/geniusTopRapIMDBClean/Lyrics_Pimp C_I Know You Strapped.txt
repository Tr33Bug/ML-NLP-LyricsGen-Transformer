I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of dat weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now youse a killa
Sweet Jones Story
Know what Im talking bout
PIMP
I know you strapped but you still a fucking bitch nigga
Ya talkin bumpkin cause I know you aint shit nigga
And if you dont shut the fuck up youll get hit nigga
And well put seven in your stomach through yo Hilfiger
I went to Dallas and some bitches tried to test me
But my nuts too big to let a pussy niggga check me
And I aint laugh bitch niggas dont disrespect me
You shoulda killed me bitch the first day that you met me
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of dat weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa
I told you nigga I dont fuck wit no K Rude
When I was young that nigga fucked me out some paper dude
But to call him to the studio that wasnt cross
But bitch you almost got your homeboy broke off
Cause Uncle Paul was gonna hit it from the front door
The whole time I had my eyes on this yellow ho
Tryin to talk like an OG better shut up
Before you get you and your homeboys whipped up
I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of dat weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa
The next night Im at the kitchen makin hits and ends
I see some niggas drivin funny in a squarelike Benz
And sho enough it was that bitch that put me in the cross
The first line in my mind was to pick him off
I said fuck him lets go do it yeah lets let him talk
But if that bitch gon pull his pistol we gon kill him off
I told that girl what this mafias like bitch
And if you ever try it its gon be repercussions across this bitch

I know ya strapped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of dat weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa
You niggas weak so you call Houston for the hit
But didnt know that we got gangsta niggas all over this bitch
So now you bitches gotta deal with the King ho
Cause you done crossed me three times we just cant let that go
And to that phony 2Pac threatenin my precious momma
its bitches for life you feel the drama
They be flying you to the center for that gunshot trauma
You could get hit in your Bentley or your Purple Impala
I know ya strapped screwed  chopped
But you cowards like to play hard
But knowing that you dont wanna catch a murder charge
See niggas like to get full of dat weed and liquor
Snort a line in you mind now you a killa
You aint no gangsta nigga
Fucker ass nigga
You aint slappin nothing here junior
Better get your mind right bitch
Dedicated to all you old stiff daddy ass niggas
When you shoulda known not to fuck with me bitch screwed  chopped
Im a put it dead on yo ass when it which
What happenin my brother
He was layin there shaking and bleeding like a mother fucker
All you 2Pacass wannabe niggas
Get your brains blew out on your dashboard bitch
Goin down
Sweet Jones
Platinum bitch
