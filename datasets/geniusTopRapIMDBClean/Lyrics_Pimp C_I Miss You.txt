Uhh A lotta shit done changed dope man since you been gone
I did a whole lotta good I did a lotta wrong
I made a whole lotta change I wrote a lotta songs
Sometimes I felt weak most times I stood up strong
Yeah I got three kids now Natasha had a son
We aint together no more I guess we was just too young
To even try to start a family in the first place
But I get happy every time I look into his face
Ever since you went away man its been hard for me
Didnt know til you died how much you meant to me
All the time and the patience you put into me
You showed me how to be the man that I was meant to be
Taught me how to play music and bout the melody
And to this day I remember what you was tellin me
You told me Son most of this rap shit is just noise
But if you put some music in it youll get rich boy
Thats why I stay up in the studio up all night
I fuck with live musicians to get the groove right
Yeah Ima rap star now yeah you could say that
Cause now my walls is filled with gold and grey plaques
Doin shows and videos and makin big stacks
But if it would bring you back I would trade all that
I wanna thank ya for everything that you did for me
Im on my knees praying to God that you hearing me
Oooohhh yeeaahhh  I miss yooouuu Im talkin to you baaabbbyyy

I know you watch me up there and its gettin hard for me
When you get a chance put a good word into the Lord for me
I been got caught up got sent to the pen
I let ya down Im in a place I know you never thought you see me in
But all these things is happening for a reason
I guess God saved my life and put me up to see another season
And all my socalled friends dont even write to me
They dont go check on my momma dont send no price to me
Im tryna raise my kids from a penitentiary
Stayin on my knees praying they dont grow up to be like me
Do you remember when my parents thing aint worked out
You let me and my momma come live in yo house
Knowin already you had too many people livin witcha
You always treated me special I never could forget cha
Cook me breakfast and lunch and dinner everyday
You wiped my tears away tried to explain why my life had to be this way
Always gave me the real you never bullshit me
I wish I woulda said thank you when you was here with me
My uncle miss ya and I know you know his heart is blue
But he aint the only one cause Annie I miss you too
A house is not a house if aint nobody livin in it
Tell me why black life isnt life unless theres prison in it
General population of super cell or Johnny or some Jack Man
Powdered coffee peppermint peach cool offs but a paint I wish I had that
And even more than my freedom I wish I had somethin else
I would give back everything Ive accomplished fore this one thang and nothin else
I aint talkin about a relationship cause broads bring too much drama  drama 
Id even pass the chance to be a millionaire if I could hug and kiss my momma  momma 
I remember like it was yesterday although I was six years old
Momma whats wrong wake up wake up Why yo forehead hot and yo hands so cold
Who all these people up in our room Auntie tell em put my momma down
I didnt understand what was goin on but it felt wrong cause so many people came around
I didnt have to go to school that day  that day  and everybody was buyin me shit  buyin me shit 
Tellin me everythang was alright but they was sad and cryin and shit
Aint that a bitch My momma aint never came back I wish I could hug and kiss her
Even though Auntie and Grandma Dorothy raised me right I still miss her
