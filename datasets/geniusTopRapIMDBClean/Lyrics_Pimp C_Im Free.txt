Im back on the slab back on the block
Where them hustlers breathe that air and drank them 4s on quarter rocks
The boy Emmitt had me shining when I stepped out the door
I thought I had enough but James told it give me some more
And the same damn day I went to the Bentley lot
Off the show room floor I copped and spurred that thang was hot
But I bet all you busters already knew that
Cause I was all on the internet gettin my shine back
Making rhymes stack pimping with my mic
Everybody want a piece cause Sweet Jones is what they like
They like to pimp his steak and shrimp hit well like a pimp
Back floor lac low UGK is back ohhh
Free
And Im free
It was Free Pimp C but now see the pimp free
Old school gave me that before I left that CT
Terrell check my bezzle on this platinum Jacob watch
They locked up my body but my mind never stopped
Cause I was plotting and planning and scheming everyday
Gettin ready for my release so I can steal the game away
From all these clone type peekers tryna sound like Pimp C
Hes okay but hes not me
By a long shot cuz bout tryna steal to me
Them boys might run BET but trick we run the streets
Its me and Bun B thats for life we the trill
When you see a pimp shinin trick tell me how yafeel
Free
And Im free
I did 4 years tops never hit PC
Did my time in Population with the real OGs
I seen a whole lot of pain men doing they bids
Most of us praying and dudes tryna get home to they kids
Wasnt nothing like Oz a bunch of iron and bars
Bunch of player hating snitches talking to the guards
And a whole penitentiary being ran by broads
Some of them kept it one hundred most of them was fraud
Seen a whole lot of chumps con men in buckles
Some big time dealers kidnappers and busters
Pimps and playas I seen some kill with they hand
But I still dont believe the pen is no place for no man
Free
And Im free
Yeah Dedicated to everybody aint gon never make it up out there
Know what Im sayin
To everybody doing life keep yall head up  keep it up 
Dont get fed up Uhh
Do yo time dont let yo time do you
Young Pimp
Picture me rolling know what Im talkin bout like Pac told em when he came home
Jumped in the five hundred
