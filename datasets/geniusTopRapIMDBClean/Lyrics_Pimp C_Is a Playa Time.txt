Is a Playa  Time  Lyrics
Uhh
Hold up
Comin down
Hold up
Mm
Smoke somethin
Lately he been flippin and stayin on the grind
Tellin you that you fine but he aint spendin no time
I be pourin wine tryin to knock out your spine
Make you mine from behind to some slowed down Bump n Grind
His thang like a dirty Sweet from off the street
My thang like a O of indo from Sacramento
Lately yall been arguin he call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo shit tryina dig you a new ditch
Now I admit that he rich and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his Six Im fuckin on leather and wood
Im just a yougin from the hood with some dick that feel good
With him you know that you shouldnt
With me you know that you should
Your pussy snug like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb cause I aint makin love
See yo man the type of guy to get jealous and hitcha
But me I lick ya where he dont and suck real hard on yo nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime nigga she gave me a nickle
So while you thinkin she done jet she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin yo gal young Pimp C be spendin yo time
Time
Isa Playa Isa Mack I love getting at these ladies but not
Like I love my paper stacks
Now rule one get yo cash up MOB
Thats paper in my pocket my nigga PIMP
Homie dont hate me mayne just hate the game
The only reason yo woman digging me because I play with change
Dont take it personal my nigga I dont love her Imma playa
She just gon keep me company while I get lifted as I lay her
Well naturally I have to be dead serious maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes I was impressed by the sex in her ass
WUIS her Versacci down like Fran Drescher bless her heart
She was a sweettart butcha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin smart wit all that you know comin wit hesay shesay
From what she heard at the club bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off but the bitch was wrong and you
You gon let these messy hos fuck yo world off
I tried to love her man but see love is one thang and dumb is anotha
Brotha Id be dumb to let her run thangs
I shouldve passed but I was gassed superunleaded
And her nappyheaded ass gon regret it remember I said it
Cause Im in a sublime new state and frame of mind
Cause itd be a crime for me to waste my time
My time


Did you ever think about whos ass ya girls was
Before the booty had became yours
If a niggas sang flows you know everythang goes
Fuckin in it til its colorful as rainbows
Sportin furry Kangos she cant go rockin paid shows
Paper hard to fold plus I roll slick keep talkin shit
If you dont like me its most likely  cause I done hollad at yo bitch
Why she so thick Tellin lies and ya said to be believin em
But I make her feel like Uhhuh can you do it Uhhuh
But when I scoup her up she know that Im the one to make a slutcum
Gotta man he a lame anyway motherfuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love baby dont bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud so we can fuck
So wassup Now we in the Suburb submerged watch a movie
Or bumpin UG K shit scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man yea I knew g but she dont usually say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka wanna ball up and cry
Chickapowpow I love them thighs when Im rollin aside
I aint gon up and die like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits two blows
She heard my new shit it was new clothes
New golds carefully Herringbones and cellphones
But her friend home now Im freakin two hos
If ya girl be wit me somethin nifty she probly wanna lick me
Im the Twista I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy gamin it from a shot of Mississippi now pimp on
Isa Playa Isa Mack I love getting at these ladies but not
Like I love my paper stacks
Now rule one get yo cash up MOB
Thats paper in my pocket my nigga PIMP
Homie dont hate me mayne just hate the game
The only reason yo woman digging me because I play with change
Dont take it personal my nigga I dont love her Imma playa
She just gon keep me company while I get lifted as I lay her
