Hey I got the bass quaking trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
Its the great state of Texas so I cant believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
Its time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
Im bout stacking bank everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I aint talking bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don Pimp C a king
Lil J the owner of the squad HTown we the team
It aint no I in that you trying that you be fatigued
But if we man up and press we could lead the league
We some allstars the roster is sick man
I aint gotta start POPll be the sixth man
RapALots a southern empire for the assist man
Three two one swish and

You see the slab outside it look good dont it
Masterpiece dripped out with the fours on it
Trunk airtight speakers and them show lights
Holding cops around nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats offcream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown knocking doors down
1011 slabs in a singlefile line
Flossing swerving the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause its paper Im chasing
My roots come from Texas this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while Im knocking the doors off
Music Video 
Is this true youre part of the largest mob family in Texas
Then what are you here for
Music video only 
Since I drop Knockin Doorz boys sort it out
Seen the light want the paper cant live it out
ZRo and Young Thug in the studio
They already platinum you already know
Mike Jones and Koopa they done shook hands
You can lay a plex aside if you a real man
I think that Paul and Chamillionaire talking but aint rapping yet
Its a start though we knockin down doorz
TI and Flip still on that boy stuff
Acting like kids that aint what time is it
I know you dont like what Im telling you
But I keep trill fuck what you feel thats what Im telling you
Stop listening what your homeboy selling you
Cause when pop off they gon be bailing fool
And you gon be alone when you catch the case
So watch your mouth and get that stupid look out your face
