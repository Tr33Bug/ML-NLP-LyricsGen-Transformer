Like That  Remix  Lyrics Webbie 
Like that like that
Bounce ya ass like that like that
Bounce that ass like that like that
Bend over let me see it from the back
Hook Webbie 
Like Beyonc like Trina  bounce that ass like that 
Like a big booty ass black diva  bounce that like ass that 
Like a stripper up and down like Flipper  bounce that ass like that 
Bend over let me see it from the back
Webbie 
Double shots of Hennessy let it get you groovy
Gone work yo ass do ya thang Ima do me
I done switched to doja and the swisher got a room key
Act like you auditioning for a video or movie
Bend towards the floor I want your hands where your toes be
Ima squeeze all on you booty all nasty
Done made 18 girl Im legal you can harass me
Cash and a Beamer I cant seem to find a bad beat
A big fat ass like Trina make me happy
Titties shake thighs shake vibrate while she dancing
Like to shake her ass like Ciara real fancy
Wonder can Ciara shake that ass on this nine piece
Betcha Jada Pinkett shake that ass real classy
Aint ready for the real betcha she be lettin Will have it
You see me Im picky I rate that ass
I gotta ask 50 how Vivica shake that ass
Hook   repeat 2X
Pimp C 
I sent my bitch to Las Vegas go and hit that lick  hit that lick 
Im still tryna put some dick up in Vanity 6
Apollonia too  too  you know Ill bust you up  bust you up 
I want some threeway love head pussy and butt
Aint no shame in my game I need a porno star
Lemme hit ya in ya ass and play it back in my car  back in my car 
Im talkin Gin and Pepper I know that she feelin me
Take dick like a champ like a bitch named Kennedy
All it takes for me bone neck and lay in they house
I know you real pimp niggas they know what Im talkin about
Tell that girl Keyshia Cole she need to give me some pussy
She shoulda cheated with Sweet Jones cause that niggas a rookie
Fore I sweep through ya pussy like ya need a 
Bitch thought Sweet Jones just might hit her
I told her like this she can swallow this skeeter
Now hoe move around cause I really didnt need her
Hook   repeat 2X
Lil Boosie 
I want a face like Beyonc a smile like Ashanti
Boosie and Paris Hilton a caramel sundae
Bust it back wide open lemme see yo inside
And lick yo tongue at me  ooohhh  that make my temperature rise
Lookin for Teairra Mari I can make you feel good
Ciara can get it too Olivia Im feelin you
I need lips like Fantasia put me to sleep
Talk nasty like Trina  ooohhh  I need me a freek
I like to lay back fuck bitches with two or three Georgia Peaches
They argue before they eat it like Puffy they need Jesus
Like to smoke a purple blunt while you play with that cock
And while I knock off yo top I want Lil Webbie to watch
Yo gon let Webbie see my candy yeah Girl thats how we play that there
Eve I better not see yo tail nowhere
Cause Ima talk that koochie out the drawers  say what 
You want me to be Santa Clause you gon have to break it off like
Hook   repeat 2X
