Hey baby we sure love to ball  love to ball 
Ooh baby we sure love to ball  love to ball 
Hey baby we sure love to ball  love to ball 
Ooh baby we sure love to ball  we sure love to ball 
I like smokin out and Pourin Up
Im breakin car lots two hundred thousand dollars Im showin up
The street life get my watches glowin up
New Motorola smartphone steady blowin up
I remember doin bad
Always knew I would get it it didnt make me sad
Cause I was a beast with it
I keep my khakis with a crease in it  crease in it 
Sharp as a knife
I crawled back in the day but bitch now Im ballin tonight  ballin
Tonight 
I got a call on my celly while I was jammin some Screw  woo 
And it was that PIMP mayne whats up with you
Slab was sittin outside and he had bought em in twos
I painted one candy red and I painted one candy blue
And you know all the women want to conversate for a few
Cause my jewelry sick like hachoo and my necklace still got the flu
She said her name was a Nokia but I had to nickname ya boo
I had to nickname her Chlorine cause your chick stay wet as a pool
Its true boys want a verse from me but they couldnt afford me
Be talkin so much game that a Pimp gon wish to record me  for real 
Been a HTown baller Im talkin swishin like Horry
Aint nobody gettin my glory aint nobody trippin like Cory
Mo already know that I keep a room in my vault
I signed a check to myself so I guess that makes me my boss
Therealestevercom and I aint gonna sign off
It aint no stoppin our ballin like we ran out of timeouts  hold up  
Uh summertime niggas  niggas  Phantom aint the answer
Fly I cant enjoy it I think my daddys got cancer  huh 
Pistol in my lap Im rocked up like Miss Chancer  starter 
Fist turn a trick a five like Jo Jo dancer
Old nigga doin boy hit a house one knot  knot 
Years seventy eighty stole all our Christmas lot  bitch 
My whole life I was exposed to the fast lane
Runnin through my blood seventyfive thousand for the chain  chain 
Fifty thousand for the watch piece
But Ill take it off bitch to squabble with ya in the streets
Im Dr Dre of the South ya better watch your mouth
Michael Jordan underdog see ya at the Playas Ball  bitch  
Say baby turn yourself around so I can love you good
Hey baby girl you so sweet
Good time go on and suck my meat  suck my meat
