I know you got a man at home  at home 
Dont go and do nothin crazy
You aint gotta make a move
Baby let me put this on your mind
I know you got a man at home  at home 
But think about this here for later  later 
You aint gotta make a move
Baby let me put this on your mind
Let me put this let me put this
Let me put this on your mind
Get down girl just like Pharrell sizzaid
Cheat on ya man ma thats how you get ahizzhea
I aint tryna lock ya down and take ya time  take ya time 
Im just tryna put this dick off in ya mind  mind 
Go hit ya spine like a Viking supposed to
Keep ya nigga in ya life or let a young nigga mold you
We stayin prayed of paper the ammunition for the devil
Getting our blessings goin to that other level  level 
Bet these niggas cant get it cant see
Cant touch it cant read cause them niggas aint me
And girl I dont dream everythang come true
These hoes tryna choose me but bitch Im tryna fuck with you
Im tryna fuck with you 
She gotta nigga at home Of course you do
Cause if ya didnt Id think somethin was wrong with you
I cant see a nigga splitting up divorcing you
You hot like cayenne proportion you
Nah image is everythang time is money
Let me beat right quick and skeet on yo tummy
Chill up a shot of Patron roll a blunt of the kush
Im kinda old school still like hair on the puss
Now hes yo provider pays the bills
And me I provide dick hard as steel
For my last birthday she arranged a menage
And graduated from the driveway to the garage
Ha


Now you can catch me sippin somethin with a cork in a bottle
Smokin bad on that purp or the fourth with a model
I dont party much when I do I blow through it
I confess I talk about it more than I do it
Im the vacation type white ostrich Bugatti
On the beach with a young Chevy Belle Afonte
No PO no court no Glock
Bought these mainly fresh purr no socks
Gipp rollin in a candy Jeep G50
On the weekend its the LS 460
Overseas steering wheel on the right side
And you wouldnt believe that thats a seven fortyfive
Where you goin What it is Whats ya name
ESP jeans and hardly true religion on her man  hey 
Tryna fill corners make some more chips
Drive a few whips old school chrome lips
Flown through the park dippin downtown
Fourdoor Cruiser with the top break down  down 
Floors and the walls all oak on the private coach
And we all gon let it burn on the Love Boat
Pimp C UGK for life man
Thats my nigga right there
Fo shizzle dizzle Back on the streets Daddy
The Pimpalation man Right here live in person man
Fenzel Washington its Pimpin in Motion man

Jazze Pha Pimp C Jagged Edge Big Zak Gipp  Ali
Whoa boy Masterly coordinated
