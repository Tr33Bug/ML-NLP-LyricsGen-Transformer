Niggas say that I was tricking and sucking them hoes cock
Letting them keep half the money playing the short stop
I was quarterbacking nigga putting a bitch out on the track
Looking to get down for the grind and bring all the money back
Bitch you got 8000 you aint no P
I get 15000 for my choosing fee
The Bentley 200 and the house was a mill
200 on my neck and Im working wood wheel
Tell me how you feel when you see a pimp shine
Your bitch in your cover got my dick on my mind
Slick on the grind got what them hoes like
Smell good dick good she Tina Im Ike

Nigga the numbers in my bank account longer than a Limo
If you aint getting bread you must didnt get the memo
All my cars off the showroom floor I dont test drive
My new shit aint got no roof and the doors suicide
If you try me then its suicide goons open fire
Everyday is Halloween nigga their go Michael Myers
Masked up to get his cash up wake your ass up
Think you save off in the burbs til you get your ass touched
All this money overflowing I cant even walk
Stepping in the bank Im gonna rip the vault
I got some cash  I cant hide that shit
Just see what I wanna go buy that shit
Your girl on my nuts want to try my dick
And she spit back that shit Im gon fire this bitch
