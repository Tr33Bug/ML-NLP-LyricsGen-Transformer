Corey Mo  whas happenin 
Sweet Jones
I see a lot of niggas in this rap game man
Niggas moving too mother fucking fast
Yall niggas need to
Slow down  know what Im talking bout hol up 
Niggas poppin pills sippin barre smoking fry and God knows whatever else
Niggas on that Malcolm X
You know like that nigga Breeze said man the hood gonna catch up with you man
You know what Im saying
Peep up in the city with the hoes showing ass and titties
Im a ghetto star and the games a pity
Cause most niggas get took by the street fame
And they cant hold on to their spot in this dirty game
I see a lot of niggas sign record deals
But they fall off cause they niggas wasnt real
But Ive been in this thang since 92
Getting my money doing what the hustlas do
Through the wars having no cars
Going to jail rapping behind bars
Putting it down wit Bun B
When we was broke out on the streets
Trying to come up on a motha fucking Swisher Sweet
I used to sell weed then I sold crack
I used to ride in a oldschool gold llac
Fleetwood wit cherry lights
I sold that bitch to that boy Mo thats why we come down at night
Slow down  know what Im talking bout  repeated
Bitch now I drive a big Benz  big Benz 
And spend big money with my motha fucking hustling friends
I dont buy the O I buy the quarterpound
Im talking Indo nigga I lay these bitches down
Whats happening out in LA LA
When Im out there with the BooYaa Tribe
And thats how I play  thats how I play 
And Im hollerin at Yuk and CBo too
I hear whatcha saying and Im a do what yall wanna do
Cause fuck niggas need to get hit up
Bitch niggas dont deserve no truck
Snitch niggas dont deserve to fuck
Nigga outta luck
Thats why your records aint selling and ya stuck
You need to slow down before somebody hit you up
You need to slow down before somebody fuck you up
You need to slow down before it comes to get you
Hit you in your wig and aint nothing to split you
Slow down  know what Im talking bout  repeated
You see this rap game is more than just rhymes and beats
It designed to make money it starts in the streets
A lotta niggas dont follow the rules and end up losing
Way before their time cause their records aint moving
Better slow down and rethink your strategy nigga
Have you still paying dues you cant be mad at me nigga
I aint looking for no handouts or looking for no friends  unuh 
My brother always told me nigga go and get your ends
And thats what Im a do its the honesttoGod truth
Im a stay up on these beats and Im a stay off in the booth
So all you niggas hating waiting for me to fold
Im bout to shift to another gear and pass you hoes
On the cool I aint nobodys goddamn fool
Just like you pack tools nigga I do too
So in case you never knew nigga you know now
What you ought to be trying to do is on the real
Is slow down
Slow down  know what Im talking bout  repeated
Hol up slow down uh
Get your mind on your money
Cause your records aint selling
Nigga repeated
