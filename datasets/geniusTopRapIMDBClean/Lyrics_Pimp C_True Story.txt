True story lil bitch
Trademark trademark smoke sum bitch
Drop seven in the pot hit it with the soda
Now I got what them Cali boys call A1 yola
The south is circles and them Atlanta is squares
Lying about the prices it aint seventeen up there
Im down with Young Buck and Buck is down with Pimp C
But aint nobody got of a ten in no damn Tennessee
It might be twentyseven or might be twentythree
Dawg and Biz used to come and get it for 16 from me
They had two niggas that were driving shit back
And they were serving TI took his bitch and his Lac his jury and his money and his 50
She had a baby for priest but still my ho
She was translating Spanish with the Mexican
Tryna get a better price T got fucked in the end
She a square now Dawg and Biz both dead
Pussy nigga T got locked in the feds
That was his ferrari in the Juve video
The bitch killed Dawg cause he was fucking his ho
Same time T was fucking Dawg wife
Shawty from the back T a bitch for life
You can see me in the streets bitch better keep steppin
