I got the B twelve beat hard eye style
Wanna fit them girls in mah ride is on
Work somethin twerk somethin
Make the DG see it in trip face it
When I was whipping a wig i could have bought her lag
But i like stacking mah paper and blow the dont you say
When i pimp up on the hog i was a funky dog
Now talking about a beasley cut the fan
When i finally bought a mercedes i could a bought a B
I keep some powder in a yellow and pistol on me
Came home bought a billy could a bought a rolls
Save a hundred and fifty thousand and still trick you hoes
Seventy five thousand a night in the bungalow
I got Peruvian bitches man you can treat yo nose
Do it right dont stop pussy nigga watch ya mouth

Wanna fit them girls in mah ride is on
Work somethin twerk somethin basic
Make the DG see it in tripface it
I got the B twelve beat hard eye style

In his truck like die holiday shooting out at high noon
Under the red light all we knew was a life for a life
Home crey you be tonguing the dime and she be
Playing the pike now get yah mind right hater
You a see em between the king and the pimp
I got the B twelve beat hard eye style
Wanna fit them girls in mah ride is on
Work somethin twerk somethin basic
Make the DG see it in tripface it
