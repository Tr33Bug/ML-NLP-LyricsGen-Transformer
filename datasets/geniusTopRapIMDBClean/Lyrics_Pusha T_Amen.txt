In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night rich wealthy
Or poor with dislike we pray asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind body spirit and faith we pray
Amen
Yeah  amen  you like that right  amen 
I wrote it myself by the way  amen 
Yo Young Jeezy Jizzle Snowman  amen amen 
We gotta give the streets what they want man  amen 
Fuck the goddamn shit  amen 
You gotta get it in bruh lets get it  amen 
You like that dont ya I wrote it myself by the way
And I dont mean to be selfish but I picture myself gettin paid
And you might catch pneumonia cause Im colder than a elf on a sleigh
Uh me and Pusha back on it now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense Im tryin to get paid
Tryna get saved  Too late  time to get paid
Got a gun and a stockin mask niggas thought I was tryna get waves
Ima let all yall niggas pray for it my young niggas knockin off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end only fuckin way Ima pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep tellin me to go hard number one spot you was made for
Yuugh I made more front of the grill got a racehorse
California Crayola red Glow In The Dark like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin in my lane for not knowin that its a landmine
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue Crip or Blood solitaires diamond studs
Like chandeliers Ima flood black Jesus piece like its dipped in mud
Fashion gods notice mine rollerball spikes Im Pokmon
Paris shit Louboutin under bright lights where do you belong
