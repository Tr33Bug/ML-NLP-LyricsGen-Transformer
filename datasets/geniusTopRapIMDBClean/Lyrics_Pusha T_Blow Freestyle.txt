Blow  Freestyle  Lyrics
Malice found religion Tony found prison
Im just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilos got a sibling
Father knows best wash my hands alls forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants Jacksons no room for George
Yeh the fear of Gods in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasnt disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime its revealed
What goes around comes around this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that Im free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but Id rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman say my name and Ill appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole whats my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
Im here now watch how many niggas plans change
First class flights Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models what a motherfuckin life
