Theyre gonna die
Why would I wanna
We was out in Brambleton after Pooh got hit
Club Entourage in that new drop six
Ice thatll snag any new hot bitch
Champagne super soaker screamin Who got this
Beach niggas wanted work that they could move out quick
But my Norfolk niggas they was on some shootout shit
You and I we were different like the two got mixed
Buyin biggies but was ridin on some 2Pac shit
Why would I wanna 
We was both hurt when we see how Q dropped Bish
Said we knew the ledge better we th new plot twist
Who knew your face bin all across the news outlets
Would mean forever I would never talk to you bout shit
Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now the past is your goto now
Shit we really used to roll around
Coppin quarter pounds from the border towns
And shit Ferraris gettin ordered now
Cant water down godfathers to you daughters now
Shit but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now niggas need to tone it down
Why would I wanna 
You would pay sixteen I would pay eighteen
When I paid twentytwo still was a great thing
Laid up countin a million we daydream
Till the plug took back his half thats they change
Who was with you roaming the halls at night pacing
Cause the feds watching them things that we chasing
Sliding doors just like the van on ATeam
Revolvin doors on them whores they playthings
It was much more than foreigns that we were racing
If the past catch your dash no erasing
Black Rari white hood make it a race thing
Who knew our dynasty would end up a JayDame thing
Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now the past is your goto now
Shit we really used to roll around
Coppin quarter pounds from the border towns
And shit Ferraris gettin ordered now
Cant water down godfathers to you daughters now
Shit but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now niggas need to tone it down
Why would I wanna 
It was sad watching dude in Vlad interviews
Really its bout me he channeled it through you
Had a million answers didnt have a clue
Why Michael kissed Fredo in Godfather II
Names they concealed I dont make up shit
This that nowitnesseswrappedinducttape shit
Needed all my niggas just to move your brick
That had me on Brambleton back when Pooh got hit
Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now the past is your goto now
Shit we really used to roll around
Coppin quarter pounds from the border towns
And shit Ferraris gettin ordered now
Cant water down godfathers to you daughters now
Shit but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now niggas need to tone it down
Why would I wanna hold you down
