TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsCall My Bluff Lyrics
Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff

Buffalo shrimps from Mahi Mah's
Coke deals upstairs at the Ramada
The oceanfront motels was popular
And crack was cemented phenomenon
Elected Presidential was on my arm
Red stripe Pradas and on and on
Driving a fiend car dangerous, extremеly armed
Shout to the Branch's, Antoine and Sеan
Some niggas play different, involve your mom
Sister, aunt, niece, duct tape them all
We only in the sport to be LeBrons
When you used to platinum, that gold be bronze
Your favorite rapper's dressing like Comic-Con
These necklaces is different from charm to charm
Buried drug money from lawn to lawn
We learned from the wizards and Poppa Ron's
Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff

Calling my bluff, gon' answer, "Hello"
Service with a smile when I hand out halos
Shotclock shooters, when I point 'em, they go
Now everybody asking, "What happened?" They know (They know)
Rather watch the sunset in Turks and Caicos
Eating conch fritters with chips and queso's
Don't make me call my TTG's with Draco's
Who all got amnesia until the case closed
Sometimes I wish my fanbase was more like J. Cole's
But dope boys gotta be the man like they know
How many more car faxes must get exposed?
Imaginary shipments, fictitious payloads
You should listen to them on the platforms they on
The villains, the killings, no ceilings, I yawn
Niggas acting like we can't pop up, hey Yawn
We specialize in not getting locked up, Akon
"Ahaha, I don't feel like they get that!"

Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
