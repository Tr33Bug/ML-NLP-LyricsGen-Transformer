I wanna talk to all you addicts out there
Thats got yourself a great big Jones
An you done tried all the methadone
An you just cant leave that heroin alone
I wonder have you tried
Dope just touched down Im so grateful
Numbers so low bitch be thankful
They say dont let money change you
Thats how we know money aint you
Bitch I been had bitches been bad
We buy big boats bitch Im Sinbad
Downright sinful bitch we been full
All my dopeboys we like kinfolk
BMore burnt spoon DC glass pipe
VA sent bales bout that trap life
Blew through thousands we made millions
Cocaine soldiers once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas took care children
Lent my pastor build out buildins
Rapped on classics I been brilliant
Now we blend in we chameleons ahh
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin to set me free
Come back baby try me one more time
Ooh baby Im bout to go out of my mind
I cant
Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
Cause nobody else can fuck with me What a showoff
Nigga wrist for wristlets have a glowoff
Fuck it brick for bricklets have a blowoff
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade  Yugh 
White on white thats the testa
Black on black thats the Tesla
See these diamonds in this watch face
All that shit came from pressure
They dont miss you till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancin like a Ying Yang Twin
You cant have the Yin without the Yang my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game Im in  Yugh 
Cant escape the scale if I tried
Interstate traffickings alive
Push
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin to set me free
Come back baby try me one more time
Ooh baby Im bout to go out of my mind
I cant
Still fresh off the boat niggas
Dont make me supersoak niggas
Your life ends up a quote nigga
The good die young all dogs go to heaven
Its really just mommas fallin out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flairs
Cocaine concierge longest runnin trapper of the year
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarains
Is he still in the caravan  No 
Its a mil in the caravan  Whoa 
Richard Mille on a leather band  Ooh 
Behind the wheel like an ambulance  Go 
On my way up to Maryland  Gone 
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin to set me free
Come back baby try me one more time
Ooh baby Im bout to go out of my mind
I cant
Come back baby try me one more time
Ooh baby Im bout to go out of my mind
II cant
