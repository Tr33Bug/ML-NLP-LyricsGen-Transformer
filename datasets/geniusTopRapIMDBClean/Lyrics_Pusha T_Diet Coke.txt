Yesterdays price is not todays price
Like likelike crackcrack like like
Like lilicrack crack crack
Imaginary players aint been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke thats a joke right
Everybody get it off the boat right
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge whats your dope like
If your Benz bigger step it up to Ghost life
Missy was our only misdemeanor
My tunnel visions better under stove lights
You ordered Diet Coke thats a joke right
My workers compensated so they dont strike
Wish me luck see green like Don Bishop
The ones you trust dont change like them chains you tuck
Far as Im concerned whos the best Me and Yezos
Wash then dry so give me all of mine in pesos
Add it up  Add it up 
Your bitches in them pictures but they laser taggin us
They mad at us who wouldnt be
We became everything you couldnt be
Everything your mama said you shouldnt be
The Porsches horses revvin like Look at me
Saddle up
Im still pitchin baby batter up
Imaginary players aint been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke thats a joke right
All you niggas get it off the boat right
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge whats your dope like
If your Benz bigger step it up to Ghost life
The flows untouched the drums is tucked
Drive Cullinan when roads get rough
Snows a must the nose adjust
Young Gs like we Hov and Puff
Best jewelries and hoes we lust
Chanel trinkets and hoesll blush
Crush hearts like pretty boys
And we drivin pretty toys
Extendos will make plenty noise
Crescendo make your car endo
Pierce your car window
Missy was our only misdemeanor
Nike box hold a hundred thou with no insoles uh
The crack era was such a Black era
How many still standin reflectin in that mirror
Lucky me
Imaginary players aint been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke thats a joke right
All you niggas get it off the boat right
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge whats your dope like
If your Benz bigger step it up to Ghost life
