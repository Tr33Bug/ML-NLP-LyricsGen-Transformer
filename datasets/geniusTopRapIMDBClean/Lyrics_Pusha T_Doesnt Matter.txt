This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas that always got something to say
Got some nerve to have an opinion
Renegades
I dont give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents dont matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents dont matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter ohh
Theres a meaning to the kissin of the ring
The gods dont mingle with the mortals
Peasants aint sittin with the kings
Goliath aint worried bout your sling
And Cassius aint bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin bout your dreams my reality
50 birds waitin in the wings
Do it my way I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia it dont matter
Since you talking bout me then lets talk about this money
Lets talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets talk about the fact youll never take nothin from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate Im up and runnin
RG3 nigga be that
Runnin through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it no
I dont give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents dont matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents dont matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter ohh


Attention seekers beware I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since yall claim Im Illuminati tell me why would you try me
Kennedy John F or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day so how the fuck you gon stop me
You lil niggas just dirty mines is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision witch huntin ride for Pac worthy
Im coke boy leanin on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day God
Death is just a Uturn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray
I dont give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents dont matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents dont matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter ohh
I dont give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents dont matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents dont matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter it doesnt matter
It doesnt matter ohh
My Name is my name
