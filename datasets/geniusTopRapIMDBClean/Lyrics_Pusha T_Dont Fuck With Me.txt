Reup gang GOOD Music Def Jam
I love my family
The nerve of you
Hell sit and clip at your lines like he aint heard of you
I seen it happen before that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoein but the whole while cloning
The elephants in the room the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its hers but the whole world knowing
Told niggas its the new god flow
Its that New Testament and the old God knows
And you new niggas dont get to pass go
Ill monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So dont mention me in the same breath Im Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told Id much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin but I cant blame em
Clear the road to the riches but I cant pave em
Put Trey up on your hook still couldnt save em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now Im back to the future my career dejavu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive
Dont fuck with me
You see
Theres a lot of people out there to be fucked with
I am not one
ReUp Gang
Dont fuck with me
Rappers on their sophomores actin like they boss lords
Fame such a funny thing for sure
When niggas start believing all them encores
Im just the one to send you off bonjour
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Skins vs blouses you mirror Prince
Chappelle Show all of you Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy who was for real pennin
The talk dont match the leather
The swag dont match the sweaters
And wolves dont walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all you mall dwellers
Offtherack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old bitches orphans
Daddys MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a sharks fin
Cool Jing on you bitches but Im darkskinned
We walked in seats courtside
Dap Diddy Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open theres much more to Queens
Versace blublockers row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now Im back to the future my career dejavu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive
Pushno shotsbut nothing goes unseen
