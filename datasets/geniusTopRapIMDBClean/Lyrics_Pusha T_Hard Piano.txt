Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I wont let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin Matt Lauercan I live
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paintandsip for like forty
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
Its a nightmare yeah
Im too rare amongst all of this pink hair ooh
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Taptap throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Baselin the bezel
Your bustdown is bustdown and dont match the metal
Lower levels where you settle at
Im the pot callin the kettle black
Where theres no brake pedals at
Between God and where the Devils at
Had to doubledutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the troubles at
Exactly what the games been missin
This fire burns hot as Hells Kitchen
Push
Now thats how the ting go Im back from Santo Domingo
Thats where the kings go down in Santo Domingo
Now thats how the ting go Im back from Santo Domingo
This for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
Cause thats where the kings go down in Santo Domingo
From Honda Accords to Grammy awards yo
Thats where the kings go
I can blow a million dollars into dust
Lord knows how many bottles Ive done bust
Still runnin through the models like Im Puff  MMM 
Confront my problems like Im Ralo in the bluff
Pusha know these politics is paradox
Chillin in a condo full of readyrock
My homie amputated but gon stand for somethin
Im dyin to find a way to get a Grammy from it  Maybach Music 
Watchin my success for some is bittersweet
Always keep the sharpshooters triggers tweaked
Diamonds drippin on me via Tiffanys
All these K9 units still sniffin me
Ignorance versus the innocence
Its not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat  MMM 
And you can spot my hoes by their car keys
Another episode full of atrocities
Its doubleM baby money monopolies  Maybach Music 
You scared to see my face in a fancy place
So why debate my case vs a Nancy Grace
Its flesh and blood til Im fresh as fuck
Still handson sucker press your luck  MM 
Your money gone every other month
My money long so the treasures tucked
Now thats how the ting go Im back from Santo Domingo
Thats where the kings go down in Santo Domingo
Now thats how the ting go back from Santo Domingo
Cause thats where the kings go down in Santo Domingo
Thats where the kings go
