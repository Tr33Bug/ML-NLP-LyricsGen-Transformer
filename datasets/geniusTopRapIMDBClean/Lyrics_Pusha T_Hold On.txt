I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records never sold dope
So I aint hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But Im a thinker methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman no child no witness no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but its Gods face in that mirror
We was made in his image dialing and its much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan blonde hair blueeyed like the Fhrer
The judge and the jury the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We aint the same color clarity of diamond nigga
Nah I aint got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart its as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading no writing made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings we at it again
Just hand me the crown Im active again
Everything that it seems hear my passion again
Was never my dream the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble white walls in my new spot
Four chains big studs a nigga too fly
Top down tank top I think Im 2Pac
So Im labeled the rebel nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings only major league teams
Chasing my paper couldnt fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia should enroll in myself
God body and mind food for the soul
When you feeding on hate you empty my nigga it shows
Follow the codes aint no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song cant be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered niggas grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes aint no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
If you right or you wrong if you riding come on
By the end of this song I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
I got you my nigga hold on
