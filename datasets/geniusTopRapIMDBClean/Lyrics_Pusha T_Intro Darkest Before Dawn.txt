TranslationsEspañolIntro (Darkest Before Dawn) Lyrics

Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy

Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck ‘cause I’m Jack Frost
Of sellin’ that blast off
I’m on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I’m my brother’s keeper, Lord Willin’, keep grindin’
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P, who’s core’s a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it’s gonna kill ‘em
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!
A Pablito le dieron pa’ bajo, but I’m still here, y el otro tipo? he’s running, but I’m still here, I don’t even know why you doing this loco, yo ni se pa' que, but always still right here.
