TranslationsEspaolIntro  Darkest Before Dawn  Lyrics
Espera ven aqu who you wanna be Drug Dealer Demon Rap nigga You tryna save the culture Ay Dios mo You gotta pick one daddy
Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck cause Im Jack Frost
Of sellin that blast off
Im on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace Think Big keep climbing
Reasonable doubt drug era keep climbing
Im my brothers keeper Lord Willin keep grindin
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers I done paid for my friends
Still held back I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late great on me
Put the fears in my peers heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now its murder was the case homie
Im watching this three ring circus 
Old lions dont roar so the clowns aint nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let em run amuck until the king resurface
Then its off with your heads
Wear your little jewels you could floss when youre dead
They take samples of em I make examples of em
Its the thrill of the hunt I keep my mantle covered
Ask Ye whos loyalty more realer
Ask P whos cores a drug dealer
Me and Tim its coming its gonna kill em
The only great I aint made better was J Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga
A Pablito le dieron pa bajo but Im still here y el otro tipo hes running but Im still here I dont even know why you doing this loco yo ni se pa que but always still right here You wanna be like them dont you huh youre not like them Y definitivamente theyre not like us
