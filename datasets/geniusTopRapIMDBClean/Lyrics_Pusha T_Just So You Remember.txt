As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight
Its only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
Just so you remember who you dealing with
The number dont change I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch we built up our villages
Seein you rappers apply for the stimulus
Livin a lie but die for your images
Its guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I aint go to show you what you shoulda did
Tennis chains to hide all my blemishes
My Jokr smile you know who the villain is  Hahahahaha 
Just so you remmber who you dealin with
Look outside the landscape ridiculous
Motion lights surrounded meticulous
Architectural Digest my premises
She just spent a million on the finishes
Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
Army Celine the wardrobe is militant
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids
Just so you remember who you dealin with
The purest snow we sellin white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes these hoes losing innocence
The book of blow just know Im the Genesis
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight
Its only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
Just so you remember who you dealin with
This Pyrex talks but Im the ventriloquist
Language different Im damn near an immigrant
A song with any of you niggas Im disinterested
The needle is sharp but they aint shootin insulin
You missing the point these drums aint Timbalands
Never thought wed go to war
After all the things we saw
Its April Fools Day
Tomorrow never comes until its too late
We fight for the bill you niggas still chipping in
You Google to death the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces
The cane is sugar and cut by Dominicans
Open the box its like ten Christmases
My folks in the box is serving life sentences
I live in a world that never leaves witnesses
Just so you remember who you dealin with


Tomorrow never comes until its too late
