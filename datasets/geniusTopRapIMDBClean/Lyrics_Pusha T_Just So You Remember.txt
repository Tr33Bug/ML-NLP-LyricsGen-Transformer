TranslationsEspañolРусскийPortuguêsJust So You Remember Lyrics
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealing with
The number don't change, I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick, we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch, we built up our villages
Seein' you rappers apply for the stimulus
Livin' a lie, but die for your images
It's guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I ain't go, to show you what you shoulda did
Tennis chains to hide all my blemishes
My Jokеr smile, you know who the villain is (Hahahahaha!)
Just so you remеmber who you dealin' with
Look outside, the landscape ridiculous
Motion lights surrounded meticulous
Architectural Digest my premises
She just spent a million on the finishes
Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
Army Celine, the wardrobe is militant
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids
Just so you remember who you dealin' with
The purest snow, we sellin' white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes, these hoes losing innocence
The book of blow, just know I'm the Genesis
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealin' with
This Pyrex talks, but I'm the ventriloquist
Language different, I'm damn near an immigrant
A song with any of you niggas, I'm disinterested
The needle is sharp, but they ain't shootin' insulin
You missing the point, these drums ain't Timbaland's

Never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

We fight for the bill, you niggas still chipping in
You Google to death, the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces
The cane is sugar and cut by Dominicans
Open the box, it's like ten Christmases
My folks in the box is serving life sentences
I live in a world that never leaves witnesses
Just so you remember who you dealin' with
