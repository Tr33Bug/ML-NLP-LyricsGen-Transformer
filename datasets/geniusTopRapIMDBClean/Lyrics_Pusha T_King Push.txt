This is my time this is my hour
This is my pain this is my name this is my power
If its my reign then its my shower
This pole position I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys block bleeders gold diggers dont stop either
Motivation is misguided if you hit the mark then its not needed
Carry on like a carry on on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me daddy from a complex
Cause her mothers fucker wouldnt marry mom
No excuses no regard step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And Im speaking Spanish like Don Omar
But Im King Push this king push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks
Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eyechart
But thats my fault my details of the sidewalk
For 11 years we seen better years
We was sellin birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress
Cause Im King Push still King Push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks ah
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle insult ya
They name dropping bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Lets have another look just get a little closer
Rage against the machine black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta inside track on the G rap poster
Best Dboy all Im missing is a dash
Difference tween me and Hova
But Im King Push still King Push
I rap nigga bout trap niggas I dont sing hooks ah
