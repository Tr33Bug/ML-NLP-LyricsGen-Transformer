Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
Uh I know that you think Im the one but who doesnt
It comes with the territory when you buzzin
A ball player sold you a dream aint do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt but whos judging
I aint trying to guide you hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirtydollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So no cuffing no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone shes just bluffin
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin
If anybody else do ask we just nothing
Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
Hey mama come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa shoe Balenciaga
If you act right I can match you up proper
If its about a dollar thing big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Dont listen to your best friend she dont matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in seethrough V1 V2
Chanel or Celine however I see you
Christians or Chloe damn them Cs too
You know I play fair Im Daddy Day Care
I know it aint cheap for you to lay here
Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
Lets get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Cant commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame lets push the shame behind us
On the DL pushin my brothers CL
Meet you at the spot you had tint on the TL
Its only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid like my bracelets did
Uh Im from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all cause the money dont last
All them broke niggas lookin puppydog sad
She in that new purse sayin Honey dont ask
Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
