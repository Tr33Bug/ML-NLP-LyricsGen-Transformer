TranslationsEspañolLet Me Love You Lyrics
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Hey mama, come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1, V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn, them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
You might also like
Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all 'cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don’t ask"

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you20Embed
