If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
Im just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got em baby Im Jim Perdue
Cocaines Dr Seuss
We sip Ace out the flutes
Chanel scarves out the roofs
If I never sold dope for you
Then youre ninetyfive percent of who
How forsaken ar the rules
I done paid for all of yous
Th first 48s the clue
Your jail cells made for two
AMGs on auto cruise
The wrist singin autotune
The dope game destroyed my youth
Now Kim Jones Dior my suits
If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
Im just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got em baby Im Jim Perdue
Cocaines Dr Seuss
Coca leaf and potpourris
Chains over Le Coq Sportif
Dont brag bricks to me
If they aint tell you to bring your skis
My Patek hers petit
The triple play be E Phillips
Bird feathers done made me chief
Whatever happened to black marquise
Might buy your bitch a jeep
I can make you lose your sleep
You millionaires on just TV
Now make it make sense to me
If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
Im just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got em baby Im Jim Perdue
Cocaines Dr Seuss
