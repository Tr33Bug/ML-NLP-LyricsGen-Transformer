Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang go and make it bang
Gettin followed by them hollows go and make it bang
Niggas aint been to church in a minute
But its funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen
You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role its easy acting like Mitch
Paid In Full was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water
Yeah while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh Im drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it Rodriguez
The illusion of money we dont believe in
You ask me Tyga looking like a genius
Im Kim Jong of the crack song
Gil ScottHeron to the black poem
Woo the revolution will be televised
Cause we done see all and they telling lies
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang go and make it bang
Gettin followed by them hollows go and make it bang
Niggas aint been to church in a minute
But its funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen


You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role its easy being my bitch
Its only right for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns I emboss your wrist
The minimums niggas aint synonyms
Dual exhausts driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didnt know what the goal was
Shine remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse controlled by the iPad
Ahhh my living room rap scream crack money
I dont trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang go and make it bang
Gettin followed by them hollows go and make it bang
Niggas aint been to church in a minute
But its funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen
Niggas talking it but aint living it
Two years later admitting it all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why Im still talking dope why not
The biggest rappers in the game broke voil
They say its hate but its these welldressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh you aint know you got coached through it
Wooo the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Haaa the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard king him
Yeah this is gun slingers and Goyard
Uh this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why Im still here
Im Americas worst nightmare
Night night nigga
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang go and make it bang
Gettin followed by them hollows go and make it bang
Niggas aint been to church in a minute
But its funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen
