TranslationsEnglishMillions Lyrics
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
This that shit that y'all wanted
This shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga
And y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost
Church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid
'Cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came
For that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in Blu-Ray
And these black diamonds like Boondocks

I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians
Have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!

Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet

I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door
Roll through the hood like task force
Fast forwardâ€“oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs
And we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it32Embed
