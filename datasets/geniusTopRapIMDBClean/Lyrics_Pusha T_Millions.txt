Im haunted by horror stories wannabe home owners
Horrible outcome a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted cried on every visit
Im cryin sayin his name ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neimans niggas committin treason
Soft loafer preferred frost organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20 my choppas say Im the shit

Roll through the hood like task force
Fast forwardoops They say they wanna see proof
My record sales aint much as theirs
And we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
Im just keepin yall on yall toes
Dope boys gold mine
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin of when niggas made a killin
Hidin choppas in the closet half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter Arm  Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin all yall bitches
