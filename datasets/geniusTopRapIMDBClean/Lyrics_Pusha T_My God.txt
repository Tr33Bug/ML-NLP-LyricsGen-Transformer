I cant be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow so that my core follows
We dont mourn for the dead nigga we pour bottles
Drown sorrows ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother Nigga Ill be damned
Gator at my mommas house welcome to zombie land
A hustlers paradise a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didnt bat an eye I at it kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heavens door they wont hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smokers face
Theres no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and youre four wheeling right
You know youre up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
Im a wizard at it nigga heres the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic
Yes My God
The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here so Ill need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain no gain nigga
They say Im heating up welcome to the flame nigga
No matter the success still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came nigga
Aerodynamic roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price cash under handed
The 012 a year early Im a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
Theyll be no waiting I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
Im here now nigga pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Its the new god flow aint it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth get reacquainted
