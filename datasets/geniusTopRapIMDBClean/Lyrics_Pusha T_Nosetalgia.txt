WWWWhat is it
Twentyplus years of selling Johnson  Johnson
I started out as a babyfaced monster
No wonder theres diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm  Hammer and a Mason jar thats my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me Starter jacket that was twotoned
Four lockers four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller cutting school with his jewels on
Couldnt do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood Im a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago If he dies he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre if he rides he rides
Throwing punches in his room if he cries he cries
We dont drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who gon fuck his bitch the best
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital my only Timex
Nigga this is timeless simply cause its honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon Says Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying  dead yuugh
You better change what comes out your speaker
You better change chchchange
Deedeedee dahdee dahdee deedee dahdee dayah  What is it 
You wanna see a dead body
Instrumentals from my mommas Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh wee cut me some slack weed never did that
This was different geez Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten niggas dont pay attention
And when its tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarterpiece to a four and a half
Took a L started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open taco meat laying on his gold
I said Daddy one day Ima get you right with thirtysix zips
One thousand  grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it Deebo on perimeter
He said Son how come you think you be my connect
I said Pops your ass is washed up with all due respect
He said Well nigga then show me how it all makes sense
Go figure motherfucker every verse is a brick
Your son dope nigga
Now reap what you sowed nigga  Please reap what you sowed nigga 
I was born in 87 my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that yall was smoking is my profession
Lets get it
You better change what comes out your speaker
You better change chchange chchange chchange chaange
You better change what comes out your speaker
ThThThThThey must be on the dick of who
ThThThThThey must be on the dick of who
