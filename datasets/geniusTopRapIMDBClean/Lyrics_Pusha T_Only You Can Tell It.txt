Its coming clear Ive noticed
Its a different face youre showing
Its another welcome back
I dont imagine it could be this way so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Its coming clear Ive noticed
Its a different face youre showing
Its another welcome back
I dont imagine it could be this way so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Two sides what the gamell do
Bring money fame to you
Stackin mine nigga ye high
Standin on it like a pedestal
Couldnt imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches they skinny dippin
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial one ocular thats CBS
Aston Martin DBS James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since ARod
Hands dirty like Ason Im grindin nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on 500 horses race on
Coke ties that coke dries its cemented its baked on
Eghck Thats based on the life of a nigga who aint said nothin
Trunk tight trunk white cant relate if you aint bled nothin
Now that there said somethin dont make me have to dead nothin
You askin me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin
Its coming clear Ive noticed
Its a different face youre showing
Its another welcome back
I dont imagine it could be this way so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
