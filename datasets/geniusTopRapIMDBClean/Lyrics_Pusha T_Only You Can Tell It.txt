Only You Can Tell It Lyrics

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why13Embed
