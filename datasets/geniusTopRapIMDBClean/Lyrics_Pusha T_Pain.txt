Yeah yeah yeah
I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Im just doing my thing
Getting money baby girl gold chains
I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I aint never did a thing
Getting money rocking chains
Well never feel the same
We the thugs in the game
I dont never feel pain
Eighteenwheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money screaming Encore
Spending nights with a prime whore
But thats the bitch that youre blind for
Celebrating on a whim nigga
Pain is Pac Above the Rim nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem niggas
Cause she was there when it was dim nigga
She wasnt fucking none of them niggas
So now were even like a hem nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda  La Madrina 
Might as well they gon nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and its war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out youre poor
As the Feds knock at your door


I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Im just doing my thing
Getting money rock a bunch of gold chains and
I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Im just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Im just doing my thing
Getting money rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring
Pain is joy when it cries
Its my smile in disguise
Its what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Yuugh
This is drug dealer brilliance
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe dont quest like love
Came in this bitch with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
Its no risk without gain
Its no trust without shame
Its no us without caine
Push my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on apron
Treyeight on coulda been Trayvon
But instead I chose Avon
Powderface like a geisha
Arm  Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two watch the brick kiss and makeup  woo 
Its a match made in heaven
All thats missing is the reverend
All thats missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message
I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Im just doing my thing
Getting money rock a hundred gold chains and
I dont never feel pain
Cause I done felt too much pain
Im just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Im just doing my thing
Getting money rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring
