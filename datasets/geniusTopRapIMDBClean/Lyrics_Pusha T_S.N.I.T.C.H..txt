TranslationsEspaolSNITCH Lyrics
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Well the walls are talkin to me and I know you think Im wrong
But sorry nigga Im tryna come home hey
Now when the phone start to clickin your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but that man wont let go
Oh my nigga say it aint so
Now we speakin on some niggas that he say he aint know
We used to steal dirt bikes dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated gettin money on the same blocks
But things changed and we aint end up in the same box
Hearin whispers it aint adding up
Givin you the jailhouse talk but you aint mad enough
I never thought Id be the last man standin up
I never thought Id had have to question Were you man enough
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Tellin all your cellies how come I aint sitting next to you
Yeah see I can read between the lines
So its awkward when you call and I gotta press 5
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
I think the Feds are lookin through me cant you hear it in my tone
So then sorry nigga Im tryna come home hey
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writins on the walls
Its like I hear you smilin when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I dont be the next to fall
They sayin Terrion been getting money while Im gone
And wont he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home
Nah he selling cars itd be him and Lil Rome
Im just tryna offset what he was sayin on my phone
Nowadays niggas dont need shovels to bury you
Pointin fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor
I just sit and wonder play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightnin then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama she aint even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her kings now weak sayin
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Well the walls are talkin to me and I know you think Im wrong
But sorry nigga Im tryna come home hey


Lets talk real niggas lets speak real nigga
How many niggas you knew snitchin you aint killed nigga
Covered his own tracks he didnt care that
We had a legacy he killed I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is gettin stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesnt stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh from great friends now its no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facin once he told me that
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
Sorry nigga Im tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me cant you hear it in my tone
So then sorry nigga Im tryna come home hey
