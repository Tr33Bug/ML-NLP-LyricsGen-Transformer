Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Lets talk this payola  Payola 
You killed Gods baby when it wasnt his will
And blood spill we cant talk this shit over  This shit over 
The Lord is my shepherd I am not sheep
I am just a short stones throw from the streets
I bring my offerin I will not preach
Awaken my demons you can hear that man screaming
Im no different than the priest priest
Santera  Santera Santera Santera 
They say that death comes in threes how appropriate  Propriate 
Triple back they rush in like Soviets  Soviets 
At the Kremlin
Searchin for the green like a Gremlin presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in  Woo 
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds the Glock hollers
The three of yall too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves watchin The Untouchables
We dont do vegetables niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef then we heat em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring think of doublecrossin a priest
Hail Mary repeat after me
Santera
Ya te vas a la maana  Maana 
Haah los ngeles te esperarn
Es el fuego que yoconozco
Es el fuego que yo
Ya te vas a la maana  Maana 
Haah los ngeles te esperarn
Es el fuego que yoconozco
Es el fuego que yo


Of all the things Ive ever paid for
Know that its no price tag when I wage war
Its no more to pray for niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep they told me the days gone
You listenin DeVon
As Im talkin to your spirit for Gods sakes
Im dealin with heartbreak
Checkin my ego Im livin with lost faith
Im backin this hit nigga you ever seen Shark Tank
I paid em in small bills all of em small face
I bet when we draw blood you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts my shooters give all thanks
And all praise no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey its probably better this way
Its cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santera
Ya te vas a la maana  Maana 
Haah los ngeles te esperarn
Es el fuego que yoconozco
Es el fuego que yo
