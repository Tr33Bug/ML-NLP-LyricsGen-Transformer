Come on lets toast the champagne this ones for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man it feels good everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning no vision on quitting

Raised round killers we just happy to be here
Spot em got em let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic voodoo Moulin Rouge
Thats a tactic that they use fuck em high then suck em dry
