Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in em
In elevator condos on everything I love
This aint a wave or phase cause all that shit fades
This lifestyles forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and hes great
Ovens full of cakes that he bakes still spreadin paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin clients movin weight
Just add water stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine make our bottle servers race
These are the games we play we are the names they say
This is the drug money your exnigga claim he makes
To all of my young niggas I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes along with the side bitches
They try to coexist end up wishin youd die bitches
Stood on every couch in the A at the black party
No jewelry on but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we dont need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin like a bank code
These are the games we play we are the names they say
This is the drug money your exnigga claim he makes
Aint no stoppin this champagne from poppin
The draws from droppin the laws from watchin
With Ye back choppin the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This aint for the conscious this is for the mudmade monsters
Who grew up on legends from outta Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton the scale never lies
Im twopointtwo incentivised
If you aint energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This aint really for you this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldnt stop then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who aint sinkin
Chess moves are made my third eye aint blinkin
Stay woke nigga or get out
Still pull them whips out still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music all my niggas had to live out
These are the games we play we are the names they say
This is the drug money your exnigga claim he makes yah
