Its the blackout Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more I took the last spot
ReUp Gang P the nigga Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole nother level then you add fame
Thats a whole nother devil legit drug dealer
Thats a whole nother bezel the carbon Audemar
Thats a whole nother metal but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin like the rebels UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal I let you niggas settle  Yeah 
Trouble on my mind

Pharrell said get em so I got em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game Im a problem
Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French Im going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr Lipschitz has been trippin
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um well not really its getting kinda chilly
Lets hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked getting jiggy with it in BelAirs richest
With a bag of pills couple berries and a biscuit


Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Im a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers two Glocks cocked screamin West side
With the speakers blastin a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli youre silly
Thinkin that this preme wasnt free willy
The feeling is neutral the gang is youthful
And fuckin tighter than Chad Hugos pupils its Wolf Gang and the
With the ReUps a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaines a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin it does
This is for the critics who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds same symmetry
And this black art see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game you make enemies youll never finish me
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
