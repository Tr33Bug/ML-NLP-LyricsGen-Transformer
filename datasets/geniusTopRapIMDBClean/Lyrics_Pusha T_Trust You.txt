These women aint shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl you different
When youre not around it feels like somethings missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl Ill trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money girl
Started out as just a fuck mission
Whod have thought I wouldve fucked with ya
Dope boy they got trust issues
Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later we in the villa suites
Top back we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes but you didnt cheat
Cold nights when you couldnt sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
CClass helped you see past
All them other hoes and that they niggas weak
Whoo Im good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
Its all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I dont blame her I dont change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know shes sponsored
Whoo You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that
We turnt up we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
These women aint shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl you different
When youre not around it feels like somethings missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl Ill trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money girl
Locked phones past tense
Pass codes we past this
Pass time Presidential
Rolexes both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds we Bowflexing
Pitch dope touch down
Both sports Im Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting thats you
My bitch stunting thats me
I break it down then break her off
Im breaking bread and thats key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking  your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that Im balling
You still know that Im all in
Your ex nigga your next nigga
Gon hate the fact that Im spoiling
Whoo But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that
We turnt up we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
These women aint shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl you different
When youre not around it feels like somethings missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl Ill trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money girl
Please dont mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring with your bowlegged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacksll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
Butll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play acki
And again I say I like these hoes
