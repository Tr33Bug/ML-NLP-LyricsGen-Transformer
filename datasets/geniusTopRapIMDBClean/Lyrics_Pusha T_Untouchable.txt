Lyrically Im untouchable uncrushable
Blunted in a 600 blunted in a 600
Untouchable uncrushable
Blunted in a 600 blunted in a 600
Yuugh I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2 I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it the wrist is magic
The left is Patek Philippes replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless its getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Cant you see my Total Pam Kima Keisha
Im aiming for the moguls why yall niggas aiming at the locals
And rap niggas broke like them theyre mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like interior gauze
It feels like still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceilings open I CrossFit the coca
Yuugh Its a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and aint nothin rented
Yeah wearing DriFit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money I dont bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that dont bounce
The president of GOOD Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that dont bounce
Im in the score of these movies Im losing count
Mu you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me 8 Mile fame
Selling Eminem to him and em
White to the Blacks Im a villain in
The Rolls Royce playing peekaboo with the emblem
Lets talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix Narcos
Part on the side of my fro like Im Pablo
No hablo I sell blow
Lone wolf no Tonto head honcho
Yuugh lets take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
Its looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers I flooded the Jess I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight I done ran it off
Im walking on water I took the sandals off
Tell AE to turn the cameras off Push
