Yo Niggas be on the mic they be all serious
Its good to be serious but effortless shit
Effortless effaefortless Mmmhmm
Turn my music up Duro Yo yo you my hero
Make the shit get louder Even more in my headphones Louder
Uh Sweetheart shake yo ass cheeks
Bust it Mmmhmmm Mmmhmmm
We gon knock it down and put this
Rock solid Amplified shit up
It hurts like a situp
So you betta send a letta to the betta
We cut the bank and takin all the bankin chedda
Girls get prettyed up
Then they comin out the club Rap cats lock it up
Worldwide vision where
Everybody sees clear
I could get you ten here
Uh Makes no fuss Keep my shit plush
Compliment I get blushed Thats just how a brotha is
Big Willy kids and we really run our jibs
Ladies breathe easy Let your man please thee
Uh Takin rhymes to another zone
Is your mother home Cause we can get the moans
And stay strickly on a rhythmic notion and
Keep the joint close for the commotion and
Keep movin around Movie stars
Buy a little car buy out the bar
All in  for the people who move wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the way we work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be
All in  for the people who roll wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the people who work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be
Yeah Yeah yeah yeah what
We do it alive blowin the spot of this
Showin to prove what rap is  What is it 
Marauder pass the blue moon
Hit chu wit the ill tune
Ass cheeks move wit the help of my jacket bloom
Insert the veteran
Who consecutively come wit shit yet again
On the dance floor chicks get horny
Hopin that they all move on me
Word for REAL for real
Do it hard for the love of the game
Pull your card and Im askin yo name bitch
JayDee be champion
Tip be stylin and definin yo chick best companion
Id advise you to fix your self for real
And do your shit wit more zeal  More zeal 
We in the mix and its thickenin
My rhyme and its tickin in
The hatin and the shit is so sickenin
Picasso original  Riginal 
You forgazy and the shit amaze me
Sharpen your contrast and put a little color in it
High Define your screen and put this brotha in it


All in  for the people who move wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the way we work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be
All in  for the people who roll wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the people who work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be
All in  for the people who move wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the way we work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be
All in  for the people who roll wit me
All in  for the nights of ecstasy
All in  for the people who work and play doin it
Everyday This is how I need to be  Need to be
