She only likes it when its hot She doesnt like the cold
She said I got a bright idea Lets go to Mexico
500 in the bank things are looking bad
Imagine if we gotta eat things are looking sad
Barely in love  repeat   chorus 
She looked into the sun and said Whats on your mind
Whee Ha lookatiaa lookatiaa sun shining all the time  sun shining all the time 
She picked up the fan and let the trailer go
She only likes it when its hot Doesnt like it when its cold
When you really think about it love is truly powerful
The undeniable force that makes it magnetic
And you cant explain it you do what you do
Cant noboday play the fool like  something something something 
Barely in love  repeat   chorus
