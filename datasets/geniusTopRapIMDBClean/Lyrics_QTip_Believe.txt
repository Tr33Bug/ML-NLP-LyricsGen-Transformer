I believe thats love thats love
I believe thats love
I believe thats love thats love
I believe thats love
I believe love love
Uh of the things we believe
Theres a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves
And we got to hold firm when fateful sight conceiving
Why doubt your plans Cause its all worth believing
We can make it work do believe that
Leave mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact by tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves into the world into the rap game
Emcees are miserable their music should be leaving mics maimed
Man look we holding out for the truth
If we alone and aloof we gon hold for the proof
Man put it in believing believe in believing
Seeing aint believing its the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other put the question to the system
They promising returns Then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for Renaissance to reawaken what is withered
Belief can confirm make it is what it isnt
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didnt
I believe thats love
I believe thats love thats love
In the land of makebelieve time to make unbelief believable
Taking belief to the realm of the real
Believing this shit thats forcefed through the media
Believing its real when its really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that dont believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be weary of them theories carry on
People find belief when they dont find identity
Believe in your friends dont believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbelief right in front of you
Troops on the other side what you gon do
Oooh oooh oooh heeey
Ooh thats love thats love
Oooh oooh oooh heeey
Ooh thats love thats love
I believe
I believe
I believe
