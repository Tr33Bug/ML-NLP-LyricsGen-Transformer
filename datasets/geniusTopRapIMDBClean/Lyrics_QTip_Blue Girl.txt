Looking in your eyes and its sparkling
Listen to your laugh its disheartening
I can see your common sense its clear to me
I can tell youre hurting its plain to see
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be blue girl
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be blue girl
Dont be blue girl
Wanna let you know how youre making me feel
Got my head spinning like a ferris wheel
We can ride  until its shangrila
When we get there I can marry ya
Got my head spinning like a wonder wheel
Said I wanna let you know how youre making me feel
Making me feel
All you gotta do to soothe your pain
Close your sparkle eyes and chant to me
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be
Youre a blue girl
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be
Dont be blue girl
Girl
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be
Youre a blue girl
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Dont be
Dont be blue girl
Girl
Wait a minute you got brains in your head
Then why you got that pain in your head
Always testing folks and always have a reason
Blame the pain from before the sight is never leaving
Them self help books and that meditation
Cant set you free you still have hesitation
Been trained through pain theres love
Most of us have sailed above
Pain games and lighting old flames
Girls being blue is such a shame
Taking secrets with you to the grave
Little girl its you I cant save
Playing games and lighting old flames
Girls being blue is such a shame
Yeah yeah the birds
