Come on
Ummah Ummah Ummah Ummah
A hard time if your motion is still
Let me move some things around because the lyrics is ill
Abstractyou know my stiggidy in here  yeah 
Niggas get on and swear its they fuckin year
But yo your girl just moved
To the joint in the club in the car if it groove
Broad look the movement is on
Mild mannered mamis in Victoria thongs uh
I get my rhyme on thus
Guaranteed to make it right if your night is a bust  yeah yeah 
You Vivrant and you fresh and all
Original to say the least and youve impressed Kamaal  come on 
Rappers start then they stall
Findin it very hard to make it over the wall
Hey get your weight up my motto you heard
And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words uh
So girls move it around
If you see your main dog give a brother a pound
And just uh
Breathe and Stop for real and give it what you got and just uhh
Breathe and Stop for real and give it what you got
Give it what you got give it what you got
If you on the block then give it what you got
A thug a thrill you as mean as the eyes  say word 
I wanna feel you them big ass thighs
Your Prada dress or your Gucci bag
With the Polo jeans over doobibag uh
Yo hold the door aight
We comin through Tribe beef hold it down for the night

Turn it over the page
Usherin all of yall to a brand new age where  yeah

Everbody get right to the pitter the patter  come on 
Makin moves settin precedence
Enter in your residence the whole scene is decadence
And the feelin is true

So lets go for the ride
Strap yourself in tight and if you bonafied then just uh
Breathe and Stop for real and give it what you got and just uhh

Millenium on your mind are you runnin out of time
Hope you skippin every line because Im gettin mine
Move it around a bit again

Eye to eye ma and toe to toe  toe to toe

All my peoples no matter the creed
