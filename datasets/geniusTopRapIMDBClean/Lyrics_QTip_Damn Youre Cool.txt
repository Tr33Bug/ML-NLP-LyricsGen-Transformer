Damn
Youre so cool that youre frigid
Cool
Gotta loosen up so you can get with it
Damn
It could be simple if you focus
Cool
Can you feel that magic hocus pocus
Damn
Youre so cool
We sipping in my car and Im thinking to myself
That we could do something else
That this doesnt have to end
But I have to be cool
er heads that will prevail
Let me think of something else
Theyre taking wind out my sail
As I peripherally watch you move around
I could see you peripherally watch me move around
And we in the same shoes
And Im far from eloquent
In fact I freeze
Im silent
Could you please intervent
With some else  good joke
I dont even care damn
Look at you youre pretty yo
The way youre sitting there
You smile and I say what up
You say Nothing
You cool but I think thats pretty clear
I guess Im cool if Im here right
Why yall fuckin with the kid
How come every time she near
always disappear
My demise  is imminent
Im turning up the song
Maybe when the chorus ends
I can think of something strong
Like


I said I gotta use the bathroom
You wanna come inside
Yeah I guess
Dont stress
You aint going outside
What a night
Look at her light
Her aura not free
I can kinda feel the heat
Now Im low in the seat
Open the door
She offers me her couch and some water
Normal hospitality
I figure that Ill order
Acknowledging acceptance
Seems her space is well kept
And she looks I look away
Starts to chuckle
Then expects
a moment
Her with ease
Yo shes such a cool breeze
That its actually disarming
Im not Jay or Prince Charming
Just a bit unchic
And a little too unique
On top of being really cool
Yo you know she really sweet
And the CD player runs
A familiar tune we hum
Then she tells me that its 8
Of course she compliments her day
Starts to move a little closer
Aint no room here on the sofa
Starts to move in
Let me lose this silly grin
Damn
Hey you you are so cool to me
I got a whole on my mind
And I wonder why youre here with me
Damn
Hey you you are so cool to me
I got a whole on my mind
And I wonder why youre here with me
Damn
Youre too cool for me baby
Youre too cool for me baby
Damn
Youre too cool for me baby
Youre too cool for me baby
Damn youre so cool
