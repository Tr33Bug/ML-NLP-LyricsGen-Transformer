The people at the label say they want something to repeat
But all my people really want something for the streets
So keep hooking  Hey yall whats goin on 
So keep hooking  Its time yo word is bond 
So keep hooking  Lets do what we must do 
So keep hooking  Ah ah ah lets hear it for 
Keep keep
Who can make it up Dark ages here in rap
And the constant conversation has been lets bring it back
Corny rap style niggas they lack the pedigree
Deep waters they be in when they are just the manatee
Who me I am unaffected the Whale the Hammerhead
The magnanimous decision unanimous I am fed
What you looking at Wait I can help you with that
The formidable unforgettable painting Abstract
On the wall amongst them all from Warhol to JeanMichel
A commodity hot property heres the morning bell
Guantanamo Bay and niggas deferring routes
Your soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
But homie whats that about You should revisit your scheme
Before the schemin seems real reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours you aint commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem we seeing that in the door
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
The wiliest wittiest on the low we the grittiest
Taking the task these barbaric insurgents
Who nurseryrhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures
Man what could give you such a naive belief
Theres examples all around of careers being brief
The Luke Cage of the loose leaf page run and hide
Comin out in the yard bona fide to be hard
So keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking keep keep
So keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking
Keep hooking keep keep
As if we reading pressures higher we should all be that inspired
Too just lift it and take it higher peep the name thats on the flyer
The Midnight Marauder low end theoretical
Ring tone rappers rockin shades are forgettable
Phantom of the rapper  Boo  Yo you Puss in Boots
Energies electricute looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MCs we combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement a real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host
You need to open up wide while we give you the douse
