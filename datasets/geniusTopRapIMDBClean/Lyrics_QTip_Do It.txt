Hmmm so youre the one theyre talkin about
Let me see if this is real
When I do it eyes lookin at me when the
Music should be the only thing you see
Its the score to a cinematic oddity
Lettin off shit hit your ass repeatedly
Acrobatic wha Ill pull something through your chestpiece
Before she came home pitstopped breast be
Watched the movie and smoked a philly and
Took a hit of D She actin all silly and
I pull the brothers in depressed situations
When the thang hit the phere we risin up to the occassion
Youre killin me wit petty little rap beef
No fingerprints is how my expertass be
While Im at it Imma stand my ground righthere
Spotlight where the chicks is found
You see this littleass club we in Yo its
Mine intertwine wink your bun do it to the drum
Yeah thats alright
But I know you can do better than that
Cmon come harder
Aiiight then
I guess we stand the same ground same
Page and wanna freak shit
I wanna eat it watch you beat it cum reaal hard than repeatin Yo
The frivolous rap song he rap about is no good
Remove all the crap about my dogs is all in for the national
No passion then I guess they be cashin out
I keep my eyes on things and
I keep my shine on BLING
My peoples aint nothin to toy wit
Professional leavin a boy stiff
You doin all while youre really talkin
You need to get gun or get walkin
This greedyass country we in I guess its
Mine intertwine wink ya bun do it to the drum
3x 
What chu really wanna do
I wanna really do it right
What chu really wanna do
Grab ya hands hug ya tight
For real
For real
Well what chu feel
Well what chu feel
We can
Do it Do it Do it
Do it Do it Uh


Do it Do it
Do it Do it
Do it Do it
Do it Do it Do it Do it
So I was wondering what would happenhow would you feel if
Icame inside your bedroom I took off all your clothes and
Took all mines off And uh I got the portable DVD thing
Andgot theright connections I stick it in and put on top
Your spa basing to get you all fucked up over the bounce And
Then you can take it off and then
