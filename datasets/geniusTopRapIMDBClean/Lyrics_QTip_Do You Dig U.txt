Are you runnin late
Did you show em love
Even if you didnt there will never be another
Like you
Did you write the hit
Did you hit the bong
Even if you did it wit your friend under covers
Its you
Maybe it was on a strong run
Either way actin like get it done
For the lovin it was all one
Cuz girl you know it takes one to know one but
Do Do you dig you
Do Do you dig you
Did you drink the drink
Talkin up the sun
Fightin off the dragon when its lookin in the mirror
At you
Workin all day
Playin all night
All I wanna do it just get a little hit up
To you
Its you
Do you dig you
