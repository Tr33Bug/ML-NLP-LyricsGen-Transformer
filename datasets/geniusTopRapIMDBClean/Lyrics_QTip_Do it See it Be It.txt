 Bonus song after End of Time
For real
Erybodys a star erybody shine
Follow your heart and not mankind
For real for real
Im bout to do my thing to shine
So everybody Shine cmon
Its not luck that Im sittin here spittin for yall
Preordained by Allah that Im hittin for yall
Growin up on the New York concrete lookin
Lilke a little snotty dish of prodigy cookin
They called me Little Man all in the boulevard
When I was young my family used to party hard
Games of Run catch kiss turned to Run catch hump
The illest niggas was Richard Pryor and Ronnie Bump
Skinned knees from being badass little boys
Police sirens and baby screams was average noise
HipHop came the ghetto copped the soundtrack
Street poetry to tracks could you beat that
Malik Taylor introduced it to me
He said Forget Benny Hill nigga lets MC
Twelve years old rhymin in the back room
For echoes we used to rhyme in the bathroom
RunDMC Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh
The Juice Crew rule but whos this nigga KRS
Reference points too many to wish for
Battlin niggas on trains I stay raw
Never let my dream die
I was happy and high going to Alis in BedStuy
We made our first demo tape
Excited like a muhfucka lookin for our first break
I know you can do it
Be about it yall
Listen to the story I tell yo for real
I know you can see it
Use my life as an example
Do it and see it and be nobody else
Jungle Brothers De La they gave me little light
In Top Three Feet Buddy that was aiiight
One year later the Tribe was initiated
Bonita came it was wild how she dominated
Can I Kick It parlayed us to our next phase
So drunk in those days I truly was amazed
How I got up enough to make tunes
People cheered me
It was foreign then came Low End Theory
People quickly recognized who we are
Phife is ill and Busta is a superstar
Tours with PE Naughty and the Geto Boys
Arsenio Hall women then were evil toys
Whisperin hate inside my brothers virgin ears
Tryin to hurt but yo we stood amongst the tears
Midnight was even tighter now look at us
Condoms is on the rider stored on the bus
It got funky right here I had to save my life
In the snow after the show I had a fight wit Phife
Moved to a land to get away but back home
Jive was irkin us it sent me through a danger zone
The good thing I found Allah in the process
An angel appeared wit sneaky ways and gave me stress
Now what am I to do
My albums platinum but Im still feelin blue cmon


Yeah 
You can do it
Makin my way the wilderness has grown fierce
Gumption and my heart both of them was pierced
Crashed my truck didnt think Id make it out
Had a hit on my life he thought I screwed his wife
Plus my house burned down me and Ang was in it
My crew was tired and I knew we had to end it
But through all of this Im still here
Take notes and let hope floats
Im still here take note and let hope float
Im still here take notes and let hope float
You can do the same shit that Im doin
You can do the same thing that Im doin
Uhhuh
Im still here take note let ituhhah
Still here take notes and let it float aha
Still here takeand let it
You can do the same thing Im doin thing that Im doin
Still here take notes and let it float
