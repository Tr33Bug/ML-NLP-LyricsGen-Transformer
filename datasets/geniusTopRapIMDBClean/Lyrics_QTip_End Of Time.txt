Just feelin things out for real ya know
Just wanna do me for real ya know
No reason to make it complicated for feelin agitated
You love it or you hate itfuck it
Desperation jumpin off of street corners and
Hustlas lookin for runs like Pop Warner and
Local state officialsman they out of touch
Getting money for some aiyo aint nothin much
But yolet them tell it we smoke it and we sell it
You dont understand so dont gel it
You sneakin souls just for phat diamond golds
Cuz our lady friends have likings for designer clothes
People in my hood thinkif Im lookin raggedy then the cat is just a weakling
In the very fake chain of oppressionthe television taught me any lesson its
Image is Nothing but yo I got a thirst
Nothing but yo I got a thirst
Nothing but yo I got a thirst
Whats worse  Your rings or your purse
All aboard  All aboard  Make your way to the back there Hey you  Step lively  Women and
Children first Whats wrong with you
The world is coming to an end
Come on now were looking at the end  Theres not enough room for freakin everybody  We have to leave all of our paraphernalia behind  Come forward wankers  All of those wankers  Come on lets go  This way  Come on now lot  Were looking at the end  Lets go  Move it to the back there  Come on now lets go
Buck that bum back
Bum dick broke back
Baghdad bomb back
Bum dick right back
Dark dick broke back
Right back bomb that
Bum dick bomb back
Bomb back
Its kinda scary you see
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a breath
Hell it could be your last
Theres so much shit around us
Things we cant even see
If this is end of the line
Thats where I wanna be  repeat 4xs 


End of the line
End of time  repeat 4xs
