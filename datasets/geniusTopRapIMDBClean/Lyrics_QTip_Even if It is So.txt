Even if It is So LyricsShe work at Mickey D's from 10 to 5, Walmart 6 to 12
Saving up enough for school, her little girl is doing well
Daddy is a walking bum, smoking weed, drinking rum
Couldn't leave her if I tried
I see her light is on inside
Let's build...
She in the back room greasing up
Friday night is heating up
Young cats trickin' up
Dancing so they give it up
Best girl, workin' nerve
And you know for what it's worth
She's workin towards a better life
Regardless if she works at nights
Let's build...and the people go..
And even if she is, I dig her so...
Even if she is so...I dig her so
She work from Mickey D's from 10 to 5, Walmart 6 to 12
Saving up enough for school, her little girl is doing well
Daddy is a walking bum, smoking weed, and drinking rum
Couldn't leave her if I tried
I see her light is on inside
Let's build...
She in the back room greasing up
Friday night is heating up
Young cats trickin' up
Dancing so they give it up
Best girl, workin' nerve
And you know for what it's worth
Shes workin' towards a better life
Regardless if she workin' nights
Lets build...
I'm just an arty music gigolo
Life goes without me though
If you have some pay for me
I will come and play for thee
As long as I know she there
I don't even really care
'Cause even though our lives aren't right
We still see that better light
Let's build....

Something about your sweetness)
Even if she is so...even if she is so...1Embed
