She work at Mickey Ds from 10 to 5 Walmart 6 to 12
Saving up enough for school her little girl is doing well
Daddy is a walking bum smoking weed drinking rum
Couldnt leave her if I tried
I see her light is on inside
Lets build
She in the back room greasing up
Friday night is heating up
Young cats trickin up
Dancing so they give it up
Best girl workin nerve
And you know for what its worth
Shes workin towards a better life
Regardless if she works at nights
Lets buildand the people go
And even if she is I dig her so
Even if she is soI dig her so
She work from Mickey Ds from 10 to 5 Walmart 6 to 12
Saving up enough for school her little girl is doing well
Daddy is a walking bum smoking weed and drinking rum
Couldnt leave her if I tried
I see her light is on inside
Lets build
She in the back room greasing up
Friday night is heating up
Young cats trickin up
Dancing so they give it up
Best girl workin nerve
And you know for what its worth
Shes workin towards a better life
Regardless if she workin nights
Lets build
Im just an arty music gigolo
Life goes without me though
If you have some pay for me
I will come and play for thee
As long as I know she there
I dont even really care
Cause even though our lives arent right
We still see that better light
Lets build
even if she is soI dig her so
Something about your love keep me hangin around
Something about your sweetness 
Even if she is soeven if she is so
