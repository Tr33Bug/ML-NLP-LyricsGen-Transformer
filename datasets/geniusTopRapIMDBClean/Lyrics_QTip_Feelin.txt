Had this good feelin when I got up today
Like everything was cool so I went on my way
I guess I walk with a bop so then this profiling cop
Now wait a minute G ayo dont tell me to stop
So then this profiling cop with his profiling ass
Figured the best thing he could do was find a cat to harass
That little kitten was me not that one in the tree
The black one with the promise and the wish to be free
I mean damn policeman cant you leave me alone
Im a prince plus important plus theres business Im on
See this racking Im in it need somebody like me
All of us is concentrating on the things that we see
How much we make so you see and grate
You not making a slate cause its just in our fate
I refuse to get booze so just handle your thang
Yo whats happenin today yo we gotta bring back that
Feelin what happened to that feelin
Good Feelin dont you go dont go inside
Feelin dont you go girl dont you hide
Feelin dont you go dont go inside
Feelin dont you go girl dont you hide
