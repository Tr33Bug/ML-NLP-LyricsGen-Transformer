What a consorted effort
The crew aint ever sayin eff it
My dude Im saying
Instead of laying for the credit
We rather wait our best and just  it
Best foot forward
Yes we got to be historic
But we got to have love for it
Its not your regular average poet
Im into into the chords just to know
And I know it
When its time to get a hand in there
Incite the party with the fire
No sitting there
And no complaining here
Disgruntled thirtysomethings
Whining over yesteryear
Let my drums just rumble through
Cats wanna fuck around
Fuck it lets do it dude
Like a sand dune sure to get swept up
You never should have stepped up
You need to know your mans MO
Queens pedigree bro
In the outskirts feel it be
You got the feva here
You feel the heat
Oh my my my I think I got a feva
I think I got the fever IIIII think I got the fever 
For something good
I think I got the fever IIIII think I got the fever 
Oh my my my I think I got a feva
I think I got the fever IIIII think I got the fever 
For something good
I think I got the fever IIIII think I got the fever 
For a minute man you saw a bit
And the tribe was the conduit
Deep in the pit of your stomach
The feva made you heart rate summit
My ears on the asphalt
Why quit when its your fault
You gotta wake up and read the mercury
Im like Chicken George
Dude doggie you aint merking me
With the golden mic
Im known to be a motherfucker
And do what I like
Spitting volumes of tales that needs to be in libraries
Youre mortified up in the cemetery
And we stay open
Its in our blood its genetic
While others are infected
With the weakening DNA that makes both sweet and 
Bounce girl shake a bit
Break em oracles do away with the 
My brother makes a real quick way out the stands
With a lot of stout
So what You made your money now what
What you living for What you gon do dummy
Yo you gotta have a fever for something
You gotta have a fever for something
