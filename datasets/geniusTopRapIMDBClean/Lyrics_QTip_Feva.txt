Feva Lyrics
What a consorted effort
The crew ain't ever sayin' "eff it"
My dude I'm saying
Instead of laying for the credit
We rather wait our best and just  it
Best foot forward
Yes we got to be historic
But we got to have love for it
It's not your regular average poet
I'm into into the chords just to know
And I know it
When it's time to get a hand in there
Incite the party with the fire
No sitting there
And no complaining here
Disgruntled thirty-somethings
Whining over yesteryear
Let my drums just rumble through
Cats wanna fuck around
Fuck it, let's do it, dude
Like a sand dune, sure to get swept up
You never should have stepped up
You need to know your man's MO
Queens pedigree, bro
In the outskirts, feel it be
You got the feva here
You feel the heat
Oh my my my, I think I got a feva
(I think I got the fever, I-I-I-I-I think I got the fever)
For something good
(I think I got the fever, I-I-I-I-I think I got the fever)
Oh my my my, I think I got a feva
(I think I got the fever, I-I-I-I-I think I got the fever)
For something good
(I think I got the fever, I-I-I-I-I think I got the fever)

For a minute, man, you saw a bit
And the tribe was the conduit
Deep in the pit of your stomach
The feva made you heart rate summit
My ears on the asphalt
Why quit when it's your fault
You gotta wake up and read the mercury
I'm like Chicken George
Dude, doggie, you ain't merking me
With the golden mic
I'm known to be a motherfucker
And do what I like
Spitting volumes of tales that needs to be in libraries
You're mortified up in the cemetery
And we stay open
It's in our blood, it's genetic
While others are infected
With the weakening DNA that makes both sweet and 
Bounce, girl, shake a bit
Break 'em, oracles do away with the 
My brother makes a real quick way out the stands
With a lot of stout
So what? You made your money, now what?
What you living for? What you gon' do, dummy?
Yo, you gotta have a fever for something
You gotta have a fever for something
