Hasty decisions we made still prevail
Both needed breaks we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways and nooks and things with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah thats for sure
Still a bankroll and yeah still couture
But man this thing we had was much more
Come back home dont be out in the world
Its a rat race and no place for a girl
Amongst the scavengers I found a pretty pearl
Its for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough buckle em up we call em duds
And we and we and we ahhh
We got the gettin up we got the gettin up
Today is nice come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
Come over here baby dont look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedys
You and I advance certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man no other could contend
Or we could be like those exposed to history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty lets do this all nite
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up I promise that Ill bite
We got the gettin up we got the gettin up
Today is nice come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come thru
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives are so colorful
A wonderful spectrum not onetone dull
Full of excitement and not one lull
See we had an understanding oh yes we did
Im bringing it back Im puttin in my bid
Have a couple of kids have a couple of cribs
We like Ruby Dee and Ossie Martin and Coretta
Doin it to death no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our sprits still together
Come on now heres a placement for your hand
You rockin with the numberone MC man
The numberone controller of right with the plan
We got the gettin up we got the gettin up
Today is nice come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
Tonight is right come on we gon gettin up
Said we gettin up said we gettin up
