Now picture this a man wit his whole thing in order
Movin through life at will he ill
He make his home team proud with his gentleman style
But he still no joke wit his wisdom and smile
Givin pounds all around no need to act foolish
Enjoy the time no need to get ghoulish
I spit it out wit the general feelin that
Once u vibe wit it then you keep on comin back
The north south and east and the west
Wanna see which crew can do it the best
Is it the North where people drink juice and Smirnoff
Girls go hard but they lips stay soft
The west where cats throw jets to play
Smokin green all day keep a loked out sway
Eastsidethe hustle get real
Pretty young things with their mass appeal
Or the south where thugs keep gold in their mouth
Big ol girls with their thang hangin out
Whatever it is I hope you involved
We gon push it to my level let the G evolve come on
Go
Go at
Go at it hard
Real hard
Everybody take note to your man and yall
And I will take note to the grand
Its venomous I mean the way they hate
They cant wait for my to mize me meet my great but
No attention I give them no light
Niggas gotta know that I go through mics
Go through walls with sounds and speakers with real drives
You cant fuck this nigga from Tribe a yo
I put my mind to the work in here
And make sure that all of ya can understand
That I dont do bitch I dont do tricks
I stay doing beats while you stay layin bricks
I do do the things that keep me from the rest
And I do that well if I do suggest yo
Put your hands on your system and feel me out
Or put your hand on your money and hold your cloud
The indoor seat of lady galor seas
She get touched once and shell never divorce me
Hey clear your brain as I implimate raw thoughts
You shouldnt be aware that I dont get off course
Stayin steady on it niggas aint ready for it
Flourin it hard we AJ Pettite on it
A nobles face and Im doing my pace
Makin sure all my conrads get a true taste
What a good shit and Im ringing your memory
We goin hard yo and thats how it need to be
So wake up and take that sleep outcha eyes my friend
Heres the motto in your ear hear this again


Heavy hitters knockin shit out the park
You didnt even really play tell me why did you start
