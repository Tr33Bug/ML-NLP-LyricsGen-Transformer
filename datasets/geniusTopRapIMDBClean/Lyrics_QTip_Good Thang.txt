She a good thang
I dont even think twice about my good thang
She turns me out up inside
Im staring at both from the outside
So good that it turns into a bad thing
I be thinkin too much about my bad thing
Its so intoxicating
Her infection always keeps me waitin
I just need to get a minute to tell her
Imma call her up in the late night
And talk about the love thats too tight
Its floating on a belt atlantic
Phone is tapped so we not that candid
Its your sweety ticket and brandin
When I need it you gon have to unhand it
When I need it dont leave me standin
I just really had to tell you that
I want you
You know I need you
Good thang
You know I want you
Good thang
And I thinkin that you remember my rappin
This confession of all good trappin
Your impression has marked me deeply
I think you need to see me
Dont have a hittin agenda
When I hold you and befriend ya
This substance here not empty
Its emotional you forfeit me
Theres a spark inside thats glowin
You feed it and its glowing
You radiate you showin
I just had to get a minute to tell you
You know you really touch my feelings
When you think those thoughts
You know you really touch my feelings
And when you talk that talk
You know you really touch my feelings
And when you move like that
You know you really touch my feelings
Get a minute to


Just picture us together
And in the end it feels better
Its the last single in 
You reward me like
