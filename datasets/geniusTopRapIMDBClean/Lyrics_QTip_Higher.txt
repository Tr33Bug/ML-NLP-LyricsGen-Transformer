Take you  higher 
Hit you  higher 
Make you  higher 
Hit you  higher 
Take you  higher 
I dont know what to make of this
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down
Hold the game fucking blew it
Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Made it out alive you wont be that way long
Plus you niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet yall aint get no bush neither
My hood dogs sing songs of rejection and pain
If we get sunshine its followed up by rain
Like to lay your chick down and get a blessing of brains
My man ski know you soft so he stressing your chain
We see the morrow through the shades of it might not come
Got to get it all now cause we might be done
Matrix nigga  nigga  you looking at The One
Fortified with a bonafide blastin of a gun
We in the space for positionin
Money and eliciting
Living out our lives while certain cats just lookin in
We bewildered off the sacks and the green
Whether the bay LA or Chicago or Queens
You better raise your game
They comin at you high
You better raise your game
Dont ask no questions why nigga
Then speak figuratively I mean this shit
And speak literally you in some shit
I dominate flows
I dominate shows
And in the nightime our dominance grows
And you could see from the posture Im holding
Yo Im reing up while the rest is folding
A hip hop cat whos flown world wide and
Experience adventures like poseidon
Bump heads with RB chicks
Give em one hit joint and they lookin for the remix
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze
Im so irregular
Ear on the cellular
Lets celebrate cause your man is a hell of a
Fillin the blank with a good thing to fill in
We hold it still cause we walkin with steel Chins
Blindsided up in your own reality
While we in the heat of the moment fuck morality
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma  ma 
Im lookin straight dont see your eyes get my point ma  ma 
However you do it Im doing you back
Yo dont misconstrue it cause Im screwing it back
Yo rappers better count my presence as they down time
I gotta move around dont have no fuck around time
So you better just get on back
Just  incoherent scats  abstact


Uh uhhigherwe gettin higher
Yeahhigher
Yo one more time
I dont know what to make of this
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down
Hold the game fucking blew it
Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Made it out alive you wont be that way long
Plus you niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet yall aint get no bush neither
And I bet yall aint gettin no ahoop either
