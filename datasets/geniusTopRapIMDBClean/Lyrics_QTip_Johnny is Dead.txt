Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
And I think about my chance for me to intervene
And its up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it cause yea I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a QTip isnt in it
So to stick it in to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe I mean can I survive I mean
Cause this is my mans on me this is my fams
And heres somethin new its front row for you
So dont misconstrue its Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard dont stop your repertoire
As long as you could see its you whos stayin we
Cause life is filled with pills and little pearls and shit
Im fuckin up I mean Im trippin up
But still there is a void them people get annoyed
Lets focus is on the feel before we get a deal
Come on
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
Figuring out where we should be
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
With the vibe we came to put back on the street
Lets take care of ours and ensure we eat
And Oprah an em they criticize the boys
Without empathy they lose all their boys
They cant keep us down were dominate and brown
And those other shades they join our parade
But wait theres rain ahead like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris is shit she gotta see it
Im no different to you I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page I dont come of age
Im not a deity Im far from perfect see
I roll the tumble weed its just a humble scene
That I present to you is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are the door I hopes ajar
And soon were walkin in a blip its just to say Come on
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
Figuring out where we should be
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
Figuring out where we should be
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
