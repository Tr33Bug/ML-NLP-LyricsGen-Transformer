Bodies in the street killing over head
Marvel at the sky as it turn blood red
Peelin caps back til the white meat show
This is natural for the little Afro
Pressure bust pipes minds is feeling up
And when I lay it down you aint never getting up
Revenge is on my frequency dialing
Prayers for these fools well it aint worth wilding
You say that you a Samurai Whatever
Im fueled with my father hes inside me forever
Yall aint never seen this breed of young boy
Not disrupted by girls by games by joy
See Imma think for ya Imma think for me
Out think the enemy constantly
Its murder on the rocks slinging niggas on the roads
Citizens take cover as I shit on patrol
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
Phony niggas talk bull but I know they dont kill
And they know its for real but I hope they dont squeal
They hold me bigger than a bull to left my home alone grail
Only trigger that he pull is on the Home Depot drill
Show you how the coke feel four in yo dome now go chill
He aint never gettin up like O did with no pills
VI pop stars Im strapped like Bokeem
Gettin shot pa no turn back with those keys
Trynna shop hard bigger than obese
And I say I cop cars I aint talking bout the police
Nigga broke pockets look like the ears of Odie
From Garfield know how my heart feel
When the Benz stop the rims do cartwheels
Now Im the Man like Meth from Park Hill
Bring a pound cuz I smoke trees a little hash too
Break ya down so I can put weed in little capsules
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
When they see me they say Who that over there
Just a lil dude with a head full of hair
Just a lil dude not a god damn care
Just a lil dude so you best to beware
