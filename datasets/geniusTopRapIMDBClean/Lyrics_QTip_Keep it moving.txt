Hip hopa way of life
It doesnt tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife
I verbalize overrhyme friendly
That puts a listener in a frenzy so pop me in your benzi
You dig it get wit it or get your melon splitted
If you ever try to combat sir walter moves the king
We got the illy team that doesnt even sweat the gleam
Or glamour well figure 4 your ass like greg the hammer
Man we rockin joints like the who or santana
Keep jams packed and hotter than havana
Positivity is the key in the lock
Put your hand on it turn it to the right ak
We doin daredevil dandies on these mics
Peace out to the whole hiero whos puffin on the hydro
Yeah dun we movin how we like
Since the days of rockin hilos we keepin things on pyro fire
As we move with zeal and desire
Now the hip hop plan hope you complier
Son we havin tunnel vision but my sight is real real broad
Cuz I cant afford to miss that call
Makin moves not movies as get on the ball
And we keepin things covered like a female shawl
When I watch hockey yo I just look for the brawl
Quest quest and you know we signin out yall
Keep it movin yeah yeah to the kim
Keep it movin yeah yeah to the kim
I aint got no time for schuckin and jivin
