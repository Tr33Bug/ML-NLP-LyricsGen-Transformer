Let’s Ride Lyrics

To all the lowriders, the big riders
Word up
What happened in the car, yo?
F'real, let a nigga—

Brand new truck, butter soft seats
Four-point-something with a low ridin' something
Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
Who looking better, and damn, you looking good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride
Listen to the CDs I play inside
Mos Def, Jay, Prince and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin and Biggie
And when the evening is over, love
Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover, love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race, but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find there's a stash then you don't freak
You wanna nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near
Oh, I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means, my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride around with you, 'cause you my special friend, uh
Me and you, I think we should ride
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't worry, just come get inside
Come on, come on, come on, come on

The second part, my ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we painting on
Abstract the word we creating on
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tint's passed the legal one
OutKast banging loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected, brand new inspected
Emissions got tested, details perfected
Got the Armor All touch, empty out the Dutch
No tobacco spilling on my rug, klutz
Kick off your shoes, show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues, we all for getting more
More of that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy making you cling
A little harder than your average hug or grab
Lady, tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you bounce, tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheeling, drinking, no earl
Vacationing, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape
You might also like
Me and you, I think we should ride
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't worry, just come get inside
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Me and you, I think we should ride
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't worry, just come get inside
Come on, come on, come on, come on5Embed
