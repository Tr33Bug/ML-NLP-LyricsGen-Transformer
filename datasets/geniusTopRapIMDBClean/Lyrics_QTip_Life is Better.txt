Life is Better Lyrics
Life's filled with gray
But now, it comes clean
Leaves fall away
Hip-hop is playing again
And it's banging, too
Know it's banging, for you
Don't stop this feeling I feel
I just wanna lay around all day and feel the breeze upon my knees
I'm so into your rich history
Tell me stories and take me away
Come and take me, ooh
Come and take me with you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you
Life is better, now that, now that I found you

Uh, uh, one step at a time, a man walked on the moon
One record got played, Kool Herc said boom
One minute young man, your time come soon
We waiting, it was prophesized you loon
We bang our drums, enter message through sound
We restless and we takin over your town
Hands sweatin'
