My saga goes on as I romance the song
Original hiphop cat shorty push on
I could reminisce back to a sunnier day
Where everybody shot fives
And when you shook and push paint
Get off the back seat and activate your feet
Because the focus of the mission
Is the rhythm and the beat
Not concentrating on the character assassination
Or the influx of money from association
Youre listening to one of the last lights glowing
Who can hear the sharp F and still keep shit flowing
Really dig let me give myself a plug here
Its QTip here to service every plug there
And introduce to you all a brand new sound to pound
Lush fortify and revitalize your crown
Life is but a dream
And as the music is streamed
Let it work inside of you
Into realitys thing
Do your thing
We are gonna make it work
Make it work
Listen to Kurts work baby
Like a genie if you rub me right youll get things
Not a hungry ass rapper with some  inventive things
Imma concentrate on building up the repertoire
Eventually inviting all of yall to the seminar
Where you can sit down and extinguish your trite beats
Its Rainbow
Collate and implement peace
I breathe in myth and exhale truth
Standing out in the industry
And plus Im aloof
Im about to bring it to you in a better band
You can catch us 1nce again on David Letterman
I could make it right lady
Just because Im Muslim
Does that put me on your wanted list
Government games and corporate gaze
Wanna see an underprivileged man crumble in pain
Wanna see every race become separate and vain
But Im telling you man
bring about a change
Plus I see you mami as youre dancing
You can chance and
Your life could end
Connect to your deeper friend
To artists abroad this art is a bore
With a brand new vision
Come and get it while its given
I got my focus on
I keeps my chi strong
We gonna make this motherfucker bang real hard
The uprising of the positive inquisitive
In spirit were derivative
Praise it and we let it live


We are gonna make it work
Them them we gon make it work
Still we gonna make it work
Chris we gonna make it work
we gonna make it work
Shaka we gon make it work
Nitro we gon make it work
Qiana we gon make it work
Yes we gonna make it work
Aiesa we gon make it work
we gonna make it work
Mama we gon make it work
Everybody we gon make it work
Everybody we gon make it work
Everybody we gon make it work
