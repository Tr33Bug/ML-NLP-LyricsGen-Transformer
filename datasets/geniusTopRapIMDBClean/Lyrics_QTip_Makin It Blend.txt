Uh
Abstract Queens cat what we lookin at
Sixth sense too immense smellin is the fact
Out here you got your shiesty cats stabbin back for some track
Until we take it back you probly wont be feelin rap
Wordsworth Brooklynite what it lookin like
5 senses 9 inches 5 foot in height
Out here you got ya crooks and heists shook and shiest look alike
Payed off the books from dice good lookin and hookin tight
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him
We make it blend I say we makin it blend
Yo Uhuhuhuhuhuh
Cmon
Back when I came out first joint I hit it out
New styles to talk bout new ground to walk about
Still breakin shit wit the hammer of Thor god
Bigger than Asgard hittin ya ass hard
Act it out cause theres no time to word shit
You never win wit Wordsworth the wordsmith
The verse gets tighter every second the earth twists
Heard its QTip and Words  you had to purchase
Prefer this now wait a minute whats that I heard skip
Nerves twitch played this so much its probably your third disc
On purpose at your service basement to surface
Learn this  how can you rehearse somethin thats perfect
Isnt it funny when you use your favorite pen
And get your rhyme pad write shit thats truly bad
Embarrass yourself make a fuckin mockery
End the hypocrisy you never toppin me
Im the monopoly in jail is your cacophonies of unfair policies
In there youre rottin B
You hit the lottery well then you spottin me
Im extortin you of all your natural bodilies


Ayo it gotta be the way I respond that makes you honor me
Song hittin award winnin  yall just the nominees
Play it safe Ill arrange your wake
My paper mate will have my label mates album released a later date
Police patrol the city til Im as old as 50
Hat back clothes wont fit me causin 50 to frisk me
My hands are ammunition banned like contraband in prison
Im who you wanna be blowin out your candles wishin
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Yo Makin it blend
Makin it makin it blend
Make makin it blend
Yo I like a woman wit a bangin body the face and frame of Halle
Attitude  angry snotty
Speaks slang and cocky
Time to hang Aint gotta bring a posse
Through rainy days she got me like Whitney stay wit Bobby
Yo your cake is in the kitchen your wishful premonition
Is turned around by my firm thoughts of demolition
Its time to numb your run and dim your vision
Its time to give up the hopes and dreams of major acquisition
Aint got a droptop that goes 0 to 60
But after shows ladies drop tops and show they titties
Across the globe you cant oppose its risky
Or even go against me
Im Words so every time that you flow you spit me
We in the asphalt you cause your last fall
Insult to injury is when we curse the salt
Douse the open wound to the tomb
Its time to sit back and watch professionals in full bloom
Us you they and them
Yo Her and him
We make it blend I say we makin it blend
Yo Uhuhuhuhuhuh
Cmon
