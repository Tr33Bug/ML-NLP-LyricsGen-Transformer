Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Im just a brotherman descendant of the motherland
I fuck with blackberries and dimes and butter tens
Good on my right and trouble on my other hand
Life is a tight rope Im dyin the balance in
And by the end hopefully I be the balanceman
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
Its outta function I see girls that can top it off
I hold mines while these cowboys pop it off
You just a moviedude claimin that you popsoft
This shits like cold grits without the hot sauce
This government seems to me like its off course
Come on come on lets move And get down  like its off course 
Come on come on lets move  This government  and get down
Come on come on lets move And get down  ride with me 
Come on come on lets move And get down
Your dubious style may rock for right now
But in the long run you really lost one
Jamaica Queens man land of the tossed gun
Its never easy police not sees we
Go through the checkpoints birds flip to po nine
I got a bad bird nicknamed her sunshine
I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime
Into the right tunes we hit the right rhymes
I dig her fashion smash into my memory
And in the club shorty stays real into me
A humble dude and never will pretend to be
The type of artist thats desired for the industry
Came in this fucka me and Im a leave me
And in the end B you would believe me that Im a leave me
So whats a industry if the listeners will always stand beside me
Come on come on lets move And get down
Come on come on lets move And get down
Come on come on lets move And get down
Come on come on lets move And get down
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
Here we come yo here we come
