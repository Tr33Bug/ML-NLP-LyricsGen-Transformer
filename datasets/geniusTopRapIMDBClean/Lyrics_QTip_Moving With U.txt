Awwwwwwww Looky here looky here looky here
You out the frame with it You off the chain with it
You out the frame with it Woman woman
You got your girlfriend around ya
No wonder she surround you Look at you
Your brown eyes pierce just like a knight
Make afella think real hard about the rest of his life
The whole shit is strange Im really thinkin brains
But on the other hand I really feel your stress and pain
Flimsy little men they cant command you
And they dont have the heart to demand you
But niether do I I guess Ill let you walk
On and watch cause your walk is strong
Sippin passion wit a stranger in the club
It doesnt necessarily equate to love
Its not really in the air I wanna take it elsewhere
Somethin wild that chu cant compare
Bangin on my wood drum now
Hope your hearin all the sound Now nigga come now
Sittin at home a hat in my hand
While you crawlin on the earth with your natural tan
Your than is jiggilin and causin a stir
Lets do it real rough until life is a blur
I suit you the way that chu move

I can kinda understand you know
I mean bein at the top I mean to start a show
The brushes with fame continuous game you get
Hustles with plans stakin they claims and shit
But you shine and you pay it no mind always
Stayin on the grind with the thangs you do
You got the illest little switch and you
Aint takin no shit cause nobody wanna fuck wit chu
Admiration to the utmost
All my dogs raise your cups til the girl toast
I dont wanna bring shame to you really
I wanna put flames to you sincerly
Make your boxspring jump like a low rida
Best place that I could be is inside ya
The love that we have could be real
But you gotta go by what your heart feels
Heart feels Heart feels
