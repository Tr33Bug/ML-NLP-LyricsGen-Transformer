NT Lyrics
For real though who really got sick flow
On the edge not the ledge hangin out of the window
Bird chest niggas with ya wind of this fear rap
Fuck around youll be minced meat inside of a meal sack
Puny little punks better hit the gym
But that doesnt mean nothin to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team Im amped up
And you asses cant dim my beam
My shine what the fuck is on your mind
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers aint motivated they cant do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we mosh at the dance
Inside of your mind or youre inside of my pants
Musical intentions that we have is vast
You sick Drink a NyQuil well Im bed on your ass
Oh well then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some shit is what you yap on your cell to friends
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamaal Im in complete me zone
Its rap time for you that means nap time
Reachin for my joint What the fuck Imma clap mine
Singin songs of sixpence you sit tensed
Surprised your ass at the end like The Sixth Sense
Heavy hitters knocking shit out the park
You didnt even really play tell me why did you start
Spittin sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid Im not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your fuckin playground
Put on your headphones tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walk face and go underneath the town
QTip Abstractm how I gets down
All my bitches dance if you know that you damn sure
Let your pussy drip on the dance floor if you wanna
Get down 
Fuck that niggas will bust gats
Better lit a make for their rush that cuz they wanna
Get down 
Flip this piano sick shit
Get down 
Chill you can get off my dick and
Get down 
While Im on the hook get on your good foot
And blow up the spot for all of you niggas cuz thats how we
Get down 
Comin with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme cuz I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act rap just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have their own fun
Now theyre all grown up to be assholes
Im giving you the rope will you tie it to lassos
You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daiquiris in the Southwest breeze
Writings so exciting the pen it keeps
Drippin out jings thats converted to hymns and them
People be hummin it from now to their next of kin
My family is starving You know they want me to win
Me forfeit Nigga please get off it
Send the check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it
Abstract comin through witness the bomb shit
