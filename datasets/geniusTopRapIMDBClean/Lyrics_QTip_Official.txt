Oh yeah
Well the bell has rung because the time is here
Oh yeah
We gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear
Oh yeah
Not much is for sure but this here is true
Oh yeah
I gotta do it for me but then Ill do it for you
Major attraction trouble distraction
Scramble up my name and it still come action
Musics our number doubters who slumber
Open up your ears to the low tender thunder
Creative Queens native mixes are the Native
Want some fresh shit Then were correlative
Busta is ferocious unflawed and precocious
Airin fools out cause my willy bodacious
Peoples dont blame me shorties cant game me
Country Cherokee but the city here made me
Rock like coral distinctive bout my orals
Got lil grime and got a lotta laurels
The rhythm stay bangin my onetwo thangin
Is exemplified by the comp left hangin
Percussions our weapons drums are Smith  Wessons
Lyrics poppin off leavin deep impressions
I feel what the beat does people fuck with me cause
When the song end I become what the beat was
Same thing as other no need for cookie cutter
The bar gets raised not your average old gutter
For that I hit a chin up B ya time been up
Wouldve came sooner but I overslept my getup
Now lets get in the middle girl Ill solve your riddle
Cause we can be strong and protect against the brittle
If dudes need to see me go and get the CD
Ill aerosol your wall top to bottom like graffiti
Bismillahin dudes sound pardon 
When you hear the music thus begins the Mardi Grasin
Rhymes aint the issue thats how Im gon get you
Dont need a Billboard hit for me to hit you
The clairvoyant micist who always come the tightest
Queens everywhere demonstratin who the flyest
