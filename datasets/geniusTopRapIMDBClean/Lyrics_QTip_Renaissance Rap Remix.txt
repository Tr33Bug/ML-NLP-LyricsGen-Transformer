Renaissance Rap  Remix  Lyrics
I dont care who first or who last
I just know yall betta rock dis at da drop of a dime baby
Renaissance  I dont care what yall say or what yall do
But you got to be finished before the music is through
I dont think they heard me hold up
So here we go now
It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill I would hone my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there on Farmers Boulevard I made my mark
Two dudes brothers would dip from us me and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the Atrain line
Where rappers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me Big Pete Tanya and Sir Ibu
When in the heat of the cypher I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in your head we gon rock the dead
Night of the living MCs the weak ones fled cmon Bus
Yo yo Godbody wise intelligence
Smack niggas and wrestle with elephants
My beloved respect my benevolence comin like missiles
The issue is this be the shit you cant rebel against
Then I sniff out you niggas that be hidin in bushes waassup
And strangle niggas like poisonous octopuses shut the fuck up
Back with hazardous weathers and blizzards
As I spit stickin out my tongue like an iguana lizard
At you corny niggas  ha  Animal Planet rap Wildlife
Stabbin you in your back wild nice  Ahhhh 
While I hunt and eat you niggas like food leavin you bleedin
Beats  Rattle the speakers like some buffalo stampedin
If you dont understand what Im sayin lyrically
Im like goons acciDENTALLY beating you like gorillas playin
Ha ha  Bitches know when I spit I be seducin them
Countless money with diamonds thats buried in Jerusalem
The Renaissance
WHOOO thats Busta Rhymes right there
I dont know what I look like sendin Raekwon in there
Where Raekwon at
Ayo squeezing Johnny Walker neck up in the Benzo freezing
The headlong cock block pumpin is easy
Poison medals on my neck wrists and arms
Louie luggages is bronze a big bag of D Happy Kwanz
Together we the ChiLites to twists of the OJays
One line from thisll have you leanin like roach spray
Poison up on Hoyt Street my boys in Mrs our choice
Brooklyn Shaolin wildin in the Royces
Old Gold at the Golden Globes my robe hittin the cement
Chef in the building yep and he been
A thousand one goons at the Rhumba
Certified clients drug money and somethin up giants
Yo its the Tarzan cocaine clan in the area
Guerrillas in Louie hats the more the merrier
Take mines take a hundred 9s
We be runnin out of rhymes never bullets
Try to front and you mines Renaissance


WHOOOOOOOOOOWHEEE 
Ahem I go off
Let me spaz let me spaz  Cmon 
Though they call me Weezy F you gon let me pass
So ahead of my time with my nextweek ass
Money on the dinner table like Lets eat cash
And I do it for the killers and the hundred dollar billas
And from now on I dont think you should stunt without a million
Dollars in the bank I got money in the bank
Now throw yo hands in the air if your pussy dont stank
You got a bullet and a shank I got a bullet and a tank
I got fur in my boots and the hoodie on the minks
Stop sweatin me you should follow me Im directing it
Other fools break it down I be dissecting it
Ever since I made it up out of middle America
Everybody wanna be in my genital area
But you better stay away from my chemical barrier
Weezy Baby straight out the Caesarean nigga
Whats it called man  Oh yeah Renaissance Rap
Man I aint gon give yall my microphone no more
Cause yall tear it up when you get it
Lemme see who we had on here
Now we had QTip we had Busta Rhymes
You had Raekwon the Chef you had Lil Wayne on here
Man I aint givin yall my microphone no more
Cause yall tear it up when you get it
I just said get a lil somethin before the beats go
