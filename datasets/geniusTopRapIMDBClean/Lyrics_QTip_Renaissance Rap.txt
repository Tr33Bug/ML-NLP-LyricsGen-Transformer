Gather around the Renaissance man has finally appeared
And Im astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the oppositions Abstract bless your soul
There are degrees of MCs but none on the level
Of the other vocalist precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing impure emcees plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance
Rrrap Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
So here we go now
It is the Midnight Marauder on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles way I displayed
How I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there on Farmers Boulevard I made my mark
Two dudes niggas would dip from us me and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the Atrain line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me Big Pete Tanya and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
So get it in ya head we gon rock the dead
Night of the living MCs the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit Renaissance wont quit
We gon baptize yall for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr Strange
Making cultures move if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin aint gon bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we dont see it as one
We dont quit bullshit and we never lost son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearings impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it its like dynamite
And its the Renaissance Rap


Uh uh its the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uhcause its the Renaissance
Its the RenaissanceRap
It is the Renaissance Rap
Now lookin at ya clock you know that its time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the TOP
That be GOD and I be TIP
The promoter of the flyness witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came but Im the royal highness
Dontcha ever forget who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suhthin that you cant recover up from
You better off joinin the force because we cant be done
Listen we on this mission and its a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo
Its the Renaissance echoes
