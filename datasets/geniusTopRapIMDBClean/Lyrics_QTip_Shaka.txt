Shaka Lyrics
Uh, ah, uh, uh

My brother, Shaka, would have wanted me to do it like this
So raise your glasses for the lost ones in your life
(Y'all—to the beat, y'all)
(let's go, y'all—ya don't stop)
Dilla Dawg and Master Wel would have wanted me
As well, to propel with the spirit of the mic
(Go, y'all—let's go, y'all)
(Let's cut, yo—c'mon)
Even if you had one person with you and it's hard
They make it easy, celebrate them, let them know just who they are
(Go, y'all—let's go, y'all)
(It's cool, y'all—c'mon, uh)
Because of these experiences I have some control
On the microphone, I'm bold elevatin' to the stars
(Let's go, come-on, yeah )
(Yeah, yeah, let's go, c'mon!)

Here's a demonstration, with the excellence
Reverse the pandemic stress, filled with pestilence
Who has his finger on the pulse of the B-boy?
Serving fiends with the stream of a D-boy
Who's well connected? You must respect it
I'm driven with the spirits mentioned in this record
Hopefully this serves as motivation
They never sayin' that kind of sensation
Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it
Mama, I know, let me put lil' thamp on it
Blade runnin' through the day with agility
Stay gunnin', make way for possibilities
It's the capital-Q, rap, it'll do
What I want it to, it's like tamin' a shrew, uh
Livin' life, the Shakespearean proportions
Knowin' better, I've experienced distortions
You might also like
And through the in-and-outs, of life's revolvin' doors
I'mma see that; I'm still gettin' more
Yeah, I'm comin' in—I'm gon' see my friends
To the top floor—it seems it never ends
Heaven never ends—yeah, it never ends
It be goin' on—it's phenomenon
Like a newborn—or a Stevie song
It be goin' on—do ya feel it?
Snare drum go—

My brother, Shaka, would've wanted me to say this to y'all;
Don't lose sight, y'all, without giving a fight
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
I'm channeling Weldon Irvine, Mr. Clean
He would've wanted me to say what I mean, and I mean, get it right
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
Dilla, havin' you in my past has been a blast
You've inspired so many and forever will you last
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
And to my father, yo; your spirit is drapin' me
Never escapin' me, I'm happy that I had you in my past
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeahh)
Uh-uh, let's go
Now, let's go, c'mon
Let's go
Now, let's go
Tka-ta-ta, uh-uh3Embed
