The way you style your hair oh oh

The way you care oh

You look just like a teacher girl with your glasses on
Thats sexyall night longthats sexy
No matter how we push or thrust they stay on
Thats sexyand its sexy to methats sexy
Hey its something like a phenomenon
Unearthing these feelings is coming on
I get a rush like a team on Monday Night
Lord you always look out so make it right
And if not then I guess your will is done
But Im still gon to reel this one
With this world complex from voting fraud
And an unjust world we need you Lord
Got a glass thats filled with Jack and Coke
And a heart thats filled with will and hope
While these phony ass rappers I spoke about
Kill this hiphop off without a doubt
And I need that resilience and the strength
And a life thats got experience
So I could learn this lesson and maybe then
I could email this shit to my friends
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
Youre so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
Youre so sexy and I hope I compel you
That little gap between your teeththats sexy thats sexy
That space where your thigh meets your knee
Thats sexy thats sexy


The way you chew and pop your gum its so rude
Thats sexylittle girlthats sexy
Its so unreal time stood still  from the way you move
Thats sexy thats sexy
And Im walking over to you to say Hello
Yo but here goes the things Im seeing though
Im seeing us on the floor us on my rug
Shooting shit getting high and making love
And the TV is on but its watching us
And the evening is going marvelous
You got a brim hat on and open toes
And the house is empty like we open shows
Fall asleep wake up and do it again
Fall asleep wake up and do it again
You get so impressed you telling your friends
Fall asleep wake up and do it again
And we walk outside into a wind
Closed eyes as we lift I mean ascend
And we going upstairs in God confide
Shows us love and where our folks reside
Theres so many places thats laced with peace
And it seems we escaped the snarling beast
Caught up in the excitement I lost your hand
Dont worry bout it girl Im still your man
And Im running through the mist and finally
I see ya flapping your wings youre over me
And you going even higher than where I can
I said Wait a minute girl Im still your man
I said Wait a minute
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
Youre so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
Youre so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
Youre so sexy and I hope I compel you
Gotta get brave I have something to tell you
