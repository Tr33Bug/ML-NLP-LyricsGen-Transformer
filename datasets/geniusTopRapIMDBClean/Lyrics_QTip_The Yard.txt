The Yard LyricsPicture me
Submitting myself to a jail cell in a situation that's tale
Picture me, yo can you picture that? with a Nikon Leica or a Kodak Black
Picture me, trynna see another day
Every shit that I get it gets taken away
Picture me, yo
Tell me can you picture that? with a Nikon Leica or a Kodak Black
Picture me
My man on some homo shit
Punks in the yard trynna touch my dick
Fuck that!
Yo, tell me you can picture that
With a Nikon Leica or a Kodak Black
Picture me
I'm locked down now for shit I shouldn't even be
Can you picture me? can ya feel me? can you see me staying here
Tell me man I got another plan, fuck that!
Click click

From a birds eye view
