Vivrant Thing Lyrics
Uh.. check it out now
Uh.. no doubt now
Uh.. yo, check it out now
Uh.. no doubt yo

Special girl, real good girl
Biggest thing in my itty bitty world
Called her up and she made me feel right
Wish for bliss could never take flight
Sittin back with this mic in my hand
Spittin hot shit tryin to see grand
Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo
Uhh, such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

And even though we both fly
Give each other space and not the evil eye
Actin like grownups
Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up
Girlfriend tellin you she wanna see
I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'
And when we both do hit
We go on and on and on and on and on and
Sweeter than Ben & Jerry
Can I rhyme? Well you know I gets mine
Sittin round in my abstract car
This abstract thing goin' abstract far, yo

Uhh, such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing
Yo.. such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

Look at you, look at me
Look at you, look at me
Check it, yo - check it, huh
Yo, check it - uhh, yo
Yo.. such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing
Look at you, look at me
Look at you, look at me
Yo, check it, yo, check it
Yo, check it, yo yo yo
Yo.. such a vivrant thing
Vivrant uh, uhh-uhh, uh
You might also like
Gettin back to my MC status
All the Willie that I kick make the other niggas mad it's
Movin, to your town and situation
Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she
Shook her thing and violated
Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated
I'm sayin, "Yo is this some heartfelt shit here?
Am I strong black nigga? Well shit yeah
Plus we can hold a convo'
Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo
Just wanna see you by my side"
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride
A rapping nigga for real
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal
Rap slate like big weight
You buy, I sell, we split big cake

Uh uh, just move your little thing
Move it around and shake your little thing
Uh uhh
Yo.. such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing
Uh, yo, you such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing yo
Uh, such a vivrant thing
Vivrant thing a vivrant thing uh
Vivrant thing a vivrant thing uh
Vivrant thing ah out yo uh uh
