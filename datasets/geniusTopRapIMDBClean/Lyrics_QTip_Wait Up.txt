We on a brand new page millennium days
Desperation on the streets gotta find a new way
Keep the mics and choke holds The saga unfolds
Machavellian approaches executed by the coach
Im in these streets like a ghost
The airjettin artist
To the love I hit em right plus I hit the hardest man
I got a whole new approach for the rhymin
You cherry cats slide Im holdin out for the hymen
Uh You play the rappin roll
I take the rap and sold
And intertwine it wit mine and turn a half to whole
Im just a genie in a Jack bottle
Them fake ballinass cats is just a wack model
This joint knocks wit the force of a gat throttle
I live by You put it out we get it back motto
Hey But who around but just your average reproduction love
Rap is gettin lose so all the ice is screamin Thug
What the hell is wrong Im askin in this song
One time I smoked hash out of the hippies bong
One of us is goin laid cause I aint gettin played
I leave you right inside that shittyass bed you made
And walk along chuggin Ballers Brains rockin rings
And things and just waitin for white rains
I got the drive dog I hope the dogs ready
My mentality on dime chicks is stay sweaty
Wait up Your wait up Wait up

Get your  UP UP UP UP Yo   wait up
You wanna shoot dice or wanna shoot rounds
Wanna sell rhymes or wanna sell pounds
The decision is yours Id rather see tours
Get chicks wit ghetto shit fallin out they drawers
My team stay posted They stay roasted
Niggas who all in it had a hard knock livin
Administra rhyme minista illa treasura
You didnt know that your man was a legend huh
Embonishment for the both of you
I hit the road and I take my whole fuckin crew
Cause Im a Queens cat  True  To the Gs cat  True 
Gettin money for more than one needs cat  Aiiight cmon 
Condition never peers and  Take it home kid  mind stands out
From Seattle to South Beach my joint grand clout

A mellow disposition even when its pain
Your mental ammunition is faulty wit a drain

Brothers out of his game so we can see tours
The innovator  your man still a hater
