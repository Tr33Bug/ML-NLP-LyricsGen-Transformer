And it and it begins he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks How many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down she made him better
Fucked a thug through fucked up weather
And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love she gave to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work plus go to school
Plus fight the love she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love thats her campaign
We fight we love
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Cmon yeah yeah uh uh uh uh yeah yeah yeah cmon

And it yeah and it and it begins hes off the wall
He left his friends he aint home no more
Hes in a place thats far away
Where he cant understand what they say
Cmon 
They say Salaam they carry bombs
In crowded places and cause alarm
Youre the infidel whos uninvited
But really an American boy whos slighted
It aint your fault you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world its cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin for your soul and WMDs
You cant find nothing cause its empty
You got your gun and hes your friend
And hes your man until the end
We fight we love
We fight and love so much
Sometimes I get confused of who we are
Cmon yeah yeah uh uh uh uh yeah yeah yeah cmon
