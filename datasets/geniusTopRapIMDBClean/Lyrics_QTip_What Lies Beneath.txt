Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing
And I figured that Id do it cause it wasnt no harmin
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin
About that Queens motherfucker yall need to take cover
Imma take position and yall best to take shahida
Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire hotter
Sendin this to Cross Meniski and Bay Vigi
Doug Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi
Yall staying in my heart while I dabble with the charts
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art
This coward got it once cause he kept his lip dippin
Now he in the news and he ventin in my livin
This other coward Phife who I used to do my jewels with
Subliminally disses me on childish out to prove shit
Lets not forget the king of Internet
Wholl assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep
And calls you Ziggy Stardust but who the Major Tom
Who starts to elevate it out of reach from his arm
Its a great day fuck it
Ya probably hear rebuttals overflowin out of buckets
Cause you lil gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin fiction
Ride off in the night V8 horsepower
From a soundbomb killin the lone ranger drillin
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive
Ya lackin with ya heart then start preachin what you practice
The clairvoyant psychic MC is upon you
You cornered and you bagged dang so where you gon run to
Used to get my mothers switches now I grant her wishes
Never superstitious breakin mirrors with the pitches
Ya man is insane with that doodoo on his chain
Funkin up the joint he vain that aint a bling thats a blang
Besides can he rap about a real life vision
Success lies in struggle thats what most of yall are missin
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones
Clown niggas raps get converted into guns
Illuminati president and government official
They dogs and they henchmen is comin out to get you
The age of Aquarius the change is goin on
We gotta keep strivin movin on
Ya dead wrong ya wrong ya know ya wrong
Ya know ya wrong for that 
Now why ya gotta go and do that 
Ya dead wrong ya wrong ya know ya wrong
And you know you know you are ooh
And you know you know you are
