What Lies Beneath Lyrics
Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing
And I figured that I'd do it cause it wasn't no harmin'
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin'
About that Queens motherfucker, y'all need to take cover
I'mma take position and y'all best to take sha-hida
Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire, hotter
Sendin' this to Cross, Meniski, and Bay Vigi
Doug, Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi
Y'all staying in my heart, while I dabble with the charts
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art
This coward got it once cause he kept his lip dippin'
Now he in the news and he ventin' in my livin'
This other coward Phife who I used to do my jewels with
Subliminally disses me on childish out to prove shit
Let's not forget the king of Internet
Who'll assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep
And calls you "Ziggy Stardust" but who the Major Tom
Who starts to elevate it out of reach from his arm

It's a great day fuck it
Ya probably hear rebuttals overflowin' out of buckets
Cause you lil' gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin' fiction
Ride off in the night, V8 horsepower
From a soundbomb killin' the lone ranger drillin'
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive
Ya lackin' with ya heart then start preachin' what you practice
The clairvoyant psychic MC is upon you
You cornered and you bagged dang so where you gon' run to
Used to get my mother's switches now I grant her wishes
Never superstitious breakin' mirrors with the pitches
Ya man is insane with that doo-doo on his chain
Funkin' up the joint he vain, that ain't a bling that's a blang
Besides can he rap about a real life vision
Success lies in struggle that's what most of y'all are missin'
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones
Clown nigga's raps get converted into guns
Illuminati president and government official
They dogs and they henchmen is comin' out to get you
The age of Aquarius, the change is goin' on
We gotta keep strivin' movin' on
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong
(Ya know ya wrong for that)
(Now why ya gotta go and do that)
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong
And you know, you know you are ooh
And you know, you know you areYou might also likeEmbed
