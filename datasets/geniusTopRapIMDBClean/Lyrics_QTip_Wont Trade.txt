Welcome to All Sports All Day Today on the program trade talks Continue in New York City but it doesnt disturb his productivity on the field
Now that I know what it is boy 
For your epitaph niggas laugh chicks steady gas your ass
Siphoning out your cash seein the door the flash
While I stay enclosed walkin out in my clothes she said
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
You motherfuckin right wantin this shit every night
Finish up I hold her tight wearin feelings on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave cooler than the evening breeze
Do you believe  Gotta believe 
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
The Division One leader in the rebound with numerous shorties
Off the post goin coast to coast she on the hardwood
Sub Im out the game she sayin Nah he good I mean
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
For no amount of dough franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think longterm plans he be bringin in the fans
Frontpage magazine listen to this lady scream
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
Cause she know whats better for her
Toppin in the peckin order fluid like the runnin water
Nicest nigga Kinda sorta
When he screamin just the slaughter no matter the quarter
I get it  I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
The clubhouse king battin practice slug and swing
Gametimes anything when Im in youre bout a minute
Holdin the bat its good as fact
Shes out the park and comin back she sayin
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin memorabilia from your walls
This is why you cant trade me
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
When asked about the trade rumors he simply replied that hes just here to produce to put forth the best effort for his team
Now that I know what it is boy 
You can put your money on a sure thing
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer in the White House thing
Clear your mantle the trophies I bring do you wanna trade
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
Cause in the end as a teammate
Youre lookin for a back shoot and goto ball
Leaves it all on the floor always lookin to score
Peptalks in the lockerroom this is why you sing this tune
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
And injuries cant make me sit out I ball till you get out
Hook off no didoubt and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game you know my name it makes me better
A cheer for the whole team lets go for the whole thing
The ballad that youre holding MVP voting
And I represent the sentiment youre emoting as you say
I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
The physical ability with mental capability
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity
And I aint really seein me vacatin this community
Im stayin here  I wouldnt trade it for nothing 
Im glad that you feel this way heres where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday they cheer for me say Ole
Wait a minute Andele I dunno well anyway
