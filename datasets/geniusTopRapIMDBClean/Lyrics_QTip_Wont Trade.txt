Wonâ€™t Trade Lyrics
Welcome to 'All Sports, All Day.' Today on the program, trade talks. Continue in New York City, but it doesn't disturb his productivity on the field

(Now that I know what it is, boy)
For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes, she said
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze
Do you believe? (Gotta believe!)
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties
Off the post, goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood
Sub, I'm out the game, she sayin', "Nah, he good", I mean
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
For no amount of dough, franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
Cause she know what's better for her
Toppin' in the peckin' order, fluid like the runnin' water
Nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter
I get it (I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing
Gametime's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact
She's out the park, and comin' back, she sayin'
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls
This is why you can't trade me
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
When asked about the trade rumors, he simply replied that he's just here to produce, to put forth the best effort for his team

(Now that I know what it is, boy)
You can put your money on a sure thing
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring, do you wanna trade?
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
Cause in the end as a teammate
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score
Pep-talks in the locker-room, this is why you sing this tune
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
And injuries can't make me sit out, I ball till you get out
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game, you know my name, it makes me better
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting, as you say
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
The physical ability, with mental capability
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community
I'm stayin' here (I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
I'm glad that you feel this way, here's where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, "Ole"
Wait a minute, "Andele"? I dunno, well, anyway
(I wouldn't trade it for nothing)
