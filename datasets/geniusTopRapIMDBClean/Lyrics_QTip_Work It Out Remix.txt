Work It Out (Remix) Lyrics
Work it out
Hey hey, we gets it in now
Work it out
Hey hey, we gets it in

Boring
What my life used to be
'Til I tapped the MPC to conduct and such
Breaking
That's what ya'll gonna do
That means ya'll break through cause ya'll clearly touched
Band mates
Chris Curt' is on the scene
The Hodge bass is mean, the drums is Kohlenberg
Breakout
Epidemic seems to grow
Breaks out from every show cause this you never heard
Hip-hop
Is dead, some say it's whack
We need to bring it back and la di dar dah
Music
It supplements the word
And known to touch your nerves, so here's another bar
Passion
The passion of the mic
The passion of the nights, wherever that it be
Hold up, no need to be inside
Just let the feelings ride
C'mon and let's be free and just


Now wait and
If you could, would you please
How many ill emcees are capturing the mass
One hits
They do they little do
For just a day or two but then they never last
You might also likeRing tones
The labels cashin' in
They think they gonna win from this phenomenon
Thinking
I'm thinking I'll do me
Let the music carry me, let the music carry on2Embed
