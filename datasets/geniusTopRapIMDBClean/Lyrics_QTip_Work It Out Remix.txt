Work It Out  Remix  Lyrics
Work it out
Hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out
Hey hey we gets it in
Boring
What my life used to be
Til I tapped the MPC to conduct and such
Breaking
Thats what yall gonna do
That means yall break through cause yall clearly touched
Band mates
Chris Curt is on the scene
The Hodge bass is mean the drums is Kohlenberg
Breakout
Epidemic seems to grow
Breaks out from every show cause this you never heard
Hiphop
Is dead some say its whack
We need to bring it back and la di dar dah
Music
It supplements the word
And known to touch your nerves so heres another bar
Passion
The passion of the mic
The passion of the nights wherever that it be
Hold up no need to be inside
Just let the feelings ride
Cmon and lets be free and just
Now wait and
If you could would you please
How many ill emcees are capturing the mass
One hits
They do they little do
For just a day or two but then they never last

Ring tones
The labels cashin in
They think they gonna win from this phenomenon
Thinking
Im thinking Ill do me
Let the music carry me let the music carry on
