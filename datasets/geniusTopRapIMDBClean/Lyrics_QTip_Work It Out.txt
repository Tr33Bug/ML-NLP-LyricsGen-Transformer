Borin well my life used to be
Til I tapped the MPC to conduct and such
Breakin thats what you gonna do
That means yall break through cause yall clearly touched
Bandmates Chris Kurt is on the scene
The Hodge bass is mean the drums is Colenberg
Breakout epidemic seems to grow
Breaks out from every show cause this you never heard
Hiphop is dead some say its whack
We need to bring it back and la di dar da
Music it supplement the word
And known to touch your nerves so heres another bar
Passion the passion of the mac
To passion of the nights wherever let it be
Hold up no need to be excited
Just let the feelings ride come on and lets be free
And just
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Now wait and if you could would you please
How many ill MCs are capturing the mass
One hits they do their little do
But just a day or two but then they never last
Ring tones the labels cashin in
They think they gonna win from this phenomenon
Thinking Im thinking Ill do me
Let the music carry me let the music carry you
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
Work it out hey hey we gets it in now
Work it out hey hey we gets it in
