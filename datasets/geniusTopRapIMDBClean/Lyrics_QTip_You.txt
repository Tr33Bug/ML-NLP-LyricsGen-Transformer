Wait
At the end of it all its you
And at the end of it all its you
And at the end its you
At the end of it all its you
Its you its you
At the end of it all its you
Its you its you
At the end of it all
Looking from how I see it
When I finally realized couldnt believe it
I couldnt even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so why be pissy
But when you wasnt seeing me nights you get it in
Thats when the snooping and shit it would begin
Where you at Where you going
Thats what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a Hello or I miss you
Or The Renaissance how does it do
Suspicious ones though few
Can stress out your brain it weighs on you man
And helps your peep game I thought it was me
But then I could see
It was you its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end its you
Its you at the end of it all
Its you its you its you
At the end of it all
I couldnt take it
But the spell of love I couldnt shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else who was your lover
You gave me up and managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turned to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doing love
Get it These things you projected
And I dont want to be affected
But when you get in love its never easy love
To make decisions of youve defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers that Im seeking
Well it seems Im getting close that Im reaching
And I was thinking I had no reason
Calling you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was cunning not for loving tell me why
Well make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if youre committed
Your heart is it in it
If it goes too many days sweet love can decay from you
Its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And the end its you its you
At the end of it all its you
Its you Its you
At the end of it all
