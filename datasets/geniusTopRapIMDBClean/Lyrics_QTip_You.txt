You Lyrics
Wait

At the end of it all its you
And at the end of it all it's you
And at the end, it's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you, it's you
At the end of it all its you
It's you, it's you
At the end of it all
Looking from how I see it
When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't even swallow
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine, so why be pissy?
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get it in
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin
"Where you at?" "Where you going?"
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a, "Hello," or, "I miss you"
Or, "The Renaissance, how does it do?"
Suspicious ones, though few
Can stress out your brain, it weighs on you, man
And helps your peep game, I thought it was me
But then I could see

It was you, it's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end, it's you
It's you at the end of it all
It's you, it's you, it's you
At the end of it all
You might also like
I couldn't take it
But the spell of love, I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else who was your lover
You gave me up and managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words, they turned to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doing, love
Get it? These things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love, it's never easy, love
To make decisions of you've defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seeking
Well, it seems I'm getting close, that I'm reaching
And I was thinking, I had no reason
Calling you a culprit, it was treason
And the twinkle, in your eye
It was cunning, not for loving, tell me why?
We'll make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if you're committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes too many days, sweet love can decay from you
It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end, it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And the end, it's you, it's you
At the end of it all it's you
It's you, It's you
At the end of it all2Embed
