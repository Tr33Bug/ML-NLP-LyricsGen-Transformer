Lets start the show off sistersll go look alive
The Queen Latifah the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats she rock rhymes so I
Gave her
A sample sound the she added a compound
Word this is for those who havent heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Those who oppose us heres an example
Its time to run the King and Queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one go ahead rehearse one
I hope you dont know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking concentration cant be broken
Queen Latifahs outspoken
Use your imagination picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth feed the needy
Confident decendent of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that Im black and I dont lack
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ no time for slimy toys
Im steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit produced by The King
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hiphop patients this is a King and Queen creation
Technician musical musician
Im stating the facts strictly nonfiction
In hiphop you wonder whos in trouble most
Creativity you get a double dose
How can you stop me No I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo  The beats a Juliet 
With topic blend this makes me a hard one
Persevere Im here gets taught one
Strength producer I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take em
I rock never hyperventilate
Others get tired could use a commercial break
45 King DJ Marks my alias
It takes a ton of MCs to prevail against me
Just listen Im unstoppable
You want a mission  This ones impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talents advanced you havent a clue
How I do it the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits I wear it
Many attempts were made none was recognized
45 King said sound personified
Im going to Wonderland to check find out whos next
You pretty good but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer I got the formula
And said the man from self Im warning you
Its my domain just ask my chauffer
My rides equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top its a usual act
Cant wait to get down to 45 Studios
Im into rap but no urge to sing
Im DJ Mark 45 45 King of Swing
