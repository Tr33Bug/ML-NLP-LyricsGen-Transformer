Yeah well well owww
Yeah yeah
Bring on that pecan pie
Pour some sugar on it sugar dont be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Dont be stingy Im a growing girl
I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound
Because Im big blonde and beautiful
Face the fact the simply irrefutable
No one wants a meal that only offers the least
When girl were serving up the whole damn feast  oh ho 
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese  woah 
Then take a look inside my book of recipes  ooo 
Now dont you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a mansize appetite
Ill use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
Ill let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice  oo ooo 
Well keep it in a oven til its good and hot
Keep on stirring til it hits the spot
Because Im big blonde and beautiful
There is nothing bout us thats unsuitable  oo oo oo 
Why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid  ooo 
When Edna you look like the whole parade
They say that white has might and thin is in
Well thats just bull
Cause ladies big is back and as for black
Its beautiful
All shapes and sizes follow me
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree  oo oo oo oo 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  oh yeah 
Oh yeah groovy baby groovy
