Why yall aint say
Yo you KNOW
You know you was supposed to say something to me
Ooh baby baby
Aww yeah
Clap your hands yall
Check it
Dig it while I rip it
Check it while I wreck it
Give it to em La 
Okay gimme a few seconds
First I give a shout to every
Jerseybornandbred head
And everybody in New York
From brunettes to red heads
Who got my back  Jersey got your back 
Yo tell me who got my back  The Bronx got your back 
Yo tell me who got my back  Brooklyn got your back 
Yoyoyo who got my back  Uptown got your back 
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother LANCE
Up in heaven resting chilling watching over me
You know youre too good to be forgotten
Papa wasnt there but there was Lance in the house
And so to me and Mommy you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink 40s
Back then I didnt blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
Im wicked out my gluteus so ho on and ho on  hooooo 
Thats what we about to do  hooooo 
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop
But chill
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Just chill
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Yo chill
gimme five on the black hand side 
Uh
gimme five on the black hand side 
Come on chill
gimme five on the black hand side 
Check it fear dont live in here
Tears dont bring me cheers
So gear for another year because I had it up to here
Yeah Im about through with you
You wack and rooty poo
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two
Im ret to set it off again
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin
In fact dont make me have to get the royal gatt
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack
Well play any show and I know that Ill pack it
Attack it with my tactics
Im loaded like a full metal jacket
I flip mines to get mines
Im happy to get with you
But you cant come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
Its all game
It all sounds the same
Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But theyre ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me erase me
They must be freaking crazy
Im the La La La from Halstead
Bred with the Queen as a prefix
Its off with your head
And thats a promise cause I dont make threats
So mind your neck cause its about to get set


Cmon set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Uh set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Somebody set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Watch the La set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Uh set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Uh set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Watch the La set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side 
Checks the Queen set it off
Gimme five on the black hand side
