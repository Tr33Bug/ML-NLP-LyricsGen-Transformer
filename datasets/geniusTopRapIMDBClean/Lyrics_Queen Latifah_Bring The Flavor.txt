Ill put your best to a test  wanna bet  wanna bet youll blow it
Ill smoke you like a cigarette just give me the mic
Ill give you wreck and save your idle threats for the next rap
Ill take it without the cream so leave it black
But you can leave the sugar so I can make greenlikeabooger money
In the bank no need for actin stank
Its a sad thing to watch you get gassed like a tank
And spank look at the intelligent female I N I
Dont try it you know I dont buy it

So I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep
So I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet
