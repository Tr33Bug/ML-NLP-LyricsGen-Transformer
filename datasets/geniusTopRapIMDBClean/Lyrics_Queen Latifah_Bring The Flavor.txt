Bring The Flavor LyricsWho brings the flavor?
That's me, that's me
Who brings the flavor?
That's me. I got it

Oh no, it's a scandal, I drop upon the mic like an anvil
And they'll praise me for mad thoughts, I'm crazy
I'm searchin', lookin' for the target
You don't know what hard is, this ain't all this hard yet
But I don't wanna be hard, I just wanna flow
'Cause rhymin' is my game and I play it like a pro
So whatchu wanna know? My name?
Dana Elaine, all hail the queen acclaimed
Drive you insane, woman with a brain
I'm a Flavor Unit MC
And that means I'm one of the roughest, def-est, toughest, best-est
Wickedest MCs rappers in the place
But if you try get swift? I'ma punch you in your face
I'ma higher flier, why you wanna cry?
I'm already hot, so put me in the fire
Give me a pen and pad and it's over, bye-ya!
See ya later, alligator, hey D, bring the flavor
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor, bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!
Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor, bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!

Yup, yup, yup
I be Latifah on the mic and
When I'm rhymin' don't you call my bluff
 I hate it when I have to get dangerous
It divides, it loosens, and it weakens and it changes us
You want more? Sure, I fill you up like Texaco
I switch to Spanish and rock it from here to Mexico
Record go, yo, watch the pro, let me flow
I'm raking in the dough on the down low, so me no know
Don't get me riled, I get wick-wick-wild
Flex styles by the pile, so smile for awhile
Aware, my dear—kick-kick-kick, snare—
That the flavor's in the air, oh yeah

The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
The flavor's in the air, the flavor's in the air (Bring the flavor, La, bring the flavor)
I get down with the F.U. crew, the only way to be, the only thing to do, ooh!

Peep me 'cause I'm not sneaky or freaky on the mic
I just grab it, grip it, rip it right
And the girls know it (know it), and the guys know it (know it)
I'll put your best to a test (wanna bet?), wanna bet you'll blow it?
I'll smoke you like a cigarette, just give me the mic
I'll give you wreck and save your idle threats for the next rap
I'll take it without the cream, so leave it black
But you can leave the sugar, so I can make green-like-a-booger money
In the bank, no need for actin' stank
It's a sad thing to watch you get gassed like a tank
And spank, look at the intelligent female I N I
Don't try it, you know I don't buy it
Now, uh, if your get-up-and-go done got up and gone
I wrote this song so you can rock the hip-hop all night long
So I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep
So I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet
