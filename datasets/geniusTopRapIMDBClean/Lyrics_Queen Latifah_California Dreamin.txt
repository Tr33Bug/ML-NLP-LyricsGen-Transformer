California Dreaminâ€™ LyricsAll the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I went for a walk on a winter day
I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winters day
I stopped into a church(yes i did)
I passed along the way
I got down on my knees(down on my knees)
And I pretended to pray
You know the preachers he likes it cold
So he knows I'm gonna stay(he knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreaming on such a winters day.(ohh oh yeah)
All the leaves are brown and the sky is so grey. I went for a walk on a cold winter's day(yeah). I'd feel so safe and warm if I was in L.A.(in L.A.). But I'm California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming(on such a winter's day)
California dreaming(on such a winter's day)
California, California Dreamin'
California Dreamin'(a place that's for me, mmmmmhhhhh)
I know it's just a dream
Dream on
