All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey
I went for a walk on a winter day
Id feel so safe and warm if I was in LA
California dreaming on such a winters day
I stopped into a church yes i did 
I passed along the way
I got down on my knees down on my knees 
And I pretended to pray
You know the preachers he likes it cold
So he knows Im gonna stay he knows Im gonna stay 
California dreaming on such a winters day ohh oh yeah 
All the leaves are brown and the sky is so grey I went for a walk on a cold winters day yeah  Id feel so safe and warm if I was in LA in LA  But Im California dreaming on such a winters day
California dreaming on such a winters day 
California dreaming on such a winters day 
California California Dreamin
California Dreamin a place thats for me mmmmmhhhhh 
I know its just a dream
Dream on
California Dreamin
