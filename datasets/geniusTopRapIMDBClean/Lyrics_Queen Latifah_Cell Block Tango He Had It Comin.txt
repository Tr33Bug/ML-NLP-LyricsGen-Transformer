Cell Block Tango  He Had It Comin  Lyrics
Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah yes Im here to testify
No I gotta speak on my behalf
You dont even know what happened
Can I just tell you what happened
Queen Latifah 
He had it comin  He had it comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
Macy Gray 
I mean imagine why was he hittin his woman
Why was she takin that Now picture her fightin back
Think of the ass kickin think of his ass flippin down the stairs
And me at the top smilin he shoulda stopped wildin
Now could you picture me tryin to finish him off
See why I pictured me on this side of the law
High heels leave holes youda thought I was gunnin
Now the cops comin I aint runnin  He had it comin 
Girl you shoulda seen it shoulda bobbed and weaved
Before the cops came got a couple of clean hits
In word the  couldnt take the abuse
But I couldnt explain that to the state troops
But you know girl yeah you go girl
Plus I look real cute in orange jumpsuits
This the story Im tellin and I aint changin nothin
I just needed you to know Your Honor
Queen Latifah 
He had it comin  He had it comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
Queen Latifah 
He had it comin  He had it comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same

  Macy Gray 
Aight aight lets get this over with
Take the mug shot hurry up the fingerprints what the blood clot
Lil Kim aka Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jumpsuit Im rockin Armani
Yeah I bust at him once but that was just a warnin
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin
Im not guilty just tryin to protect mine
It aint my fault he ran into my knife 20 times  He had it comin 
Just my luck the bastard aint die
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked your eye
Broke your nose til it started bleedin
Kicked you in your ribs choked you til you stopped breathin
Fuck that Im sick of bobbin and weavin
Him threatenin to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I do a bid cause aint no way
Nigga  gonna do me like Ike and OJ
He had it comin  Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin  C omin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
This is for the constantly accused mentally abused
How many of you been in my shoes before  aight 
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin up with his tired ass in the first place
Why am I flippin I just bought them condoms
I aint used not one but there was two missin
Made a new mission how to catch a cheater
If he only use Coast you shouldnt smell Lever  He had it comin 
If you know he dont smoke you shouldnt smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin you shouldnt yell either
Run up on him quietly choke him out silently
It might sound cruel but you gotta love the irony
So explain that just came back off a trip
And I come home to this please
He aint followed the guidelines
So forgive me Your Honor but he ran into my knife five times
He had it comin  Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin  Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin  Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
