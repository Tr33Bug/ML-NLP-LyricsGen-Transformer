Welcome into my Queendom  My Queendom 
Come one come all
When it comes to lyrics I bring them  I bring them 
In spring I sing in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to partay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
One nation under a groove 
House music always soothes
So get with the flow lets go yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo
If so then shall we let the games begin
What better off position can you be in
Im on fire the flames too hot to douse
The pool is over come into my house
Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body 
Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body 
Heres a dance step from Al and Kika
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm I know its gonna reach ya
Im the queen Latifah
Now its time to run through it
45 King  Yeah baby  Cue it
Yeah there you go I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it  That was cool 
I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum
Give me some
With the Flavor Unit Ive come
To say ride the groove line
Dont swing the pipe bomb
Listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
Its a house party Im hosting  What 
Come and rock with the one thats chosen
It cant turn me inside out  Uh uh 
For those who dare to come into my house


Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body 
Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body 
Its a new fusion Im using
You ask what is it Im doing
Hiphop house hiphop jazz with a little pizzazz
From the queen the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from Wrath of My Madness
Its my rap that rocks this party
Im a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic Black woman hardcore beat drumming
Its hard to keep a good woman down so I keep coming
Blow for blow I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
Its an open invitation
Come into my house
Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body 
Dont make me wait
Come into my house  Give me body
