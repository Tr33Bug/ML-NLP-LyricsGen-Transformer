Come So Far  Got So Far To Go   Hairspray  Lyrics
Hey old friend lets look back on the crazy clothes we wore
Aint it fun to look back and to see its all been done before
All those nights together are a special memory
And I cant wait for tomorrow just as long as youre dancing next to me
Cause its so clear every year we get stronger  Stronger 
Whats gone is gone the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas cause
I know weve come so far but weve got so far to go  Ooo 
I know the road seems long but it wont be long til its time to go
So most days well take it fast and some nights well take it slow  Ooo 
I know weve come so far but baby baby weve got so far to go
Oh yeah hey yeah Oh oh 
Hey old friend together sidebyside and yearbyyear
The road was filled with twists and turns oh but thats the road that got us here
Lets move past the bad times but before those memories fade
Lets forgive but not forget and learn from the mistakes we made
Cause its so clear every year we get stronger  Stronger 
So dont give up and dont say when
And just get back on the road again cause
I know weve come so far but weve got so far to go  Ooo 
I know the road seems long but it wont be long til its time to go
So most days well take it fast and some nights well take it slow  Ooo 
I know weve come so far but baby baby weve got so far to go
Oh yeah hey yeah oh oh oh oh oh 
Hey old friend come along for the ride
Theres plenty of room so jump inside  Jump inside 
The highways rocky every now and then  Yeah yeah 
But its so much better than where Ive been

Just keep movin at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass youll ever need  So you need 
Lets keep cruisin the road were on
Cause the rearview mirror only shows whats gone gone gone  Yeah 
We got so far to go
Woah oh Yeah 
Oh its so clear every year we get stronger  stronger 
So shine that light  ooo 
Take my hand  ooo 
Lets dance into the promised land cause
I know weve come so far but weve got so far to go  Ooo 
I know the road seems long but it wont be long til its time to go
So most days well take it fast and some nights well take it slow  Ooo 
I know weve come so far but baby baby weve got so far to go
