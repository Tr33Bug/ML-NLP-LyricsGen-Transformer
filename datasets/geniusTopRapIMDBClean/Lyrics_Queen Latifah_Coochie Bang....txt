Coochie Bang Lyrics
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Some days I wake up grumpy
On other days I let the brother sleep
But if theres no peace for the piece then
I say peace to the beast in heat
Lets talk about a Slim Jim jimmy chance in hell
If you cant protect a peck your chances fail
Thats just the pride I keep
He could great sideways inside out
But still left on the side street
Thats just a bare fact
My definition of bareback
Come at me bare Dont come back
Slap
Try fittin with a mitten
So you wont be trippin and flippin
And skinnydipping in the queens kitten
So come and get candid
Kiss the candy
No claps cant stand me if I offend he
You cant be saved by the skin on your teeth
But the skin on your friend
Could be your end to say the least
Peace
And I wont give a thang
Cause Im down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Slick kick a groove
Dont show the trick in you
Fit the move smooth
Or forget it with the stickandmove
And dont get tricky with the kissy poo
And dont say dont be cruel when Im dissin you
Kissin you dont mean stickin you
And If I was wishing to
Then you gotta know who I listen to
Like TLC
Me in heat
When lovin me couldnt care
If your hat was to da back G
Dont turn the caution off
Turn it often
And dont say always then often and soften
Someday soon you got to get to love what you got
Then you get love a lot
Get the point yah
You get faded like the face of any great sir
Slow down the fast pace sir until its safer
And I wont give a thang
Because Im down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang


Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Some go from this one to that one
From wickwick to wack one
You face one you place one
The safe ones a strapped one
And I dont wanna buy my friends
Forget your promises and use your condom sense
Or Im a glimpse
Then Im gone so long
The only thing thats on is your clothes
Now go home
And you can ho til the snows gone
And Ill be here til the last hard head dead hos gone
Either strap up or pack up is my motto
You say I wanna stay
I say I know yo but bye go
Lets take it to the extent
If you love her when you rub her
Brother take her hint  word 
And I wont give a thang
Because Im down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
Brothers better strap they thangthang
Ladies dont let them in if they dont have a condom
