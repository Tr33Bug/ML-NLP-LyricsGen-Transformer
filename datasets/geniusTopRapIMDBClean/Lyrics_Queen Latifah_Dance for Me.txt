Its a fact Ill attest to mess around and Ill arrest you
I aint playing you know what Im saying
This aint the best youve ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean  Hail to the Queen 
This MC stands for Microphone Commando
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air yeah just like that now
Chill and watch me rap cause Im flowing  Flowing 
Just like water I slaughter  Slaughter 
A battle put me in it I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words all in my system
System by techniques techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music music I take part in
One try one God and one destiny
Just dance for me
Dance to the music   Repeat 2x 
Now understand that you must  dance  because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples this for example
Are made by the 45 King so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
Hes a DJ producer and mind you a friend of mine
I hop dip and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me sing while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
Thats the way we like it so Im doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me
Dance to the music   Repeat 2x 
My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ho
With powerful lyrics Im armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that youre used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And lets start this let the beat get dumb
Cause Im a shake it all night and then some
People dancing I can spot em
When I take control you know I got em
Stop the music  Thats not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If youre not on the dance tip heres your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

Dance to the music   Repeat 6x
