I pray to brushin off haters for stuff they do to me

Lately it just seems to me
That people aint what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know theres snakes in the grass
So I pay my staff to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin
I combat that with positive thinking
Im me till Im old and grey
And when that day comes
Imma teach my daughters to be the same way
I am the way I am Im from the hood
So crme de le crme

Thats why I try to stay from round yall  thats why 
You never keep me down
