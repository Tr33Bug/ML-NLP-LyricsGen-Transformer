Lately it just seems to me
That people aint what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know theres snakes in the grass
So I pay my staff to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin
I combat that with positive thinking
Im me till Im old and grey
And when that day comes
Imma teach my daughters to be the same way
I am the way I am Im from the hood
