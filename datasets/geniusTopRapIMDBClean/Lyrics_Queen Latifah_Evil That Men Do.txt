You asked I came so behold the Queen
Lets add a little sense to the scene
Im living positive not out here knocked up
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up
This rhyme doesnt require prime time
Im just sharing thoughts of mine
Back again cause I knew you wanted it
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it
Dropping bombs youre up in arms youre puzzled
The lines will flow like fluid while youre guzzling
The sip I drop you on a BDPproduced track
From KRS to be exact
Its a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking
Cause its knowledge Im seeking
Enough about myself I think its time that I tell you
About the evil that men do
Situations realitywhat a concept
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life but who the hell cares
Because shes living on welfare
I government cant come up with a decent housing plan
So shes in no mans land
Its a sucker who tells you youre equal
You dont need himJohannesburgs crying for freedom
We the people hold these truths to be selfevident
But theres no response from the president
Someones living the good life taxfree
Except for a girl cant find a way to be crack free
And thats just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do
Tell me dont you think its a shame
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You cant treat him the same
Its time to teach the def the dumb the blind
That blackonblack crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom a fate worse than death
But theres still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart but also in your mind
It will benefit all mankind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And its the evil that men do
