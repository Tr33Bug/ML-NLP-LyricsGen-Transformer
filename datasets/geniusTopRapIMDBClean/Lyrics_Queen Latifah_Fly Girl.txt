Well its almost nightfall
And theres no forecast of rainfall
And Im in the mood for a party
So Im gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So I jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now Im on the menu
Guys in the house theyre watching me
Theyre clocking me theres no stopping me
Desire  I know you want me
Youre fine  Thank you
But Im not the type of girl that you think I am
I dont jump into the arms of every man
But Im paid  I dont need your money
I love you  You must be mad
Easy lover is something that I aint
Besides I dont know you from a can of paint
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys
I always hear yo baby
I mean like whats the big idea
Im a queen nuff respect
Treat me like a lady
And no my name aint yo and I aint got your baby
Im looking for a guy whos sincere
One with class and savoirfaire
Im looking for someone who has to be
Perfect for the Queen Latifah me
Fly girl fly girl
Come here cuz youre sexy and youre fine
And I want you to be mine
Fly girl fly girl
Have no fear your heart is in good hands
Wont you let me be your man


All my friends are in relationships
Some of them good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see loving it aint hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know Ill find him someday
And when I find him
He sure wont say
Lounging sitting in the house
And Im cooling first day of the week
So theres nothing to do
And Im in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said therell be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile
Its cool cuz 91 is my year
And this time I know Im gonna hear
Fly girl
