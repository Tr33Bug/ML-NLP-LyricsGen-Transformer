Go head wit that bullshit
Pop a can of fake shit
Never shouldve pulled it

Shake it break it

Slide with them paces
Big jeans big keans

Pay me for my sixteens
Switch in my fitted jeans
Twistin up that icky green
Book full of city dreams

Lets swing baby

And whoever told you LA wouldnt drop is a liar
