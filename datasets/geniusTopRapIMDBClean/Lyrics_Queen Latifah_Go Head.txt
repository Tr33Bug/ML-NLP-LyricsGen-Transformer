Go head wit that bullshit
Pop a can of fake shit
Never should've pulled it
Now you wanna stay quick
Shake it, break it
Never catch me naked
If them checks is basic
Slide with them paces
Big jeans, big keans
I only ride them big things
Pay me for my sixteens
Switch in my fitted jeans
Twistin' up that icky green
Book full of city dreams
Now everybody half way there swing
Let's swing baby
Let's swing baby
Let's swing baby
Go head wit that nonsense
Address me as your highness
I'm New Jersey's finest
Back from Bahamas
Aware of my content
Sista got sponsors
Dana got a conscience
Let me hit responses
Go head

I see poppin' on me
Don't get sloppy on me
He be lookin' at me
She be hatin' on me
Well um basically
We just keepin' the peace
We just rulin' the night
With the family
You might also likeNow you want some new shit
I keep it movin' who wit
My flavor unit
Bumpin' on exclusive
Jumpin' down in Houston
Peace to Whitney Houston
Tyin' up some nuisance
Ridin' wit a few friends
The science of the crew is
Neva give 'em units
We win the humor
Late let her move it
Everybody ruthless
Watch me make deuces
Thinkin' he the new shit
Time to gin and juice this
Story unconclusive
Now introducin'
Jumpin' jumpin' movin'
Somethin' bumpin' who wit
LA's Jersey unit
Lot of cats included
Single droppin' June-ish

Let's swing baby
Let's swing baby

Lady bubble bubble for my thug
Startin' that trouble
Little homies born in the struggle
I show you I love you
Get in a huddle
Peace to mommies workin' a double
Dana'll hug you
Piss me off I'll get em to mug you
I'm the same princess of the posse
Sippin confossey
If you can't sang
You can't copy what's gone stop me
In a black beat swizzey
And I'm pumpin' my posse
And plus I'm stocky
I dare on of y'all broads to try and stop me
La stays layin' the fire
Displayin' the wire
And I'm paid now
So twenty years just stainin' the tires
President buyer
Peasants can't grow with the sire
And whoever told you LA wouldn't drop is a liar
Go head
Go head......Embed
