Up in the church with my homies
Tryin' to get a little praise on
But keep it down on the low key (low key)
Cause you know how it is
I saw shawty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was singin' in my ear
You would think that she knew me (knew me)
So we decided to chill!
The worship got heavy (heavy)
Had me feeling like I'm ready to blow (blow)
Oh (oh)
God's saying "Come get me!" (Come get me)
So I got down and brought my knees to the floor
My knees to the floor
That's when I told God I said
