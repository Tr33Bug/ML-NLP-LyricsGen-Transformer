How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How much do I love you
Well multiply your love by infinity
Picture a vision of beauty
As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a Native Tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
Im pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew Id never love another
Im like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me
Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude its not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
Youre so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I cant reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then youre all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Dont stop
Ecstacy
So sweet
I adore you
Come to me
Thats right
Come to me
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
Im pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew Id never love another
Im like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me
Please dont go
Happiness is nothing without you
Stay
My sweet one
I adore you
Hold me
Come to me
Love me
Love me
