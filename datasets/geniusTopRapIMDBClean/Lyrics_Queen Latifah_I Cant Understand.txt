I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasnt causin it
She must be stupid as a fiend
They should have told the child You dont step to the Queen
Perplexed and Im vexed cause everywhere I go
People be flexin expectin me to wanna flow
I dont play that the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback so whatcha sayin
You dont wanna be a sista in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now Im fed so its off with your head
Now
The moral of the verse is your career is through
And dont be fuckin with nobody who aint fuckin with you
If I was in yo shoes Id let the BS start walkin
Next time there might not be no talkin
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Aint make no diff to me so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it I fell in love with his soul
Aye papi Aye Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girls number Hmmm That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip I had to call up the honey
There was a chick on the side Oh no it couldnt be
There was a chick on the side Hes down with OPP
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin my thang
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
Why the negative vibes And why do people take bribes
I dont understand it yo  I dont know 
Why do bad people live And why do good people die
Somebody gotta tell me why   I dont know 
Why do people smoke crack And why do White fight Black
Whats that scenario   I dont know 
Why do hearts get broken Why the chumps get choked
They know I aint no joke   I dont know 
Now with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
Its a crazy ass life and thats my word its bond
Im tryin to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me you know I just cant understand
Whats goin on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah aint gone just yet
Cause when it comes to masterin confusion Im a VET
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy
