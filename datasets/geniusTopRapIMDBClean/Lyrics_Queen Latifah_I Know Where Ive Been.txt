Theres a light in the darkness
Though the night is black as my skin
Theres a light burning bright showing me the way
But I know where Ive been
Theres a cry in the distance  Oooo 
Its a voice that comes from deep within  Hey yeah 
Theres a cry asking why I pray the answers up ahead
Cause I know where Ive been
Theres a road weve been travelin
Lost so many on the way
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the price the price we had to pay
Theres a dream in the future
Theres a struggle that we have yet to win
And theres pride in my heart cause I know where Im going
Yes I do
And I know where Ive been yeah
Theres a road
We must trave
Theres a promise
We must make
But the riches
Will be plenty
Worth the price
And price we had to pay
Theres a dream  Dream 
Yeah yeah yeah
In the future
Theres a struggle
That we have yet to win
And theres pride
In my heart
Cause I know where Im going
And I know where Ive been
Yeah
Theres a road  Theres a road 
We must travel  We must travel 
Theres a promise  Theres a promise 
That we must make  That we must make 
But the riches  Oh but the riches 
Will be plenty  Riches will be many 
Worth the risk  Worth the risk 
And the chance  And the chance 
We take
Theres a dream
In the future theres a struggle  Struggle 
That we have yet to win  We have yet to win 
Use that pride  Pride 
In our hearts  In our hearts 
To lift us up  Lift us up 
To tomorrow  Ooo 
Cause just to sit still would be a sin
I know it I know where Im going 
Lord knows I know where Ive been
Know where Ive been 
I give thanks to my God cause I know where Ive been
