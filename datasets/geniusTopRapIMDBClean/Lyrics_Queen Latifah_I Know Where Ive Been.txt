I Know Where Iâ€™ve Been Lyrics
There's a light in the darkness
Though the night is black as my skin
There's a light burning bright, showing me the way
But I know where I've been

There's a cry in the distance (Oooo)
It's a voice that comes from deep within (Hey yeah)
There's a cry asking why, I pray the answer's up ahead
'Cause I know where I've been
There's a road we've been travelin'
Lost so many on the way
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the price, the price we had to pay

There's a dream in the future
There's a struggle that we have yet to win
And there's pride in my heart 'cause I know where I'm going
Yes I do!
And I know where I've been, yeah

There's a road
We must trave
There's a promise
We must make
But the riches
Will be plenty
Worth the price
And price we had to pay
There's a dream (Dream)
Yeah yeah yeah
In the future
There's a struggle
That we have yet to win
And there's pride
In my heart
'Cause I know where I'm going
And I know where I've been
Yeah

There's a road (There's a road)
We must travel (We must travel)
There's a promise (There's a promise)
That we must make (That we must make)
But the riches (Oh, but the riches)
Will be plenty (Riches will be many)
Worth the risk (Worth the risk)
And the chance (And the chance)
We take
There's a dream

In the future there's a struggle (Struggle)
That we have yet to win (We have yet to win)
Use that pride (Pride)
In our hearts (In our hearts)
To lift us up (Lift us up)
To tomorrow (Ooo)
'Cause just to sit still would be a sin
(I know it! I know where I'm going)
Lord knows I know where I've been
(Know where I've been)
I give thanks to my God 'cause I know where I've been2Embed
