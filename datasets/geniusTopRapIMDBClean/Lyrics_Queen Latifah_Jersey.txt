Queen Latifah 
Yo whats up this is Queen Latifah in the house
Definetely representin Jersey on the love love
Coolin out in Cali shootin Living Single
But damn I miss home
I cant forget New Jersey
Verse 1 Queen Latifah 
When I think of home I think of a place where theres love overflowin
And all my family and peeps I knew when I was growin
Mommy and daddy made me proud to an Owens
Taught me to keep goin
Straight up but never knowin
I would become Her eminence and royal highness
The Queen Latifah no doubt one of New Jerseys finest
So set if off
Get em up on my own
Cause Jerseys what I think about when I think of home
Dont let no one get close to you except the chosen few
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you
When you were broke and blue thats how fam do
Thats how you stay true around these snakes
That freakin smile when they hate you
Im quick to take the ride down for intown   
Just another day living on a down 
My experience legit my rhymes is on hit
Its mad truth to the rumor we the shit I cant forget
Verse 2 Queen Latifah 
I used to work at Burger King but after takin orders
I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters
When I learned to do the Wop yo I couldnt stop
I brought it back around the way to show the people on my block
Teacher teacher tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there is nothin to it
So we meet at Irvington High halls and after school Id run
To the Willowbrook mall boostin with Sulamon
I had a talent for getting em for gear
Petty thief small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Apache to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio
45 King Special Red Alert Show
Cause thats what life was all about to me
REP Flavor Unit representin Jersey
Verse 3 Queen Latifah 
I think about my mom and my brothers when Im on swoll
Shakim when Im on swoll
My baby sister when Im on swoll
Hoffstead when Im on swoll
IllTown when I on swoll
JillTown JC when Im all swoll
Irvington Newark and so on when Im all swoll
Recognize the home of my soul
We got Naughty
And uh we got Nicky
We got Redman the Artifacts and Whitney
Bon Jovi them my bogeys
Bruce Springsteen and Das EFX
Shaquille ONeal oh hell catch wreck
Tisha Campbell Jerry Lewis Tony Bennett
Back spin or spin it
Thursday Peppermint Im in it
Shadows I knows no foes in the spot
Cause them peeps is my peeps and my back is got
Nuf respect to your burough your block
Youre black I love to see us move as a flock
Unstrapped against each other
No body armor
Nobody harms a hair on a head everythings calmer
And we cool the ghetto stars and fools
We paid the dues
We made the blues
So come on with the come on
Get down with the get down
Im down with my hometown sound
