Just Another Day Lyrics
We gon take this one over to 275 Halsted
384 Stuyvesant
We gon take it over to 155 Morgan
144 Harrison
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today feelin lovelyyay
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the gunshot but Im here to stay
Well its a beautiful day in the neighborhood a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Cant go wrong I feel strong and the flavors good
Im with whatever comes my way hiphop hooray
Latifahs on vacation Im just plain old Dana today
I strap out step out in every direction
Glock TECs jimmy hats in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise pump sounds play out wanna bes
A kid in a M3s getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close my fingers on the trigger
Dont wanna get wet so they steps cause mines is slightly bigger
But better yet Im a threat so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk cause I dont wanna talk
I stay true blue Im hoping its you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So its back to the block time to play
Its just another day around the way hey
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today feelin lovelyyay
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the gunshot but Im here to stay


Time to chill hit the hill uptown lets peep the sights
Shoot some pool act a fool cause its on tonight
Im doing the knowledge its not easy easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But its home so I flex get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape now which hood should I hit next
Stomach ache head to SteakNTake for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
Im where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girls wake they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray but I pray that theres a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim theres no shame in their game
You know my name show me a real nigga with a brain
So its back to the block time to play
Its just another day around the way hey
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today feelin lovelyyay
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the gunshot but Im here to stay
You know I gotta give props I cant stop without yall Ill be nothin
No wreckin no checks and no rhymin no cuttin
No stages front pages no phones no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So its back to the block time to play
Its just another day around the way around the muthafuckin way
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today feelin lovelyyay
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the gunshot but Im here to stay
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the gunshot but Im here to stay
Cause its just another day in the neighborhood
Just another day around the way
Im feelin good today
Im feelin lovelyyay
Feelin good today
Feelin good today
I know my hoods okay
Its gonna be okay
