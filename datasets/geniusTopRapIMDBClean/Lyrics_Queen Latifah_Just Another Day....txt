Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna beâ€™s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
You might also like
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
'Cause it's just another day, in the neighborhood
Just another day around the way
I'm feelin good today
I'm feelin lovely-yay

Feelin' good today
Feelin' good today
I know my hood's okay
It's gonna be okay2Embed
