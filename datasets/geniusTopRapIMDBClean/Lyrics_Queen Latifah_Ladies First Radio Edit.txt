Ladies First  Radio Edit  Lyrics contains a short bonus verse not on the LP version
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Funky 
Funky 
The ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked
Those that dont know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you break you take you
Now its time to rhyme can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream
Ayo let me take it from here Queen
Excuse me but I think Im about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
Im conversating to the folks who have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position Ladies first yes  Yes 
Yeah theres going to be some changes in here 
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Believe me when I say being a woman is great you see
I know that all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not the being one but the being with one
Because when its time for loving its the woman that gets some
Strong stepping strutting moving on
Rhyming cutting and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because its Ladies First
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic look at the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I wont do
Some think that we cant flow  cant flow 
Stereotypes they got to go  got to go 
Im a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
With what  With a little touch of Ladies First
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Yeah theres going to be some changes made here 
Who said that the ladies couldnt make it you must be blind
If you dont believe well here listen to this rhyme
Ladies first theres no time to rehearse
Im divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen
My sister can I get some
Sure Monie Love grab the mic and get dumb
Yo praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in LONDON and sound American
You dig exactly where Im coming from
You want righteous rhyming Imma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother like daughter I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing Im the daughter of a sister
Whos the mother of a brother whos the brother of another
Plus one more all four
Have a job to do we doing it
Respect due to the mother whos the root of it
And next up is me the MONIE LOVE
And Im first cause Im a LADIE
Contact and in fact the style it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track waiting for the climax
When I get there thats when I tax
The next man or the next woman
It doesnt make a difference keep the competition coming
And Ill recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is Ladies First
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Oooh Ladies first ladies first
Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why cause Im that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic I rocked it next
Plex you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift Its Ladies First
