Ay yo Manda
Whats up La
Yo people have been trying to get fierce on me
I think its time I tell them about themselves
Yo just give it to them Safari Style
Well well well
Its the L A the T I the F A H youll see why
Q U double E N Is the reason I must be myself
What else Well fame hasnt got me
Souped up selling out sloppy or poppy
There so much to live for therefore
Heres more from a woman
All women keep the rumors to yourself
The over blown home grown not known
Fools who never shown proof let alone own
A lot of props or a hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the Motts
Why you little played out
Aachoo
Im allergic to wack crews
The La the ti the fah
The queen is up
Throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare those who talk we cant have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise civilized and growing higher
Judgments from the Queen punishment is the fire
Im here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear fear
The sound is playing like a Qtip digging your ear ear
Mama Zula stands for positivity knowledge and grace
I never run my piece Damn Ill take it to your face
Open why you hoping none stutter stop em
Maybe choke  choke

The Queen L A T I F A H in command
Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say Is that so
Talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
Theyd be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah blase bla etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La La
Lovely and lyrically loose but lady like
Im too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps yall talk and still wonder how loose I got
When Im in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks breaks face face never never waste waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
Ill cut your throat Ill cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifahs had it up to here
Give it to em Queen yeah yeah yeah

Give it to em Queen  I got it 
Give it to em Queen yeah yeah yeah

The Queen L A T I F A H in command
Royal and loyal
Face the fire boy
You wouldnt get the time of the day
So make way hey silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping Im dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it never ever sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The flavor unit is doing it back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
