Alright listen Im back again cause thats what you required of
Me steady rhyming and Im so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But Im not buying so never sound like I dont bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me cease it you dont know me
So dont smile in my face behind my back take a line or two
Im not an idiot so who you think you lying to
Queen Latifahs here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because its a showdown
The 45 King is arising suprising hypnotising star hes up to par
So I hope youve prepared yourself for what youre in for
This is Latifahs Law
BMWs and gold rope chains dont impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed you nose will bleed thats how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype Im sorry your sound died
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and hoping that Im soft but Im dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life its trife yeah but these things happen
You need to make it better stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause theres a sucker born every day
Crimes the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifahs law
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall cause Im heavyhanded
Whip out a 45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa cant forget my other land
Wont fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say youre living right but we know its nonsense
In case you forgot just check your conscience
At showtime I blow lines you dont get yours I get mine
Your showtimes you behind the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one dont step across the line that I drew
Number two dont take credit for something that you didnt do
Number three check your heart every man has a call
Its time for me to go but Ill be back yall
