And people back in Brooklyn dem listening to me
And people in Jamaica dem listening to me
Well its a party over here a party over there
In every nook and cranny its a party everywhere
And that you should have known
When I walked through the door
Im told I got the flavor Im told I got the flow
Before you even try to diss me
Lets get something clear
There aint no fear between you and me or the atmosphere
Hail to the queen and the sire
Im lighting fires
Your style is wack as two flat tires
It will only take a second
For me to just wreck it
Smoother than my body buck naked
I dont have to prove shhh
Just keep doin hits
And niggas be all on my two tits
And even if you think its odd
Im telling you after every single rhyme I thank God
For giving me the power to make your heads nod
Tony Dofat style gotta keep em going wild
Listen to me now

And everybody dem listening to me
What a beautiful day and Im riding down the highway
On my way to the studio gotta go cause I slept late
I just came back from cool ass Cali
Where Mandy was bumpin MC Rens In the Alley
Driving so fast that no one could catch me
While Im knocking Gangsta Bitch by Apache
This is the mood for making the hit hiphop song
You should have known it was on
The places Ive been the people Ive seen
And everywhere I go its Give it to em Queen
Cause hiphop is for real Im dealing with the truth
Cause all over the world its aggravated youth
So every time I grab the mic you know that I could rock it
So I can have some fun and put some money in my pocket
You can always know the time just recognize the sign
Cant nobody put a padlock on your mind
Listen to me now

Take a trip on back into the third verse
Of the originator of the concept of ladies first
You came along and tried to freak mine
To the contrary cause Im not your ordinary piece of feline
See I know the book because I read it twice
If I bite the hook then Ima pay the price

And told me all about where babies really came from
So you can hit the door with the theory
