Living Single (Theme Song) Lyrics
Check, check, check it out
Check, check, check it out
Do what you want, girlfriend, 'cause it's your world

We are living (Ooh)
Single (Hey)
Yes, we're living the single life, yeah
We are living (Hey)
Single
Ooh, and in a '90s kind of world
I'm glad I got my girls
Keep your head up (What?)
Keep your head up (That's right)
Whenever this life get tough (You gotta fight with)
My homegirls standing to my left (and my right)
True blue, (it's tight like glue)

We are living (Hey)
Single
And in a '90s kind of world
I'm glad I got my girls
