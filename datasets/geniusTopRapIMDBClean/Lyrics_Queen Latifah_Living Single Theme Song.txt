Do what you want girlfriend cause its your world
We are living  Ooh 
Single  Hey 
Yes were living the single life yeah
We are living  Hey

Ooh and in a 90s kind of world
Im glad I got my girls
Keep your head up  What 
Keep your head up  Thats right 
Whenever this life get tough  You gotta fight with 
My homegirls standing to my left  and my right 
True blue  its tight like glue 
We are living  Hey

And in a 90s kind of world
Im glad I got my girls
