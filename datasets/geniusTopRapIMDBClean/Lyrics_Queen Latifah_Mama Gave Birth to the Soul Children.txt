Possy Dovey  Yes mama  Time to get up
Hello Im Queen Latifah how ya doing
I hope that youre with this I hope that youre willing
I want to introduce you to a cut called
Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children
Well here comes the goy  Goy 
The Tru to the goy
You know the one a Dovelike boy
Stepping with a step keeping with a kept
Making an appearance with a nottyhead set
Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2s singing
Peace to the negative nah you make the weighin
Weighin weighin way out of order
If you know youre better youd better that you caught a
Waving the mighty peace sign higher than a kite
If youre feeling sick its alright its fever night
Dont do Do see do and dig in no potholes
Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol
Its no different from the verbal last heard
Cayumbo is the ruler thats bond to the word
Hes moving more than three feet jocking with the knee deep
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet
Next on the menu we continue with the pasta
Dipped in chocolate served with lotsa
Twizzlers and honey yum yum yummy
Lyrics Im flaunting is good for the tummy
Tiptoing in I proceed to the floors
Selling much records like a pimp mover
Excuse me mommy Pos wins
Cause Im the A to the Plug WON
Brother freak it live for this tribe
Now lets ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please
Cutting back with the raps and we dont get cheese
Ducks and we sit need to get 
Cause preacher is the key to the casualty
Polaroid flicks are back and you know
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons show
Go mommy  Repeat 16x 
Im back a black queen upon the scene
With a knack for funky tracks know what I mean
Prince Paul produces this and its a fly one
It has a beat that weigh hes one of my sons
Its a family affair and then were out of here
There is no doubt here cause this is our year
So flex to a Queen LatifahDe La Soul sound
Go ahead mama get down 
It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good its practically edible  Say what 
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu
As I relay the story untold
And if youre wondering why I got kids so big
They werent born from the body they were born from the soul
Go mommy
Go mommy
De La Soul gives shoutouts til fade
