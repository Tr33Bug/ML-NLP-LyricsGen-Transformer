My baby she may not look
Like one of those bunnies out of the Playboy book
Well Im sorry bout that Mr Williams
But shes got something
Johnny much greater than gold
Well now whats that
Im crazy bout that girl
Shes got so much soul
Shes got the kind of loving kissin and ahuggin
Sure is mellow glad that Im her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do  ow
Tell em bout it Watson
My baby now when she walks by
All the fellows go and I know why
Have mercy just look at her walk
Its simply because that girl she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me I will lose my mind
Because shes got the kind of lovin
Kissin and ahuggin
Sure is mellow glad that Im her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
Cause she knocks me off my feet
Id better tell em one more thing
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow tell em bout it Mr Williams
Now everybody in my neighborhood
An thats whats grooving me
Will testify that my girl she looks so good
Well let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine she give eyesight to the blind
Help em to make em see
And if she ever leave me I will lose my mind
Because shes got the kind of lovin
Kissin and ahuggin
Sure is mellow glad that Im her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me
Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Mercy mercy mercy
