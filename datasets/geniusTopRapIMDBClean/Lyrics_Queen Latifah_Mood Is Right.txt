Mood Is Right Lyrics
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night

When I met you, the first thing I thought was, “Sexy!”
I didn't judge, though, figured I'd wait and see
We had convos 'til the break of dawn and
I intrigued you, you fascinated me
You told me all about the freak in you
Figured I was seeking you
And I couldn't wait to get a peek at you
But I'm the type that thinks that sex is best
When you're in love with more than the physical specimen
So I waited for your heart to get in touch with mine
And waited longer just to make sure it was genuine
And now I see you're on the real tip
Baby, I can feel it every time you hold me with a tight grip
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right now
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night

All I ever wanted was a strong brother like you
That's why I hold on to your love
'Cause you're the earth and I stay down to it
Just like this beat, I expound to it
I live a very hectic life, but I'm glad you understand
'Cause when it starts to stressin' me
You see it comin' and forgive my moods and my attitudes
'Cause you know how the pressure be
Then you massage my body
Every single inch of me to relieve the stress in me
You've got a way of getting next to me
You've got me offering the rest of me

Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night
Baby I know that I can do it right
All night, all night, all night
'Til the break of morning light
Alright

Many thought they was gettin' kitten fast in the past
Make me purr and then jet in a blur
I don't think so, 'cause I don't think "ho"
They didn't get laid, 'cause I don't get played
But baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
And it's for Y-O-U for eternity
Now that's how my mama said it's supposed to be
Affairs, flings, and those type of things come along
But I'm putting on a ring for my king
'Cause you bring it strong
So let's be on our merry way
I'll give you love without a limit like Mary J
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right nowEmbed
