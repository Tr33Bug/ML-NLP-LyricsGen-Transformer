Gotta get up when the mood is right
Im ready to let you love me all night
When I met you the first thing I thought was Sexy
I didnt judge though figured Id wait and see
We had convos til the break of dawn and
I intrigued you you fascinated me
You told me all about the freak in you
Figured I was seeking you
And I couldnt wait to get a peek at you
But Im the type that thinks that sex is best
When youre in love with more than the physical specimen
So I waited for your heart to get in touch with mine
And waited longer just to make sure it was genuine
And now I see youre on the real tip
Baby I can feel it every time you hold me with a tight grip
Its true its all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
Im ready to let you love me all night now

Im ready to let you love me all night
All I ever wanted was a strong brother like you
Thats why I hold on to your love
Cause youre the earth and I stay down to it
Just like this beat I expound to it
I live a very hectic life but Im glad you understand
Cause when it starts to stressin me
You see it comin and forgive my moods and my attitudes
Cause you know how the pressure be
Then you massage my body
Every single inch of me to relieve the stress in me
Youve got a way of getting next to me
Youve got me offering the rest of me
Gotta get up when the mood is right
Im ready to let you love me all night
Baby I know that I can do it right
All night all night all night
Til the break of morning light

Affairs flings and those type of things come along
But Im putting on a ring for my king
Cause you bring it strong

Ill give you love without a limit like Mary J
Its true its all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
Im ready to let you love me all night now
