Today Im not the queen a sista role model or friend
Today Im that bitch thatll shoot you a fair one this dont exclude men
Wanna test me Come test your weak songs and weak shows
Reincarnated Ill be a pimp and slap the shit out of these weak hoes
With these freak shows make em leak holes
I aint talkin about shootin free throws coming on stage with no clothes
Shit who the fuck said I cant beat those break
Took so long for your album to drop I thought you died I missed the wake
I dont spit subliminals no doubt
This way you dont walk around wondering who the fuck Im talkin bout
Im not trippin I heard you rippin
But Im into breakin bitches sending them back to their first career Stripping
Lap dancing for five cents doing VIPs to make rent
Look up and Im platinum wondering where the fuck time went
This is for those hoes who oppose my queendom and wanna bring some plate
I aint got shit else to do so
And them niggas too this dont exclude you I wont duck
Yeah the only thing worse then a bitch nigga is these pretty motherfuckers
Dressing the part with no heart gettin hot niggas to rap wit em
So the fuck what A lot of wack niggas went platinum
While you on tour your girls get manicured
Better leave security I might knock on your door and get yours
Dont put it past me I shine Apache how many I left in stitches
Now let me get back to these bitches
Im sick of these hoes poppin bullshit on the radio
And the videos like theyre the ones with the tv shows
You want what I got We could fight everyday for all the lotta
Bitches is acting but Im the one gettin paid for it
You hoes saw Set It Off
Dont make me braid my hair back and let it off
Cleo ho dont start no wont be no
Get knocked out not knowin what a diva do what a diva did and what a diva is
Bitch recognize who Queen Latifah is
Ill give it to you raw with no trojan
Your legs are the only thing you spose to keep open
You jokin smoking on the good shit
You get a good kick up on yo ass
Playin me close like siamese wantin to try these
Im leavin you hoes and I see you in IVs
Who ever said they beat me lied
Bitch you need to put down the tv guide
Turn off the tv now you see me 3D
Thought shit would be easy believe me
My name aint Khadijah this aint Living Single
On the Fox Network you fuckin wit an expert
Get yo ass laid to rest I will cave yo chest
Bitch niggas gettin robbed for they Avirex
Pay yo debts or Ima be up in yo pockets  quick 
Dent in yo mouth if these bitches wanna gossip
Poppin that shit about me and dont know my steelo  so what you sayin yo 
I make my own shit legit you ride a dick for dough ho  so what you sayin yo 
I dont need tight clothes to cover up my half assed flows  so what you sayin yo 
And on yo knees is the only way you hoes gon blow
So what you saying yo
