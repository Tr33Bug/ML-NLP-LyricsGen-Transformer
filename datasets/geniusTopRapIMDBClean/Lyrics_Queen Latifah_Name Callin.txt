  4x 
Name callin hasnt fallen into what Im runnin
I wouldnt dis another sista unless she had it comin
Hold my Heineken Pache Im bout to catch a charge
Bitches that think they hard get snuffed fuck the bodyguard
They need to shut the fuck up or step to me
All they can do is be mad at me bitch dont threaten me
Niggas dont know Im nice with these you pay the price with these
Come by this Pisces your life cease
You couldnt see me if you looked at my life like Mary
Your style is cheesy how you gon beef You dairy
Better be wary cuz if its necessary
Be shoot the joint Ill leave you somethin for the tooth fairy
And all you rappers sellin more sex than skill chill
Ill rip your style all the while keep my sex appeal
Dont get it twisted yo I never really favored you
And I was raised by my niggas from the Flavor U
So fuck giving props where they aint due
Fuck you and that nigga
Who wrote the rhyme for you too
I got hot when you play my spot you get laid like rugs
And youll never be the woman that your father was
Stop flirtin with my last nerve and head south
Next bitch say somethin  word  Im goin in your mouth
2x 
Another bitch after my crown but I dont hate her
Cuz she couldnt come up if she was gettin fucked in the elevator
What you thought I wouldnt check your chin
Though I was your fuckin friend
See you and speak tonight all that shit ends
Dont act extra where you from
High post on low income and then some
Ready to leave your gums numb
Listenin to you is like wack sex
A premature ejaculation
A quickie that gets me stressed
Youre doin it but it dont thrill me bitch you know you feel me
Dont get scared now time to face the real me
Im ready to break my foot off in your anal
Ready to bring you some pain yo
Comin up with that playdough
Style you stole tried to mix it up and make it blimp
Sound like Lauryn with a dash of Lil Kim
We know bootleg Korean coughin schemin ho
I know its bootleg cuz they misspelled Moschino
Whats worse Your PressOns hair or gear
I should buy your contract
Put your ass on hold for another year
You picked the wrong one so bring your click
Now we can handle this like ladies
Or get into some ol otha shit

  2x 
Makes ya feel like rappers be on some bandwagon shit
But I gets boogie quick fix with lyrics from toastin too many spirits
Fuck all these cheesy bum bitches fakin these riches
Niggas representin for these real live niggas 96
What the deal Chicks pimpin they sex appeal
How you feel  Stupid 
Got the still now dead up in your grill
Bout to go up in your raw so you industry whore
Never saw the lights before now you model and floss
Overload your whole dome piece when I rock shit like this
You cant flip cuz jiggaboos be gettin twisted  What 
All that high shit that you be smokin got you buggin
Think that you could step to my crew
We be nut smugglin
Turnin rough niggas into bitches like what
