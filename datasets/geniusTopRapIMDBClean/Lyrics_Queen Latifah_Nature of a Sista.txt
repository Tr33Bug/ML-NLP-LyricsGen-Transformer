Coming from the bitty bitty bottom of the basement
The first floors a bore so Ill rise
Dont want to make it to the top too quickly
So I take steptostep all the time
Take a look at the flow of the future
If you cant shake to it then it dont suit ya
Break off back off before I bust off
Bad is the worst some are bad but soft
Bad this bad that whos bad enough
For those who are bad then batter up
I pointed this rap with my index
So baby come on with a rag and some Windex
Im stepping the step tryna meet me there
Im avoiding all political fanfare
If you down take a pounding from ya fista
For the sound of the nature of a sista
Whos a king whos a queen whos tryna bang
I see myself as a queen but it aint for rank
This for all not one not for income
But for knowing who and where we descend from
I kick off with a choke I come crazy new
They call me Mama Zulu but I wont baby you
Im not the type to look for a man with cash
But the only thing you get if youre brokes a cast
I dip then switch what floor is this
I go higher than a fire try to diss
This is a little of my headedfortop style
Rippin tracks whippin in fact its that wild
Right on flow a few floors to go
I see suites instead of concrete so
If you down take a pounding from ya fista
For the sound of the nature of a sista
Heres a knickknack sit back hold ya hat
Heres a big rap ya got close now get back
I got an army bustin through the enemys wall
My thoughts on the situation was fuck em all
SaltNPepa said it was time to grow
So me and Spin did em in now time to go
YoYo grabbed him he said Hey diddle diddle
While I and Nikki got Monie out of the middle
Sisters in action strong real still complete
I say what up cause you cant come or compete
The La the TiFah booms like a speaker
I hold more soul than a sneaker
Dont ask if Im fast I come swift sis
Cause Im passing an ass if you with this
If you down take a pounding from ya fista
For the sound of the nature of a sista
