You aint got no work for me  no work no work 
Or any Flavor Unit MC  no work no work 
You aint got no work for me  no work no work 
You aint got no work for the queen  no work no work 
Dont try to get fly yall
Were blackin up eyeballs
I run with a rough set so dont get me upset
I gas you so hard I leave you fartin
Youre soft as a buttercup stupid ass so why you startin
Youre memorizing every damn lyric that I write
Youre all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin on my bra you freakin straphanger
Until we play Techs but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you 1993
Its all about the Flavor Unit and my family
Cause I would die for all them and they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female all catch hell
An explanation of the Queen Latifah spelled well
So blow up and know me
Dont even contemplate a theory about jerkin me
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
You aint got work for the queen  no work no work 
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs  no work no work 
Check it
Play me like a child but you know Im grown
See waterworks so take your broke ass home
That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin joint with the hardcore phrase
Amazed I wouldnt diss another sister less she had it coming
And even then I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning cunning as a venus fly trap
Cause word up I fight back youre damn right its like that
So step back Im not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
Im not the type of girl to be running to the cops
I know about everything that goes on on my block
And right beside my bed I keep a Luger and a Glock
Theyre for the protection of a Flavor Unit queen
Me not gon let ya go until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes when I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
You aint got work for the queen  no work no work 
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs  no work no work 
Now this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys Im annoyed
You gots no work so I lurk to keep you unemployed
Im a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives youre kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstile and the conductor threw me out
You feelin kinda horny Call a clinic on that crotch
Yous a dingy dirty bitch so I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here plus there
Cause Ill be here plus there
Well bump heads
Theres nuff lumps everywhere
Nigganiggas say the hood aint changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody but theyre bad instead
Were ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought I thought twice thought through and thought first
The queen picks the verse off a shirt
You hurt when I smirk cause you know first
You aint got work for the queen  no work no work 
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
You aint got work for the queen  no work no work 
You aint got work for me  no work no work 
You aint got no work for the queen  no work no work 
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs  no work no work 
I said you aint got no work for me  no work no work 
I said you aint got no work for me  no work no work
