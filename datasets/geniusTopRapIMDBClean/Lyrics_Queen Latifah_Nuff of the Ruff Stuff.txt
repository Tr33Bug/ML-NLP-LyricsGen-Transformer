Get funky with it
I told you before you burn when you play with fire
So take off your hats matter of fact hail the new Sire
Youre hungry as hell so im cookin up the chowder
Its laced with ingredients gon come on like gunpowder
Pompom lick a shot then I got to order
Im runnin for the border for causin disorder
Pompom lick a shot got on my defenses
Im runnin for the fences of course Im relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
Ive often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
Youre lookin for the black influ
I do want to give it to you
What are you mad
Give me some of what you had
You can huffhuff puffpuff and bluffbluff
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff
Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
Now nuff of the ruff stuff thats what I do and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin I show and prove not show and tell
Talk tales you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts I dont be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
Its a love thang the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid you would drink me like Tang
You think Im kickin things that I myself dont even heed
I rap not for the love of music but for greed
Latifahs booty yo she could never succeed
Shiiit
You watch me do it and boom it the Flavor Unit will snap necks
You afi listen a likkle you fi go buy the cassette
Youre starvin cause you aint had enough
Thats right nuff of the ruff stuff
Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
You talk about flavor
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun n rays
I got flavor for days
Now Im the type that the fellas call a honey and
From me you know you get a run for your money and
This is no meaningless attack I gave you a chance
Matter of fact yo I ordered them to dance
For me they tried to turn me inside out
They felt the wrath of my madness I let them come into my house
Its called Latifahs Law for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule ladies first
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall victim to the evil that men do
Small puff I call your bluff
Im not mad I just had enough of the ruff stuff

 Ruff and tuff 
And all that stuff 
Everybody know Latifah love positivity
Now positivity erase negativity
Mi comin inna di dance 
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse
As a black woman mi want equality
Equality and di freedom to be me
Mi have a mother Rita only call her Mommy
Likkle brother and sister Angelo and Kelly
A brother in them laws but mi call him Winki
Lost mi daddy and  family
black  black country
Believe in one God one tribe one destiny
Cease
