I admit that in the past Ive been a nasty
They werent kidding when they called me well a witch
But youll find that nowadays Ive mended all my ways
Repented seen the light and made a switch
True Yes
And I fortunately know a little magic
Its a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately please dont laugh
I use it on behalf of the miserable lonely and depressed
Pathetic
Poor unfortunate souls in pain in need
This one longing to be thinner
This  one wants to get the girl
And do I help them Yes indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying Spells Ursula please
And I help them
Yes I do
Now its happened once or twice
Someone couldnt pay the price
And Im afraid I had to rake them cross the coals
Yes Ive had the odd complaint
But on the whole Ive been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls
Now heres the deal If you dare
Theres a potion Ill prepare
Just consume and youll be human
Three whole days up above

By the end of day 3
Listen up this is key
Just convince Mr Prince
And get a kiss of true love
If I do
Lucky you
You stay human through and through
You can go wed your beau
And be totally divine
And if not
Then guess what girl
Youll turn back into a MerGirl
Same as you once were girl
But that tail will be mine
Dont be shy dear
What will it be
You want the guy dear
Leave it to me
But what about my father
And my family
Hmm
Sorry dear
Theres no way to spin it
Lifes full of tough choices innit
One last thing silly me
Did I mention theres a fee
Nothing choice just your voice
No more talking singing zip
Not a word
Not a note
Not a whisper from your throat
But
Show some spine youll be fine
Honey heres a little tip
Youll have your looks
Your pretty face
And dont underestimate the importance of body language ha
The men up there dont like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes on land its much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all dear what is idle babble for
Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead make your choice
Im a very busy woman
And I havent got all day
It wont cost much
Just your voice
You poor unfortunate soul
Its sad but true
If you want to cross a bridge my sweet
Youve got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam Jetsam now Ive got her boys
The boss is on a roll
Those poor unfortunate souls
Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me
Now sing
Aaaaaah aaaaah
Keep singing
Aaaaaah aaaaah
