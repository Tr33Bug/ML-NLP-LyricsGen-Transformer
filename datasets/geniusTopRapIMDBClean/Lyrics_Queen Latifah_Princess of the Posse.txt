Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds O Lord
They know not why they sweat me
Bitings against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib
The call me the high priestess of disaster
Although Im not a dread and not a rasta
Theres never been a word I cant master
Ive always been a piddly pastor
I reign the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And Im the princess of the posse so yo take it light
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one
She rhyme American she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if theres a pattern
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn
Let me know now if you would like to protest this proceeding
A greeting or would you rather progress
Onto a higher plateau truly Im taking it slow
Enough for you to seek the knowledge and to know
Im the QUEEN LATIFAH
Queen of the RE Posse the GLA which is Get Live Alright
You standing there chewing on your fingernails nervous
Watching me doing the live thing
Singing like a bird sings ringing like the phone ring
Im the Queen and youre the underling
Im never following I follow none
The princess of the posse is a cool one


The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one
She rhyme American she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world
Im the queen of the clan with a mic in my hand
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
Its a concoction for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they dont know Im the one to front on or two
Im snatching hearts cause Im Latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
Im kicking gold so grab a hold and get a good grip
Stop the lying the trying
The time buying youve been denying
Cause youre dependent on me the princess of the posse
I got the cards so Im dealing a death blow
Youre taking no crowns put that on cease
My DJs name is Mark the 45 King
To the posse peace
Got to let you know where I come from
The princess of the posse is a cool one
The Princess of the Posse me say she a cool one
She rhyme American she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn the Bronx USA the world
Latifah run the family
Me say me haffi do it for the RE posse
You try to be down you cant take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me
Latifah run the family
