Rough... Lyrics
This one goes out to all the rough and rugged muthafuckas out there
Yes baby
Strictly on the Latifah tip, I'm saying
A Yo they don't know nothin' about this here
Yo This Queen Latifah in the house
I got my man Heavy D, My Boy Treach and My Boy KRS-One in the house
To Rip some shit with me right quick

The quicker committee gettin' witty for many 'cause the war ain't won
This the city where I'm from, I'll glue ya titties to ya tongue
It's on like this switch, It's Big, Big, Big Hit, The Black Bleep, the rip
Smokin' Shit with mad misfits
The one man, one mold, Murder 1
Murder gold, one hard headache to hold
Word to god, it's good as gold
If it ain't rough, it ain't ashy & brick thick
And if it ain't nasty, Naughty's pissin' on your picnic
Rough is the place, the space, knuckle which way you think
Here to put a fat black nose back on the Black Sphinx
I don't shoot the gift, bitch, will slaughter your Christmas
I shot St. Nick and stuck him for the gifts I ain't get
No one under 17 admitted, so I came 18 deep
You can raid but you can't thank.....
If it ain't rough, it ain't rugged
And if you can't hear it, you can't dub it, I love it

If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)

Tell me how you like it: rough
Tell me how you need it: rough
Tell me how you keep it: rough
Tell me how you want it: rough

Tuck away your entire stuff, I'm comin' tough
Rugged and rough, from a blunt, take a puff UH
Never joke with a tech nine, hotter than a sex line
Next time, flex when it's my time
I'll take a chump or a champ, a clamp or a zamp, so now the rolly polly holy moly
I'm magnificent
Skip to my lou, gather up your crew
Let the heavy setters show you what a nigga could really do today
We all know about body bags, but seems everybody brags
About being tough, catch a body tag
Knowin' well, they just cream puffs
Talkin' tough cause they've seen stuff, it's a bluff
They ain't tough they ain't nothin'

If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
Follow me massive! Follow me massive! Follow me crew! follow me crew!
KRS-One in the party just a gwan and wanna (ease up)
Here we go, yo, you Know the flow, I get high & low
You Know, why you wanna flow with the pro? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Breakin' rappers in half by the ass is my only task
Gold & platinum plaques will pass, only talent will last
I come to the party prepared to kick ass
You come to the party well prepared to get scared
You're through and need stitching up, you and your crew'll start bitching up
Where you gonna live around where I'm not stompin' it?
I really believe you're a wee bit ova confident
On MTV, you wanna down rate me quick, yeah I'm a hypocrite
When you in my face, you on my dick
Consequently your lyrics don't fit, get a grip
You straight on some sucka shit

If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)

Here comes the queen, I'll make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
You're looking for a friend to the end? Good, that me
But if you're looking for a gangsta bitch
That's exactly what you're gonna see
Ain't no way, ain't no say, this ain't your lucky day
So go pray, now you pay,  'cause I don't fuckin' play
Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right:
"You diss me on record? You see me? Fight!"
Just throw up the joints and get to the point
And cut all the talk, the BS can walk
'Cause I ain't here to waste my breath
You test my skills, you gettin' put to ya death
I'm sick of all the huff, puff, blow your house down bullshit I heard last week
You get ya ass beat
So watch the way you approach the Queen
If it ain't rough I'll send that ass to the guillotines

If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)1Embed
