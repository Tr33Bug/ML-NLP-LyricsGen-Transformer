Rough Lyrics
This one goes out to all the rough and rugged muthafuckas out there
Yes baby
Strictly on the Latifah tip Im saying
A Yo they dont know nothin about this here
Yo This Queen Latifah in the house
I got my man Heavy D My Boy Treach and My Boy KRSOne in the house
To Rip some shit with me right quick
The quicker committee gettin witty for many cause the war aint won
This the city where Im from Ill glue ya titties to ya tongue
Its on like this switch Its Big Big Big Hit The Black Bleep the rip
Smokin Shit with mad misfits
The one man one mold Murder 1
Murder gold one hard headache to hold
Word to god its good as gold
If it aint rough it aint ashy  brick thick
And if it aint nasty Naughtys pissin on your picnic
Rough is the place the space knuckle which way you think
Here to put a fat black nose back on the Black Sphinx
I dont shoot the gift bitch will slaughter your Christmas
I shot St Nick and stuck him for the gifts I aint get
No one under 17 admitted so I came 18 deep
You can raid but you cant thank
If it aint rough it aint rugged
And if you cant hear it you cant dub it I love it
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
Tell me how you like it rough
Tell me how you need it rough
Tell me how you keep it rough
Tell me how you want it rough
Tuck away your entire stuff Im comin tough
Rugged and rough from a blunt take a puff UH
Never joke with a tech nine hotter than a sex line
Next time flex when its my time
Ill take a chump or a champ a clamp or a zamp so now the rolly polly holy moly
Im magnificent
Skip to my lou gather up your crew
Let the heavy setters show you what a nigga could really do today
We all know about body bags but seems everybody brags
About being tough catch a body tag
Knowin well they just cream puffs
Talkin tough cause theyve seen stuff its a bluff
They aint tough they aint nothin
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
Follow me massive Follow me massive Follow me crew follow me crew
KRSOne in the party just a gwan and wanna  ease up 
Here we go yo you Know the flow I get high  low
You Know why you wanna flow with the pro Oh no no no no no no no
Breakin rappers in half by the ass is my only task
Gold  platinum plaques will pass only talent will last
I come to the party prepared to kick ass
You come to the party well prepared to get scared
Youre through and need stitching up you and your crewll start bitching up
Where you gonna live around where Im not stompin it
I really believe youre a wee bit ova confident
On MTV you wanna down rate me quick yeah Im a hypocrite
When you in my face you on my dick
Consequently your lyrics dont fit get a grip
You straight on some sucka shit
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
Here comes the queen Ill make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
Youre looking for a friend to the end Good that me
But if youre looking for a gangsta bitch
Thats exactly what youre gonna see
Aint no way aint no say this aint your lucky day
So go pray now you pay  cause I dont fuckin play
Matter fact I think IceT he put it just right
You diss me on record You see me Fight
Just throw up the joints and get to the point
And cut all the talk the BS can walk
Cause I aint here to waste my breath
You test my skills you gettin put to ya death
Im sick of all the huff puff blow your house down bullshit I heard last week
You get ya ass beat
So watch the way you approach the Queen
If it aint rough Ill send that ass to the guillotines
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves 
If It aint rough  I could do without it 
If It aint rough  Just throw it to the curb 
If It aint rough  He could do without it 
If It aint rough  Its working my nerves
