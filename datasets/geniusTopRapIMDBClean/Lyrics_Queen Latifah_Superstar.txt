You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you aint gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me you can
My girlies caught me on a good day
I was bored in the mood for jugs
So we took it to a club
Thinking we would mingle a little
And plus at the time I was single a little
So I said Fine we could meet up about nine
So anyway we goes in the place
Word up its flowing
We walking around giving up peace to everyone we know and
The people in the joint is yelling Hurt me Hurt me
Im working my way over to the bar cause Im thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no I think he sights me
I smile cause hes fly
He smiles back I think he likes me
But then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me
Cause hes scared to get dissed
I dont bark baby
I dont bite neither
You could have asked me yourself
For my number to my beeper
The worst thing Id have said was no
So maybe next time
You better push up like a pro bro
You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you aint gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me you can
Saturday cooling in the house
Looking at the videos
At the same time Im trying to put on my clothes
First date First date
With a guy his name was Nate
Was he fly  Yes he was
Word up  The type you have on a plate cuz
I only met him last night
So I dont really know him but I hope it goes right
So he rolls up at my door in a twentyfourfoot limo
What is all this for
Are we expecting more
He showered me with gifts and
Then he kissed me on my hand
Now what was in your plan
I really didnt understand
Were only going to the movies
Either youre trying to impress me
Or else youre trying to get the cooty
Listen baby I dont want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from a man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant


You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you aint gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me you can
You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out I only wanna find out
I only want to find out I only want to find out
Just find out who you are
Now if you ready to deal
With a girl who considers herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
And chill with the shyness and the pride baby
Cause life is beautiful with the Highness by your side
Maybe we can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought Id do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
But you aint gotta be no superstar honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money aint gon make me love ya
And neither will your car
So cease with the latter two
With that attitude you wont be getting far
And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Cant a sister get the same type of reaction  Yeah 
If youre cool like that
Take a trip to Jersey cause thats where Im at
You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you aint gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me you can
You aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you aint gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me you can
No you aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to know just who you are
No you aint gotta be no superstar
I only want to know just who you are
