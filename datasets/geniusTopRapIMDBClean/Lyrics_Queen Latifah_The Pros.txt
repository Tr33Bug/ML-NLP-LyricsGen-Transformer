I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said Latifah bust a line
I dont think youre on the strength show me the time
I said If you really want to do this we can do this fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme
As soon as she attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb broke her down with the noun
Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they cant go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings
Ha ha I was thinking the same thing
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them
Rhyme fiends biters and bums
Took me kind of light said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight  You didnt do what I think you did  Yeah right
Bash went the first Smash went the next one
He started he started to run
But to his surprise his feet must have slipped
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step
You see you may speculate but everybody knows
Not one amatuer can deal with the pros
These are the pros coming now from Queen Latifah and DaddyO
And if you want to hear some more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say Bo bo bo
There was a time that a man could go
Anyplace anywhere without a Rambo
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it
Im DaddyO and I dont quit
So feel the flow yall because youre under attack
From my rhymes cause Im writing swift rhymes in stacks
And four words to the wack just Stay the hell back
Cause its a fact if youre wack you aint saying jack
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me
Youll be the next ingredient in my recipe
Start and dont finish Ill hunt you down
And you cant run forever so youll be found
And with nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
How you wanna be eaten boy baked or fried

These are the pros coming now from Queen Latifah and DaddyO
And if you want to hear some more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say Bo bo bo  Repeat 2x 
Its Latifah the Queen pioneer of the mainstream
I flow just like a pro cause its the same thing
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound
So button your lips and stop trying to be down
I caught you out there  How many times  A lot of times
Cause when it comes to mine you know I gotta rhyme
Stepping to the right to the left
To the best place well I have to face
A sucker like a poohbutt weak and soft
Riding my brastrap trying to get off
Understand and know if you want to go
Youd better be ready to flow cause Im a pro
These are the pros coming now from Queen Latifah and DaddyO
And if you want to hear more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say Bo bo bo  Repeat 2x 
We wax floors with bums make mocks out of some
Sting em hard and watch them complain how it stung
Kidnap the babysitter lock em inside a box
DaddyO and the true blue Queen of Rock
These are the pros coming now from Queen Latifah and DaddyO
And if you want to hear more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say Bo bo bo  Repeat 4x
