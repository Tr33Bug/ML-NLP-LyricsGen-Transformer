Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows theres exceptions to this rule
Now dont be gettin mad when we playin its cool
But dont you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
Thats why Im talkin one day I was walkin down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of em felt my booty he was nasty
I turned around red somebody was catchin the wrath
Then the little one said Ha ha yeah me bitch and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
Huh I punched him dead in his eye
And said Who you callin a bitch Yeah
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Here we go you gotta let him know 
You go come on here we go 
UNITY love a black woman from  You gotta let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho here we go 
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Uh you gotta let him know 
You go come on here we go 
UNITY love a black man from  Yeah you gotta let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho 


I hit the bottom there aint nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but thats about enough
You put your hands on me again Ill put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I dont want to see my kids see me gettin beat down by daddy smackin mommy all around
You say Im nothin without ya but Im nothing with ya
A man dont really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door Im not takin it no more
Im not your personal whore thats not what Im here for
And nothing good gon come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see  Who you callin a bitch Uh 
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Here we go you gotta let him know 
Come on here we go 
UNITY love a black man from  Yeah you gotta let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho here we go 
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Uh you gotta let him know 
Come on here we go 
UNITY love a black woman from  Yeah you gotta let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho 
Whats goin on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like YoYo you dont hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a gangsta bitch
Now that you saw Apaches video
I saw you wildin actin like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from
A minute ago you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabehard
You barely know your ABCs please
Theres plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet  Young lady 
Uh and real bad girls are the silent type
Aint none of this worth gettin your face sliced
Cause thats what happened to your homegirl right
Barking with no bite 
She got to wear that for life
Who you callin a bitch Uh 
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Here we go you gotta let him know 
Come on here we go 
UNITY Love a black woman from  You gotta let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho here we go 
UNITY UNITY thats a unity  Gotta let him know 
Come on here we go 
UNITY Love a black man from  You must let him know 
Infinity to infinity  You aint a bitch or a ho
