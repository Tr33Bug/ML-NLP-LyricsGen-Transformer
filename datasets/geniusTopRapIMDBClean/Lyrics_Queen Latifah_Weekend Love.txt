Oooh Thing called Weekend Love
Tony Rebel and Queen Latifah
I could live with it baby
You know what I mean
Watch this
Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If youve been misled
By anything I said
I didnt mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So Ill catch you on the weekend
Mondays through Fridays out  Ill see you then
A WEEK and a END
And a LOVE we were meant to be
A WEEK a END
LOVE we were meant to be
Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
Seems its been so long
Since you filled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
But youve got things to do
And I have got things too
So Ill catch you on the weekend
Monday through Fridays out  Ill see you then


Because were sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
I know you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love  maybe someday it will change 
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If youve been misled
By anything I said
I didnt mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So Ill catch you on the weekend
Monday through Fridays out  Ill see you then
A WEEK and a END
LOVE we were meant to be
A WEEK a END
LOVE we were meant to be
When we are absent that is a  to present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know youre possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend wish the clock would reverse its hand
Great things can come in a small bag
So lets make use of the time that we have
When we are together cause were spectacular
As if we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we area just a
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
