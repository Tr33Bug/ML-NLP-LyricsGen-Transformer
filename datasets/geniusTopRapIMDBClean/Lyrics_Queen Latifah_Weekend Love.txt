Weekend Love Lyrics
Oooh! Thing called Weekend Love!
Tony Rebel and Queen Latifah
I could live with it, baby
You know what I mean?
Watch this!

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays through Friday's out - I'll see you then

A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

Seems it's been so long
Since you filled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
But you've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then
You might also like
Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
I know, you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified

Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday it will change)
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then
A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
When we are absent, that is a  to present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend, wish the clock would reverse its hand
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together, 'cause we're spectacular
As if we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together, I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are-a just a...

Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend loveEmbed
