And now ladies and gentlemen
The Keeper of the Keys
The Countess of the Clink
The Mistress of Murderers Row
Matron Mama Morton
Ask any of the chickies in my pen
Theyll tell you Im the biggest mother hen
I love them all and all of them love me
Because the system works
The system called reciprocity
Got a little motto
Always sees me through
When youre good to Mama
Mamas good to you
Theres a lot of favors
Im prepared to do
You do one for Mama
Shell do one for you
They say that life is tit for tat
And thats the way I live
So I deserve a lot of tat
For what Ive got to give
Dont you know that this hand
Washes that one too
When youre good to Mama
Mamas good to you
If you want my gravy
Pepper my rag
Spice it up for Mama
Shell get hot for you
When they pass that basket
Folks contribute to
You put in for Mama
Shell put out for you
The folks atop the ladder
Are the ones the world adores
So boost me up my ladder kid
And Ill boost you up yours
Lets all stroke together
Like the Princeton crew
When youre strokin Mama
Mamas strokin you

So whats the one conclusion
I can bring this number to
When youre good to Mama
Mamas good to you
