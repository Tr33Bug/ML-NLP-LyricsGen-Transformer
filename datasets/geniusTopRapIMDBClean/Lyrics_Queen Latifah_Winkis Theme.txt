This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki  Search and find search and find search and find search and find 
Whos lookin down on me from Heaven  Whats on your mind Search and find 
Watchin my every move as usual  Whats goin down Search and find 
There but for the grace of God do I go Do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go Do I go go
Im tryin to take my time on this rhyme
But its bustin from the seams
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
Movin all around oh yes Im makin leaps and bounds
Theres so much you can say no time to write it down
Im skippin to this and skippin to that
Ive overflowed my cup
Im flowin kinda quick I hope you can keep up
Everything aint cool just cause you slap me on my hand
Theres things about me all of yall just got to understand
Latifah never was a teacher never was a preacher
Never was a saint never was conceited never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I wanna faint
But I never shut up when things piss me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
Thats what I gotta do
Thats how it gotta be
I got an angel watchin over me
There but for the grace of God do I go Do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go Do I go go
There but for the grace of God  If you lose your way 
Search and find search and find
There but for the there but for the grace of God 
Search and find search and find
There but for the there but for the grace of God 
Search and find search and find
Whats on your mind Whats goin down
Whats goin down runnin room
Its time you find
Whats goin on in your mind
Try to find peace of mind
When your blind worlds unkind
Got to fight keep the right
At the time never gone
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Keep on keep on keep on keep on
Strive on strive on strive on


Yeahyeah yeahyeah yeahyeah yeahyeah
Yeahyeah yeahyeah break it down
The Lord is the light is the light is the light
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
Yes he did yes he did
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
You dont hear me
There but for the grace of God do I go Do I go  The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world yes he did yes he did 
There but for the grace of God do I go  The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world world world world world
