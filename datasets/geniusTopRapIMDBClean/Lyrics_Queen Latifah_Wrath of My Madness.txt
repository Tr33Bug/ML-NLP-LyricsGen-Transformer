My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The RE posse said Yo Latifah we can do this
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause Im in full effect
Queen Latifah is fiveoh on this set
Youve been begging and dying
For somebodys rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
Im coolin teaching those needing schoolin
And the mic This mic in my hand Im rulin
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme thats so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But dont consider biting
Theres penalties for those who dont do right
And just be reciting
Everyone elses word that took a lot of thinking
Its not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me Your highness
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness


Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
Youre begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrinktofit buttonflies fit quite snug
As a bug you know why Because Im bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that Im pumping
Im jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on just get into it
Dont lie and say youve been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Dont step up in my face
You dont want to feel the taste
Dont try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound why
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen LATIFAH in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Dont make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
Youre loving me youre leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness
