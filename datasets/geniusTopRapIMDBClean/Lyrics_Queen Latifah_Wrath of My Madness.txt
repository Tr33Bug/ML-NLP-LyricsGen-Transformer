Wrath of My Madness Lyrics
My mellow, Latee, was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said "Yo Latifah we can do this"
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying
For somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
I'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
And the mic? This mic in my hand? I'm rulin'!
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do right
And just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well, mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me "Your highness"
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness
You might also like
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
You're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds, they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it
Don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face
You don't want to feel the taste
Don't try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
You're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness2Embed
