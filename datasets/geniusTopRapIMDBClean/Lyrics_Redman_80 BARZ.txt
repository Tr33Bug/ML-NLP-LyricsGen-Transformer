This gives you a feeling of power  Ow 
What up yall Say hello to the champ
Make you duck down learned that out my boot camp
I was a big deal when MJ dated Brooke Shields
Now Im equipped to go Bushwick for the bills that boy
Im the red button dont press me
And Im a fucked up dad the way I dead beats
Lets see why Im Bebe bad
Condoms in the Jacuzzi Im DayDays dad
I used to wanna hit JJ Fad now I motivate
Im runnin with a Gary Vee kind of heart rate
No excuses my juice runnin like Im retaliating for my ancestor nooses
I want pockets fatter than Bruce Bruces
I run with only captains on the cruise ship
While you kiss ass Im on the frontline
Spittin like Im unsigned watch a nigga unwind
Psycho ward admit it tell the judge I did it
Moved that I inspired yo body yo
I motivate big girls to work out
While you listen to Cardi B do a little cardio
I rep my city like Trae in Houston
Hungry like Em before Doc Dre produced him
The straitjacket I had on was loose
And now I bodybag any rap nigga that suits him
I tell a young nigga Plan what you want bro
Stop playin what you on the Gram with the gun fo
Nobody believe you
Even Large Profess said hes fed
We all lookin through ya front door
And if we all there you aint gon do nothin
My crew too live for us not to move somethin
Im a OG and you can tell the Bay
I aint think a nigga still be rappin when Im fotay
Years old my doc say Im a hot mess
Cause I be clownin hoes as a outlet
And your chicks got goatees and biceps
Lookin like Rodman I thought you made progress
Ima keep goin and tell the kids When you go to school
Dress down in the Teflon
You might have to dodge bullets
Even I dodged a bullet I aint fuck with the Bitcoin
I dont lie fool I shit like I ate a order of Thai food
I could give you seventeen syllable haikus
No one seein Doc America should think like Erykah Badu
Back and forth with the blunt get Aaliyah high  Uh 
My block push the weight til its legalized
Interior my hood like Syria
OG kush got my eye like Whitaker
Def Squad WuTang we all kill it
This creed cant be built by Carl Weathers
Fourteen brothers jackets all leather  Lets go 
Red off the wall like racquetball nigga
Young and Restless Im old and reckless
Spend 50K on a necklace
While I watch Death Wish gettin head call it Neckflix
White people call me they say Hi Redman
I go off like ya insecure side chick
Tell Herbie Hancock this how I rock it
Niggas Gd up til they hear the gunfire
But Im behind my hitter nigga umpire
I aint stupid I put all the anger in the music
Feel the rage when I hadouken
If you dont know who behind this rhyme
This is me boy like a Tay Roc line  Lets go 
KRS for pres JayZ for vice pres
I had a dream speech Nah its a nightmare
Put your hands on me wherever you put your hands on me at nigga
Im leavin you right there
Im not violent but niggasll try you when you smilin
So Im Fly Jones I keep a silence
Im never tired
You get washed in the ring its a wrap
You can hear the violin
When I react you under contract
Its like tellin John Wick where the enemy
I keep connects like my brother Raekwon
If it go down he know where to get ten a key
I work harder and smarter
Thats why Im able to keep a ounce in the godfather  Yeah 
Def Squad WuTang my alma mater
I get fly with the words call my hand PalmPilot
And Im from the Garden State
