A Day of Sooperman Lover Lyrics
Look, up in the sky
It's a bird
It's a plane
Hehehe, no, it's Sooperman Lover, baby, yeah
Daddy, daddy
Would you please tell me a story?
Alright, get over here and sit your big ass down
Lemme tell you a story about the Sooperman Lover, check it
Yo, I was out for lunch and shit
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked
Boogiein' to my Walkman with an "S" on my chest (Bust a move)
Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas, so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am, so get off that old bull, shuck
Lunchtime was up (Fuck)
Let me jet or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree with a tag that say that:
"If found, please return to this address"
(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set
Like, pchow, I jetted to the closest phone booth
Quick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit
I can leap tall buildings (Yeah)
In a single bound
Boom, right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling
(It's a plane) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter watchin' Fritz on Channel 6 and
Relaxin', feet cocked up just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
Then landed at the cat's tag address in the projects
(Elevator's broke) So I had to take the back steps
(Knock-knock) The doors opened and my eyes swole
From this bad-ass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold
"Yo, is this your cat?" ("Aw, yes, where'd you find him at?")
"He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan"
"Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?"
"Nah, baby, the "S" on my chest stands for"
Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said, they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong
There's something wrong with me, yes, it is
There's something wrong, yeah, yes, it is

She was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me
"No money, a donut, and some, uh, coffee maybe?"
"Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?"
"Uh, make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka"
We sat, unhooked the cape from my back
She felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked
"Goddamn, Sooperlover, your shit look thick
Tell me, how strong are you with muscles like this
You bad motherfucker?" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)
Akhi hit you like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey, hold up, she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said: "Here, baby, hit it"
"Nah, baby, I ain't with it
You'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit"
But I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull, it was hype, outta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the cover and, oh, brother, I was with it
Ready to hit it, asked my dick, "Yo, wassup, G?"
Yo, man, shit's thick
Licked her on her belly then kissed her down her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
As big as mine (Ew), this bitch must be crazy
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze
'Cause I'm the

Said, they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong
There's something wrong with me, yes, it is
There's something wrong, yeah, yes, it is1Embed
