Yes Im a superhero dont forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway lets get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am so get off that old bull shuck
Lunchtime was up  Fuck 
Let me jet or Ill collect unemployment bucks
On the way back Jack I spotted this object a stray cat
Stuck in a tree with a tag that say that
If found please return to this address
How did you see it  Nigga with my Xray eye set
Like pchow I jetted to the closest phone booth
Quick flash I dipped into my Sooperlover suit
I can leap tall buildings  Yeah 
In a single bound
Boom right through the fuckin phone booth ceiling
Its a plane  Nah Sooperman Lovers the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission to save this cat that was wishin
He was in his litter watchin Fritz on Channel 6 and
Relaxin feet cocked up just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he wont start meowin and bitchin
Then landed at the cats tag address in the projects
Elevators broke  So I had to take the back steps
Knockknock  The doors opened and my eyes swole
From this badass honey sippin a quart of Old Gold
Yo is this your cat  Aw yes whered you find him at 
He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan
Well how the hell did you save him Are you police undercover

She was grateful lookin for ways to repay me
No money a donut and some uh coffee maybe

She felt my arms cause my pythons looked stacked

Akhi hit you like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee highheeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up hey hold up she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke yo she was no joke
She took a sniff some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said Here baby hit it
Nah baby I aint with it
Youd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit
But Ill hit the blunt so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie opened the bag and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull it was hype outta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later tossed the cover and oh brother I was with it
Ready to hit it asked my dick Yo wassup G

Licked her on her belly then kissed her down her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
