Still walking down the streets with my hand on my black Tec
My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts
Im high when I sag my 2 Black Guys
I would be brief but my Karl Kanis didnt dry
I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps
My smoke bangs like its freshly picked from the swamps
So nigga how you roll a blunt how you roll a blunt
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt
Now I smoke the Maui wowwee
Then Ill be back for more Im sure like Al B
Go Uptown smoke quarterpounds at the Dungeon
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the BomBa
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don
Huh pick up a bag from my block twoohs the number
Who can get swift with the microphonics
Plus Im crisp like CDs on LPs in 3D
My funk respect it cosmic injected
That cause me to set it off just like that club record
Hit it from the back stay strapped like two packs of lubricants
Its gonna hurt no its not I got experience
The funk dweller creeps through your cellar
And if your moms dont know your ass better tell her like this yall
Theres a million and one blunt spots all over the world
That got the good herb for all you boys and girls
Which one do you go to
Which one do you go to
Im packing buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks
Hey bro I didnt know your nickel bags come that fat
Yo check it my lyrics strip the track buttnaked
Catch the local to the A to the buddha to my vocals
And I set the world on fire
Get a billion people higher from just one blunt in my cypher
Youd swear the ganja was mixed in bombazee
The rhymer bomb squads and MCs like Hank Shocklee
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots
From fifteen to fiftyfifth I ran all through the blocks
I set it off jock I light a blunt for my nigga D
Thats doing three flat now where I get the hash at
You cant fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract
Past that my stuff Im rough like McGruff on dust
Theres a million and one blunt spots in America
Yeah Im tellin ya
Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfucking air
Smoked out with niggas from North Newark to Montclair
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms
Cause I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and them
One of the Americas Most Blunted
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted
Ninety degrees smoke with LOD on the Island
Then back to Stat to smoke more packs with the Shaolin
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger
But it didnt work because they Lee nails got longer
But the weed is good for when youre macking
And girls can front it off like they dont know shit that happened
I know what happened I told her back nick that motherfucker
So check my stamina your ass couldnt snap with cameras
Leave you on your back like Godzilla did Gamera
Props on blocks smoking the choc and whatnots
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops
