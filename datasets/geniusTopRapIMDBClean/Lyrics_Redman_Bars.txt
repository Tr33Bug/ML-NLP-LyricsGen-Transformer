All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit 
I dont give a fuck nigga you already know what it is
All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real

Like OJ let me take a stab at it
Inhale like asthmatics
The chiropractor Redman Im back at it
My sawed off by the bed its a craftmatic
The size of a Subway sandwich ask Jared
Big foot givin input
Every rhyme like Lisa Ray homie fuck with it its a good look
Im a lieutenant the new school respect Red Menace
My society raised a winner
I set any bitch straight to restore order
Lift my pimp hand up like Why I oughta
I dont tolerate the nonsense
I tell my bitch be easy like you straight outta Compton
South by Southwest out in Austin
Tore the place down Twitter went Wow
Def Jam raised their eyebrow we independent now
You shouldve took care of the cash cow
Moooove out my way bitch Captain Courageous
Fuck you and your iPod if I aint in your playlist
Bravehearted Im Nas in 94
You could say Im your favorite rappers favorite
Im like Penny on the floor wasted
Pump your brakes divorce me if you cant relate

Chick on her knees like SMH
Get it Too slow listen faster cause my times a factor
You freestylin and I aint asked ya
Weak link niggas Redll think bigger
This flow hit your chick she cry me a river
And you Simba lyin like you carrying around the iron
Like Im a supervisor and Im firin
All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit 
Bars okay nigga

All you emcees must get dissed
Cause only real niggas gonna bump my shit

Yo Im a 90s nigga so of course I think my era the best
Untouchable fucker we Eliot Ness
Mitchell  Ness its all Jersey
Hoes send my wild DMsI feel Im related to X
I dont be up in the trap tryna write raps
Just to say Im in the trap and made it off rap
As the world turns I let my L burn
And watch you little fish swim up in my whale urine
Even gay bitches love me like the Lword
And bitch niggas get a clip from a spell bird
I mean the Mossberg
The same thing my weed got a case of gangrene when its angry
I act like Scarface up in your project hallway
Make sure youre all covered  by AllState
Me and them beats in your ear like Andre
And what I think of yall motherfuckers strange
Fuck yall Im addicted like a menthal
I was born from the days of yes yes yall
My boy carrying a tech rep call
So take your bitch ass home Watch your cholesterol
I dont talk a lot I just rap a lot
On this verse I got tips from a astronaut
Check the forensics we in this
Ill end this with Red is the best in the motherfuckin business
