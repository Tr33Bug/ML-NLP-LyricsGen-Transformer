Blow Your Mind  Remix  Lyrics
Ahem hit me
Yeah
Its goin down
Whats goin down
Yo yo yo Reggie Noble drop that beat in ha
Yeah uhhuh uhhuh
Give it to me give it to me
Ahh look out its the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who dont be knowin my name I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide make ya slip make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit I DJ like Quik
The topnotch of the block cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks Im hot so give up the props
My style is hummin comin at ya duck or get backed up
Dispatcher  Red get freaky to the rapture 
So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew to the check of onetwo
Its you  Ahh  funky fresh in the flesh troop
Come on and get down and boogieoogie with the roughneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kid
Yo Red  Whassup G  bridge
Ooh you blow my mind
On and on and on and on
Ooh you blow my mind  Look out 
On and on and on and on  Ahh 
Can I tear the roof off this mother Its the funkdafied brother
Then I laugh because I burn ya like Backdraft
So call the fire engine cause Im flamin up your buildin
One life to live so the funk is in all my children
Cause I can get wicked like the witches from Eastwick
And freak the type of funk to make all yall teeth grit
And crumble my style is more flyer than the Brundle
Fly from The Fly part one The Fly part two
PsychobetaPFunk got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk you got a blunt light it cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being watch me freak it in Korean
Redman
Redman my man
I rip shop in hiphop I get props my lip rocks
The rap stuffs more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I havent blown your mind ah
Ooh you blow my mind
All around the world for the funk  On and on and on and on 
All around the world for the funk  On and on and on and on 
Let me get busy with the funkyfly stuff cause Ill cut your freakin
Eyes out fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
Its the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level the PFunk the devil
The spectacular Blacula bust holes like Dracula
Loaded of course more legend than Acura
Im swift I like big spliffs so I tisktisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
Ill cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can wax on wax off like Danielsan
Do the yayyay the boogie say up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogie thanks to E cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard word to herb cause I macframalama
Plus I kick the grammar straight from New Jerz
Its the renegade rap Redman really who rip rhymes
In rough mode yo hold your breath while I explode ha
