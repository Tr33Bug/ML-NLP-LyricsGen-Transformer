Ah look out its the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who dont be knowin my name I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide make ya slip make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks Im hot so give up the props
My style is hummin comin at ya duck or get backed up
Dispatcher Red get freaky to the rapture
So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew to the check aone two
Its you who Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids
Yo E  Whats up G 
Bridge
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
I do the hustle like Russell Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra pop more pop than CocaCola
Next to Yoda Im a star at war plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up girl
Come on and get it if you with it troop
Krush groovin smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit cause Im cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaPFunk got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk you got a blunt light it cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being watch me freak it in Korean
Redman
forget it
I rip shop in hiphop I get props my lip rocks
The rap stuffs more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I havent blown your mind  Rewind 


And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I 
Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
Cause I cut your freakin eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
Its the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level the PFunk the devil
The spectacular Blacula bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
Im swift I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can wax on wax off like Danielsan
Do the yea yea boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard word to Herb
Cause I macaframalama
Plus I kick the grammar straight from New Jers
Its the renegade rap Redman really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo hold your breath while I explode
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I havent blown your mind 
And you blow my mind baby
And you blow my mind baby  Press rewind if I havent blown your mind
