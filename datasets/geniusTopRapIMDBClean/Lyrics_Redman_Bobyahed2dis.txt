Ah
You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman
Lets take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure
To where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered
Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics
From a place we call Hell and beyond
And I say
Right about now you are rocking with the best
Can I get a hit  Hit it  Thank you  Hit it 
What youre about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic Devil himself
To all knotty head niggas bob to this
Come walk with Def Squad on the dark side
Coming to you live and direct without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it
God damn  Word is bond word is me 
So whos that funky nigga thats known to kick the fat shit
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Talking bout the dog dogcatcher
Its the dogcatcher Ill catch you
Oh how insane
Catch a contact from the weed itll bust your brain
The top notch of hiphop and Im on the charts
Im catching applause when I rock the microphone from the heart
My styles foul so look into the Eyes of Laura Mars
As you can see I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin down the highway with my forty between my lap bitch
Crossing the GW coming into Manhattan
Boy my skills are stacks I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettoes like crack
Go in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got it dont matter whos gun bigger
But I bet you you cant do that
Cause your multiplatinums cant save your ass from the block
And youre fucked if it aint pop
The funk is blowin wattage out your fuckin trunks
Like Pete Puma Im known to give a ho lots of lumps  Haha 
Props I got coming through your block nine cocked
My socks even got threeeightynine shots
Dont press it I hang em like them niggas do in Texas
You dont have no heart you chestless
Cause your hearts on my necklace
I give props to real MCs like KRSOne
Kool G Rap Buckshot Busta B and Im from
The East Coast where a nigga like youd get laughed at
And since you came out gassed well Im closing your gas cap
The creature from the deep the ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey keep your eyes up on the Preacher  Uh 
A menace like Dennis I got game like Guinness
I can French kiss my lyrics then I run trains with sentences
Lord have mercy  Stop  its too much funk to cope with
Droppin dope shit after dope shit were the Trojans
Yell from the lungs
That rings from here to kingdom come
And I dont have to be a special ed to get dumb
So fuck what you heard word to herb
Cause I macaframalama plus I kick the grammar straight from New Jers
Badmon here we here we come
From New Jersey in the place to be
So fuck what you heard word to herb
Cause I macaframalama plus I kick the grammar straight from New Jers
Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me
Cause they here to stay
Ill be outside when you get there
