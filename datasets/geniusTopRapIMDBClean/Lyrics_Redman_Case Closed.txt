Hah
huh hah hah hah HAHHAH hah 
Nineteen ninetysix
hah come on  Coming with the sickedest motherfuckers
In the perimeter
huh whooo nineteen  You hit em with a newwwww
ninetysix nine six  tree dick be fly in your ass
Dick Didick check 
Amazing grace how sweet the sound is of the fo pound
To blast all these sound men that got the po sound
Yippeekiyay motherfuckers heres the show down
But since were broke now with dope sounds now here we go now
Check the motion while I be puffin the potent
Blow spots and urban networks with other experts
Plus this thing between my ear thinks clear
And the only thing it fears is the man upstairs
So fuck your bulletproof gear
If I decide to get your ass you better believe its more than a blast
booya  More like rough paragraphs out Alcatraz
And ash your staff let the grime our your ass
Everybodys hustling with sons toting guns
Where Reggie Nobles from we stick nuns that got funds
Bomb niggas like they did in Oklahoma
Freez youre froze Def Squad UHH case closed
I be the sneaky second dimension seeping through your sector
Have nectar leaking out you wack rhyme stressers
Extra deez disease leave rashes on rappers
Makin MCs so feel the breeze of the Grandmaster
Packed with swift solid style structure
Simonizing MCs with the degree of street ruckus
Aiyyo who got guns I split precise spleen splitter
Return my physical presence to the borough of the hard hitters
I devour night sun shower minutes last hour weak mans last power
Body the six four mind shotty
The one you handle second dimension mind vandal
Lacerating your retina for tryin to see this
As Im flowin through the prism of the X3D
See at forty belows I freak flows that burn your nose
When you inhale the verbal blows case closed
Aiyyo why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga
Aiyyo why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga 
Yo dont you know who I am motherfucker
Redmans the name fool
Thats my nigga 
Why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga
Aiyyo why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga 
Yo dont you know who they are motherfucker
Crossbreeds the crew fool 
Them my niggas
Things aint easy cuz we be strugglin day to day
A bunch of stressed black men with not really much to say
Twistin up some brown paper that we struggle just to get
All the deaf dumb and blind become mentally equipped
As I extend my pen to wreak havoc on paper
I execute and burn MCs like Absolut with no chaser
Strong as chemical the general with props
Past wreckin mics I make the Earth shatter like the 7th sign
My drama bring about a new aura
Im sending a plague through your town like God did Sodom and Gomorrah
The deepest my vocals actions got you speechless
Make gangsta niggas wanna go home and talk to Jesus
No man alive could figure we beating rappers literally
X3D get up on this three dimensional trilogy
Got no love for foes no respect for grimy hoes
Nuff said X3D blowing up case closed
