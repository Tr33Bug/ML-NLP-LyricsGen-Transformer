Yeah bout to fly that knot
Redman Keith Murray Erick Sermon with the Cosmic Slop
And we all pack Glocks
Word is Bond word is bond
Fuck around and get shot
As I flip skip to the beat on wax and tax
I react with tons of macs a ball and some jumping jacks
Flyin expert puttin in work
No question cosmic funk and weed session
Like GangStarr step up its Hard to Earn
But I change up the mode and blow up the globe
The bandit spittin dialect umm  UMMM 
Catchin wreck umm  UMMM 
One two micraphone check  UMMM 
Attention passengers were on a noncentral journey
To Hell and beyond
FUNKADELIC DROP THE BOMB
Booyaa
Im that type of nigga to give it to ya
My Cosmic Slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers
My flow freeze the Nile The Funk Child splits the river
Then I crush like the bombazee was rushed through my verbal lust
Im spaced out I LOST MY MIND ON CLOUD 19
VISINE FOR EYES when I blow Alpines
Dial 9 00 For the hero of the wierdos
I hope my brain dont bust
Transform into a 711 Slurpie Slush
ITS THE FLY My music will burn eyes
Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop ock I fidget my nuts alot
Got the two Glocks with oowops then bodies trace the chalk
Im like an eclipse on a Friday the 13th
With black cats and Haleys Comet blazin blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted for you funk fiends
That Def Squad will get the fuckin cream like Noxzema

For those that remember pics and afros  its on like that 
Platform shoes and bellbottoms some got em
Spaced out way out is what Im talkin about
In the Cosmic Slop of the Ghetto
Zuzuzuzuzu zuzuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu
Zu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu
With amazing manifestations I dictate to nations
More Cosmic Funk innovations in my creation
This Cosmic sick mic cylcicyst
Mega segments be Sega like Genesis
I orbits the solar system listenin
Guzzlin never sippin or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin
I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin
Man listen I give your whole crew an acid drenching
Just for mentionin goin that route runnin yo mouth
You get your head smacked off towards down South
And your crew too will be spaced out
Way out no doubt yall niggas need to stop
And get with this Cosmic Slop
Cosmic Slop Cosmic Slop 
And now we program we program
Pop in the disk and who the hell is this
