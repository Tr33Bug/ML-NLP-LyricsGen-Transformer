To my no good niggas and my no good bitches
Sorry if I left somebody leavin out with stitches
Seems yall too grown for ya britches
Enslaved your mind like cotton pickers for runnin wit some rotten niggas
I get raw to the core with hardcore metaphors
Resevoir Dog style truly yours
Yes I be the slug up in your chest
Then you wonder why you cant feel the full strength of cigarettes
My nationality is brutality
I got the gun up under your leather nigga so walk casually
Youd be surprised how much info you can get
For a bottle of crack to find yo punk ass and yo kinfolks
Plus that crew you run with is butt
I was dusted one day when I made your man choke up
Rappers comin to New Jersey and be gettin fucked up
Talkin about where they from and shit when dem sons aint runnin shit
And god forbid you do a show in da Bricks
Youd swear you was flying how we bring so much turbulence
I keep your nervous level high nigga
You better kiss your son and daughter tell em bye nigga
When we creep
I give respect to all my Willy niggas with the Rolex
Shinin baguettes flashin cash and dumpin Moets
Especially when my royalty check is late I dont hesitate
I scoop up Keith and see whos flashin at the Palla
dium hide your weed niggas cause here I come
Lookin bummy for low profile so loud MCs overlook me
I slip the bartender some raw
Just to tell me how much cash and Dom P you pour
Huh I should start robbin rappers in the industry
If we aint clickin then Im engineerin your injuries
Fortyeight tracks of automatic and macs
Lyrically splatdatted till your mentality blacks
And I dont give a fuck if you did thirty bids
Still I bring you Ecstasy like Im the rapper Jalil
Blaow blaow blaow lickin shots for your fuckin
Mind I got you niggas duckin out like Im onetime
Or fiveoh popo I drive hoes nutty
Like I be doin security at my live shows
Your AR is a punk he got you gassed
When I brutally smash any contender in my weight class
Aiyyo Twinz yo this nigga got jewels
hold that nigga while I rob this fool 
When we creep
