I believe theres no nigga out there as funky as you  True 
So what we gonna do is we gonna go back to the old PFunkadelic  Get the fuck outta here word 
You know what Im sayin  Word 
Remember that old cut you did  Yeah yeah 
That ol PFunk cut  Yeah make my funk the PFunk

Well what we gon do is we gon reminisce on that ol shit  Word  know what Im sayin
We gon go right back to the old school but before we do
I wanna know is my niggas in the house  Hell yeah 
I said is my motherfuckin niggas in the house  Hell yeah 
So everybody just light your spliffs up  Yeah 
Get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light  Get out 
You heard it comin straight from the lungs of the Funkadelic brother himself  Yeah 
More funk than a bag of skunk  Uh 
Twice the funk than James Browns socks  Hit me 
Hittin you straight across your mouth with a tune
Yo Redman drop it
Make my funk the PFunk  I wants to get funked up 
I wants to get funked up
Make my funk the PFunk we thump
Lyrics that bounce brains make emcees jump
Sky high cant touch the level so why try
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged and brother it takes ten to conquer
Thats why Im on probation
Ever since three I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of twotens not from an oven but MAC10
A MAC20 maybe if I didnt subtract ten
My background straight from a Black mans culture
Want more Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle damn you too hard to handle
EDouble slam once and Redman slam two
Break hooks earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor make mines the PFunk
Make my funk the PFunk
I want my funk uncut  Make mine the P 
Make my funk the PFunk  I wants to get funked up 
I wants to get funked up
Im back with the funk chump
You want funk How many lumps
I got spunk Im wellknown like Donald Trump
Im not
