Hahahahahaaa
Follow just do what ya feel and never follow
Never follow
Just do what ya feel and we gon follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Haha MethTical
Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic what we be smokin Tical
The resevoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin you dont know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch cal when you browse through my XFiles who be next now
Mans down hands down
Hold ground by yo side when it go down I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Mef he the best part now walk with that one word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton blowin her back out like Bob Backlund
Im throwin wrestlin holds
Tag teaming with Funk Doc we in funk mode take yo best shot
If it dont hip it dont hop
If it dont quit it dont stop thats the life
I be the superlyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when Im a heterosexual
I load the mic then cock drop it like threequarters
When I slaughter dont get caught in the water
Cause the Bricks got its own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese you cant compare
Get you steppin like stairs frats sororities
Dont make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me I Port em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time
Redman and Method Man still hiiiigh hiiiiiiiiigh 
Its that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter
Word
Just do what ya feel and never follow  repeat 3X 
Funk Doc break it down


Hah yo suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze yo camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shut your million dollar investment to economy
And possibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin Caution when wet by the track wetter
The hash spreader I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But its forever when a nigga  and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead its not cause you Arabian
Yo watch you say to him 
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock Tha Bassment
You couldnt come close if I gave you my booking agent
Or producer royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up  youre still wack
I peel caps on the regular
Destroy MCs et cetera creep like The Predator
Fuck you your label moms and yo editor
Give you two to the jugular blood be spreadin
All on my shirt the king of the flirt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
Tweettweettweettweet tweettweettweettweet 
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung  one me gun done 
Get on the mic and break em off a sumthin sumthin
We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sho shots it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition in rap sessions
UAP aint got no weapon you live professin
Next in line parental discretion advised
These explicit street linguistics
Better than yo momma biscuits we bomb shellin
I might know but aint tellin too bad you missed it
Johnny Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Colorsafe bleach so I dont fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade razor sharp
Get yo bandaids hold that
Like E said Get the Bozack
Show them wack niggas where the dos at
On the case like Im Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch
Flip scripts take LOOONG shits  Raider Ruckus
One I come with premeditated redrum
Gingivitis to your filthy ass gums
Bottom line either get down or get done
Motherfucker
