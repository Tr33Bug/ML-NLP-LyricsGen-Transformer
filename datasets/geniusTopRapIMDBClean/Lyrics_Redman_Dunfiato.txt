Dun fiato
Rome York we in the building

When I hit the bong Im Godzilla taking over Hong Kong
Eating wantan wid a shotgun in long johns
Its not unsung
No story here to tell Im just ready
Im a student before the school bell
That prevail my wordplay
Thirsty I bust all three Ks on Martin Luther King birthday
Berkeley College for twenty dollars
If I got it smoke here enquire my knowledge
A little psychotic I know
Rate me Im Michael Jordan in the final four fighting with Wayne Gretzky
Im not relevant lets see
Whos spittin
Some of yall Coke and Pepsi I cant tell the difference
Im Darryl when Im pitchin
Before the white girl had em twitchin
Now the rap game in my kitchen
Easy pickens
Rebel wid a cause
My mind is like fuck with mine Ill put your mind on the wall
Im on tour gettin bread and tattoos and your job is giving Tic Tacs in bathrooms
I hate gossip Ill mash up your media moshpit
Release a baboom in the chat room
My weed bags are vacuum that smuggle
Off of one blunt a bitch gon fuck you  HAHAHA 
Chicks Tivo the meatloaf when I hit they belly Doc droppin all dimes  RICO 
Take precautions
I got a Paul Bearer that build coffins for all rappers and nonsense
Nonchalantly Im thinkin darker than a convict conscience
Thats why Im sweating in the armpits thats where the bomb is
The gang rate in my city is like the 80s where Kendrick Lamar live
I gotta harvest the purple at my apartment across the park I sell pounds to Cartman
I think like an orphan Im in a zone
But its freestyle so these words might need a home
Executive net I demand respect check dont even talk to me or text the wrong tone  OKAY 
Stay at bay um and delay
When I ride out pull pins from these hand grenades
You can be amazed or hate it
But either way I get it heated like Kanye and Sway
Im done wid it I had fun wid it
Stay back and tell your girl come get it
She had Mr Right now she want Mr Wrong
Now she swing along like Serena arms
