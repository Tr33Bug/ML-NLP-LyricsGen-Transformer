We hah
This is Funk Doctor Spock
As we look at our clocks
We gonna take you on a ship to another journey
To the Darkside
Hah weve conquered new evidence that there is life
My funk prognosis make my brains comatose
One hundred percent funk runs bloodstreams through your nose
I dont have to be Madonna to make your eyes freeze
Visines for eyes when you smoke the Thai weed
For this you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this funk cosmical far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood and boondox
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks
Now who kicks that phenomical astronomical Uhh
Thats my nine in you feelin nauseous Thats my rhyme in you
I swing funk like nunchucks my games death
Thats cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul
Hot like Worchestire sometimes I get more higher than Cheech
My funk speech make words wear sun visors
Im gettin down with the funk in your trunk
Def Squads in the house for 95 for all you punks
Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
Ahhh Im just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers
Def Squads in the house for 95 you suckers
Punks yall chumps I blew the frame once twice
Im dumb nice I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight
The top notch nah fuck that that notchs topped
Im off the meter I make computers catch amnesia
Im swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades
Im Fearless like Four plus Im Kool like Aid
My grammar slam from here to York Alabama
I never pull my pants up Im nutty like Planters
My style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef
Def like Jam or Squad or Def like Lep
One two Big up to my niggas on onedeuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in blue
Rrrrrah With weed for you
Who says I cant burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes
I cause the ruckus my area is fucked up
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers
Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam
When Im loose Im worldwide like Triple FAT Goose
Heavily armed


Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk
