How To Roll A Blunt Lyrics
(Aww shit)
Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins a new wave for the blunt rollers, you know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Phillie Blunt continues
The flava's, the P-Funk y'all, get wit' it
Check it out

Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly tryna roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk'
First of all, you get a fat bag of ism
From Uptown, any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a Phillieâ€”not the city of Philly, silly punk
I'm talking about the cigar, the Phillie Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Phillie Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use your fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion, then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit your lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmm proper
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up (Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt (Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up, yeah

The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smell like pure ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. Uh, yo, here's the lighter)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with your spit, shit
I don't know what dick or last puss' you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(Hee, hee, hee, hee, sorry, Red, for spilling it)
(Bitch) You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid ten bills for the get ill
And for spilling it, you better get lost or get grill
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo don't know to roll a blunt
You might also like
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt (Hey, nigga, pass the goddamn blunt)
That's how you roll a blunt (Shit, what you holding it all day for?)
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up, yeah
(Sit yo' big ass down)

Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell
I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell), yeah
Last but not least, Redman like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no devil, when high, I am the wrong one to be fucked with
So everybody, put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So (Pump up the volume), so it's heard though the next block
I'm out, peace to Redd Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot
Yeah, DJ Twinz in the house
Yeah, Redman's in the house
Yo, peace to Pack Pistol Posse, the four, five, six
Yo, I'm out
Yo Reg, turn this shit off, man (Yo, turn that shit off)4Embed
