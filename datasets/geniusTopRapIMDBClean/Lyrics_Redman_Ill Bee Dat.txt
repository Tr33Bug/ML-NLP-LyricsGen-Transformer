Iâ€™ll Bee Dat! Lyrics
Yo, fuck you
Yo, yo, fuck you
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, fuck you
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, fuck you
Yo, Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer?
Jack move, that's how we act when we team up
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, stretch it out, nigga
Let the motherfucker pass us that blunt, nigga
They heard what that nigga say, "Puff puff pass, motherfucker"
"Puff puff pass, motherfucker"
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Sim Simma, who got the key to my Bimmer?
Jack move, that's how we act when we team up
Throw your triple beam up, this is fish scale
I bailed out the county with counterfeit bills
My slang be high range Brick City
Watch how you sniff, son, I'm highly octane
All you hear is bang, bang (Bang, bang)
Yo, remember you, bitch? Shit, I forget my last name
It's all about game, nuttin' else, for delf
Walk through the woods then stomp on your foot
With high, I take out any comp in the hood
Gorilla impact in this rap habitat
Get you steppin' in your Air Max, bounce
You cockin' it back but where it at? Bounce
I got a six pack of Heineken and Big Kap on the wheels
In two laps, I give Stella Her Groove Back

My middle name must be Fuck You
'Cause every time I walk by
Niggas be like, "Fuck you"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat
My first name must be He Ain't Shit
'Cause every time I'm in a car
Bitches be like, "He ain't shit"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat (Yo, yo, yo)
You might also like
I heard the party goin' on in there, yeah
Well, let me shake my stankin' ass in there, yeah
Soon as I walk in, dogs are barkin' (Arf, arf, arf)
Haters play the back, I stay in front like handicapped parkin'
Startin' arsons from, Jers' to Arkan-
-Sas me coughin' out that dread apartment
Roll up to the jam with the front end bent up
Watch them chickens, 'fo' end up gettin' salmonella
I'm ghetto like D&D, fuckin' wit' D
You be on Banned From TV Part III
In a heartbeat, tiger, straight out the cup
You're light in the ass, son, you weigh 'bout a buck
But I'm one-ninety physique
Two-hundred and thirty-fo' pounds total when I'm carryin' the heat
Not platinum on wax but, platinum in the streets
Any nigga that disagree, smack him in the teeth
Then I bag his little piece, rockin' the ice
Give it to the projects, gonna rob him tonight
(Why you actin like dat?) The weed made me do it
Devil's Advocate hot, it take days to do it
My crew do drugs Duane Reade couldn't breed
Dry me in the sun, I'll amount to ten keys
Redbones I'm bonin', MC's be clonin'
That's before Doc stretch up and mornin' yawnin'
My middle name must be Fuck You
'Cause every time I'm in the hood
Niggas be like, "Fuck you"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat
My first name must be He Ain't Shit
'Cause every time I'm in my car
Bitches be like, "He ain't shit"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat

Niggas and you bitches
Puff puff give (Haha)
Niggas and you bitches
Puff puff give

Yo, yo, if you gotta be a monkey, be a gorilla
It's four AM, I'm off a tab and still a
World rap biller, push a big Benz
With a chickenhead, drawers hangin' from my antenna
I'll be goddamned if a nigga take mine
On foot, shit, put rollerblades on
Mind your business (Uh-huh)
The nine with swiftness (Uh-huh)
I'll pull it, stretch it like Fonda Fitness
I'm a everyday nigga like I'm Toyota
Your A&R hope we don't drop the same quarter
Wrapped the puta in a Hefty Two-Ply
(Yo, he ain't from Chi) So haul ass back to Utah

My middle name must be Fuck You
'Cause every time I'm in the hood
Niggas be like, "Fuck you"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat
My first name must be He Ain't Shit
'Cause every time I'm in the car
Bitches be like, "He ain't shit"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat
My middle name must be Fuck You
'Cause every time I'm in the hood
Niggas be like, "Fuck you"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat
My first name must be He Ain't Shit
'Cause every time I'm in the car
Bitches be like, "He ain't shit"
I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat, I'll be dat (Fuck you)
Fuck you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's W Fuck All Y'all Radio, ya man Big Tigga
I'll be dat, ya heard? Yo (Fuck you)
It's like thirty degrees down here in D.C
All my niggas strap the Timbs up
Get out the puffy coats and all of that
And I'll see all you chickenhead ass bitches at the club later
I'll be there, ha
I'll be dat6Embed
