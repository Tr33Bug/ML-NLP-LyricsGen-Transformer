I get mad wicked  Fuck around  and catch a bad one by the funker
I puff the mad spliffs and roll blunts with Archie Bunker
Cause my brain is twisted so I cock the biscuit
Cause shits thick some say Im a bastard of a swift bitch
Negro funkin it with the style in your ear bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy so funky that you have to douche me
You cant hear me then my record label didnt push me
I know Im sayin funk too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasnt that I wouldnt freak it in the line
But it dont seems to matter cause my shit get fatter and fatter
Ill do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk Weed laced with the blunt
I puff I never got snuffed
Bust while I dust your monkey ass off
Thin ice is crushed on the hushhush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers  Why  cause Im bad  Word to mother 
Im a bad  Yo word to the mother
