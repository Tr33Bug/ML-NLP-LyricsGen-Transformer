Its Like That  My Big Brother  Lyrics
Due to technical difficulties beyond our control
Reggie Nobles stinkin ass will not be performing with us tonight
Erick Sermon keep it on
Def Squad Erick Sermon Redman keep keep it on
K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on ya dont stop
Keep keep it on and ya dont stop
Keep keep it on and ya dont stop
KSolo Redman and ya dont stop
Erick Sermon Keith Murray ya dont stop
I Xd ya amateur damage ya have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It aint a problem at all we cant solve
Threehundred sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged by my entourage who put the Ram in Dodge
Ras cla in bumba claat
Maintain few remain in the game
So I remain focused hiphops the main aim
Well its the Funk Doctor Spot the pon cock lyricist
My mentalitys so def yo I aint even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MCs out by the hundreds
Wanted for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us
Sprayed a few shank a few rap crews say they shamed too
But cant hang two like we do
Fuck them they better bow slow
This rhymell cold hit em real quick cause Im KSolo
Battle any dude this retifuge Im in cruise
See what the better vet could do to you undouche
You three groups four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime
Yo the long faced murderer
Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey Ds circular
Workin a shifty hour like a burglar
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens that Ima be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bizarre the rap nonsuperstar
When I step up I pump volume like Ra
My afro blows in threehundred sixty degrees
So this makes me the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularys very loquacious and gregarious
Pump that too go grab the dictionary
Fly words that we flip on the MIKE mike
My crew be like this styles hype
Wrongs the opposite forget the bullshh
To rhyme like the KSolo you need more than a soul kit
Come closer while I lock it down like Im supposed ta
You battle me you won You might have but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me the Brick City Stock Cock Broker
Yall niggas is fools playin with hood moves
You couldnt total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you dismissed you yeah I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through
Haha yeah haha
Keep keep it on
Haha keep keep it on look
Ha keep keep it on
Ha keep keep it on look
Haha keep keep it on
Yo what we doin son  Haha 
Knockin niggas the fuck out
