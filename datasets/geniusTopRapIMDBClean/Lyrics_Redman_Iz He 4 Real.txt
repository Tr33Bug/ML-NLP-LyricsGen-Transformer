Word up hooooaa haha haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be 
Word up hooooaa haha haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be 
Word up hooooaa is he for real
Iz he for real he cant be 
Unbeknown unbelieve
Iz he for real he cant be 
Somebody light the fuse so I can bring bad news
To all these crews who cant NBA Jam with the shoes
That double shot Hennessy got my mind trippin
Drunk enough to start a campaign on ass kickin
With my nigga Keith who give assists like Scott Pippen
For MC derelict whippin cap or cock twistin
Drop your money in the slot if your block dont got
A real representer cocked for action like my block got
Rhyme skills three and a quarter for them drop tops
Your caliber straight up pussy who pop Glocks
While I kick facts react on funky tracks
Give me room like the Hyatt while I run this jungle habitat
And if I snap get that monkey off my back
Me and mics together roll tighter than Slick and Vance Wright
Toast to the real MCs that can feel me
And if your bitch aint jumpin now then later on she will be
All these weak punk MCs kill me
They dont thrill me come to Jerz and get Jacked like Jill G
Hooooaa haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be 
Hooooaa haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be 
Haha  Hooooaa haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be 
Hooooaa haaaaaa
Iz he for real he cant be
