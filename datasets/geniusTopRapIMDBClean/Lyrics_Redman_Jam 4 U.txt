Inhale cough
Yo this is for motherfuckers that talk that sellout shit
Watch my hands
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you  Ev Everybody get up 
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you  Get on up Get on up 
Get down get down  On down 
Like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I get on up
Rhythm and funk makes you hump like Technotronic Ill make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
Danananadada without eating my damn spinach
Cause when Im on a roll thats when Redman start to chill
Round off backflip cartwheel
Ahh youre nasty I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue on the menu and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
Its like this its like that I wont slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throw down and strut
Yo E whats that funk mode Get on up
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you  Ev Everybody get up 
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you  Get on up Get on up 


Check this out here let the rough cutcut your ear
Hit Squads the crew Im twentytwo and Becks the beer
Float like Muhammad rollon like Secret
Me rip the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a babee while the others bumbumble
Dondandan dododonding
Extremely wild like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
Its the huh the funk now Im known around the globe
So buckle up hush up while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound grab my bozack then I freeze now  Freeze now 
On your mark get ready get set lets go
With the flow to jet like Delta or Jesse O
Wens with the Benz I clean my front lens
With a system that knocks harder than RinTinTin
Without question Im flexy when Im sexin
Wicked when I kick it like A Tribe Called Quest and
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed since pops dropped the seed
I knew Id be the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged more nuggets in the bucket
Thats dumb dumb dollars and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E whats that funk mode Get on up
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you  Ev Everybody get up 
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you
