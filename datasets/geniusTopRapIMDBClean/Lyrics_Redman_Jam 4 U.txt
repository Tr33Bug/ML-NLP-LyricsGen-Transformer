Jam 4 U Lyrics
*Inhale*, *cough*
Yo, this is for motherfuckers that talk that sellout shit
Watch my hands

I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you (Ev— Everybody get up)
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you (Get on up— Get on up)
Get down, get down (On down)
Like James Brown, plus I get down
But for now I get on up
Rhythm and funk makes you hump like Technotronic, I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
"Da-na-na-na-da-da" without eating my damn spinach
'Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start to chill
Round off backflip cartwheel
Ahh, you're nasty! I know
When my afro grow, that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throw down and strut
Yo, E, what's that funk mode? Get on up

I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you (Ev— Everybody get up)
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you (Get on up— Get on up)
You might also like
Check this out here, let the rough cut-cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew, I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip the crowd in half on the sneak tip
'Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a ba-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-don-ding
Extremely wild like the hair on Don King
'Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the huh, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now (Freeze now)
On your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O-
Wens with the Benz, I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin'
Wicked when I kick it like A Tribe Called Quest and
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pops dropped the seed
I knew I'd be the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dumb, dumb dollars, and yes, Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo, E, what's that funk mode? Get on up
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you (Ev— Everybody get up)
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you1Embed
