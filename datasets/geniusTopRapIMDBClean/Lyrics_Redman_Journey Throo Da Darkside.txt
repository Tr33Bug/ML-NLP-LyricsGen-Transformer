Woowoowowowowooo
Lord higher
Could somebody turn on da lights
Somebody turn on da lights
The darkside  Yessss 
Guess whos back when I bring funk like Zapp
All aboard motherfuckers while your brains get jacked
Im souped like two scoops of funk juice word to mother
The way I kick you swore that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker
The darkside brings apartheid
I act wild like them niggas from ChiTown on the Southside
Sweeter than this whoopin niggas down like Jack Nich
When I backflip my tactic graphics
Ooooooh Redman jams it in
Due to difficulties I wont be done by ten
Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz
And then we get the bambazee from oneten
Or is it further up Plus my style murder ducks
So what the fuck you got the mic turned up fo
When I Chief Rock underground MCs drop like sheet rock
Heres a ride to the underground
To the beat yall
Ah to the beat yall I do the freak yall
I keep the buddha to last me through the week yall
Ah to the beat yall
Ah to the beat yall I do the freak yall
I keep the buddha to last me through the week yall
Come take a trip on my cosmic boogie movie flicks
Far beyond space so niggas say your grace
Its a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar
When a baby I had other babies in labor catchin vapors
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume
Bang zoom Im sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom
Ridiculously I will rip an MC
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox check the synopsis
I grow confusing just like Rubiks cube boxes
Float like the butter fly so what if I
Blow your lenses tear the fuckin hinges
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahhs than a dentist
When Im in this the knottyheaded era causes terror
Yall gimmick motherfuckers better get yall shit together
One for the money and two for my peeps
Nynex cant even reach my technique or rap sheets
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God
Then take yall dreams and imaginations
To the darkside
