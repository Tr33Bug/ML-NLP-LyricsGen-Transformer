Let’s Get Dirty (I Can’t Get in da Club) Lyrics
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo
Oh shit, who those motherfuckers coming in here?
No, it can't be (Yo)

Yo, give me some room, I'm throwing elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down at three
And you ballin' ass niggas, who's dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (Man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch
Yo, Red, what's up, man?
Ayy, they ain't trying to let you in the club
Yo, DJ Kool to the rescue
We gon' break this joint down
Ayo

If you pumping this one in your truck (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you really don't give a what (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody get your hands up (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you ain't come to party shut up (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty

Yo, security patting my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be (Stay down)
All my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three
We gonna bum rush the tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool
Like a three o'clock bully waiting after school (Punks)
I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink
Shake that ass thang, the fuck you think?
Papa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring
Since Def is the label I belong in a morgue
I'm walking half dead, acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on "Green Mile"
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed uptown
You might also like
Yeah, that's right, we up in this joint now
Ayo, we getting ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint, baby

If you got up in the club free (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you drunk up in the V.I.P. (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you swingin' from them club nights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you like to start them club fights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody come to wild out (Let's get dirty, wild out)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you a big dog no doubt (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty, put 'em up)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody keep it going now (Let's get dirty, keep it going)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Just a little bit louder now (Let's get dirty, louder)
Say let's get dirty, come on, come on
Let's get dirty
Let's get dirty
Keep it going now (Let's get dirty)
This is DJ Say What on this motherfucker2Embed
