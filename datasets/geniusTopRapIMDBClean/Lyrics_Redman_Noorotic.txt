Yall motherfuckers buckle yall motherfuckin seatbelts
If you need to get high theres a mask and shit in the overhead compartment
I cant tell yall what the weathers like cuz my radios fucked up
And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty
Dont panic take one more hit off the oxygen mask
Calmly put your hands between your legs
And kiss your black ass goodbye
Im swift like a motherfuckin gift for Christmas
When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus
My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground
Let me be blunt I like crackin brews with bitches
The ninetyfour era I cause terror whatEVER
Rainin on you punks with the funk so get your umbrellas
My guns cruise tennis shoes whats happenin
I got clapped on now Im the one doin the clappin
Im Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex
Blow tape decks when Im more strapped than latex
Felt like menopause I make niggas act like beatches
Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin  with they ass full of stitches
Woo I just dont give a FUCK
I bite your whole nipple off sick like sicklecell anemia
Travel around my curse universe
Im droppin 987 degrees down to Red Alert
Droppin the slang Ill bust your brains with the real shit
Come hit my blunt so I can make yall feel it
Abuse niggas verbally so call DYFS
Im a warrior to the heart but I didnt kill Cyrus
Noorotic my style format rocks the project
I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic
Give me a time and Ill free your mind and lick your
Funky emotions to blow your veins up with funk overdosage
Now whos that nigga that got your crew bellin
Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen


Fuck you Redman
Motherf fuck you 
Im in the world with Jacobs Ladder
Im seein a lot of happy copycat rappers actin like they got asthma
They attackin me they slowin they rhymes down actually
They got factories with little dolls named after me
But its no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere
Pregnant I take advantage of niggas like I was molesterin
Newark New Jerseys what I represent
Iiiiiiiyiiiihhhhh
My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ETs home
And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in
Whattup to Prince Street Avon Ave I roll a spliff with
Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District
So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck
Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag
Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit
The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden
Fuck that lets get to the point my shits the joint I roast
Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast
To your breakfast toast  fuck it 
I got funk for days by the buckets
PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers
Hold hold hold wait wait wait wait
Let me school this bitch
Yo bitch my shit is tight can any MC do this
Whose pussy woman moans
Whose pussy woman moans woman moans
Whose pussy
And come back on the mic
I think not my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots
On blocks where your punk ass still bustin off slingshots
Talkin shit about me when Im drivin by slowly
Sayin Im this and that when half yall punks dont even know me
Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back
And let your moms give me cornrows on my crack
Because Im nasty like that
