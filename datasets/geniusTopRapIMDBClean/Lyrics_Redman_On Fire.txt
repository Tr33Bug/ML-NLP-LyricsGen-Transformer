Them bitches swear they fly 
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy
Hahha
Now everytime I grab the mic I always start shit up
Sharper than your doubleedger watch me carve shit up
Live and direct respect it to the underground connect
Pah Im wreckin any MC you select
Yo E load me in your gun light the flares
Give me fortyeight bars and I go out like Ganz and Billy Bear
Wear and tear Im wreckin for the Bricks I swear
Jump in my way and get your body splattered everywhere
Conjunction junction whats your function
Its that nigga whos so swift I could lose a compass
Step into jams with seven niggas in a Land
And forty motherfuckers in some fucked up caravan
Drop the Fahrenheit back down to zero
Bring Heat to the streets like Al Pacino and De Niro
Raw dog material grand imperial
Talk to my shotty nigga my ears aint hearin you
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy 
So take heed to what Im saying
Cause tonights the night and me and my nukkas aint playing
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy 
As we proceed 
Im on fire 
Rockin on Redman rockin on
Now do I look crazy Deranged maybe
You shot first your Glock burst but it graze me
Now time for lyrics put up your guns
And watch me get this shit hoppin like the West was won
Got that lyrical chicken feed for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee like Im Big Lez
More sicker than them Menendez brothers
You need Cochran when youre fuckin with Judge Dredd
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin dick like Im a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch Let me Simoniz you
I make sure your vision blur till you dont know what occurred
Until I black out every nerve
Foul women get served as chicken head hors douerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles
Hah if you still look up in the sky Im still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wan die E  whattup son  you got this beat bumpin
The way I feel niggas aint leave until they up in somethin
Pack my dutch like the niggas in the county
Dayrooms stay tuned for Doc Illuminati
Up around them big butt freaks is where you find me
Martini and Rossi Asti Spumante 


We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy 
As we proceed 
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy 
So take heed to what Im saying
Cause tonights the night and me and my nukkas aint playing
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin steamy 
As we proceed 
Im on fire 
Rockin on Redman rockin on
To my people in the back if youre not the wack say
Dont stop the body rock
To my people in the front if youre tokin on blunts say
Dont stop the body rock aoowwwwwowwwww
Im too strong for you to listen
I started spittin thats why the brick niggas be lickin
They stay on magazine printing equipments
And lyrics I got em by the shipment where your bitch went
Im smokin leaky out the Lecy fatal
My Squad steps with the ultimatum true dat
My muzak move crowds like down the hill moved crack
For those who stepped on toes I want my shoes back
Buddy bringin money to your girl
For your little daughter like Im Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me I bug G quote it
I see you noticed how I leave microphones corroded
Hahahahaha your staff not up to par
You raw You more like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Call deep niggas keep the gas pedal floored
And I pump the funk to keep a room and board
record scratches rooster cackles
