Get on down 
Pick it up pick it up
Pick it up pick it up
Get on down 
Pick it up pick it up
Pick it up pick it up
If you find a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon do
Get on down 
Pick it up pick it up
Pick it up pick it up
Get on down 
Pick it up pick it up
While I crack a cold Becks and keep the hoes in check
The doubleS vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like Did you see that
Ahh yes comin from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath recess
We bless mics three times a day
Three times a night it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MCs
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggas be like Ahh he changed his style up
Shut the fuck up ya still a dickridah
Its 96 so get wit it
Keep that backintheday shit when that other Squad was Hittin
Listen must we forget I originated
All that wild shit that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit
Brick City Is where I get down kid
Peace to all my buddah smokers on Prince
Fuck what ya heard Brick City runs shit
Get on down 
PPP got the Glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
Get on down 
Say what Got some fly shit on deck
Get on down 
Say WHAT Got some fly shit on deck
PPP got the Glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
Get down 
First of all MCs be on my balls straight up
Pubic hairs and everything lick the whole plate up
Bay Area roll up your Las Vegas
To all MCs I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson JC
And Hackensack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin find da MCs by the jazz men
I dont tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabularys played out admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it  Get on down 
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class beatin all Kings down
Doin over seventy in a Hyundai blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz back
Nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
Thats why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G word up hah hah
Get on down 
If you see a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon do
Pick it up pick it up
Get on down 
If you see a bitch passed out on the fuckin ground
What the fuck you gon do
Pick her up pick her up
Get on down 
I keep it fly yall
Fly fly yall  5X 
Get on down 
Aiyyo dont ride the dick of these real MCs
We pull Joints like Spike and blow crews to degrees
Then we buy Gs with a half a pound of dope MCs
We bag for cheese just to get weed
Smoke indoneez Im milky like Magnese
Ohsevenoneohthree rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts FUNKDOC
SPOT feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze  Get on down  hah hahah
Where was I Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Dont play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon youre lettin
Spit sixteen bits come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip fuck the government
Drop shit its a microscopic topic
How I stay mo bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the lala spots
And bad ass hoes with 5411 Reeboks
But still I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hiphop shit for real
I aint havin that Im clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit I cause accidents
To any MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy its simply Ginger and Remi
It dont stop Def Squad crew is hot
Fillin up your brain with supreme octane and its on
Get on down
