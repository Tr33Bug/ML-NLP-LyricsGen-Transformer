Rite Lyrics
(Beloved)
My vision gettin' clearer
I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself “that's a fly nigga”
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy, “lets ride nigga”
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot “Rite”
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot “Rite”
All my fans say f..ck you in they fan mail
Cause I had they main girl on a hand-held
I go to the store they try to pop my fan-belt
Then I body 'em in the street like Cornbread Earl
Boy I'm that thorough, I'm like a pitbull
Windex in the pen to make it crystal
170 but in rap I'm a big dude
So yeah, I got bars like a Gym Room
Boy I'm that dirty
So tell the rap Jury
That tennis, The only way a nigga gon' serve me
My black Mac Bernie, I even mac Siri
Shit I'm killin' the Mic Like Conrad Murray
Get ya weight up boy, you wan' hustle with it
Even my protein bars got muscle in it
Pop my trunk, Pop Yours nothin' in it
I'm Cool so hol' up, Wait a minute
Let's go

“lets ride nigga”
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot “Rite”
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot “Rite”

Lux I'm Loaded 'bout ready to spit a verse
On hater's I unloaded be ready to get his hearse
I'm bout to send him notice If Harlem don't get him first
Send him down to unemployment cause homey gone get this work (rite)
Hot Benz, every honey is top ten
If she Hops in, then mo' than likely we not friends
Look I'm locked in, Hit you like Skelly, your top spin
First I pop, then I'm out like Pirelli's on stock rims
Flyest in the game, still applyin' the pain
Since Milk was Top Billin', and Lyte was ridin' the train
These paper thin villains get scraped and thrown in the flame
85% of rappers is fake and so is they chain
Now that's a no-brainer
36 in my Chamber
Now a moment of silence I throw a L up for Banga
Lyricist not a Singa
Don't ever forget its Gangsta
Ladies they get the thumbs up coppers they just get the finga
(Beloved)
