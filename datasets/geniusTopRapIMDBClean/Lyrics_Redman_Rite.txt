Beloved 
My vision gettin clearer
Im lookin in the mirror
Im sayin to myself thats a fly nigga
Harlem is the city got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy lets ride nigga
Dah dah daditty dah dee dah daditty dah dee day
You niggas know Im hot Rite
Dah dah daditty dah dee day daditty dah dee day
You tryin to take my spot Rite
All my fans say fck you in they fan mail
Cause I had they main girl on a handheld
I go to the store they try to pop my fanbelt
Then I body em in the street like Cornbread Earl
Boy Im that thorough Im like a pitbull
Windex in the pen to make it crystal
170 but in rap Im a big dude
So yeah I got bars like a Gym Room
Boy Im that dirty
So tell the rap Jury
That tennis The only way a nigga gon serve me
My black Mac Bernie I even mac Siri
Shit Im killin the Mic Like Conrad Murray
Get ya weight up boy you wan hustle with it
Even my protein bars got muscle in it
Pop my trunk Pop Yours nothin in it
Im Cool so hol up Wait a minute
Lets go
lets ride nigga
Dah dah daditty dah dee dah daditty dah dee day
You niggas know Im hot Rite
Dah dah daditty dah dee day daditty dah dee day
You tryin to take my spot Rite
Lux Im Loaded bout ready to spit a verse
On haters I unloaded be ready to get his hearse
Im bout to send him notice If Harlem dont get him first
Send him down to unemployment cause homey gone get this work  rite 
Hot Benz every honey is top ten
If she Hops in then mo than likely we not friends
Look Im locked in Hit you like Skelly your top spin
First I pop then Im out like Pirellis on stock rims
Flyest in the game still applyin the pain
Since Milk was Top Billin and Lyte was ridin the train
These paper thin villains get scraped and thrown in the flame
85 of rappers is fake and so is they chain
Now thats a nobrainer
36 in my Chamber
Now a moment of silence I throw a L up for Banga
Lyricist not a Singa
Dont ever forget its Gangsta
Ladies they get the thumbs up coppers they just get the finga
Beloved 
Beloved 
My vision gettin clearer
Im lookin in the mirror
Im sayin to myself thats a fly nigga
Harlem is the city got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy lets ride nigga
Dah dah daditty dah dee dah daditty dah dee day
You niggas know Im hot Rite
Dah dah daditty dah dee day daditty dah dee day
You tryin to take my spot Rite
