Ayo ayo check this out man
Rock da spot 
Ha ayo haha
Ayo ayo haha
Nah nah ayo ayo
Ayo damn Im the bomb ringing off all types alarms
My palms be swift with the pen like Lynn Swanns
Aggravated assault against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
Its mad real in the Bricks plus I roll thick
You can quote this Im the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz and DKNew York
I dont push a lot of vehicles but I push a used one
With a tape deck if its feasible
Tell the truth I dont own a Lex Coupe
But I get you suped when I rock respect due
Is a nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ
Twice E Double if you feel me hit me once
A breaker one a breaker two 
Cause trouble to you family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit just hand me yo ends
Got caught out there cause you were Mack without ten
Punch you in your chin the rucker bringer
Live from Hell but stay cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpoenaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that still walk out holdin my strap
Blunt grabbing my wiener

Now first of all I go for broke
Check the third quarter note
I make you feel like your water broke
Cant tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well the monogram cant tell
All aboard my balls cause my dick
Dont got a lot of room for the rest of yall
Grab on my pubics let my music take flight
Rock indo and outdo dick run in and out yo
Bitch about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin Yeah I usually make em shit
I shines MCs up for auction so I can sell em on Saturday
Keith put the bat away
Lets lay in the cut so we can break his whole anatomy down and turn into an asskicking holiday
Word I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on them Benetton billboards
Hes bleeding get the gauze
He shoulda knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in slide the top back
Make sure its off safety in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed  Uh 
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Becks

Ayo catch this picture of me in the mixture
So you wont forget the black Jack the Ripper
Sorcerer offin yall with techniques
A universal lingo with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week
Freak smokin that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street and underground radio technique
College radio know I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta be an alkie the way I hit liver
Deliver the milk to your door real raw
Shit you never seen before
So when you come inside and do the front
Watch the doublepump shotgun and please dont run
Relax your minds let your conscience be free
And get money and Gs and roll these trees
