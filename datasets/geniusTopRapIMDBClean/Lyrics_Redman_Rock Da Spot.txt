Rock Da Spot Lyrics

W.F.D.S
Ayo, ayo, check this out, man
(Rock da spot)
Ha, ayo, haha
Ayo, ayo, haha
Nah, nah, ayo, ayo

Ayo, damn, I'm the, bomb, ringing off all types alarms
My palms be swift with the pen like Lynn Swann's
Aggravated assault against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
It's mad real in the Bricks, plus I roll thick
You can quote this, I'm the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch, walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz, and DK-New York
I don't push a lot of vehicles, but I push a used one
With a tape deck, if it's feasible
Tell the truth, I don't own a Lex Coupe
But I get you suped when I rock respect due
I's a nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ
Twice, E Double if you feel me, hit me once
(A breaker one, a breaker two)
Cause trouble to you, family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit, just hand me yo' ends
Got caught out there cause you were Mack without ten
Punch you in your chin, the rucker, bringer
Live from Hell but stay cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpoenaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that, still walk out holdin' my strap
Blunt, grabbing my wiener
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)

Now first of all I go for broke
Check the third quarter note
I make you feel like your water broke
Can't tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well, the monogram can't tell
All aboard my balls 'cause my dick
Don't got a lot of room for the rest of y'all
Grab on my pubics, let my music take flight
Rock indo' and outdo', dick run in and out yo'
Bitch, about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin'? Yeah, I usually make 'em shit
I shines MC's up for auction so I can sell 'em on Saturday
Keith, put the bat away
Let's lay in the cut, so we can break his whole anatomy down and turn into an ass-kicking holiday
Word, I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on them Benetton billboards
He's bleeding, get the gauze
He shoulda knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in, slide the top back
Make sure it's off safety, in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed (Uh)
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Beck's
You might also like
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)

Ayo, catch this picture of me in the mixture
So you won't forget the black Jack the Ripper
Sorcerer offin' y'all with techniques
A universal lingo, with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week
Freak, smokin' that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street, and underground radio technique
College radio, know I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah, the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta be an alkie the way I hit liver
Deliver the milk to your door real raw
Shit you never seen before
So when you come inside, and do the front
Watch the double-pump shotgun and please don't run
Relax your minds, let your conscience be free
And get money, and G's and roll these trees
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot (Yo)
Rock the spot
Rock the sâ€”
Rock the spot (Yo)
