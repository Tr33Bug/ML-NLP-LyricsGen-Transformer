Ayo yo yo yo you better pass it

We coming to you live from that bomb Chocolate City my man
Where the knottyheaded niggas and the Brick City brigade dwell
And if you dont know your fool behind better ask
Yo yo you better pass that blunt
Ayo E we comin to you live with the Cosmic type stuff
Well its that brother coming six billion feet from beneath
And you should be peepin how I get smoked out on the weekends
I swing it to my crew or down to my fam
Schoolin hellos knockers like final exams
Cause its that  Huh  Funkadelic hit you with the irrelevant
Elements and its coming through your blocks cant you smell it trick
Wanna copycat my whole format
So you get funk tracks punchlines and skull hats
Huh got a little Redman in town
Whos the effin clown soundin wack with the frown
I dont know man but you better warn him what I would do
Wild out on this staff like birds one and two
My crew runs thicker than syrup from the barrel
You get hurt up word up jammed like Pearl
Knock off a bloodclaat puff on a rough block
RIP my man Rockafella it dont stop
On and on and it dont quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit come on
On and on and it dont quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit 
I said Jerseys in the house  Jerseys in the house 
I said Brooklyns in the house  Brooklyns in the house 
I said Uptowns in the house  Uptowns in the house 
I said the Bronx in the hidouse  The Bronx in the hidouse 
Newark New Jersey rock rock on word is bond
Im comin in swarms so turn your flashlights on
Due to difficulty my style blows wattage across the planet
In fortyeight hours like Nick Nolte
Droppin the flavor stay sky high like pager
Im magical like Fantasia on paper
I saw the light like Kraftwerk of course
When the TLA Rock shock the stuff its yours
In your drawers your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin you gonna sell two mil cakes real fast
But you flopped and your image choked like a TEC
Now who freakin style your ass gonna steal next
Are there any more imitators in the house There are no
Bust like NBA Jams and you can have Chicago
Catch the combo funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back when I pumped 92 KTU in Harlem
Huh I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna shh my style like a junkie on crack
Trick you better back the freak up for real now
When I break it down from Newark NJ to Illtown


On and on and it dont quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit cmon
On and on and it dont quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit 
I said Virginias in the house  Virginias in the house 
I said Calis in the house  Calis in the house 
I said Atlantas in the house  Atlantas in the house 
North Carolinas in the house  Carolinas in the house 
Yoohoo watch the birdie while Red wreck your brains early
If rap was Bball Id have assists like James Worthy
Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device RunDMCs from my rock box
Hey you better come clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another payperview to your crew
I give a boom bip to QTip
Standin tall like Shaq money Im back this aint Blue Chips
The new stuff creamin brothers like Breyers
Hes heating up nah brother Im on fire
Dribble dribble shootin three pointers to the drum
Trick try to take my style foul andone
DJ Twinz in the house for the ninesquare
