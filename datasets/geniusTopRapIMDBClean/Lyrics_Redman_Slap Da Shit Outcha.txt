Slap Da Shit Outcha Lyrics
(Ayy) Yeah
(Ayy) Yeah

Ayo, I said I smack da shit outcha if ya mouth outta line (Ayy)
I wanna bury yo' ass but I'm out of lime (Get 'em!)
And women ask for tits, I tell 'em, "Get a job" (Ayy)
"And get me some Backwoods on your EBT card"
Don't ask me for weed, or drinks in the club (Ayy)
Or a fuckin' autograph outside my tour bus (Get outta here!)
Don't ask me for Gucci, Louis Vuitton or UGGs (Ayy)
'Cause A, B or C, you get none of the above
"Can I borrow some money?" *SLAP*
"Can I get some weed?" *SLAP* (Ayy)
"Can I drive your car?" *SLAP*
"Can you pay my rent?" *SLAP* (Yeah)
"Can you buy me a drink?" *SLAP*
"Can I wear your gold?" *SLAP* (Ayy)
"Can you take me to the mall and get me a pair of those?" *SLAP*

That's when I smack da shit outcha
I'll smack da shit outcha (Ayy)
That's when I smack da shit outcha
I smack da shit outcha, yeah
That's when I smack da shit outcha
I'll smack da shit outcha (Ayy)
That's when I smack da shit outcha
Check it out, I smack da shit outcha

Ayo, ayo, niggas get cocky when they get a little change (Ayy)
They buy a car - for gas, they need a little change
They never on the frontline, they stay the middle lane (Ayy)
Pickin' dollars off the floor after you done made it rain
And women always throwin' hints when they rent due (Ayy)
And I throw a hint right back, "What the fuck you gon' do?"
Go get your money from the store you bought your wig outta (Ayy)
Before I pay your rent, I'ma slap da shit outcha
