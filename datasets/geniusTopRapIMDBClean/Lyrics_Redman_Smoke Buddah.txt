Aiyyo I got a slight problem I smoke weed too much
Knees buckle the uck up when Im splittin my dutch
Back up back up Aint nobody hittin for free
Its just E DoublE Keith Murray and me
It cost twenty if youre down with it
Aiyyo son I ride around with my hooptie tinted
To ride around blitted
Cause I be feenin for that pookie
I smoke the good shhh save the backyard boogie for all groupies
And I be smokin up the hotel lobby
Between mo sheets than the Isleys Im high G
Im holdin it down for the BRrrahIC
K blaze tell you to get bluhh politely
Hit the funky if youre riding around gettin blitz 
Ask me if I love the rap game  I Im loving it
Cause I can do what the OWWuck I feel is real
Blaze the poot with D Don and tell UHH to get the dillz
I smoke on and on on ya dont stop
Im gettin mad ucked up and ya dont stop
To all my real dogs all my real pals
Who aint smokin get the uck owwwwt
I smoke on and on on ya dont stop
Im gettin mad ucked up and ya dont stop
To all my real dogs all my real pals
Who aint smokin get the uck owwwwt
I just love tokin blackin out like Tame in the open
Of course I got the raw dog no need to stick your nose in
Gave you a straight up shotgun when we was smokin
Froze you so fast  you looked it like Madonna Voguein
AwwwwuhhhhH I got the shhh to get your whole clique high
We can get high but act funny and Imma whip out
And they gon whip out and blow notes like Michelle
Cause you tried to jump the cipher and it goes THISSAWAY
I smoke on and on on ya dont stop
Im gettin mad ucked up and ya dont stop
To all my real dogs all my real pals
Who aint smokin get the uck owwwwt
I smoke on and on on ya dont stop
Im gettin mad ucked up and ya dont stop
To all my real dogs all my real pals
Who aint smokin get the uck owwwwt
Smoke buddha smoke buddha
