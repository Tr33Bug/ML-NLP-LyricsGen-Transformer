Ah Redman
Do you feel that the Blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation
Yeah they still mad
And if you dont take that funny smirk off your face
Ima kick your
Over 300 ghettorelated crimes happened in Newark New Jersey alone
Still the saga continues
Stick em up stick em up I got the jammy to your guts punk
Dont make a move before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block cause my stomachs in a knot
And it growls twentyfour hours a day around the ticktock
I got roaches and rats up the back
Carryin bats and gats so I fart fore I snack Jack
Then guzzle it down with water from the hydrant
My moms taking a bath and my brothers next to dive in
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I havent had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up cause Ima set up this kid
Carryin loot out from Burger King and what Ima do is
Run up on him snatch the bag of money
Then bust the dummy
Cause my man when I think of a plan theres no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face
Coat had the Black brother on scope
No jokes what I am cause the mans a pure pro
Yo my man you got a light  Straight jackin 
Yeah yeah give me the effin money too G  Yo stop stop stop 
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up now I have to go head up
With the cops but they carryin black Glocks  Shits thick 
Whats my next move My lifes on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on once again its on
I fell  Ow  and then the black Glocks went  Pow 
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing Im sniffin is dust because its
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Me and Erick Sermon taking a trip Uptown
In the 4Runner blastin my tape puffin ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that babycakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it upped the digits terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was mad splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays callin me weeknights
Who had her weekends  Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats Damn Black  The Funkadelic
Took a splash you know how that go fellas
Two months later  See you later alligator 
She was pissed and I ended up seein my physician
She took a blood test she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin Why the hell he isnt dead yet
Then I asked her Why you lookin at me
She said Redman because you have the HIV
Called Erick and his set that girl dont mess around
Too late cause Erick already had his drawers down cause its


Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
Cause its so rough
To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters make em wear they prophyllastic
Cause its drastic havin another ghetto bastard
Think Im dying for a piece of butt Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebiejeebies
Lookin like who done it With your face up on the TV
So next time you want sex get wreck but protect
Cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still dont know the time press rewind
Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline word
