Sooperman Luva II Lyrics
Hyah! Attention to all you punk motherfuckers out there
(uh-huh uh-huh, check it out, check it out)
Funky Noble Productions represent for the nine-four and nine-five area
Reggie Noble and Rockwilder in the house for the nizzow
If you don't know you might as well close your mizzouth
(To my peeps in Queens)
Yeah, ohh shit, yo, it's a bird
(Nah I thought that shit was a fuckin plane dude)
Nah nah nah, it's Soop, Soop, Soop-a-man
Hah
Verse One: Redman
Well it's the Soopaman Lovah in your motherfuckin town
Get down go round and round like shocks on your G-spot
Honeydip, now all of y'all up in that funny shit
But I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch
In the mix! So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em
With they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em
Fifty-four eleven Reeboks bitch which you need not
To do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots
Slow your monkey ass down and hold your horses
Don't wanna know your name don't wanna know none of your sources
Just fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki
So bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie
And plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong
Where the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song
Oooh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya
Slurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do
Let's take a journey up in the stars where I live at
Where I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah
Grab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her
Don't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker
And it's on
Verse Two: Redman
You might also likeWe landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up
Bought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker
She said, "I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny
So I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story."
You go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure
Where you from, the projects? "Yeahhhh, but I'm single
You needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit
My pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!"
Oh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me
She lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly
"So what you think of that?" I threw that bitch back on my back
Shit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat
I lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk
Got R2-D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work
See I got the block sewn "Oooh baby let's get it on!"
About time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin
She rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire
She tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire
She took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind
But with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind
So I broke out the ropes, smacked the ho, then suplexed her
She pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S was
"Oh shit I'm shot!" There was blood all over my finger!
I think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner
She gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond
It was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms
"Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo?
Did Superman have a gun?" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do!
So I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open
Had another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit
And I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick
Pa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness
Job well done I cleaned myself in a hurry
Oops! Gotta catch this blunt session
With I Dream of Jeannie and Keith Murray
Aiyyyo-yo-yo Keith aiyyo what's up?
