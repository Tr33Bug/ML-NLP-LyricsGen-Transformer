Gilla House Gillahouse
I smoke purp to the haze
Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I aint feeling anything
When I roll the bomb alright alright its Gillahouse
Rollin up the marijuana bud
Jack Herer Uh in the blood
Redman my codename Cheech
Hash burns all in my carseats
I was a Baby Boy like Tyrese
Hittin the L before Rock the Bells release
Mr Green yeah thats me got the knockout bud the muhammad aleaf
Young as a Bob Marley when I speak
Popo I hide the bud in the briefs
The highest of highs your boys on fire
Smokin with me is like trying to Get Him to the Greek
420 I light up the kief Im a Wiz at getting the Curreny in the streets
Bill Clinton said he hit weed in his speech
I smoke sour everyday of the week nigga PREACH
I smoke purp to the haze
Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I aint feeling anything
When I roll the bomb alright alright its gillahouse
Redman  Ready Roc 
LETS GO
Smoke with you 
The fire 
Come smoke with me 
Lets go get higher
This booooomb its a sensation
Now breathe it in all in your system
YEAH
Blunt filled with kush cheese purple and sour diesel
I call that smoking reefer
I keep weed in my system and truth be told I get higher than Blake Griffin
And just imagine what Im sipping to drink this your gonna need a prescription
So it better be highgrade if you selling me
And never start no cypher without telling me
Cup empty I need a refill
Something to chase this E pill
I hit my dealer at 3 AM
I wonder if he got hash still
Cause Gillahouse is what Im reppin
I stay high get fly Im a Jetson
Now Im on my high horse like a Western
And I never leave the house without protection
Thats something that pastor cant preach
But thats something a jail could teach
To get high we put our money on weed and we probably spend it all cause the sour aint cheap
CHIEF
I smoke purp to the haze
Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I aint feeling anything
When I roll the bomb alright alright its Gillahouse
