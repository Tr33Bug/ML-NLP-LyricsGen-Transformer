Mic check I can get smooth to any groove
Relax the tongue let my mic take a cruise
Around the planet pack em in like Janet
Jackson shes askin if I can slam it Im
Yo yo Redman man what the fuck man
Get the fuck off that punk smooth shit man
Get with that rough shit man you know how we do
Mic check I walk around the streets with a black TEC9
By the waistline kickin the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to show them motherfuckers what Im after
Im after the gold then after that the platinum
Beef after that Hurricane G packs the gat son
Trigger bang bang yo bust the slang what my name
Its the Redman on the funk train
Psych youre motherfuckin right tonights the night
To do what I wanna do to do it like dynamite
The work perfected when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk pass the forty and the blunt and dont front
On the block cause when you do front brothers are gettin stomped
Im not an addict more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when Im through cause my crew  Gots to have it 
I dont claim to be a big rap star
Cause no matter who you are youll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what Im sayin
Cause tonights the night and me and my niggas aint playin
Fat black bitch nasty
Bush bear booga breath bitch
Nasty talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans Mr Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker
You wanna see me get cool please save it for the breeze
Cause the lyrics and tracks make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit I get down with the boom bip
Like QTip I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonights the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike n Ikes
Hanging out with my niggas my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the forty between my lap coolin rollin down the highway
Blunt system pumps cause its Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up we raise a lot of noise
Cause we can do that black so Get the Bozack Jack
Remember I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the babump
Babump make your speakers pop
Thats the funk when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump jump jump jump jump jump
But if you wanna see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
Cause Red aint down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by lettin me make an album  How come rude boy 
To get on the mic and let my fuckin style run


Nasty fuckin green thumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango pickin havin ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin ass
Johnny Cash afro havin
Jack of Spades boots havin
Tony Danza shoes wearin ass
Bbbblack by popular demand I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam

I get vexed I break necks punch out gold fronts chump you
Yo fuck that yo turn this shit off man  Turn that shit off 
Turn that shit down man
