Chill and relax Im back in effect
Yes Im Erick Sermon with a brand new cassette
Yes Im spoiled rich like topsoil
Still loyal still the MC Grand Royal
Im still dope Im still no joke
I dont care Im still wild like Tone Lc
Im swift AKA a black stallion
Fat herringbone with no medallion hello
I still got the same funk flow
And yo I still get busy like Arsenio
When I rock I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight like Whitney
Houston producing a style that make a smile
To make you say ooh child
Bust a sketch the picture frame it
Hall of fame it hang it so no one can claim it
I rule brung my style from the boon docks
Now my shit pump in the boombox
Yo Red my ears are ringin
I can hear some girl singin

Plus I have a crush you drive me crazy

Funkyfresh in the flesh the Sooperman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this Redman is milk like two tits
I stay freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip money grip no bullshit
I ticktack on small cracks Im all that to fall Black
My jaw snap with raps so um get the balls Jack
Flavor like Flav plus Im wellpaid
Own a maid with a blade mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate I sparkle like Colgate
My dicks named Machete I stab much hoecake
I dont have a car but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where Im going until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch bust the mix
Jam oops I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
Its Reggie Noble yeah Im feelin kinda soso
I dog you like Toto make Rudolph nose glow
Right out of sight with the type of hype
To make you say um uh dynomite
Chiller chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the quils from tequila
Im down with the greeneyed brother named Erick
Charlie how you rate this  Hm ten like Bo Derek 
Im deeper than a valley peace to Cool V and Sally
PMD my man Solo and Im Audi
