Watch Yo Nuggets Lyrics
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?

Chill and relax, I'm back in effect
Yes, I'm Erick Sermon, with a brand new cassette
Yes, I'm spoiled, rich like topsoil
Still loyal, still the MC Grand Royal
I'm still dope, I'm still no joke
I don't care, I'm still wild like Tone L≈çc
I'm swift, AKA a black stallion
Fat herringbone with no medallion, hello
I still got the same funk flow
And, yo, I still get busy like Arsenio
When I rock, I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight like Whitney
Houston, producing a style that make a smile
To make you say, "ooh, child"
Bust a sketch, the picture, frame it
Hall of fame it, hang it, so no one can claim it
I rule, brung my style from the boon docks
Now my shit pump in the boombox
Yo, Red, my ears are ringin'
I can hear some girl singin'
Hey, Erick Sermon
Hey, uh
Rock the mic, honey, I love the way you sway
Plus, I have a crush, you drive me crazy
I replied, "Hm, slow down, baby", uh
I'm ill, smooth as Johnny Gill
Gill, my, my, my, I pack skill
So back off, softy, here's an ice cream cone
Put down the microphone
Thank you, right about now I'm through
I'm ghost like Casper, see you
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?
When I come around, homeboy, watch yo' nuggets
Why must I feel like that?

Funky-fresh in the flesh, the Sooperman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip, money grip, no bullshit
I tick-tack on small cracks, I'm all that to fall, Black
My jaw snap with raps so, um, get the balls, Jack
Flavor like Flav, plus I'm well-paid
Own a maid with a blade, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkle like Colgate
My dick's named Machete, I stab much hoecake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix
Jam, oops, I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeah, I'm feelin kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Right out of sight with the type of hype
To make you say, um, uh, "dyn-o-mite!"
Chiller, chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the 'quils from tequila
I'm down with the green-eyed brother named Erick
Charlie, how you rate this? (Hm, ten like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to Cool V and Sally
PMD, my man Solo and I'm Audi
