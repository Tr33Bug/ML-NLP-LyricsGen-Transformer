We Run NY Lyrics
Hahahahahahaaaaa
Watch out
Geyeeah As we take a journey to the darkside
Watch out
From Hell and beyond the knottyheaded nigga era has triumphed
Watch out
A new era If you dont know your bitch ass better
Watch out
Ask somebody Shoot em up
The Hurricane G is live and in color
Watch out
We run you motherfuckers
The Funk Doctor Spot coming live and in color
Watch out

Puffin mad spliffs so fuck a bitch
And a nigga cause niggas and bitches aint shit
Hahahahahahaaaa Dr Trevis
Watch out
Is in the motherfuckin house
With a couple of sick patients for your bitch ass
Watch out
Yeahhh
The Hurricane G is the ultimate funk pop the trunk
Hoohah Wild like Shaolin monks 
Representin comin out of Brooklyn Flatbush
You wuss you cant push push in the bush
Well uh lets take a journey to hell and beyond
Where the bomb grows on palms and bags labeled Cheech and Chong
The Jimi Hendrix of rap I got an afro and
Bandana then I rock jams like Santana
I move MCs like niggas move keys uptown
Red and Hurricane G SO HOW YOU LIKE US NOW
Chorus repeat 4X
Watch out We run New York
Yeah
Hurricane G hit em one time 
From the Brook taught how to trick by the real gangsta crooks
So I hook back what you took
I take my funk and my religion serious
Sanctify yall and leave yall house niggas delirious
hahahahaa  cause Im furious
How dare you motherFUCKERS forget about the ultimate
Funk BITTTTTCH nigga
I got your wicked witch with a switch
Motherfucker fuck you and your crew
So what nigga is it you wanna do
In ninetyfo I kick the wicked for the bitches
For the real trick deez who can dig it
Cause after pop thought all that Hurricane stay fat
Word to my big dick boriquas in the back
The queen of the East coast funk gangsta pack buddha
On the rhyme since eightynine
Its all in your mind but whats yours is mines
Your dough and your hoes Bump N Grind to my rhymes
Now It aint a nigga who could hang
Or pop yang about a motherfuckin thaaaang
And uh fuck any bitch who cant hang
Im representin bitches universal
It go one for the biz on the bizness
Which yall blesses with Gods blessings do you see
Hurricane and Redman original steel
Latin Queens in the house
So nigga swing it over here on these big fat tits
Titties hahahahahaa 
The Funk Doctor Spot blast up on your block
Im walkin through the sewer with manure on my socks
Your style I freaked it when I was a child
So you talkin that baby talk like Whos Talkin Now
Verbally I crush brains erupt
Blow your focus like you sniffin angel dust
Run of the mill Im not watch me kill a cocksucker
And cause ruckus like them LOD motherfuckers
Every verse every word I preach
Represents the East long as the human eyes can see
Gimme that funk funk funk funk funk funk funk funk beat
I light a blunt for niggas up in SingSing
I do it to death style is funk thats fresh
Remove your vest you just won the wet tshirt contest
And Im hotter than the Globetrotters in the Bahamas
I got a pair of pajamas made out of ganjah and almonds
Eager as a nigga wantin my shit to dub
Cause my shit be BANGIN like the Crips and Bloods
Troop I flew the coop like Big Bird in Timb boots
I Skywalk the planet like my code name was Luke
From the darkside Im from the darkside Pah
Im Above the Law like Steven Seagal
Motherfucker
Watch out
Hahahaha we take you to the darkside
Come travel
Watch out
On our metaphoric futuristic type shit
As we blow your brains like spliffs
Watch out
