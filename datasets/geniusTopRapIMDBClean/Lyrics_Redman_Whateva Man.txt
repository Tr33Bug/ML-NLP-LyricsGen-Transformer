I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of em wasnt graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang Yeah boy I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come harder they fall
That goes for knuckleheads MCs pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whooped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin mics and area codes now
PPP the kinda niggas thatll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya later on stick a slug in ya
Everything thats light green aint the bomb bitch
