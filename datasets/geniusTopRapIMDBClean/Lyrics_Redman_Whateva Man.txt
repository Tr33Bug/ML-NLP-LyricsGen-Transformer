Whateva Man Lyrics

Microphone check, one, two (I can feel it)
Ayo, you ready to get down man? (Yo, whatever, man)
You ready to get drunk as fuck? (Whatever, man)
You, you sayin somethin'? (Whatever, man)
Ayo (Whatever, man)
(I can feel it) Check it, Kool V
I keeps it bangin', keep it swangin', Mike type of sangin' (Yeah)
Ooh, la, la, la (So what ya sayin'?)
Yo, I'm smokin' herbals 'til it hurts you
I keep your daughter way out past her curfew
Hard, far from commercial (So whatcha mean, nigga?)
We don't give a fuck when we smoked out
In the land that's doped out
(It's like that?) No doubt
From this bomb weed, I cop from the streets
Get you open like buttcheeks from girls who be freaks
Ayo, can I be SWV? (You the One, nigga)
Rap Shogun, yes, E the one
Yo, I'm rolling with a forty pack of niggas
Get my weed from Branson 'cause his sack's bigger
Yo, give me dap, nigga
What I clap lyrically tap call back
Ferocious, causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky-eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
'Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily gettin' blunted
Damn nigga, you cool at what you spittin'
So why you holding the blunt so long politickin'? (Huh)
I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on hydroglycerin
I keep it live, no jive, rolling dutches
That's Masters like the Furious Five
I keep your crew chinky-eyed, for bitches actin' dog
(Can you hit it from the back?)
Why not? While we toke on this (I can feel it)
You might also like
(I can feel it)
Yo, yo, you ready to roll this weed up? (Whatever, man)
You ready to knock this nigga out? (Whatever, man)
Yo, you ready to get this chedda? (Whatever, man)
You ready to start this shit off? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)

I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah, boy, I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for knuckleheads, MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whooped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin' mics and area codes now
PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb, bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm, bitch
Read my lips, you ain't hittin' unless you got
Ten on it, get on it, or get the fuck out my cypher (I can feel it)

You ready to roll this weed up? (Whatever, man)
You ready to rob this nigga? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)
You ready to fuck, bitch? (Whatever, man)
You ready to guzzle this liquor? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)
Whatever, man
Whatever, man (I can feel it)
Whatever, man
Whatever, man (I can feel it)4Embed
