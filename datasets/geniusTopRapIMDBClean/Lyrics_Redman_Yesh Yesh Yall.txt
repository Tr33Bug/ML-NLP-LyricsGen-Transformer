This is for the realrealniggas
Yo
Hard beats like this keep my mentality raw
I G off C4 lyrics to blow off those Lex doors
My texture be the kind that explore MCs
And blow em out metaphor after metaphor
Im more wetter than your boy vigor
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemployed nigga
I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz
But I got chickenheads criminals and broke friends
That love to get ends keep the seventeens spinnin
Pull out from my jaw linin commence to splittin
Brains and body parts that motion couldnt picture
Cause when Im shitting niggas hit more decks than a skipper
Mr and Mrs Howe MaryAnne and Ginger
Gilligan you need the Professor to take the rigor
Mortis out I got orders to kill em softly  Uhhuh 
I wouldnt leave a trace if I died and police chalked me
Whos the boss G You better radio the walkietalkie  Ugh 
For these Fatal Attrac MCs that stalk me  Uhhuh 
Got a big dick in your bitch clit
When I flip this I got more work than a Olympic gymnast
Bust it I cut the mustard on any track
Milkier than Similac when Im next up to bat
Redman is on the mic and Ima  Dope motherfucker 
Yeah you best ask somebody
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Fuck the talk I walk whatever I claim to do
Knock a mule on her ass and turn the pussy black and blue  Haha 
You couldnt run up if your Fighter was Virtua
Im a roundtheclock lyricist I sleep in my workboots
Its a thin line between love and hate
Its a thin line between the trigger and the finger of a 38
Dust by far my rap repertoire
Be the art of murderin makin it hard for you to spar  Ha 
We can chill and puff the ganja but dont be mad
When the funk Doctor Spock smoke it with your baby mama
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come here
Male groupies gettin shaky when I come from the rear hah
That getonyournerve neighbor
That play the music loud as fuck three in the mornin off a paper
With mad Zul in the LSC
In the downtown area scannin the perimeter
All my boos with the opentoed shoes
If you aint gettin that pussy eaten right let me show you
Then let you taste these this Brown Fox said
Aint no nigga like theFunk Doctor Spock G
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
As I dive into the crowd Uhhuh
I wanna see who the fuck gettin loud
Who the fuck runnin off at they mouth
I let my nigga 50 Cent knock that ass out
Word bond Bitches talkin bout pourin out Cristal and Dom P
They better stick to Chandon
Blackin out wildin smackin out weaves
Breakin niggas cheapass chains and medallions
Youre just a parttime sucker in the game
Shit is real motherfucker start namin names
And if you name my name I whoop ass like Steven Seagal
Give you Under Siege 2 without the fucking train
Let your brains hang from the 808 bang
And if I wrecked your cipher then my Squad is to blame
Yes yes yall  Motherfucker Haha
Yes yes  Haha Haha Nigga
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Well be right back with some more funk shit for all you stankin asses after we pay these bills
