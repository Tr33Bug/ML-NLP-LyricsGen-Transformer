Oooh now you are one lucky nigga
You better listen to your boss white boy
Oh Im gonna walk in the moonlight with you
You wanna hold my hand
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
Black coffins  I need a hundred 
I seen a hundred niggas die
I put that on my life Lord I wouldnt tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life all you wanna do is shine
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus but will that help ease the pain
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block look like Im Big Daddy Cane
Is you a cat or a mouse Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back get tattoes all around
Hundred dead bitches hundred black coffins
Money on his head bitch Im trying to make a fortune
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
Black coffins  I need a hundred 
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve Put me on the farm
Pigs feet in a jar serve it to me warm
Any questions they hang em better pray for DjDjango
Got me working in fields too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman such a wonderful mother  mama 
On the days that it rains her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest bitch cause Im coming
Gonna die in my arms for what you did to my mother  my mama 
Hundred dead bitches  Lord  hundred black coffins  why 
12 gauge shotgun chest full of carbon  boomboom 


I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
I need a hundred black coffins black coffins black coffins  Oh Lord 
Black coffins  I need a hundred
