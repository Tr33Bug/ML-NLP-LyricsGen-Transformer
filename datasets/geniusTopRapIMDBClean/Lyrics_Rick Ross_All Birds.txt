Walk with a real nigga
Selfmade millionaire  MMMMaybach Music 
What more could you ask for huh
Im a kamikaze in a Maserati
Im a John Gotti got my own army
Worth fifty million and its all on me
Fifty on my Rollie knowin yours phony
Last problem I had a nigga headshot him
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasnt involved you wouldnt hear about him
I got Lears and all dont need Aaliyah problems
May she rest her soul I got a sleeping problem
All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double MG this little thing of ours
Take it to the door a motherfucker plea
Niggas layin on your crib while your momma sleep
Homecooked meals for the real niggas
Hot TEC9 for you little niggas
Wanna shoplift Come and boost this
We run the fucking game nigga truth is  Maybach Music 
Cargo pants and my red bottoms
Talking bout birds you know the boy got em
No clothes in the closet its all birds  Hah 
No sneakers in the sneaker box its all birds  Hah 
No luggage in the trunk man its all birds  Hah 
And I aint going back Ima ball first  Uh 
Anything you need know I get it cheap  Hah 
My nigga Rozay make millions while he getting sleep  Hah 
Cars European come and see the fleet  Hah 
Were commercial come and see us if you need the street  Hah 
Ima bring it home nigga bet the bank  Hah 
Sierra Leone all up in the link  Bling 
Bout to double up Mason Betha shit  Hah 
Huddle up round table King Arthur shit  Arthur shit 
Shorty ass fat she cant stand straight  Hah 
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggas sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause  Blrrt 
Slicker than a can of grease
Paid the state in the ice hundred grand a piece
Coke Boy Ill be thirty for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope now  Hah 
No clothes in the closet its all birds  Hah 
No sneakers in the sneaker box its all birds  Hah 
No luggage in the trunk man its all birds  Hah 
And I aint going back Ima ball first  Hah 
No clothes in the closet its all birds  Hah 
No sneakers in the sneaker box its all birds  Hah 
No luggage in the trunk man its all birds  Hah 
And I aint going back Ima ball first
