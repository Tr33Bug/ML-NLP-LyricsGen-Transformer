We get ghost you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit
Cameras in the ceiling Cline on my arm
Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
Refugees runnin wild Wyclef with a SIG Sauer
Nothin to lose I was starvin from the start
Now the same cat drivin Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that Im a member theyll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini middle of the ghetto smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid wrists on chill
Standin in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil
These boys goin blind they just happy bein free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a ki
Sheesh I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased
These boys snort lines Im fine just sippin wine
Amsterdam in the air tomorrow on my mind
Im Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that Im deceased
Even then I pray Im livin through these beats
Dope boy you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf
Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always runnin late quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublots cool but my Terminators foolish
All stainless steel quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event the marijuana be lit
Red or blue do you as long as youre gettin rich
Crack game champagne kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce new Ghost thats a nigga pocket change
These niggas actin like they want a war
When it come to whackin niggas I done won awards
Nigga you a bitch where yo Honda Accord
Im ridin in some shit only I can afford
Shouldnt claim the hood til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind I just gave you a tour
Im laughin at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans youd think it was porn


Im Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that Im deceased
Even then I pray Im livin through these beats
Dope boy you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf
Im speakin on unwritten laws the code of the streets
Im not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 711 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me you gotta get permission homie
And that could take a long time
In that time Imma handle my motherfuckin business
Ugh Ugh
Its the red light district nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck Im at
Its a no go
We green light you bitch niggas
