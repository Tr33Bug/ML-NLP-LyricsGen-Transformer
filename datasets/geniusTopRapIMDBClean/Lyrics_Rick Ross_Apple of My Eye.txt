Hahahah 
Just being somebody that the neighborhood respected
And my mama could be proud of was the apple of my eye
Thats all I ever wanted just being something man
So at that point what else can you ask for
MMMaybach Music 
Tears runnin down a nigga face
In a room full of failures I feel out of place
Still sleepin on the floor when you deserve better
Got you reekin through the cold even in warm weather
I told Meek I wouldnt trust Nicki
Instead of beefin with your dog you just give em some distance
We all make mistakes lets not be too specific
We like I rather be a killer than be a statistic
I never fold no I never ran
On my soul Ill roll like an avalanche
I thank the Lord I got some great friends
Thats why every bottle I open I say Amen
Just had seizure at the Super Bowl
Woke up in the third quarter lookin for the smoke
If its more than a quarter million Ill count it twice
Pucci broke my heart shit I call it life
And never will I call it right
Not perfect but Im the one you would call at night
Travelin the world Im just reppin my city
But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it
When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
Cause the loss of lifes the only thing niggas believe
So I pray you listen carefully
Then I become another motherfuckin casualty
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by  never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky  the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I  for the love of you and 
Standin on your block but you so out of place
Uncle on the couch momma runnin out of space
Lights off so you never tend to speak much
Go your separate ways every time the lease up
A fat ugly nigga thought Id never be nothin
Another tree stump happy with his free lunch
Duckin pigeons Im an eagle on a sunny day
Flap my wings once a week pray I glide safe
I want fried chicken at my funeral
Rolls Royces dope boys Sway interviews
Everybody dyin for the same things
Cop kill a nigga dont nobody gangbang
Im happy Donald Trump became the president
Because we gotta destroy before we elevate
Real shit look at me inside the white house
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
US treasury addressing me mad at my address
Own the biggest residential pool in the US
Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
Finger fuckin bitches in the holy water
Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter
So her daddy told it to her firsthand
Never perfect but its not just bout them purses
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by  never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky  the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I  for the love of you and 
Maybach Music
The streets could never teach me
All the things I got from you
I found myself in the wrong lane
And I ended up in pain pain
I was strolling down a dark street
When this girl passed me by
She said youve always been a good friend  always been a good friend 
And you never never never let me down
Ill just fall back never turn back
Let it go let it go
Ill just fall back never turn back
Let it go let it go
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by  never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky  the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I  for the love of you and
