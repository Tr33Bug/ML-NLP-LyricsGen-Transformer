Oh
Lets pull the 2seater out baby
Its where ever you wanna go
JUSTICE League
Riding to the music this is how we do it  all night  all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby in our ride
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant let it go
Whether thats right I will never know
Uh but here goes nothing
When Im alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor but who can you call
My down bitch one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow whats on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause Im running out of space
Elroy Jetson Im somewhere out in space
In my 2seater shes the one that I would take wee
Riding to the music this is how we do it  all night  all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby in our ride
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music Music


Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant it let it go
Whether thats right I will never know
Uh but here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a droptop chicken box
Mr KFC VVSs in the watch
Living fast where its all about that money bag
Never front you take it there it aint no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy I gotta keep ballin
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music this is how we do it  all night  all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby in our ride
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music Music
Wouldve came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant let it go whether thats right I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me never meant wrong
Tried to be patient waited too long
But I wouldve came back but I wouldve came back
Wouldve came back wouldve came back
Wouldve came 
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit drycleaned bitches whats up witcha
I hate callin the women bitches but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
Im urgin all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
Youre never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin on me to be there like missin rubbers
Im on some Marvin Gaye shit a bunch of distant lovers
This aint the life that Im used to
Reintroduced to people Ive been introduced to
Did you forget me
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I wont remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis Tennessee my cousins my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
Im halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you that crazy shit
I dont drink every bottle I own I be agin shit
And I got them wedding ring flows that engagin shit
Which one of yall got fleets on your keychains
The seats for these Heat games
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia Ive been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we dont really fuck wit
Fuck is up
Havin lunch and debatin Ferrari prices
23 and goin through a midlife crisis
But trust me I still deliver like a midwife
And no Im not sayin Im the nicest I just live life like it
Uh it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I havent hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body she tells me live in the moment
And baby Ill never forget none of that
Girl I told you I was coming back
