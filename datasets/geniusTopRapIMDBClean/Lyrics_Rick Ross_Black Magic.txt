Could you knock that ho? Could you blame that bitch?
Cause she wanna roll with a real nigga like me
That's gon' slang that dick?
Like coke to a fiend, fuck throat on the lean
Take long on the Perc', now that ho on a bean
Still money over these hoes, got YSL on my clothes
And blood drip on my sneakers
Nigga, you hating on me, she chose
And I ain't fuck your girl, she rode, my stick-shift she drove
Did everything that she 'posed
I pulled my camera out and she posed
And I was like, "Got that, drop that, pop that"
Got the top back on the dropback, I'm back
And the Glock at where the crotch at, I'm strapped
All the rocks at where the watch at, stop that
Could you cop that? Not that
I'm like, "Send the mob at", dime sack
I'm catching on contact, got racks
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout that, 'bout that life! (Hahaha)
(Poof!) There go the car (Poof!) There go the crib
(Poof!) A hundred mil (Whoop!) David Copperfield
(Huh!) David Copperfield

Poof! Nigga fuck your life
Fuck your niggas and fuck your wife (Fuck 'em!)
Got two bad bitches with a nigga
And you know they gon' fuck all night (Right)
And I rock hard white, nigga wrist game proud
I'll pull up on whores and I'm sitting on fours in a big boy drop
Call big boy shots, all clear stones in my big boy watch
All year long, got the strip on lock
Every time we in this bitch, man, shit gon' pop
My hip on Glock, your hip on nothin'
My niggas got racks, y'all niggas be frontin'
Red Cartier, redbone bitch
Red Bottoms on her, hair long as shit, hold up
Yellow gold Ro', yellowbone ho
And yellow bottles of Spades nigga, whole clique self made nigga
Poof!
