Free Mason Lyrics
This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight
You dig?
Let me slow down
It’s so Inkredible

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols, speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole (No)
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I’m iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal (Woo)
Ugh, it’s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason (What), freelancer (Yeah)
Free agents (Me), we faster (Ha)
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I’m the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard (Woo)
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga (Ha)
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga (Nigga)
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK (Ayy)
So— So I "JFK"
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day (Oh)
Right now, I could rewrite history (Woo)
I stopped writing, so fuck it, I’ll do it mentally
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die (H-O)
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide (Yeah)
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die (Yeah)

Niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don’t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise—turn the music up
Hear me clearly: If y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y’all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It’s amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red-hot
I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die

If I ever die
Never let it be said I didn’t win
Never, never say
Never say, "Legend didn’t go in" (I'ma go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Making love to my favorite girl
I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die26Embed
