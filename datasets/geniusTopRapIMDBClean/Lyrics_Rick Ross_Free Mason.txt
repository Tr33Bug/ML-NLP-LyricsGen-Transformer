This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight
You dig
Let me slow down
Its so Inkredible
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers cant crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole  No 
I wont fail but a lot of men will
Im iconic in the field like Solomons Seal  Woo 
Ugh its just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason  What  freelancer  Yeah 
Free agents  Me  we faster  Ha

A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors

They wanna push my top back like JFK  Ayy

Join forces with the kings and we ate all day  Oh 
Right now I could rewrite history  Woo

Niggas couldnt do nothing with me they put the devil on me
Id have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer I dont know who to trust
Whole world want my demiseturn the music up
Hear me clearly If yall niggas fear me just say yall fear me
Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass yall interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So yall look in the mirror doublecheck your appearance
Bitch I said I was amazing
Not that Im a Mason
Its amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me I never wouldve made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch Im redhot

My Jesuspiece flooded
But thou shall not covetkeep your eyes off my cupboard
Im a bad motherfucker its Hov just say you love it
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave you dealing with some rich niggas
