Bill Look at this stuff this is history hereyoure history
Mike This is garbageI can say I bled for garbage
Bill So this is meaningless
Mike No at one time it meant a lot When youre just a young kid this is everything to you then you realize your priorities change And you just want your children to be happy and do nice things and that makes you happy This is nothing This is just nothing man
Ugh God Forgives and I Dont
Thats one of my many emotions thats one of my many flaws
I am flawed it may not seem that way but I am
So dont play with me
I can talk about the bodies I could tell you bout the killing
Duct taping niggas in the name of drug dealin
Big body Benzes while the bitch niggas starve
Turtleneck Mercedes blowin smoke up out the top
Time to talk about the money I can tell you bout a profit
Oceanfront spot moving niggas out the projects
Diamonds on my neck call it the ghettos guillotine
Fuckin with them jewelers nigga lit up like a screen HD
Look at me ballin Im talkin high definition
Fuckin up six digits boy thats just my definition
Niggas gotta get murked but Im just minding my business
Bought three Range Rovers dolo so fuck Expedition
On the road to the riches until Im paid in full
And the Lord is my witness I got a AK to pull
These niggas full of shit my niggas moving bricks
I could front you fifty but you gotta move em quick my moolah thick
Went and got me a choppa to put it right in ya face
Better blow out your brains before you give me a case
Got the forty by my dick I keep on pissin on the hammer
When they talkin slick I double back with that banana
High definition Im stacking money to the ceiling
Fuck my ho feelings look here its time to make a killin
Got a hundred silent niggas and they fiending for a million
High definition bitches my life a motion picture


I could talk about the bitches I could tell you bout the bricks
Pull up in the Bentley I could pop up in the six
Helicopter rides I can sit it on the club
Sound of the propeller had my young bitch busting nuts
Niggas wanna crack jokes just to get close to me
Hope you know that Im strapped like I supposed to be
Put a number on your helmet like its Notre Dame
5 grandll get you whacked wont even know your name
Road to the riches until Im paid in full
And the Lord is my witness we making major moves
God forgives and I dont I got it tatted in my skin
Im going straight to hell thats if ballin is a sin
Crucifix on my neck I pray it never melt
Pacquiao purse boy I took another belt
Take a seat Im undefeated in this art of war
Rest in peace to the pussies its time to scar some more
Went and got me a choppa to put it right in ya face
Better blow out your brains before you give me a case
Got the forty by my dick I keep on pissin on the hammer
When they talkin slick I double back with that banana
High definition Im stacking money to the ceiling
Fuck my ho feelings look here its time to make a killin
Got a hundred silent niggas and they fiending for a million
High definition bitches my life a motion picture
