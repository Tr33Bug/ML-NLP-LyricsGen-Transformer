I look in my fridge my shit lookin scarce
I got a few kids we need some shit on the shelf
I get a knock at the door they say my rent overdue
And while my niggas sell dope and dont know what else to do
The only thing on my mind Im tryin to keep on the lights
I call up my slime I need a kilo tonight
Everything went well Im eatin steak no more soup
Then I parked the Caprice I went and got me a coupe
Everything takes time but this shit came fast

Motivated my niggas and well never divide NO

First I got me a Taurus then I copped me a Lexus
I took over Florida my connect out of Texas
Then I start sippin purple got my shit screwed
When you feedin your circle watch your shipments improve
Fabricate bout your fortune all my fabrics imported
Fornicate in my fortress 40k still my mortgage
24k my toilet all my taxes reported
All my exes deported shoutout Texas New Orleans
All these niggas influenced by a hustlers endurance
I just bought me the purest but I need some insurance
Niggas watch who you fuckin just to hate on your bitches
Niggas breakin the rules niggas facin suspension
