I look in my fridge my shit lookin scarce
I got a few kids we need some shit on the shelf
I get a knock at the door they say my rent overdue
And while my niggas sell dope and dont know what else to do
The only thing on my mind Im tryin to keep on the lights
I call up my slime I need a kilo tonight
Everything went well Im eatin steak no more soup
Then I parked the Caprice I went and got me a coupe
Everything takes time but this shit came fast

When you feedin your circle watch your shipments improve
Fabricate bout your fortune all my fabrics imported
Fornicate in my fortress 40k still my mortgage

All my exes deported shoutout Texas New Orleans
All these niggas influenced by a hustlers endurance
