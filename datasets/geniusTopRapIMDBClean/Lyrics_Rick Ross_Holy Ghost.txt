Holy Ghost Lyrics
Heh, what is this? (Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music
(Sweet!) Hahahah...

Bugatti Boyz
Yo turn up the motherfuckin' lights
You know what it is
Yeah, fuck your dreams, nigga
This reality, yeah, take that
They say I'm gettin' money, must be Illuminati
Talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Bugatti
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
They say I'm gettin' money, must be Illuminati
Talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Bugatti
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in

Lord knows, that boy done been about it
Lord knows, that boy'll catch a body
Phone ringing, gotta be the Mexicans
Phone ringing, gotta be the Mexicans
Being dead broke is the root of all evil
Get money, my nigga, do good with your people
I got the calico, I got the dynamite
They wanna do it big? Pick a time tonight
Back to these bitches following my timeline
Back to these crackers following my timeline
Got the phone tapped, I think I'm being followed
Touch him with the Holy Ghost, can you hear me Father?

Father, please protect me from brokeness
And bitch ass niggas, bitch ass bitches too
Keep 'em away

Talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Bugatti
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
They say I'm gettin' money, must be Illuminati
Talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Ferarri
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in

Work! That's all my niggas workin' with
Work! That's all my niggas lurkin' with
My teacher told me that I was a piece of shit
Seen her the other day, driving a piece of shit
Work! Exactly what I'm screamin' ho
Certified, 8 digit nigga, triple beamin' ho
Hah! You talkin' to the Holy Ghost
I'm smokin' 'til I overdose
Uh, when I fuck she let her pussy soak
Even my lawyer be askin is it dope
Never break the code, shock me with a million volts
I'm forever dope, touched by the Holy Ghost

You see, they hate what they don't understand
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do
Let's go
They say I'm gettin' money, must be Illuminati
Talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Bugatti
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in
He knockin' on the do' don't let the Devil in4Embed
