This the flyest shit ever
This that Rich Forever part two
Uh uh
Layin in my bed Im under these gold chandeliers
Cant say too many names in here these kinda years
Nice sweaters and these icy diamonds on my wrist
Ice Cube lookin nigga you know life a bitch
I once got no allowance now I got the crown
I said I was The Boss nobody made a sound
Really had to see them things this level story tellin
Who else could flip a chorus into 40 million
Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio
While out on bond pray I go to trial rapido
Eight felonies tellin me wanna give me life
Every nut I bust really I gotta do it twice
Ricky Ronaldo really when Im in Portugal
I pull a yacht out this weekend Im fuckin soandso
Cameras flash paparazzi layin in the grass
Tom Brady my new neighbor you can tell em that
Uh I think she like me
Oh I think she like me
I know her nigga dont like me
With your bitch right now yeah I might be
Sippin this right now yeah we might be  Ooh ooh 
Might hit her from the back let her ride me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another nigga like me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another man like me
Im sexin women out on Fisher Isle
I gas her up and let her lick me down
I may name my daughter Hermes
Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest
20 million up at Merrill Lynch
I met his chick he havent seen her since
Through the city Im still floatin like a magic carpet
She stop me for a selfie I just want the knowledge
Expressin what you thinkll send your kids to college
Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished
Do it for the dear departed fuck a Ben Carson
Empowering the youth made a nigga a target
Only one thats smokin up in Goldman Sachs
But Im the only one thats rollin like a quarter back
And I never put it in my government
Cause I never put on for the government


Uh I think she like me
Oh I think she like me
I know her nigga dont like me
With your bitch right now yeah I might be
Sippin this right now yeah we might be  Ooh ooh 
Might hit her from the back let her ride me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another nigga like me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another man like me
You caught the case you gotta post the bond
Im Rayful Edmond mixed with young Wale Folarin
Starin in my safe Im rather safe than sorry
Diddy Jigga only two niggas comin for me
I park the Caddy in my livin room
Pussy niggas lookin for me Ima give it to em
Santorini Greece sex in the swimmin pool
If her pussy dry call her Beetle Juice
Im babymakin in them Maldives
Put up all the yachts pulled out the jetskis
Khaled hit me on the FaceTime  Its Billi 
Im the flyest nigga on his bassline
She see the sneakers and she see the stones
Fat boy run the city seated in the throne
Im cashin in like the Kardashians
My paralyzed homie snuck the ratchet in
Uh I think she like me
Oh I think she like me
I know her nigga dont like me
With your bitch right now yeah I might be
Sippin this right now yeah we might be  Ooh ooh 
Might hit her from the back let her ride me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another nigga like me  Ooh ooh 
Girl you never meet another man like me
