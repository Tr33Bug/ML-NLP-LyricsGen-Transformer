I Think She Like Me Lyrics
This the flyest shit ever
This that Rich Forever part two
Uh, uh

Layin' in my bed, I'm under these gold chandeliers
Can't say too many names in here these kinda years
Nice sweaters and these icy diamonds on my wrist
Ice Cube lookin' nigga, you know life a bitch
I once got no allowance, now I got the crown
I said I was The Boss, nobody made a sound
Really had to see them things, this level story tellin'
Who else could flip a chorus into 40 million?
Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio
While out on bond, pray I go to trial rapido
Eight felonies, tellin' me wanna give me life
Every nut I bust, really, I gotta do it twice
Ricky Ronaldo, really when I'm in Portugal
I pull a yacht out, this weekend, I'm fuckin' so-and-so
Cameras flash, paparazzi layin' in the grass
Tom Brady my new neighbor, you can tell 'em that
Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)
Might hit her from the back, let her ride me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another nigga like me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another man like me

I'm sexin' women, out on Fisher Isle
I gas her up and let her lick me down
I may name my daughter Hermes
Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest
20 million up at Merrill Lynch
I met his chick, he haven't seen her since
Through the city, I'm still floatin' like a magic carpet
She stop me for a selfie, I just want the knowledge
Expressin' what you think'll send your kids to college
Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished
Do it for the dear departed, fuck a Ben Carson
Empowering the youth made a nigga a target
Only one that's smokin' up in Goldman Sachs
But I'm the only one that's rollin' like a quarter back
And I never put it in my government
'Cause I never put on for the government
You might also like
Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)
Might hit her from the back, let her ride me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another nigga like me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another man like me

You caught the case, you gotta post the bond
I'm Rayful Edmond mixed with young Wale Folarin
Starin' in my safe, I'm rather safe than sorry
Diddy, Jigga only two niggas comin' for me
I park the Caddy in my livin' room
Pussy niggas lookin' for me, I'ma give it to 'em
Santorini, Greece, sex in the swimmin' pool
If her pussy dry, call her Beetle Juice
I'm baby-makin' in them Maldives
Put up all the yachts, pulled out the jetskis
Khaled hit me on the FaceTime (It's Billi!)
I'm the flyest nigga on his bassline
She see the sneakers and she see the stones
Fat boy run the city, seated in the throne
I'm cashin' in like the Kardashians
My paralyzed homie snuck the ratchet in
Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)
Might hit her from the back, let her ride me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another nigga like me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another man like me
