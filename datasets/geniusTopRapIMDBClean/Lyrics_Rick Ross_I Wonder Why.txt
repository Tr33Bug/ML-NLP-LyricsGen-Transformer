The day you decide to get you some money
Nigga fuck your friends
Aint no friends we aint even on that
All these niggas taking Instagrams selfies
Point me to the money
Point me to the money
Business big business
Maybach business
If you aint with it I dont fuck with you
You aint gotta hold my hand and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you wont be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got em in the trunk
I wonder why I wonder why
I wonder why sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
Nappyheaded nigga pocket full of crack rock
Nineteen living like a fucking rap star
Watching from my point you thought it was a fucking film
One day he buy the car next day the fucking rims
Curlyheaded bitches tall and they slim
They know him as the myth but see I know its him
Never testify I seen it in his eye
Attempted murder on his life in that 360i
With my two eyes
Two different pistols
One with registered and one to get your issue
I wonder why sometimes I wonder why
All this fame and fortune leave you traumatized
You aint gotta hold my hand and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you wont be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got em in the trunk
I wonder why I wonder why
I wonder why sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
Now Im being followed by some creepyass cracker
Now Im being followed by some creepyass cracker
Stand your ground stand your ground
Stand your ground you gotta stand your ground
Got on my hoodie and my motherfucking Desert Eagle
You wanna do me then you go and tell the people
Knock me down temp drops as the sun rise
I could see a hustler in my sons eyes
I never knew that money bring so many enemies
Dreams come true they dream of killing me
But its fuck em and I feed em fish
Them killers coming X you off the list
Now Im being followed by some creepyass cracker
Now Im being followed by some creepyass cracker
Stand your ground stand your ground
Stand your ground you gotta stand your ground
You aint gotta hold my hand and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you wont be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got em in the trunk
I wonder why I wonder why
I wonder why sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
Okay theyre having trouble hearing you so take your time 
Creepyass cracka
And then he said 
And hes still following him 
Yes
