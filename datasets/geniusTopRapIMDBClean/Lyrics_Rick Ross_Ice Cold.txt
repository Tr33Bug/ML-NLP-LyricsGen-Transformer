She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big body Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She sheds tears for that dope boy
Shit it is what it is for that dope boy
Handle minor biz for that dope boy
But the reward is major so on and so forth
She can tell you by the Greyhound
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you bout to break down
VS1s all in my bitch watch face now
Straight Gs for your low esteem
APs for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walkin in the shit thatll get you buried
Miamis mine like Im Pat Riley
Baselines shooters nigga act wisely
Get the picture niggas gettin richer now
Livin next to bitches out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah Don King and Sosa
Come to the coca callate la boca
They letting shit slide when my nigga wont
Remember God forgives and them triggers dont
Aw baby its just how it goes
Cant feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you girl
And I keep it on the outside of you girl
And Im reaping just what Ive sewn
My hearts beating but it still stay froze
And youre waiting on the inside for me girl
And youre waiting on the inside
Arms wide open  its worth it 
Arms wide open  but its warm there yeah  ooh
And out there  ooh  its always flowin cold 
Arms wide open  its worth it 
Arms wide open  but its warm there yeah  ooh
And out there its always flowin cold  cold
She fell in love with the lifestyle
Paper tag now her neck all iced out
Lear jets to the fights now
Belagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag 20 grand nigga peep game
South beach makin love on the rooftop
Fuckin to the rhythm got her singin like she Jill Scott
Im just a nigga with a attitude
Earnin revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anythin other than to ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but its never sweet
Swisha burnin at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts dont
Seekin an appeal when the courts wont
Aw baby its just how it goes
Cant feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you girl
And I keep it on the outside of you girl
And Im reaping just what Ive sewn
My hearts beating but it still stay froze
And youre waiting on the inside for me girl
And youre waiting on the inside
Arms wide open  its worth it 
Arms wide open  but its warm there yeah  ooh
And out there  ooh  its always flowin cold 
Arms wide open  its worth it 
Arms wide open  but its warm there yeah  ooh
And out there its always flowin cold  cold
