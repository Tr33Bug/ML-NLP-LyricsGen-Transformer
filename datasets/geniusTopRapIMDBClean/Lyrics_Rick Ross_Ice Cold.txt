Ice Cold Lyrics

Omarion.. Rozay..

She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big body Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She sheds tears for that dope boy
Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy
Handle minor biz for that dope boy
But the reward is major, so on and so forth
She can tell you by the Greyhound
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you 'bout to break down
VS1's all in my bitch watch face now
Straight G's for your low esteem
A.P's for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walkin' in the shit that'll get you buried
Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley
Baselines shooters nigga, act wisely
Get the picture, niggas gettin' richer now
Livin' next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa
Come to the coca, callate la boca
They letting shit slide when my nigga won't
Remember God forgives and them triggers don't
Aw baby, it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I'm reaping just what I've sewn
My heart's beating but it still stay froze
And you're waiting on the inside for me, girl
And you're waiting on the inside
Arms wide open (it's worth it)
Arms wide open (but it's warm there, yeah) ooh
(And out there) ooh (it's always flowin' cold)
Arms wide open (it's worth it)
Arms wide open (but it's warm there, yeah) ooh
(And out there, it's always flowin' cold) cold

She fell in love with the lifestyle
Paper tag now her neck all iced out
Lear jets to the fights now
Belagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game
South beach makin' love on the rooftop
Fuckin' to the rhythm, got her singin' like she Jill Scott
I'm just a nigga with a attitude
Earnin' revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anythin' other than to ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but it's never sweet
Swisha burnin' at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts don't
Seekin' an appeal when the courts won't
You might also like
Aw baby, it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I'm reaping just what I've sewn
My heart's beating but it still stay froze
And you're waiting on the inside for me, girl
And you're waiting on the inside
Arms wide open (it's worth it)
Arms wide open (but it's warm there, yeah) ooh
(And out there) ooh (it's always flowin' cold)
Arms wide open (it's worth it)
Arms wide open (but it's warm there, yeah) ooh
(And out there, it's always flowin' cold) cold4Embed
