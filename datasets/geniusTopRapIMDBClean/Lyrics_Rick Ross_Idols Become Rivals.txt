Maybach Music 
Black Metaphor 
Damn I grew up on that Cash Money
Bling bling was well known to flash money
Hit the liquor store after my Vic authority
Quick to switch a bitch up pick up me a thicker shorty
Pistol on me nigga aint no pickin on me
We veterans so its better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin money thats just a conversation
Its so hard stayin rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama whisper Assalmu alaykum
Live for the moment die for the streets
Bible on the dash kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like was it all a dream
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them cars
I used to look up to you nigga
Ugh


Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
Ima bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of cars let the bitches tag along
This little thing of ours not the ones to tattle on
Omerta the code Met Ball parties with Vogue
Still blowin thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
Thats when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips bad blood that shitll sink ships
Fast money comin slow you better think quick
Rap game so much fuck shit done
Thats why this 45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard I went and got a Wraith boy
Catholic record labels niggas gettin raped boy
Birdmans a priest moans in his synagogue
Publishin is a sin repent forgive me Lord
Shots fired home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators who the bomb now
Look you in your eyes nigga fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Freshll get to see the light
Damn Stunna
I loved you nigga
Hate it came to this
Maybach Music 
You stole them boys pub and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it which is more poison
I handed over records never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment Im talkin all along
All Miami issues Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper J Prince and every Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga chinchilla really aint no penny pinchin
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home take that boy a three piece
Shootin dope usin coke movin like you the Folks
Sacrificin half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so Im part to blame
Last request can all producers please get paid
Cant believe this shit homie
I still love you nigga
How the fuck nigga you touch half a billion nigga
And your team starvin nigga
You on an island nigga you came to my city nigga
I let you in my city nigga
And what hurt me the most nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled nigga
Khaled was loyal to you nigga
The pain I seen in my brothers eye nigga
FaceTimin my nigga nigga he took that to the chin nigga
Thats why my nigga blessed
Thats why my nigga Khaled blessed
You put my nigga in the hole homie
I dont feel you for that my nigga
That shit hurt me you underdig Umm
Its painful what you see real niggas do
When they get the paper when they get the bag
You cant never forget bout lil bruh and them
Ill never forget bout lil bruh and them
Lil bruh and them always remember
Lil bruh and them this for lil bruh and them
Stunna
