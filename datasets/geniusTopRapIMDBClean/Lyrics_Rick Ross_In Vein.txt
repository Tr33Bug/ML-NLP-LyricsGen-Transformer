I dont got a single sober vein in my body
I dont got a single sober vein in my body
Dont apologize I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin crazy
And doin shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me and take it off for me
Its a good vibe good vibe good vibe
Dont you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream I said I dont sell it
But she can rent it for a night I dont mind open wide
Cause all this fame I earned it I might as well use it
Private elevator goin straight to my unit
All my niggas round me gettin kickback pussy
All my killas round me all be hiding in Stussy
Cant nobody stop me used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin wild gettin faded in the bathroom
It makes me smile it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain sweat and tears just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now can nobody stop me
I dont got a single sober vein in my body
Fuck her like a thug nigga young nigga new Ferrari
Old money I just fraid the Lord with us
Condo blow money like its all dope money
Come short wet niggas like a speed boat coming oh Lord
Mo money mo money these rich young niggas aint ever know money
Belaire running down the Rollie on her arm
Pinky ring sixhundred what you know about it
Im the champ baby Real Deal Holyfield
Got the bitches want it dirty went and bought the crib
25 mil Im doing 25tolife
100 acres keep my shooters all through the night
Every chandelier ran a nigga onemil
20 chandeliers motherfucker who real
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Birkin now she in the Bentley
Thats when she went and tatted double M G
Now our bond deep deeper than the rap
She give me brain she a mastermind to be exact
She a mastermind to be exact
I give her game and she give it back
Sip syrup so I fuck slow sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind till your eyes close
Stay strapped till the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dawgs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off
What make it worse he get an elbows
25tolife dead wrong on the cell phone


It makes me smile it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain sweat and tears just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now can nobody stop me
I dont got a single sober vein in my body
