This not a mind game
But we can play them too
Still running the streets cause I wanted to eat
Cause I wanted to eat cause I wanted to eat
But she who I wanted to see
Who I wanted to see who I wanted with me
Me against the world me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl me and my baby girl
Double R me and you taking over the world
Taking over the world taking over the world
Going hard was a given the chance I wasnt given
Til I pulled right beside her she was sitting in the Civic
Man you was just who I was looking for
Top down you could never overlook a boy
Big buckets magnum bottles of that rose
On my R Kelly girl Im bout that foreplay
Slow it down speed it up Im just being me
Panamera heres the keys thats just the G in me
Got a crib on the water need a bathing suit
Bond that we share so unbreakable
Heres a toast to the baddest chick in the room
This is not a mind game but we could play them too
You dont have to play mind games
Just tell me whats yours is mine
Even when youre far away
You come back to me every time
Its just me and my babe at the end of the day
We aint gotta play no mind games
Mine games
Allblack double R me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl me and my baby girl
You know Im on the grind so I miss you at times
All on my mind as Im scribbling lines
I put the weed out cause it play with my head
Turning money down we just laying in bed
She blowing money wild bundles of bread
Times are priceless it can go to your head
I think my mind blown I barely feel my feet
Imma hold my head high even in defeat
Its not a mind game so dont even think
Even if it was itd be over fore you blinked


You dont have to play mind games
Just tell me whats yours is mine
Even when youre far away
You come back to me every time
Its just me and my babe at the end of the day
We aint gotta play no mind games
Mine games
The sky is the limit
Lets take over the world and everything in it
Me and my baby gonna ride to the finish down from beginning
Ooh what a feeling ooh what a feeling
Me against the world me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl me and my baby girl
Double R me and you taking over the world
Taking over the world taking over the world
You dont have to play mind games
Just tell me whats yours is mine
Even when youre far away
You come back to me every time
Its just me and my babe at the end of the day
We aint gotta play no mind games
Mine games
You dont have to play mine games
Just tell me whats yours is mine
Me against the world me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl me and my baby girl
Double R me and you taking over the world
Taking over the world taking over the world
