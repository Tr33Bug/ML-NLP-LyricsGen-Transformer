Mine Games Lyrics
This not a mind game
But we can play them, too
Still running the streets, cause I wanted to eat
Cause I wanted to eat, cause I wanted to eat
But she who I wanted to see
Who I wanted to see, who I wanted with me

Me against the world, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
Double R, me and you, taking over the world
Taking over the world, taking over the world
Going hard was a given; the chance I wasn't given
Til I pulled right beside her, she was sitting in the Civic
Man, you was just who I was looking for
Top down, you could never overlook a boy
Big buckets, magnum bottles of that rose
On my R. Kelly, girl I'm bout that foreplay
Slow it down, speed it up, I'm just being me
Panamera here's the keys, thats just the G in me
Got a crib on the water, need a bathing suit
Bond that we share so unbreakable
Here's a toast to the baddest chick in the room
This is not a mind game, but we could play them, too

You don't have to play mind games
Just tell me what's yours is mine
Even when you're far away
You come back to me every time
It's just me and my babe at the end of the day
We ain't gotta play no mind games
Mine games

All-black double R, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
You know I'm on the grind so I miss you at times
All on my mind as I'm scribbling lines
I put the weed out, cause it play with my head
Turning money down, we just laying in bed
She blowing money wild, bundles of bread
Times are priceless, it can go to your head
I think my mind blown, I barely feel my feet
I'mma hold my head high even in defeat
It's not a mind game so don't even think
Even if it was, it'd be over 'fore you blinked
You might also like
You don't have to play mind games
Just tell me what's yours is mine
Even when you're far away
You come back to me every time
It's just me and my babe at the end of the day
We ain't gotta play no mind games
Mine games

The sky is the limit
Let's take over the world and everything in it
Me and my baby gonna ride to the finish, down from beginning
Ooh what a feeling, ooh what a feeling

Me against the world, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
Double R, me and you, taking over the world
Taking over the world, taking over the world

You don't have to play mind games
Just tell me what's yours is mine
Even when you're far away
You come back to me every time
It's just me and my babe at the end of the day
We ain't gotta play no mind games
Mine games
You don't have to play mine games
Just tell me what's yours is mine

Me against the world, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
Double R, me and you, taking over the world
Taking over the world, taking over the world3Embed
