Kilo in the kitchen pussy niggas Merry Christmas
Bitches taking pictures cause we keep on getting richer
Say a nigga name you know you fucking with them killers
Walking through the club only salute the real niggas
Aint no bottles on your table pussy boy go get your gwolla
Hoes dont credit pussy so you cant pay her tomorrow
Bitch just bought a house she cant afford to run her mouth
I run all these fields I run the game not just the South
Bow down to the biggest Belaire I be spilling
Counting all this paper no games with these pussy niggas
Double M we poppin shoppin buying new clothes

Niggas go for self when they caught up in the fame
Run back to a nigga when them shots get to sprayin

Success another gamble bitch I took a chance
Jumped straight off the porch jumped right in the kitchen
Then I got a Porsche my bitch wanted a Bentley
