You wanted to fuckin walk around these roaches These niggas is roaches These niggas is mere motherfuckin mortals Im tryna push you to supreme bein You dont wanna motherfuckin You dont wanna embrace your destiny you wanna get by
You dont wanna go into the motherfuckin dark where its lonely You cant handle the motherfuckin the pain of the motherfuckin not knowin when the shit is gonna stop
Mommas tryna save me but she dont know Im tryna save her
Man them niggas tried to play me man til I got this paper
Youre nobody til somebody kills you
Blast for me  the last words from my nigga
On the pavement born killers body shivers
Drug money dollar figures
Hustlers movin out of rentals art of war is mental
Havin sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier nowhere to go to
So its bang no survivors
Only riders on my rider murder rate rises
Stalkin niggas on their IGs never I be
Still solo Under Armour still Polo
No wire on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar a shooter
Gettin high feelin like its vodou
Nine lives SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the Rari still BI double G I E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways double up crime pays
Mommas tryna save me but she dont know Im tryna save her
Man them niggas tried to play me man til I got this paper
Youre nobody til somebody kills you


You fuckin wanna walk around with these niggas What the fuck is their culture Where the fuck is their souls at What defines you These niggas with these fuckin silly looks on their faces You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God nigga Make up your goddamn mind
Im from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The byproduct you walk up on me I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin penetrates the steel doors gang signs see em all
I said my prayer as Im countin sheep
Never really athletic but I play for keeps do you feel me
The mortician the morgue fillin with more snitches
We kill em and takin their bitches RIP
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when Im feelin like you wanna know what winners like
And Im never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas the PJs for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less keep it real homie made me filthy
Touch mine until its even kill
Like Im knowin every heathen will closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off how my nigga net worths
Mommas tryna save me but she dont know Im tryna save her
Man them niggas tried to play me man til I got this paper
Youre nobody til somebody kills you
Fuck yall wanna talk about fuckin jewelries and Bentleys and Hublots and fuckin art that niggas aint got on their fuckin walls and fuckin mansions niggas aint got Niggas cant even pay the IRS let alone their fuckin staff nigga You gotta tell the truth man The truthll set you free son the truth will set you free
