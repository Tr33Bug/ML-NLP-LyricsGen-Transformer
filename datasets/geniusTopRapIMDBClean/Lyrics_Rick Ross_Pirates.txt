I guess there aint no nice way to tell you niggas its game over huh
Pray for me
Hallucination of money while niggas stomach just rumble
Had to fuck with the Haitians and break a kilo to crumbles
Nigga livin in rubble but then Im labelled a rebel
Any nigga wan rumble somebody hand me a shovel
Gotta silence the lambs get on my Buffalo Bill
Steppin off the Sonoma with the black duffle bag filled
Got a cute bitch with me favor Kimora for real
Got Meek Mill on the celly  Meek Milli  that nigga worth a few mil
I multiply what I manage I manage to multiply
Witness real niggas fail and watch you fuck niggas strive
Witness bitch niggas tell Jabar just got twentyfive
At this point in my life Im just tryna survive
Homicide stay on my mind Christopher Wallace of my time
RIP to the legend 2Pac Shakur with a nine
Makaveli returns its God forgives and I dont
Resurrection of the real time to get richer than Trump
Im rollin the dice four five six
Young nigga nineteen four or five bricks
Prayin on you niggas sinners full of hate
God forgives and I dont only hustlers relate
Tryna keep my head above water nigga
We pirates out here nigga just trying to stay afloat
And I ride for my niggas
Fascination with fortune afford me mansion and Porsches
Panameras abortion marijuana imported
Dreams of gettin cream and never to be extorted
Seen so many things be preposterous not to record it
Product is in demand profit not far behind
Got on my mother pearl she fuckin up father time
Babies be havin babies Im talkin bout how I grind
Niggas thinkin its voodoo the way bricks be multiplyin
Affiliated with wealth associated with death
Selfmade millionaire snatch a triple beam off the shelf
Straight Grim Reaper Air Jordans walkin the streets
Blackberry boss one call ya put to sleep
Im rollin the dice four five six
Young nigga nineteen forty five bricks
Prayin on you niggas sinners full of hate
God forgives and I dont only hustlers relate


The Lord is my light and my salvation
But I see none of you fuck niggas
Fuck what you heard nigga
I need to feel it
I need to smell it
I need to see it
