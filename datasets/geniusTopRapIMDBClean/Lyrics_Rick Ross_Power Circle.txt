If Michael Jackson came alive right now
Hed ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb coming up short
Think youre Dee Brown jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math Im a motherfucking G nigga
Its all on me now as you can see now
Im gon get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin on you fucks a long time time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse startin to see now
Im at the round table where your seat at
Where your plate where your lobster where your sea bass
We aint never left acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle thatll murk you blackout short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and aint no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck em they know already but fuck em
Tell em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You dont know nann nigga nope uh uh
This famous thatll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
Imma earn til the last court adjourn
Til the last gavel drop we gon have it locked
We gon have it locked
We gon have it locked


Im part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
Its funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they aint want nothing from me
My futures so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldnt be here
Power to the people so the people shouldnt live in fear
And Ill be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to no one there
Not even a voice not even an ear
No one alive no one to care
Now I got a power circle now Im on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I aint gave a coward shit
Stone me throw me a pile of shit but you wont pull me out of it
Its funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And whats life without grind
Those niggas yo niggas
Hope those niggas real as mine
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And whats life without grind
Those niggas yo niggas
Hope those niggas real as mine
Theres a difference between underrated and hasnt made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
Theres no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
Theres enemies envy with green my niggas  lawnmower
And Im on tour Jordan 4s Tom Ford
And I aint thugging they clapping at me a encore
Got a dark heart bright mind make women crazy
I give her D I throw up two I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment aint entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate Im out my cabeza
Jealousys for the weak you aint happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon blitz us but aint no way that they gon hit us
Im so elusive so my niggas be goin through it
Guess its a wrap when your codefendant make soul music
Cash rule the world  at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real then they real  my niggas deserve it
And we dont deal with weak squares in this power circle
We dont deal with weak squares in this power circle
Im like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas thatll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking lotta Tweeting til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog I kill your dog we tied even Id believe it
If you see it then you got it nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin you gon be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell em hard for the low and give em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say Im the hottest and a nigga still modest
Im just being honest
Back to the wall never let em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona I dreamed it woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas I eat em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table power circle a mafia
Just talkin money talkin money what you talkin bout
Probably talkin bout us we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You wont last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon dont compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
Im a diamond inside the rough thats too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone put you pussy niggas through hell
Hells fire I never lie you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord this cant be life no it cant be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
Its good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb so eventually Im
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it aint business I get offended I mind
Now one fake Im a realist in strive Im a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy well hurt you
Life in the power circle
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on am I right
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
Its too late now
Double MG
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down nigga
Ugh
