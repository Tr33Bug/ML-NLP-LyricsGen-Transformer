Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on am I right  Oh oh whoa 
On the way we shed some tears every day we sacrifice
So we can be standing here oh what a hell of a life
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever oh oh oh ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever and ever and ever
I remember bein blind to it
Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner made up my mind do it
Def Jam on my heels should I sign to it
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day Im hustlin on every corner boomin
Back of the Phantom couldnt fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto I follow Gods orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr Roberts when Im in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it but barely niggas fade
White sheet yellow tape where your dawgs at
Count a million cash can you blog that
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch now you wanna know the name of it
Never playin so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier Hublot I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cause it aint buzzin
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Cant talk snow where the soft at
Your man got murked but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie rose gold cost 40
Platinum 21 its time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once Im screamin YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast ballin with my nigga TI
Croc no glass smilin women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives takin pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a Dboy craves
Rich forever in my Dboy ways
So dope blue jeans new Js
Sold dope by any means all day


Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever
Huh A hundred mil aint enough
Got a hundred women gotta deal with it love
Worth forty Ms is he still dealin drugs
Cigarette speedboats but hes still with the thugs
Club LIV Louis shots on a Sunday
Grindin even be legit one day
Order some more bottles because Im on one
I know her pussy wet and she wanna cum
She wanna cum maybe come over
Stop dealin with them niggas you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
Cause you know a nigga rich forever
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now its very clear that we gon be rich forever
And ever and ever ohoh ohoh
We gon be rich forever
On the way we shed some tears  Oh oh oh 
Every day we sacrifice
Ohoh ohoh we gon be rich forever
