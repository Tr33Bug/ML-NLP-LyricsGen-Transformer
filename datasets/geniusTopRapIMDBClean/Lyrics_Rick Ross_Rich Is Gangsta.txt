Yall niggas know what this is
If you dont know
Im finna break it down
I just upped my stock fuck them cops
If you love hiphop bust them shots
Your man is priceless if your mans loyal
Better give that man a raise or end up paying for it
If you cut it call it Jam Master Jay
No Adidas but I rock a brick a day
Talk about the jewels outta nigga reach
Nigga please so I came back with a bigger piece
You still smokin weed on your car chase
Im pullin off the car lot screaming Gods great
Before the crib you gotta clear the guards gate
Elevators like Franks on Scarface
New Presidential had that pav
Like a G I gave the Cartier to Wale
Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover
Told Warner Brothers that the games over
For me to move forward from here on I need 50
I aint talking 50 Cent neither nigga haha
I came back a rich nigga
Young mogul Bo Jackson Im a switch hitter
They want me face down on the pavement
Gang members claimin I need to make a payment
Its hard for a young black executive
Cant you see were all fucking relatives
Relatively easy we can go to war
Fuck it we can go to war
Chasing me a hundred million thats inshallah
Fresh up out the Feds system welcome home Jabar
I watch him pray five times a day nigga
Same one that used to moved the yay nigga
AKs in his heyday nigga
Benz coupe wood frames low fade nigga
Got the cubans got the boats got the zoes nigga
Cocaine worth much more than gold nigga
So whats your goals nigga
All my shit went gold nigga
I remember smokin mid grade
Til I went and got my shit straight
Im spittin like this bitch a mixtape
Til they seen a Ghost with a temp plate
Sittin in the trap blowing thick smoke
Trafficking my dope with a thick ho
Feds tore apart the squad nigga
Thats why I had to play the part nigga
That wasnt me it was a job nigga
It gets deeper that was just a start nigga
Screamin in my sleep I know Lord hear me
Death to you fuckboys on my 4th Bentley


Gangsta nigga
Rich is gangsta nigga
This is gangsta nigga
Yeah rich is gangsta nigga
You know where we came from
Look where we at
