Rich Is Gangsta Lyrics

Y'all niggas know what this is
If you don't know
I'm finna break it down

I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots
Your man is priceless, if your man's loyal
Better give that man a raise or end up paying for it
If you cut it, call it Jam Master Jay
No Adidas but I rock a brick a day
Talk about the jewels outta nigga reach
Nigga please, so I came back with a bigger piece
You still smokin' weed on your car chase
I'm pullin' off the car lot screaming: "God’s great!"
Before the crib you gotta clear the guard's gate
Elevators like Frank's on Scarface
New Presidential had that pavé
Like a G, I gave the Cartier to Wale
Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover
Told Warner Brothers that the game's over
For me to move forward from here on I need 50
I ain't talking 50 Cent neither nigga, haha

I came back a rich nigga
Young mogul, Bo Jackson, I'm a switch hitter
They want me face down on the pavement
Gang members claimin' I need to make a payment
It's hard for a young black executive
Can't you see we're all fucking relatives
Relatively easy we can go to war
Fuck it, we can go to war
Chasing me a hundred million, that's inshallah
Fresh up out the Feds system, welcome home Jabar
I watch him pray five times a day, nigga
Same one that used to moved the yay' nigga
AK's in his heyday, nigga
Benz coupe, wood frames, low fade, nigga
Got the cubans, got the boats, got the zoes, nigga
Cocaine worth much more than gold, nigga
So what's your goals, nigga?
All my shit went gold, nigga

I remember smokin' mid grade
'Til I went and got my shit straight
I'm spittin' like this bitch a mixtape
'Til they seen a Ghost with a temp plate
Sittin' in the trap blowing thick smoke
Trafficking my dope, with a thick ho
Feds tore apart the squad, nigga
That's why I had to play the part, nigga
That wasn't me, it was a job, nigga
It gets deeper, that was just a start, nigga
Screamin' in my sleep, I know Lord hear me
Death to you fuckboys, on my 4th Bentley
