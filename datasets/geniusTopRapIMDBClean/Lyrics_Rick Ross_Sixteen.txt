JUSTICE League
Huh This is special
Extremely special
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
Its funny because its been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat a dope idea
Sixteen bars aint enough
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a sixteenbar verse
You know so many different levels to living your life and
Depicting with your wordplay
Exactly what life means to you and sixteen aint enough
I know yall gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one huh
Its funny how things change funny how time fly
More than my feet travel the more that I feel fly
More that I make now the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash
Smooth as John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger the women just getting badder
All I see is the money cream Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one sixteen aint enough
Talking that fast money fifteen every month
When your people labelled poor that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now its box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis steaming my marijuana
Double M Gs double M fees
We in every hood nigga government cheese
Yacht to Yachtmasters Ol Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat paper that Im stackin
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll give and go fuck a fade away
Living like Scottie Pippen dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble now Im flowing a river
She say my heart cold Im naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys  damn what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke had to use a niggas instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the sixteen
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating Im just watching on the big screen
Three Stacks on the beat and the kicks mean
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
You know how sometimes you got so much to say but
They on they only give you sixteen Hehehe
Man its like I mean I got so much to say
The world has said so much to me
And I just wanna give right back to em
But I only get sixteen thats like a cage you know
I really cant say what I wanna say you know
Its just a glimpse thats all
Just one uh one little single glimpse just a page
But I guess Im defeating the purpose of doing all this talking
Aight
Summer 88 or was it 89
Or was it wintertime Aw never mind
Im in my room booming
Drawin LL Cool J album covers with Crayolas on construction paper
Im tryna fuck my neighbor Im tryna hook my waves up
Im tryna pull my grades up to get them saddle lace ups
Before lil Marc was Jacob before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up before wed tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up before my crumbs would cake up
Before they tell me they love me and well never break up
Before the time she makes love to someone that I thought was my homeboy
But boy was I wrong now
I dont budge dont want much just a roof and a porch
And a Porsche and a horse and unfortunately but of course
An assortment of torches that scorches the skin
When they enter intruders whose tutors did
A lousy job hows he God if he lets Lucifer let loose on us
That noose on us wont loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they dont let us win I cant pretend
But I do admit it feel good when the hood pseudocelebrate
Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it
Like we know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name em hinthintit aint um Welchs
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Yall cant measure my worth
But when you try youll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when backs against the wall
I feel right at home yall sitting right at home
All Kellygreen with envy while Im jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child looks up at mama and smile
With such a devilish grin like Where the hell have you been
Shes yelling Sellings a sin well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin if you dont offer new ways to win
A dolphin gon shake his fin regardless if he gets in
Or out of water most important thing for him is to swim
And Flipper didnt hold his nose so why shall I hold my tongue
I miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm
And not set off these alarms when cameras snapsnapsnap
Return fire pappappap pap pappap pap pap
Theyll learn why mere privacy so essential
They wont make no laws I break their laws til they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all I hate them all dont like em dont pretend to
Yeah something tells me we aint in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool aint cool anymore
All them women we were pursuing now they want more
And they deserve it all dont settle for what aint yours
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh  Lord  yeah  Oh Lord 
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah
When sixteen aint enough
When sixteen aint enough
Ooh yeah  When sixteen aint enough 
Aw yeaheaheaheaheaheaheah  When sixteen aint enough 
Breakdown breakdown
Does your mama know you see me Does she know youre freaky
Does she ever wonder if its bout ya I am speaking
Do you ever ponder where Im at when you get sleepy
How the hell Im gonna tell the youth dont be me Yeah
Hahahahah hahahah I love it
Does your daddy think you perfect Does he know for certain
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains
Do he think Im 2Pac cause Im Black and put the words in
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman Yeah
Hahahah its funny because we couldve shortchanged you  Huh 
But because we love you we go that extra mile
Break it down for em Andr huh
Next level amazing
