What is this  MayMayMay 
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music hahahaha
Shes just perfect in every kinda way
But I dont think I can handle her pain
So messed up and Im too busy just runnin my game
Oh girl after girl mistake after mistake
Ive tried to change but they always around pullin me down in bed  MayMayMay 
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises  boom 
Broken condoms lipstick marks and unprotected sex  uh 
I feel like shit you know I aint shit
Sorry wont turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldnt believe it so I used you
Im sorry oh Im sorry dont make it right I know
We at the crib she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation she lick every tattoo thats on my face
Like a thug I just wanna fuck thats every day
Temporary separations confessin my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and Im still hurt
You new pussy but she cant tell me that its real first
A lot of lies apologized the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin to herself Damn this verse real
Rehab out in Vegas that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the gram they trendin Meech home
In the D and my G he throwin that PStone
Every picture that you post we comments on each one
Im just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I cant change the rules
All this time I blamed you cause I know what Im doing
Stepping on your heart again relationship ruined
I tried to change but Im always out fuckin around in the club  MayMay 
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up  uh 
My worst nightmare went right in my back I wish I could wake up  uh 
I feel like shit know I aint shit but Im  MayMayMay 
Sorry wont turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldnt believe it so I used you
Im sorry oh Im sorry dont make it right I know  gotta love it baby uh   MayMayMay 
Lifes short and baby girl you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver  uh 
Sayin Sorry layin up Im way up in your liver  boss 
The red bottoms got you walkin funny  ha 
Get you an agent she ballin and all she talk is money  right 
Take her shoppin baby boy aint no salary caps  uh 
She get it poppin so you better bring battery packs  huh 
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district six figures on my shorty nugget
Ive tried to change but they always around pullin me down in bed  MayMayMay 
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms lipstick marks and unprotected sex
Yeah I feel like shit you know I aint shit
Sorry wont turn back the clock  MayMay 
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldnt believe it so I used you
Im sorry oh Im sorry dont make it right  MayMayMay 
I apologize
Youre not perfect Im not perfect
