Do you know what we are going to do We are going to defend ourselves because Huey P Newton says that Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner Power if we have the ability to define it the only next thing to do is get organized So when a pig walks up to you or when a pig gets to jiving with the people you be so organized you be learning some tactics you be learning some revolutionary principles you be having some guns hid out somewhere you have some proper tactics that when the pig gets to jiving with you the pig is wrong you whip your guns out on him blow him away and then you have made the ability in fact you have made that pig act in a desired manner
Smokin a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No ID on the track let the story begin begin
Hah yeah
Lookin in the mirror but I dont see much
Still runnin the streets so I dont sleep much
Watchin the snakes so they dont creep up
But the way Im gettin this money niggas cant keep up
You niggas cant keep up
Niggas got beef but it cant be much
Im still walkin through the crowds like I cant be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil later might let me fuck
Damn she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didnt even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the mothafucka
No insurance on the mothafucka
Aint life a bitch
But you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody know that Im a lotta peoples threat
Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me Lord will I be dealin dope
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only Lord knows
Goodbye to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me whyyyy
Thought havin everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God Im scarred I have tattoo tears of joy
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated
But dammit a nigga made it
Goddamn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church Lord know Im blessed
Five different lawyers Lord know Im stressed
A punch in the face get you 300K
Ask Vlad now he back to makin minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And Im still swimmin in ice
Im just livin my life
Im just livin my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste
Goodbye to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me whyyyy
Thought havin everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God Im scarred I have tattoo tears of joy
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real
I gotta represent for Emmett Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my Rollie its about that time
White man had a problem with mine
And we suppose to be shy
The revolutions televised
Bobby still on the rise
Goodbye to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me whyyyy
Thought havin everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God Im scarred I have tattoo tears of joy
