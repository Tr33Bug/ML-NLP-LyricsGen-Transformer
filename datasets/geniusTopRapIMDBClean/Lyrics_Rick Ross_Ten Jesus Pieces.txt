God forgives Hes so honorable
But livin amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury
I wake up excited I made it through the night
Things I did in the dark will it ever see the light
My nerves should be a wreck I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect she loves my adlibs
I think Im a genius hundred grand a fuckin feature
I do at least three a week roll up the fuckin reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains no luggage Im a big timer
Niggas claim that they thuggin when they dickridin
My niggas rather walk do they own brick climbin
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows in my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doin wrong
My homie in the cell so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Askin for a hundred mill as I pray to God
I do this for my niggas facin hard times
Cant be on them corners if you hustlin part time
Ten chains on Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows comin from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G ten Jesus pieces
Young nigga comin up they wanna gun you down
Drinkin vodka in the memory of my nigga damn  I miss you PNut 
Ridin real slow on them all golds  we had them nigga 
Shoppin for them Os when the mall close
Reppin for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on  Real shit 
All black tees ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowin on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like  right 
Forty dollar tab meanin forty grand
Lil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holdin on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on smokin in the motherland


I do this for my niggas facin hard times
Cant be on them corners if you hustlin part time
Ten chains on Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows comin from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G ten Jesus pieces
Im his poltergeist niggas know Im more than nice
All these jewels on all Moissanites
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster
Black card maxed out damn black brother
White collar black market
Chrome Smith and Wesson back pocket
Eight shot bitch Im a top shotta
Screamin your affiliations but that dont matter
Im flyin first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfuckin killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
Its really sad just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple white tee new sneakers
Dope boy style ten Jesus pieces
I do this for my niggas facin hard times
Cant be on them corners if you hustlin part time
Ten chains on Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows comin from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G ten Jesus pieces
Versace shirt Jesus layin on the chest
Man I swear Big did it the best I mean
Nas did it fresh Jay did it fresh I mean
Ye did it fresh but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now Im stuntin on these niggas cause I couldnt back then
Rose gold yellow gold a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once I aint tryna match them
I remember bumpin Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scrapin up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and Im danglin chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I buy em
And they say because Im Muslim I shouldnt think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
Its better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now Imma wear these ten chains and floss
I do this for my niggas facin hard times
Cant be on them corners if you hustlin part time
Ten chains on Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows comin from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G ten Jesus pieces
We untouchable
Xolaal sama guys dundu ben yoon la
