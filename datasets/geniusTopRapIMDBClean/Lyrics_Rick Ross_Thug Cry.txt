JUSTICE League
I just wanna be the one I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when youre down
I just wanna I just wanna fly Ima show you tonight
That Ima put it on you baby take you past the sky
Uh wake up in the world and Im just another nigga
Call it public housin when you next door to the killers
On them corners it gets better as you go
Grind that motherfucker til its yellow brick road
Free as a bird spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin niggas shootin in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard where the fuck to go next
Go against the odds youngin go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but Im close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre nigga throwin up Thizz
I just wanna be the one I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when youre down
I just wanna I just wanna fly Ima show you tonight
That Ima put it on you baby take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
Uhh well let me light one for my problems
Smokin on that loud pumpin up that volume
Get it crackin like an eggshell in this motherfucker make omelets
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They dont know what I been through
Dont know what Im goin through
As long as I get through thats what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch but still I cant afford to
Let these niggas play with me need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that MAC9
Yeah I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds I really feel like a giant
Cant trust none of these niggas I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas still got dirt under my fingers
That aint a threat thats a bet
Cause they comin at my neck like the best a man can get
But to make a long story short I need a shoulder
Cause the devil on one the other one Im lookin over
Tunechi


I just wanna be the one I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when youre down
I just wanna I just wanna fly Ima show you tonight
That Ima put it on you baby take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
Uh I pray I live forever
Niggas hatin like its Salt Lake City
No tints on that pretty ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments dont offend me
Cause your baby momma so friendly
I proceed with the plan weed in my hand
Croc in my cup quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches first nigga with a Wraith
Double M we handle business cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape its well orchestrated
200 acres estates a young nigga made it
Came from the hood aint nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my motherfuckin wings
I just wanna be the one I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when youre down
I just wanna I just wanna fly Ima show you tonight
That Ima put it on you baby take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
Huh Mastermind
As I get high in the middle of the night
