Trap Trap Trap Lyrics
Beep, beep
I'm sittin' at the red light
My ankle monitor beepin'
Hadn't been charged (fuck that)
I think I see the people (let's bounce, man)
Mmm, bounce (Maybach Music)

I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Brown bag legend 'cause it's all cash
Brown bag legend when it's all cash
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
First one on the block, woah, I need mine off the top, uh
Overtown, he got shot, but he died in Opa-locka
Couldn't save one lung, hit 'em up, Lum Lum
See the look on my face (woo!) like Carol City won state
Niggas hate on my sound, 'til I went the first round
Then I earnt the Lombardi, ain't no fuckboys allowed
Only fuck if she exclusive, her favorite rapper Lil Boosie
To tell the truth I didn't ask, when it come to bitches I'm Gucci
I'm the wrong one to rob, in the jungle I'm Nas
In the label I'm Russ, in the trap I'm Rick Ross
Double M, Goldman Sachs, just like Omar and Khloe
You came down for the packs, I sent you right back loaded

I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
Roof off at the red light
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, sheesh, sheesh
Brown bag legend 'cause it's all cash
Brown bag legend when it's all cash (Stop talking)
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap (Jeffery)
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap (Yeah)

I was tryna bet the whole map
Out in Vegas, out the trap
Niggas talkin' 'bout raidin' the trap
Man, I'm 'bout to go ape in the trap (nigga goin' ape shit)
Nigga, watch your babies in the trap
Nigga cookin' oil base in the trap
Young nigga slave in the trap
Nigga run base, base in the trap
I'm 'bout to get this shit movin', yeah
Answer the door with the Woolie, yeah
Wrist in the water, I need me a boat
I'm 'bout to get this shit cruisin', yeah
Stand at the stove 'til you're woozy, woozy
Let's make a movie, movie, yeah
Move, move, move
Bitch, I'm richer than Tom Cruise, yeah
So many different meds on me
Fuck around, call the Fed on me
Chk-chk, boom boom boom your head, homie, reds
Draco got a lot of lead on it, you dead (yeah, yeah)

I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Brown bag legend 'cause it's all cash
Brown bag legend when it's all cash
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Yeah, Wale though, uh, uh
I ain't nothin' like the trap niggas, Goyard backpack nigga
Uber crates 'til the Feds pull up, woo woo, cataracts, nigga
I'm the type, holla at the wife, her body yours, but her soul is mine
Adios, do 120, all she want is good dick and advice
Wraith, scrappin' my tires, Jameson 'til I'm fried
Famous here but I'm humble, Double M the Empire (M-M-Maybach Music)
Renzel got me all day, I'm Kyrie, he LeBron James
Tired niggas say Folarin ain't top, I been SportsCenter erryday
I ain't nothin' like them trap guys, I mean I kinda do bag dimes
I kinda never do back down, leave a nigga high via rap lines
Get a beat, leave it baptized, mob ties, but it's black lives
Black lives, nigga, trap lives, gimme five on the black side

I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
Roof off at the red light
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
