Its time to take you to the other side
The side you gotta watch your AE cable television for homie
But we live this shit
Im not a star well thats a lie
I seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testified
Spoke on the homicides amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams
A project minded individual criminal tactics
Us black kids born with birth defects we hyperactive
Mentally sexcrazed dysfunctional they describe us
They liars at the end of the day were fuckin survivors
I remember watchin Scarface the first time
Look at that big house that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to my peoples in my mind
They dumb and destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In the bastardized nation Magnum 45 carryin
Where Im from aint far from Washington Heights to cop Aryan
A rookie boy the cookie didnt make no profit
A stranger to the block I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say its garbage
I brought it back to papi aint tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses
He gives me powder he has faith in Nas ambitions to distribute coke
Had addictions to gold chains Mercedes Benz hopes but Im again broke
This shit aint cut for me other dealers they up their orders
Barely at 62s they already up to quarters
They out there every day some true hustlers for you
Im at it half way none of my customers are loyal
Picturin pipin out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy cash to flash diamonds
My junior high school class wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur I got my grades there
Blamin society mad it wasnt made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse and so I was
Throwin rocks at the pen just for the love
Before the evil the secret life of Gs
You seein me blurry triple beam dreams


Pocket full of money parkin lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens and got cameras every angle
Dope been comin so you know the income major
Rule number 1 I cant do business with a stranger
Contract killers comin when I feel endangered
Early 90s reminiscin when I had a pager
Triple beam dreams now Pat Riley my neighbor
Fuck boy talkin out of turn nigga
In the court room spreadin like a germ nigga
25 on the line them niggas droppin dimes
Cooperation got them rednecks droppin time
Khaki suits and some niggas go to actin cute
We was all cool stackin in Acura coupes
More accurately we acted as is if jackin was cool
Snatchin niggas out they shoes then wear jackets to school
Fuck boy you caught up in my dream
Countin cream on the cover of a magazine
Im the source got the plug with the uncut
JayZ Blue Magic nigga what what
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as Im gettin high
Triple beam dreamin as the cream multiples
Fuck boy talkin out of turn nigga
Fore you sell dope its shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions duct tape
Fornicatin countin money with a fuck face
Fuckin bitches that be givin up your whereabouts
Slow leaks gotta air em out
Kill em all Rolls Royce Ghost nigga ball
Phantom drop head shit I had to get em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on the plate fuck em all I could send my dog
Triple beam dreams the ghettos my reality
Im from where your hustle determines your salary
Six figure family member nigga forget about it
Low income housin nigga tryna get up out it
I got a plan little nigga just believe in me
Triple beam dreamin with this thing in me
Pocket full of money parkin lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens and got cameras every angle
Dope been comin so you know the income major
Rule number 1 I cant do business with a stranger
Contract killers comin when I feel endangered
Early 90s reminiscin when I had a pager
Triple beam dreams now Pat Riley my neighbor
