Us Lyrics
Young Chop on the beat
BandKamp
OVO, MMG, GBE
You already know
Aww, yeah

At the top, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE, we don't fuck with niggas
At the top, where you see us, nigga
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas
Michael Jackson got them fiends just like Thrilla
Two-door Maybach clean, smoking on killa
You a stranger talking and I don’t feel it
If I don’t know your momma, I'mma make him feel it
Heavy Armor-All, you know I wanna shine
Bitch, I need it all, each and every dime
Photos taken, four-door Maybach, I know you hating
Staying with women from Staten Island, my flows so flagrant
We the realest, pistol concealed, my percentage
Higher than yours, Cash Money, I see no limits
Port of Miami, then I drop Trilla
Ex-dope dealer worth eight figures

At the top, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE, we don't fuck with niggas
At the top, where you see us, nigga
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas

Just got back from Turks and Caicos, hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filler
New deal on the table, look like 'bout like ten milla
Shout my lawyer, man, he a contract killer
You know 305, Ricky, that's my fucking nigga
Did this shit right here for Baka, Preme, Styles, and Gilla
Did this shit right here for Reese, Sosa, Fredo, Durk
You let Drizzy get a verse, you gon' get this work
Yeah, at the top it's just us, nigga
Yeah, that's why I don't really trust niggas
See, my family and the money is a must, nigga
All the fame and all the pussy's just a plus, nigga
Yeah

At the top, where you see us, nigga
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas

Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas
A small circle with no new niggas
Cause I don't really trust niggas
GBE, it's just us nigga
And she just wanna fuck with us
So much kush, keep me stuck, nigga
In other words, high as fuck, nigga
Life's a movie, I'm a priceless picture
Four hundred for the belt, nigga
Right or wrong, you get left, nigga
For that bag, you get left, nigga
For my niggas, you get left, nigga

At the top, it's just us, nigga

I love this beat, aw man, I'm finna go bad
I pay for pussy, aw man, she gotta be bad
She fuck with me, that bitch know I'm 'bout to buy them bags
Beef with me, fuck boy, 'bout to go out back
I woke up counting money, make confetti fall
Type of money, she fuck me, she gotta fuck us all
Them other boys well known for letting niggas starve
We eating good, not my fault, it's Wingstop's
My new home look like it's Al Capone
My new bitch look like she in them folds
My new watch look like I had it stole
Barry Weiss told me I'm gold, God forgives, I don't
Me and Drizzy like The Beatles, nigga
Same ones hating, wouldn't wanna be them niggas
We let 'em stare, but we don't see them niggas
We don't see them niggas

At the top, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
OTF, it's just us, nigga
But I don't really trust niggas
GBE, we don't fuck with niggas
At the top, where you see us, nigga
Since a youngin, bitch, we been them niggas
