Beats Keep Callin  Freestyle  Lyrics
Whatever whatever whatever
Mr Porter dont trust you Im gon bust you nigga
That thang pop pop pop
Whatever whatever whatever
If Young Metro dont trust you Im gon shoot you 
Whatever whatever
This that your careers over flow for real
This aint fourwheelin roll with coke heroin caine
Bone chilling cold with no feelings
Bangin dopedealinHov and NoCeilings Wayne
Started out like Nas shoot gun
Heavy is the head with the crown
Slaughterhouse my minds two tons
Hardest out like John Qs son
And everything you say greasy
And made up like a piece of cheesesteak
And everything I say come natural
In this thing of beauty like Alicia Keys face
How can I be hated in the streets
When Im on even on my off day
Im creative when its beef while you throw salt
Im your baby mama and them new salt bae
Ill assault they a la carte tray
Molotov through your restaurant window
Mr Hyde Dr Jekyll Nickel Nine Ricky Grimes
Im Sylvester Mindbender
I spark fours thatll arch floors
Thatll have whoever acting hardcore
Doing parkour Ima dog Porter
Brought the dog for recording harsh thoughts for the art form
Taking me to your leader is like
Showing Chuck Norris where a glass door is
While Im just tryna stay outta jail
Last war I stay strapped for it
Yall can run while the gats blowing
And if I miss your ass then I guess
You saved by the bell like Zack Morris
Im on bando time when I ride through cities
Before my time RIP Bobby Krissy
Or Bobby Whitney flow KCi JoJo
Let the Tech N9ne go KC MO bro
I dont stand my ground I just demolish niggas
Simple you against me you aint ridin with me
Bitch not only do I kiss and tell
Im Orlando Brown when I describe them titties
Im the rubberband man but I do more than count bands
Fuck sipping 40 ounces Im sober out here
Fucking hoes like 40ounce Van
Nigga Im Pusha T doing quiet numbers
Getting silent money Ill retire from it
I dont dress loud I throw the flyness on it
Let the labels talk and Desiigner mumble like Donald Trump
Throwing money hitting everybody and they auntie up
Trying to find someone to come perform for me fore I fuck the whole entire country up
Im the first one gunnin last one runnin
Too enlightened for a check
Any rapper that want it Im Wack 100
Invite em to a scrap
I narrow down shit the Farrakhan way
You can find me anywhere the crime wave
Im Schwarzenegger you Sarah Conner
And your favorite rapper act like Eric Andre
Ryans still alive played nice cause the drama still flies
Even when you shoot your little Uzi vertical in broad day
Like you still tryna kill God
Im French kissing with a bitch you mentality
Voodoo and como talle vous
While Im hula hoopin dollars for that snarly tooth
My future look like juju in a body suit
When you niggas gon admit it
That Im better than the youngins
That Im better than the legends
Never did I dumb it down or did I settle
Im Rick the Ruler in every different measure
I aint just the R Im every different letter
I can give your chick eleven inches if she let me get the leverage
I can be president if hiphop would just let me switch endeavors
And Im just having an open workout in Heaven
Tryna get me a good sweat
Im Jae Millz looking up at the sky like Ayo BIG am I good yet
When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin ya
They keep callin ya
They keep callin ya
When its hard to understand me cause my jaws keeps lockin
My parents keep callin the Lord keeps watchin
Im standing on the corner with my boys beat boxin
And anywhere I go all of these whores be jockin
The dogs keep barkin at the top dog
They already lost it nigga its a lost cause
I remember when I had to pawn all my jewelry
Was so embarrassed by the help that no one offered to me
Zoning off the bottle we only taught to fight back
We only talk survival walking home we just might scrap
All we did was write raps tryna get so drunk
Had to get my sight back product of the old gun
Made some bad decisions so early on in the process
I had people out to get me my album wasnt even out yet
Im talking bout the selfproclaimed King of Detroit
I seen some people reaching they dreams some people destroy it
I seen people die at the hands of the violence of men
Seen people shot out the sky being fly as they can
Seen em split the pie up and Pam sniff her entire two grams
Slipping now we in your crib to tie up your fam
Cause its hard to really focus when youre tryna stack for ya
Lawyers with those in power tryna blackball ya
Its hard to find employers like accountants thats loyal
With those who told ya they adore tryna backdoor ya
You aint onpoint though one minute you popping trunks
Next minute you happy man next minute you sloppy drunk
Every January 1st the ball keeps droppin
And Im just celebrating it at the mall we shoppin
Celebrating friendships bro this cuz that
Fam this borrow that loyal this trust that
Comas after comas that were alcohol induced
If I aint wake up from em I wont ask what yall would do
When its hard to understand me cause my jaws keeps lockin
My parents keep callin the Lord keeps watchin
Im standing on the corner with my boys beat boxin
And anywhere I go all of these whores be jockin
I had to bite down bite down
A nigga had to bite down bite down
All I could do was bite down bite down down
Bite down bite down I had to
Hundred yard dash through the hood talking money runs
Using that money counter getting rid of them funny ones
You know the ones too wrinkled to go in them slot machines
Throw em on the titty bar floor to lower a thot esteem
You could be the hottest thing and still have the wrong team
Sometimes to see the bigger picture you need a wider screen
I got the arm out the black beatle beating the drum
Mannequin challenging whole families viva la drunk
Its Nickel Season the fevers begun
Im savage even though my tat issa knife Im keeping a gun
Loaded cartridges stolen cars with the Lowenharts
Rip the game apart and you are not worthy like Wayne  Garth
By now my lifes so righteous I dont even sleep with groupies
I move like that nigga Spike Lee when he was Mookie
Back in high school I really clowned
I said Id do the right thing if Rosie let me ice cube them titties now
But this is realer than movie depictions
What you niggas know bout making a move in a beef and truly committin
It aint no squashing it after you push a certain button
Make sure everything under your lip cut and your shirt is tucked in
Burning your beard away with Magic Shave
COs frisking your pregnant bitch turning your kids away thataway
Thatll in a shallow grave casualty of a cabaret
Daughter calling some wack nigga daddy at movie matinees
Even when we deal with Saturdays my children still know that
I dont want another mans cheapass ways on my doormat
And anything I do from legal to illegal
I do this shit the ski mask way like Im Lil Kodak
