TranslationsEnglishBlack Savage Lyrics
I don't know what this world is coming to

Yeah, I ain't ya average rapper residing in Calabasas
Mashin' the Aston through Malagasy in Madagascar
I don't believe in your white Jesus and Last Suppers
I place value on brothers who never had justice
I am the black savage
Ali and Foreman in Zaire fightin' for black magic
Rifles and flak jackets, mama was suicidal, papa had bad habits
Product of true survival, rocker like Black Sabbath
Hoppin' up out the Chevy, Pac, Biggie, Machiavelli
OG like Nas or Reggie, culture like Ox in "Belly"
Vulgar like Akinyele, focus like Dr. Sebi
We did it your way, but now the culture is boppin' to our Sinatra medley
I'm limitless energy, they gimmicks and imagery
Kendrick, Cole, and the Kennedys, lyrical Holy Trinity
General of the city, they into promoting silly beef
Keepin' it Willy D, Weezy on the "A Milli" beat
Dream Chaser facin' the enemy like my nigga Meek
Tyler Perry writing my winning speech like it's Emmy week
Heart of gold, never sold my soul, Glock weighs a ton
Hov tellin' Lori Harvey, "No" at Roc Nation brunch
One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all

How much more do you want?
You wanna send us back to where we came from
'Cause we just savages
Well here’s my ass to kiss, yeah, yeah
I'm made of gold, my nigga
I go back home, I'm a goldmine, nigga
We taking all the land back they stole, my nigga
'Cause what you reap now is what you sow, my nigga
Where your soul, my nigga? Goddamn

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all
You might also like
If I ruled the world
I would go return all of the gold that was stole
Reupholster the nose on the Sphinx, it's a world war
Huh, they tryna take the soul out of soul
Niggas say I sold out, I never sold out a show
Even though people drove out in droves
Plus a whole lotta hoes, I suppose
"On the road to success, you gotta pay the toll," I was told
I don't hang with pawns, I'm Genghis Khan
Slang with a gang of cons that came with guns
Who speak the language from the ancient ones
Dangerous, huh? We shinin', nigga, shame the sun
Do I move D or stay in Saint Laurent?
'Cause y'all fashion week and this ain't Milan
Calusa to your Juan Ponce De Léon
Make sure it's peppercorn sauce on my filet mignon, my nigga

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all
My first reaction, raise my hands up along with my antenna
Sinner 'cause we born sinners, killers 'cause we want dinner
Try to warn niggas, better keep on growin'
Try to stay away from foreign, nigga
Better recognize when the Devil show his horns
He enjoying his whores like Donald Goines
There's a difference 'tween yours and Tomeka and Lauren
Young Warren Buffet in his prime, you ain't even know it
How she supposed to get thick? You just be feedin' her corn
With your corny ass get robbed while she fuckin' on your horny ass
Go to jail, tell it all before you ask for your attorney ass
Nigga, look, you could never be me
Knew who I was 'fore I got out the trap to sell a CD
I been shoulder-shoulder with gangstas facin' LAPD
Felony after felony, still they be yelling me free
Now my philosophy is, "No possession, no apostrophe"
'Cause ain't no use in being in prison, you ain't gotta be
Ironically, we dodging crazy crackers with hammers
Just how they used to dodge nigga with braids and bandanas
Man, it been more mass killin' than it's days in the year
Wonder if fighting for it worth as much as leaving it here
I'm sayin'

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all

Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world is coming to
Truth comes to the light behind it all10Embed
