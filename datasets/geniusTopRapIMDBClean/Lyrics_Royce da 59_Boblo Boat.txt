Cruising down the river dancing till your feet got numb cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement parkah memories of BobLo Island
All is your world aint nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut Just jealous of everybody thats headed out on that BobLo boat It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks Aw man I wish I was joining youa little cheese and crackers a little Cana wine a little Riunite on ice some Harveys Bristol Creambut lets do this only on Smooth FMÂ 
Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this handmedownshit I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me antibitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back fore I was born
Pop told stories bout it that would last for hourslong
And as a family we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the BobLo boat
Uh on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the BobLo boat
Thats where I lost my virginity no condom though
Thats when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the BobLo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics thoughBobLo boat
Hey hey hey lil Craig come here Aye hit this nigga Nigga dont worry bout what the fuck it is just drink
Yeah yeah yeah
Some of my better times I shared with you
I shared with you yeah
Shit all of my better days I shared with you
I shared with you shit
And now I gotta wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
Shit stuck inside a rat race  fuck 
Rat race  fuck fuck 
Wake up wake up wake up wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race  fuck 
Yeah look
Twist the cap lift the bottle back swig it
Dig it teninch rims on my mamas Civic
Teninch woofers in the trunk to be specific
They bump rattle the license plate plus the windows tinted
Dont even give a fuck that its dented bitch Im the man now
Im rolling driving it slow as if its stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci lets check her
Double Ds like doubledeckers I wanna sex her
But these keys dont come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college Im under pressure
Im not a real nigga til I undress her I gotta press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My reallife trauma
Plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but thats insane it couldnt be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap you never heard it better
Give me a sec I murder sectors prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it but it spill out I gotta chill out
Say Fuck the world and never pull out
We had no BobLo boat
But I could note those times just like a Bible quote
BC before cell phones the first time I would smoke
I was six years old but thats for another chapter
Thats for another story to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking bout dumb days
Thinking bout dumb days


This is 808Ray
Nigga dont worry about what the fuck it is just drink
