Ugh
Boom boom
Tickticktick
Yeah
Fivenine ugh
Yo
Im the verbalspit Smith Wesson I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a splitsecond
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You hear a Ticktick then you testin
My saliva and spit could split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me Im as live as it gets
Everybody claim they the best and they head the throne since BIG is gone
Iff you ask me they Dead Wrong
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
Ill have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come come now get pissed on shitted on
Tough talk turns to Cant we all just get along
You get blazed when the mics off shot when its on
You probably ducked when they laid the gunshot in your song
My gun ststutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Nough in the clip to give a speech to you
Me and Premier we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques Id prolly rap circles around
Im the next best to reach a peak
Formerly known as the best kept secretI guess that I just leaked it
Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Im a motherfucking star I dont battle no more
I provide the gunclapping round of applause after your show
And we could go toetotoe cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like Thats all you got
Every day Im meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a niggas hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitchesI be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googlyeyed looking at me batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that Im down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice Quit talking its over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past I know yall sweat
I got regrets older than some of you socalled vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Aint a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit you dont chew you dont breathe
You dont miss a fucking line
Every time I spit I tick to show you its hot
Leave me in the deck too long I blow up your boxboom
Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
Boom boom bam Goddamn
Royce 59
