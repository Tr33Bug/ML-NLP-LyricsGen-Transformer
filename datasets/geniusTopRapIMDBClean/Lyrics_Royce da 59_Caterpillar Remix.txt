Caterpillar  Remix  Lyrics
You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Ring the alarm the caterpillar keeps firing ohh
We in the war where butterflies keep dyin  ahh 
Im a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didnt do this where in the fuck would you be at
See theres a difference between us what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
Im tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh all you niggas my little rapper babies
Yall my children yall bit my shit and contracted rabies
Dont you grade me next to these rappers baby thats degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
Im skippin class to be fascinatin
My pen is like Big Ben this shits just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these hasbeens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns and heres my battle cry
Ring the alarm the caterpillar is firing ohh
We in the war where butterflies keep dyin  ahh 
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Kid think your number wont quit
Number one song get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When its all done then your number gon switch
Hold up wait a minute
Guess what Ima never do Show so much respect to you
That I feel like were friends so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone whos not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin you never knew
Always stay professional you always gon make revenue
Dont let people next to you that dont want the best for you
Its completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin is a fuckin lie
Its nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin the butterfly
Dont you ever disrespect the fuckin caterpillar
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Kid think your number wont quit
Number one song get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When its all done then your number gon switch
Yeah sold a quarter million records in my first week
And BET still dont wanna let me perform
Maybe its cause my pigment maybe Im being ignant
Maybe its all a figment of my imagination
And exaggeration exacerbates that Im the illest yes
How many are willing to kill us
We the realest thats why they feel us the best
But I dont give a fuck about this rap shit not really though
Shittin on a brother I should love man thats silly yo
Fuck all this division and lyrical incision
Its time to unify cause hiphop is beautiful its you and I
And it doesnt discriminate if you black or white
And you Christian or Muslim
It just love em and put nothin above em
I just want to be remembered as a good person
Dispersin a message of hope while the world worsen
And the media will still find a way
To turn us into clickbait and misquote
Wanna keep the peace but if you do that
Ima slit throats sike nah
Logics such a hypocrite you can take a hike nah
Right now Im here to talk about suicide and depression
Anxiety mental health and all that other shit
You scared to mention
Yeah I could talk about the millions Ive amassed
But now just aint the time or place
Its crazy how everyone so obsessed with my race
Cause Im proud to be black but matter fact
If it was flipped around and every time somebody asked me
What it was like to be a white rapper
Whats it like to be a white rapper Logic
Oh and I was just like just never talked about it like
Man its just so great being a white rapper
White white white white everything
White manbeing whites so greatwow its so great
And then some brother was like Ayy aint yo daddy black
And I was like Oh shit
And the whole world be like What are you scared to be black
Are you ashamed to be black Motherfucker fuck you
Fuck you you piece of shit mixed biracial fucking cunt
Thats how they be 
Cole said fuck all this black and white its time to unite
Be who you are identify as a star
Fuck all the jewelry and money inside of yo car
You still just a person and Im still dispersin these lyrics
Fuck the rap ego shit just be a good person now thats the spirit
Shoutout to true emcees that love the culture
From Duckworth to Chano Jermaine and Joey
And Aubrey and cant forget Bobby
To every emcee who knows that this is truly a way of life
And not just a hobby uh not just a hobby uh
Not just a hobby this is a way of life
Shout out to Bobby the LOGIC this shit a way of life
This shit a way of life yeah
