You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Ring the alarm the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin  Ahh 
Im a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didnt do this where in the fuck would you be at
See theres a difference between us what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
Im tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh all you niggas my little rapper babies
Yall my children yall bit my shit and contracted rabies
Dont you grade me next to these rappers baby thats degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
Im skippin class to be fascinatin
My pen is like Big Ben this shits just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these hasbeens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns and heres my battle cry
Ring the alarm the caterpillar is firing
Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin  Ahh 
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Kid think your number wont quit
Number one song get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When its all done then your number gon switch
Hold up wait a minute
Guess what Ima never do Show so much respect to you
That I feel like were friends so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone whos not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin you never knew
Always stay professional you always gon make revenue
Dont let people next to you that dont want the best for you
Its completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin is a fuckin lie
Its nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin the butterfly
Dont you ever disrespect the fuckin caterpillar
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Kid think your number wont quit
Number one song get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When its all done then your number gon switch
Youre looking at Attila the psychopathic killer the caterpillar
Dont tell me when Im supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper aint even half as ill
A savage still the tracks a banana peel attack of the silverback gorilla
Youre havin a little trouble fathomin this is actually happenin
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen Im batty like eyelids when theyre blinkin a lot
You copy me but youre not
You cant be butterflies my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing Ima squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
Till the shingles come off the roof well shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme in inkpen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like its King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
Wait a minute  Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg is that copyin or payin homage
Its sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather Ill have to rehatch on you
Come back as a black wasp half yellow jacket you cant swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it dammit I cant stop it
The rap is a vag and Im goin in like a tampon in this bitch
Its a manslaughter
Stampin out grasshoppers you cant be no Rap Gods
In fact youre exact opposites you make a wack song
And cant hold a candle but even Danielsan whacks off
You jackoffs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one but my pencils are number twos
Cause thats all I dos with em poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when Im droppin a deuce
And when Im producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
Cause these bars always got my stools in em
And I dont need Metamucil to loosen em
Bitch shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
Im bout to go spin another cocoon
Then Im cuttin you from your mothers womb
Then Im flushin you
