Cocaine Lyrics
So low
Door is closed
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Can't let go
Of my high hopes
My high hopes
My high hopes
(Say what?)
Papa came home from another day of hard
Work and handed me his key, told me "Go look in the car"
So I went out there to look for what he asked me to get
I was checkin' all the seats but the only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine (Say what?)
Uh, Papa was too solid, he ain't never tell a lie
I went in to tell him 'bout it, he said "Oh, that must be Guy"
He worked with me at the job", I said "Oh" and walked away
He said "Oh, before you go, make sure you don't tell your ma'
'Bout the cocaine" (Say what?)
Uh, me and little homie, we was walkin' to the store
It was right there on the corner and we seen a guy that's homeless
He was wrapped up in a blanket, he was lookin' really cold
Then he asked us for some change and he asked us if we know
Who had the cocaine (Say what?)
Cocaine

I'm losin' my mind, trying to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I drink a lot of alcohol, problems with the law
Would I have done better or the same
If Daddy never tried cocaine? Uh
If Daddy never tried cocaine
Cocaine, uh (Say what?)

In my throat
So my father's only next logical step was to go to rehab
Can't let go
And that's exactly what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got completely clean
Hasn't done a drug
My high hopes
In over 20 years
He did that for himself but
My high hopes
He did that because he didn't want to lose us
Whew, strong man

Uh, now let's talk about how much I respect my pop
He's been through so much in life, we ain't never had a lot
We just had each other's back, that was really all we need
Pop', I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me
More than cocaine
My father chose me over cocaine
Cocaine, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm an addict who inherits your pain

Trust is broke
Words got choked
