So low
Door is closed
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Cant let go
Of my high hopes
My high hopes
My high hopes
Say what 
Papa came home from another day of hard
Work and handed me his key told me Go look in the car
So I went out there to look for what he asked me to get
I was checkin all the seats but the only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine  Say what 
Uh Papa was too solid he aint never tell a lie
I went in to tell him bout it he said Oh that must be Guy
He worked with me at the job I said Oh and walked away
He said Oh before you go make sure you dont tell your ma
Bout the cocaine  Say what 
Uh me and little homie we was walkin to the store
It was right there on the corner and we seen a guy thats homeless
He was wrapped up in a blanket he was lookin really cold
Then he asked us for some change and he asked us if we know
Who had the cocaine  Say what 
Cocaine
Im losin my mind trying to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I drink a lot of alcohol problems with the law
Would I have done better or the same
If Daddy never tried cocaine Uh
If Daddy never tried cocaine
Cocaine uh  Say what 


In my throat
So my fathers only next logical step was to go to rehab
Cant let go
And thats exactly what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got completely clean
Hasnt done a drug
My high hopes
In over 20 years
He did that for himself but
My high hopes
He did that because he didnt want to lose us
Whew strong man
Uh now lets talk about how much I respect my pop
Hes been through so much in life we aint never had a lot
We just had each others back that was really all we need
Pop I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me
More than cocaine
My father chose me over cocaine
Cocaine uh
Im proud to say that Im an addict who inherits your pain
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
