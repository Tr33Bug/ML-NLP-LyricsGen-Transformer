Trust the fucking shooter
Uh
We in here counting dead president heads
Up in the years its been up in the mills of dead president heads and counting
They put pictures of dead president heads on green long papers
Then went and put dead president heads on mountains
How we aint gon make it
You know what
I went from women asking whats the scent of your fragrance to center of attention
To dinners in Vegas then all the way to Japan racking up yen
Now Im all the way back
And Im acting like Dennis in Vegas stacking up wins
Im a young black boy armed dangerous
To those who want to come and try harm or change him
While theyre living in anguish while Im living in real nigga harmony
Energy around me blend together like falsettos tenors and bass
All intelligence is on God level
All memories formed in melodies from the 70s
And all hail to all dinners and plates
And all hail to the cartels and we out on a yacht
And you know how we know that we are and you not
Because yall are looking at our sales
Im a motherfucking oneman army
Im more R than our I put the R in ourselves
Uh Im the one they cant generalize
Every time I come through straight their wave minimize
Why Its probably cause I gun through they gay enterprise
Niggas get crowned quick these days
Street this best this king that we aint seen that
All we see around your clique is squad cars
Niggas need to get crown vicked these days
Stop kicking it you couldnt fit in my old socks
Let alone my shoes
Im not a street nigga Im just a chip off the old block
I aint rocked with an entourage since 07
Niggas dissed Marshall after they copy his whole reference
Like we wont send an actual firing squad to their studio
That will Basquiat their whole session
A lot of niggas dope but none concern me though
I got that Pac Big L Pun eternity flow
I got that blowing that weed taking that last drag in
And tossed in the infirmary glow
Ill hit your broad in the gall bladder with this bald dagger
Have her hollering not the knife til she having an orgasm
And all of her juices is haulassing down the thighs
God dropped me off in the drop with the crossroads with crossed toes and dotted eyes
Im not alive I wasnt born I got a ride
Uh get your popcorn idolize cause Ive arrived
This is Cam Newton throwing bullets with the band shooting
This is beat submission from Bas Rutten
This the  edition of  its proven
Nigga pay your dues youre past due here
This cash rules youre looking at the wrong paper this bad news
Relax junior you still think youre in high school
But you not but you will be looking at your last new year
Ha booya bombs over Baghdad
Compliments since 7 Mile Fenkell Ave Cash and Poo Bear
With directions to just go blasting through there
I aint stressing bout none of you poindexter responses
I aint tongue wrestling with no artist unless its Ashanti
Nigga this God Gandhi Kevlar labcoat
Mixed together with leather bathrobes like Plies and Fonzi
Cool science Im around lions and giants
You there Ryans here
No one can hear you crying where Im at the highest tier
One diss track could tear your whole act up like the Flatbush Zombies
Gripping the Mac truck with Travis Scott hitting your Macbook
Im not a pioneer Im the last of a dying prayer
Living in forever ever ever ever ever in laughter
And ever since that heffer put me on MediaTakeOut
I aint fucked a basic bitch since
I got sophisticated bitches coming to my place asking is it safe to sit
I said only if you have to take a shit
Country chick named Delores I let her sit on this Mason dick
Rappers blew up and get to shouting out designers
I like to thank my notebook it got me out of the binders
Blacks never had each others backs
Rappers saying All Lives Matter Okay now were actually spineless
Im into psychology nowadays she say she bad
Ill probably brainwash her like Hollywood did Stacey Dash
A lot of guys out slanging for a belt buckle like Pootie Tang
WadaTah
59 the illest MC of all time right now and all the time
Kneel right in front of me like feel sobriety youngn or fall in line
Uh right now Im piranha dipping in waters of Flint with the Slaughters and Em
Come on in dummy the waters fine
Sniff around I smell just like money I aint hard to find
Im doing big things
This bitch asked me do I got at least 50 shades
Just the other day
I said come here let me kick game
I got more than 50 shades and just grey is the colorway
I gave my momma a pic of myself in a big frame
And a card that says bitch Im Rick James for Mothers Day
Uh I just thank the Lord and pray for more
I just lifted the skirt of the devil
I dont really care how youre dress her
Nigga Im just out here to take your drawers
Make the winner fall on the track
Let nature take its course
Im a product of the old Death Row camp
I aint a fan of his he might want to be standin clear
I come with the cannon not the cameras
I aint Shannon Briggs but lets go champ
Lets slow dance
Kill you with the first and give you seven more necromance
Best flow versus yo petrol rants you gassin
This that new black Bent blue Aston
This that who dat against who askin who ya again
99 the Outsidaz told me I wouldnt last
Im too arrogant
But here I am two boys two girls two eras in
And they over there on pills and heroin
Forks in they careers so thats real embarrassin
If I could just get you clean through my charities
I might just let you breathe through me vicariously
But then again I might not cuz I dont write sparingly
Im torn between get along fight and why cant we
Fuck the Stitches approach
If I have to show up Im slashin your throat
Your arms are too OG Maco to box with OG Wacko the GOAT
Im not a factor Im the whole problem
Down to subtract for a fraction of folks
Your favorite artist a diva
I put leaves around the heads of nonbelievers like drawings of Ceasar
Wake me when the sleepers are done ignoring me bruh
Ill be flying with a full tank of gas on ether
If you from the block watch yall sons
Watch yall daughters cause I saw murder
Slaughter much as I saw hot sauce and hot dog water
I came a long way from wishin under the stars
But I aint come all of this way just to say Ive come this far
Coppin paintbrushes with black cards
Theres no limit when it comes to this art
No need for twitter followers I dodged prison
Im the nonequivocal black and at large
Listenin to a Timbaland track in a villa in Calabasas
Im that same little Cringer and Battle Cat kid
Addict specialty pen and pad scenematics spazzin
Fuckin wit a bitch about as bad as my spendin habits
I got nowhere askin can I have it
All the valuables I have in this world I had to take it
Had to open King Tuts tomb up in my imagination
Had to separate fear from respect and admiration
Get rid of your fears
Time to remove doubts and
Think about it theres two sculptors named Gutzon and Lincoln
Who carved dead president heads
Who got paid dead president heads by the president
To move a mountain
Uh contemporary art deco
We keep the shit rockin like the dails of Art Basel
Stompin through this hiphop shit like its our step show
We survive
We should have bar mitzvahs for these bars
We the gods
We should shoot bar missiles with these bars
Beat the odds look at the car see the rides
Dont be surprised just realize
We aint runnin for president
So we aint worth shit unless we alive
