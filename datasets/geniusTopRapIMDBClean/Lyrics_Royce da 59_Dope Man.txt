Dope Man Lyrics
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Prophesized to be your king
He's a king of the street
Man of the world, who the little boys wanna be
He's the dope man
Ohh (Ooh)
Just the ghetto hood celebrity
Chains and shackles, just a distant memory
He's the dope man (Ooh)
I ain't talkin' pimps and hoes, I'm talkin' Cadillac drove on 24s
He's the dope man
What you see is what you get, he's off it
He's our dope man (Yeah)
It's 72 degrees and it doesn't get better than this
The weather is so beautiful outside
It's gonna warm up a little bit
And I wanna shout out to all those people that are
Headed out for good times with family and friends
Just a little relaxin', enjoyin' yourselves
I wish it was me joinin' you
But I'm right here doin' the thing that gets it groovin'
The moves and the sounds
Only on Smooth Grease FM

Dope man, please, can I have another hit (Hey, hey, hey)
Dope man (Give it up, give it up for)
Dope man, please
Give it up, give it up for
Give it up, give it up for
Dope man, please (Ooh)
Dope-dope-dope man

Old head starin' at me, they some has-beens, I'm the nigga that they never was (Dope man)
Your mama used to be a dime piece (Dope man), now I let her and your auntie split a dub (Dope man)
Mommy got a fat ass in a sundress, I'ma see if I can get a hug (Dope man)
Fucked your baby mama, only problem is now it's too hard to get rid of her (Dope man)
One man treasure and another man trash, you can call me a litterbug (Dope man)
White cop call me a nigga while the wife pops call me a jitterbug (Dope man)
One man white powder army could wipe out an army of Twitter thugs (Dope man)
Put the weed man out of business at a time when the town needed realer drugs (Dope man)

Dope man, please (Ohhh)
Dope man, please, can I have another hit?
The government injected crack into my natural habitat
Charged me with possession and arrested me for havin' it after that
Pulled up in the Wraith, know it really hurts
As the oldest had to get a couple in blood
Dope man, please, can I have another hit
Dope man (We gon' split a Dutch)
Dope man, please
Dope man, please
Dope-dope-dope man
Dope man, dope man
Dope-dope man, dope man
Please, can I have another hit?
Dope man, dope man
Give it up, give it up for (Dope man, please)
Give it up, give it up forEmbed
