I am that nigga its obvious
These niggas broke on their pickpocket watching us
They see the watch and this jewelry we rocking
Get sick to they stomach now they tryna plot on us
They know this extendo we got on us
Cant name a time when its not on us
Hope they try robbing us
So they can go back and tell niggas about all these bullets they got from us
I let that blocker unload I put that pot on the stove yeah
Now these CDs only product thats sold
Fans in Berlin going out of control yeah
I fuck a lot of new hoes
Penthouse on top of the Lowes Versace my robe
Whats in my pocket A knot I cant fold
Make sure my gelato is rolled
Uh I am on a whole nother level than you uh
My grandma used to say Boy you got the devil in you
Fuck around get some metal in you
My name ring bells I could sell out whatever venue
For us by us
For us by us
For us by us
For us by us
For you  By us
For you  By us
For you  By us
Im tired of hearing bout what all these rappersll do
First of all none of yall could last in the booth
I dont know whats faster your wounds turning black or to blue
The media to slap or to sue
Step to a nigga just to step on a nigga
Sounds easier to me than counting backwards from two
Bring the hood piece you expect to buy the Benzes
Shell catch an iron you aint pressured by forensics
Half these niggas rhyming transgendered
You said it gotta question how you meant it
I transcend forever monumented
Not even Netflix could document it
My son got autism from injection by syringes
These nerds aint warriors we heard the same story and
You niggas blowing whistles at Hurricane Dorian
Blowing missiles back to the word of vainglorious
You sissy
Nigga this is for us by us
Why you put yours up Ill put up my cup
Survivors of systems meant to divide us
You only can afford what you could buy five of
You a fool in a war with the faint of hearts
Ill let the tool encore take your brain apart
Im at the Louvre on the floor by the hanging art
Im putting numbers on the board like a game of darts
Product of every single blood freckled Timberland
Buy up every building in the projects to contemporary art deco every tenement
My consiglieres Marc Ecko every sentiment
Cop a hundred rides park em all in one garage
Money on my mind like Rocky thunder thighs
Everybody everybody friends like they from Milan
Til they in a hole in a lawn like the number nine
Long hours of perfecting this 97 shit
Spitting seeds left the shells of pistachios on the keys of the Casios as the evidence
Bearing my soul DiCaprio from The Revenant
Phantom looking haunted like a hayride
Camera on the trunk like the one from my prayers
Amethyst a gun cummerbund child they lied
Glamour chick in front one of one I say I
And you know how I do
Put the beef behind me then put your soul behind you like De La
Twin white Maybachs
Steering wheel wood when Im floating through the hood like sailors
Couldnt be cut like me if you had ten tailors
Put the wifey in a black Bent Bentayga
Judge cant exonerate violate
Got a mansion by the lake got a maid Consuela
I was fly even when I was a damn lie
I was flying standby cause of how I expand mics
Triple threat bitch I make the track and write
The judge cant give me life bitch I am life
You a algorithm
You niggas everything the culture isnt
I dont coach or visit
I dont get into the social digits
I just smoke distribute
Microorganism living my colloquialism
