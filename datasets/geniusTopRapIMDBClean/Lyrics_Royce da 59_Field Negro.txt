Field Negro Lyrics
You ain't been gettin’ this money all your life
Oh you forgot about the roaches and all the mice
Out here livin' an alcoholic rapper artist life
What happened to art is life?
All of you kids is in charter school
And you startin' to do everything in private
Maybe that’s from all of the charter flights
Make sure whatever you're doing is not in the dark
You know this shit is bound to come out eventually
Underneath all the lights
Rob a man, kidnap him, take him for all his rights
Degrade him all his life, rape his daughter, his wife
Nine months later, use the baby as piranha bait
We wasn't even allowed to pray, let alone read or write
People like Cube opened them doors
And politically correct negroes like you
Close 'em to keep your ice
Clap for 'em, they make you feel like they love you there
Your whole platform could swim with the fishes
Like Huggy Bear
Your Maybach and your house is like that important that you won't move at all. It's distractions, that you won't say anything at all in risk of losing something. Right. You won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?

You ain't been gettin’ riches ya whole life
Oh, you done forgot? The oven door open
On the stove in the kitchen to heat up the house
'Cause they done cut the heat off on ya home, right?
Okay, now you thinkin' you livin' so far away
Just ’cause you neighbors with Britney and K-Fed
Every artist in the game are phony
Fuckin' all the same thotties in the game since way back
And all the same thots in the game been givin' the same top
To the same guys in the game like one of Sway hats
The plight of the miserable wasted talent
Only guys with the hits are the Tygas, Drakes and Khaleds, shit
This is what happens when your favorite artist never get challenged
Your favorite fella from the NFL has been silenced
My dad said, "Under no circumstance should a man
Considered a legend have nothing left on his deathbed
And any black man not willin' to stand up for his own rights
Should lose the use of his right and left leg"
They say I couldn't do it, so I went out and did it
They said they gave it to me, so I ain't ask for more
I stayed active every time a door slammed in my face
Stayed at the door, I stayed knocking, I stayed rockin'
I did it my way without all the complainin'
And all the whinin' all day like Kanye or Wale
For the validation of all the bloggers
And all the same gay ass awards
Fuck y'all and all them gay ass awards
We are livin' inside the same hell
And we all willin' to die to go the same heaven
But we are lyrically not on the same level
I'm scribblin' my killings down and sendin' them out like chain letters
I'm not here for the crown nor Tory Lanez cheddar
I'm here for respect or else I'm willin' to take off the belt
And whoop a young nigga's ass with it like James Evans
You might also like
A house negro look at you and say
"Man you crazy, what you mean separate?
Where is there a better house than this? Where can I wear better clothes than this?"
It was that house negro
In those days he was called a house nigga
And that's what we call him today, 'cause we still got some house niggers running around here

You only been livin' a small part of your life all the way up
Oh you forgot about your home that you grew up in
When you were starvin' with nothing, when it was stripes on all The canned goods in your closets and cupboards
You grew stripes and you developed the heart of a hustler
My grind Shawn Carter as fuck
I go back in time, sell George Washington Carver a nut
Plus, none of these artist can beat me
I'm Truman and Christ on the Noah's Ark on the waters of Fiji
I'm truly the type that'd push your wig farther than BC
Leave your brains all over the street
My heart's on my sleeve, put my seed in the Garden of Eden
And start a new species, please, you know my steez
How you got a team and you ain't got loyalty?
How is y'all the kings and you ain't got royalties?
I been around homicides since Marky D
Kool Rock Ski, you disorderlies, you know my steez
Children is dyin', women is cryin', we under attack, fool
What a better time to be famous, black and impactful
Name somethin' better to come together as one to react to
Shit we still comin' back from a checkered past like lumber jack suits
You play for the NFL, I just wanna ask you
If you don't kneel with Kaep, it's simple math
They cannot run it past you
Niggas innovate, people penetrate, exclamate
Off our inner hate
We oblige, so they make the riches, we don't rise
They just keep us high
Product of slave privilege, cop Ferraris to race a nigga
I do any job you can pay, if I can make a livin'
Vodka straight, a whole lotta pacin'
Just so I can make a decision
Keep a honorable spirit
With not a whole lot of faith to distribute
They took the scriptures away and replaced it
After makin' they own racist revisions
They crazy, basically they create shit just to play shit
To take away shit to rig it
I'm pretty sure they Maker is livid, they racist, they bigots
What's Christian about that?
The fakeness is vivid, the paper is printed
They should wake up every day
And pray to the nature of business
Fuck a Laker, I could never play for the Pistons
At the expense of creatin' division
The Wraith is exquisite, I'm 'bout that paper
But it's gon' prob'ly take me a minute
I much rather be a atheist chasin' my faith through a prism
Assumin' the information is real
Then play for a racist with a racist agenda
I hate you niggas, bow figures
The misappropriation of wisdom got you
Slaves to your own alienism, to pay a few bills, house nigga
I rather get hit with a Patriot missile
Than to be out here with ya exhibiting patriotism
They say a broke' clock is right two times
But it's never accurate
Truth time, okay
If some of us don't have time, some of us have time
Some of us perform in the halftime
Some of us boycottin' halftime
Some of us standin' up, some of us sittin' down
Reparations will never get back to us
They'll forever just laugh at us
I think I found a way for you niggas to face your truth
Go ahead and try to trace your roots
That shit is rather miraculous
Them niggas took away the message
And mess with the message in it
Embellish it just to spin it, just to sell that shit back to us11Embed
