You aint been gettin this money all your life
Oh you forgot about the roaches and all the mice
Out here livin an alcoholic rapper artist life
What happened to art is life
All of you kids is in charter school
And you startin to do everything in private
Maybe thats from all of the charter flights
Make sure whatever youre doing is not in the dark
You know this shit is bound to come out eventually
Underneath all the lights
Rob a man kidnap him take him for all his rights
Degrade him all his life rape his daughter his wife
Nine months later use the baby as piranha bait
We wasnt even allowed to pray let alone read or write
People like Cube opened them doors
And politically correct negroes like you
Close em to keep your ice
Clap for em they make you feel like they love you there
Your whole platform could swim with the fishes
Like Huggy Bear
Your Maybach and your house is like that important that you wont move at all Its distractions that you wont say anything at all in risk of losing something Right You wont say anything on anyones behalf at this point
You aint been gettin riches ya whole life
Oh you done forgot The oven door open
On the stove in the kitchen to heat up the house
Cause they done cut the heat off on ya home right
Okay now you thinkin you livin so far away
Just cause you neighbors with Britney and KFed
Every artist in the game are phony
Fuckin all the same thotties in the game since way back
And all the same thots in the game been givin the same top
To the same guys in the game like one of Sway hats
The plight of the miserable wasted talent
Only guys with the hits are the Tygas Drakes and Khaleds shit
This is what happens when your favorite artist never get challenged
Your favorite fella from the NFL has been silenced
My dad said Under no circumstance should a man
Considered a legend have nothing left on his deathbed
And any black man not willin to stand up for his own rights
Should lose the use of his right and left leg
They say I couldnt do it so I went out and did it
They said they gave it to me so I aint ask for more
I stayed active every time a door slammed in my face
Stayed at the door I stayed knocking I stayed rockin
I did it my way without all the complainin
And all the whinin all day like Kanye or Wale
For the validation of all the bloggers
And all the same gay ass awards
Fuck yall and all them gay ass awards
We are livin inside the same hell
And we all willin to die to go the same heaven
But we are lyrically not on the same level
Im scribblin my killings down and sendin them out like chain letters
Im not here for the crown nor Tory Lanez cheddar
Im here for respect or else Im willin to take off the belt
And whoop a young niggas ass with it like James Evans


A house negro look at you and say
Man you crazy what you mean separate
Where is there a better house than this Where can I wear better clothes than this
It was that house negro
In those days he was called a house nigga
And thats what we call him today cause we still got some house niggers running around here
You only been livin a small part of your life all the way up
Oh you forgot about your home that you grew up in
When you were starvin with nothing when it was stripes on all The canned goods in your closets and cupboards
You grew stripes and you developed the heart of a hustler
My grind Shawn Carter as fuck
I go back in time sell George Washington Carver a nut
Plus none of these artist can beat me
Im Truman and Christ on the Noahs Ark on the waters of Fiji
Im truly the type thatd push your wig farther than BC
Leave your brains all over the street
My hearts on my sleeve put my seed in the Garden of Eden
And start a new species please you know my steez
How you got a team and you aint got loyalty
How is yall the kings and you aint got royalties
I been around homicides since Marky D
Kool Rock Ski you disorderlies you know my steez
Children is dyin women is cryin we under attack fool
What a better time to be famous black and impactful
Name somethin better to come together as one to react to
Shit we still comin back from a checkered past like lumber jack suits
You play for the NFL I just wanna ask you
If you dont kneel with Kaep its simple math
They cannot run it past you
Niggas innovate people penetrate exclamate
Off our inner hate
We oblige so they make the riches we dont rise
They just keep us high
Product of slave privilege cop Ferraris to race a nigga
I do any job you can pay if I can make a livin
Vodka straight a whole lotta pacin
Just so I can make a decision
Keep a honorable spirit
With not a whole lot of faith to distribute
They took the scriptures away and replaced it
After makin they own racist revisions
They crazy basically they create shit just to play shit
To take away shit to rig it
Im pretty sure they Maker is livid they racist they bigots
Whats Christian about that
The fakeness is vivid the paper is printed
They should wake up every day
And pray to the nature of business
Fuck a Laker I could never play for the Pistons
At the expense of creatin division
The Wraith is exquisite Im bout that paper
But its gon probly take me a minute
I much rather be a atheist chasin my faith through a prism
Assumin the information is real
Then play for a racist with a racist agenda
I hate you niggas bow figures
The misappropriation of wisdom got you
Slaves to your own alienism to pay a few bills house nigga
I rather get hit with a Patriot missile
Than to be out here with ya exhibiting patriotism
They say a broke clock is right two times
But its never accurate
Truth time okay
If some of us dont have time some of us have time
Some of us perform in the halftime
Some of us boycottin halftime
Some of us standin up some of us sittin down
Reparations will never get back to us
Theyll forever just laugh at us
I think I found a way for you niggas to face your truth
Go ahead and try to trace your roots
That shit is rather miraculous
Them niggas took away the message
And mess with the message in it
Embellish it just to spin it just to sell that shit back to us
