Ryan  Never would have made it
Now Im glad I make it out
Its God speed
Its God yeah
Its God speed
Its God ahhhh
Uh this is just how I zone when Porter spaz
I was born at a quarter past
I was the color purple Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royale bag
Now Im the hottest nigga that you know with the coldest intentions
Uh all I know is this flow and this pencil
The Lord is my shepherd the Devils my Doberman Pinscher
The industry said I had to be an alcoholic
Who be havin threesomes be doin acid and havin seizures
Wish I could go back to my old school and slap the teachers
All I had to do to blow up was an album packed with features
I dont relate to common folk they focus on the comments so
Ima go roll a Tesla Roadster down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold your honorable
Niggas is sheep niggas is sleep bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connectll give you a whole kilo of coke so he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein the holy Jesus of flows
He the GOAT baaah
That should be my taaaag
Im from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery thievin ballers debauchery schemin
Allah and Jesus its hard to believe Im a product of Eve
In the garden of Eden speakin how targeted we been
Rihanna stalker Im parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end put the paws on you I soften your defense
Hit your pause button halt your critiquin
Talk is cheap the more you niggas talk it it cheapens
And all I see is prey round the streets today
Im about a freak away from havin Issa Rae eatin out LisaRaye
Any artist out that you see is great tell em I said bring his ass
Better bring his A let his single play
We dont care what you sing hit you in the face with the butt of the gun
You leak and get your street cred and a few streams
Pop go the weasel nigga
Fiva Nina Im the illest you got pop culture fever nigga
All I know is Big and Pac quotes pop toast and squeezin triggers speedin tickets
Now Im pullin cops over give them niggas season tickets
Teesha used to shoot me down vicious now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now I go out to get my groceries in twoseaters
Used to roll the old school four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin with nothing but raw quarterpacks and duffels
Ryan writes heaters
Yall niggas is cut like one of them Get Rich or Die Tryin wifebeaters
Me Im just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you a hater lets do it I whip you now then whip on your boy later
Them whippinsll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I dont do Rodeo or ales I do the Floyd Mayos
So many men shopping the womens section it aint no ladies left
These niggas crazy Yes
They playin crazy like the Chappelle sketch Wayne Brady ep
Im what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine 80s met
Bringin bars back to the streets like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin Ether in HD at God speed
