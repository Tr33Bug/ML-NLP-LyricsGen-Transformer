Hold up 
Presenting to you the President of the United States
The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart Reagan is launched into the operating room and tells his doctors I hope youre all Republicans
Cash rules everything around me
I aint claiming Im street
Im just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete
In the bubbleeyed ride all because I bubble like Don P
Right beside mes a dime piece college girl looking bout as good as I sleep
Thats cause I keep it low the opposite of high key
Yall niggas got the wrong idea bout whats really going on out here
Yall weird I see they told you Keep your ears to the streets
Yall niggas laying down and yall ears out here in these streets
I guess you took it literal
Guess the only code you live bys forgetitcode
Uh if I should get my own guilty verdict
May the next man learn from it then flourish
You could put it on the news you could put my face on the front of a shirt in the latest video then blur it
Yall niggas fucking with the next nigga bitch
Mostly attracted to her cause she the next nigga bitch
One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas
Now he on the slayin spree for Dilla niggas I call it the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to dig a ditch
God is looking down on all being carried by the crisp pallbearers
Like just ball player
You aint even gotta pull a trigger you can still assist
Imma keep it real as this
Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold em and when to fold em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money aint good money
Got to know when somebody aint good for ya
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes and when its golden
Got to know all the got to knows
Got to know all the got to knows
God made us niggas then made us all breakable
Then gave us all decision making thatll make or break a nigga
People tryna blaze with you just so they can lace a nigga
All because of public sensationalism
With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to
When the place where the foundation of eatings
Higher population is based on popularity
Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom
All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact youre talking to an abomination
At the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong crime taking place
Thatll put you away for a long grind where its locked
Where its not safe unless you know them combinations
Yeah its just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother
We dont learn from each other we learn to look the other
Way when one of us in trouble
That karma looking to catch you its patient
Itll wait till you think you would love to come get you
Cause  it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered
Dearly beloved you soul searching for nothing
Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with historically
That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person
Whos living under the gun in this cold cold world that we live in
Thats under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants
More religion and more churches doctors more nurses
Cause its the American way to make anything thatll finish you or drop you for purchase
Who said I couldnt buy my way into heaven
All I need is a bottle a couple dollars a couple people thatll keep me company
And who love misery as much as me
You got to know your pedigree got to be yourself at all times
Your true self at all times aint gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be
A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride
Gotta know the alert signs them butterflies as reliable as your first mind genetically
Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold em and when to fold em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money aint good
Got to know when somebody aint good for ya
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes and when its golden
Got to know all I got to know
Got to know all I got to know
