Everything is hard hard hard
I mean life is hard bills is hard
Shit its all hard  hard hard hard 
Got to get that out your mind
I want to think that hard be real with yourself
College aint for you
In fact I want you to take up a trade  trade trade trade 
You know become a carpenter
Did you know Jesus was a carpenter  Hard hard hard 
She dont want you
Getting in that girls drawers is hard
Remember that boy hard  She dont want you 
Good luck baby  Getting in that girls drawers is hard 
Teacher Teacher I dont understand what you even wanna talk for
Hard hard hard 
Unless an interpreters gon come up there and talk for me  Hard 
Because we dont speak the same language
You say shit like Take up a trade and your thoughts bore me
You dont teach me nothing you just talk towards me
Im gon need your assessment and fast
Look around you do I look anything like the rest of your class
Cant you see that Im special
I dont act like these fucking crumb snatchers
I dont even breathe like em I was born with my lungs collapsing
I walked right up to the drug dealer in my class and asked him
How did you get such a bad bitch
He said it was hard and the best ones are the hardest to get
And I went on to see the world and he went on and started the trick
And now when I see his girl she be on my dick
I guess fucking the baddest bitches around wasnt hard as I thought
Man what the fuck was I thinking  Get money 
Jewelry and cars  cars cars cars 
Achieving the highest level of success aint as hard as I thought  top the world 
What the fuck was I thinking  I was drunk 
I was drunk or I was lost  You was lost yeah yeah 
My people said it would be hard  Hard Hard 
My teacher said it would be hard  Hard hard   Its gon be hard 
What the fuck was she thinking
Why did I listen to yall
What the fuck was I thinking
My finest hour is here this is what I see in my prayers
This is me though Im facing all of my fears
Making all my enemies look in the mirror
And see the meme of the Jordan face with all of the tears
What most of you analysts ignore its my explosive animal allure
I went away to get in the way of my wife planning a divorce
Handled it and came back more talented than all these rappers
Though Im DiCaprio all they have on me is the awards
Im a Steinway grand piano theyre Casios I will kindly pass them the torch
The day that one of them are able to hold a candle to my corpse
Ill put a hand on your whore even if she aint my type
And this song is inspired by Broadway play called Hamilton I saw that changed my life
Right away so my next move is to either screenwrite a movie or write a play


I said fucking the baddest bitches around wasnt hard as I thought
Man what the fuck was I thinking  Get money 
Jewelry and cars  cars cars cars 
Achieving the highest level of success aint as hard as I thought  Top the world 
What the fuck was I thinking  I was drunk 
I was drunk or I was lost  You was lost yeah yeah 
My people said it would be hard  Hard Hard 
My teacher said it would be hard  Hard Hard   Its gon be hard 
What the fuck was she thinking
Why did I listen to yall
Im looking like the black Bond in Africa
Hotel room look like a beautiful crime scene in fact its a
Spectacular Halle Berry Vivica massacre
Left behind by a serial bachelor
Fall back yall I really dont fall back enough
Youre not gon not sound soft to us
The shotgun will throw a box of black balls at ya like Count Chocula
That last line I was just on my Pharoahe Monch
Rappers kneel before me like Im trying to prepare a punt
Ill cut your body up and put it in two different cars
Put it in the river have you swimming in a pair of trunks
Momma asking when Im coming to the church
My little brother asking for the Aston
I threw the keys to him like Im fronting up some work  Ha good looking Nickle 
I used to not be a trendy guy
Now I probably got more pairs of Balmain jeans than Wale and Envy got
Ah somebody pinch me
Pardon me
Teacher teacher Im so sorry Im late
Im Lyric Montgomerys father Im here for Career Day
Hi Mr Montgomery 
Can I talk to the kids
Hello children how was your day
Im Royce Da 59 and over the years
Ive been blackballed
Ive been in jail
Ive seen lives turned
But guess what Ive learned
I learned that fucking the baddest bitches around wasnt hard as I thought
Man what the fuck was I thinking  Get Money 
Jewelry and cars  cars cars cars 
Achieving the highest level of success aint as hard as I thought  top the world 
What the fuck was I thinking  I was drunk 
I was drunk and I was lost
And you know what else
Everybody asking me just because Im a lyricist in this business
How come I havent gone broke yet
I tell em its cause Im the flyest backpacker ever
Im flyer than Mos Def in a Trump tower surrounded by four chefs
Fixing him some salmon croquettes with Kendrick Cole and Kweli
In their Jidenna clothes try me you and your crew will bleed
Yall bums aint shot for the stars since New Years Eve
Nothing was given to me
I had to go upside heads just to get upside hills
Never over the hill though so I dont strike when the iron is hot
I strike whenever the fuck I feel
I eat what the fuck I kill
I got this way from not being allowed to eat dinner
If you knew how much Ive lost youd have no problem with me winning
How many times could I be reinvented
Money is the deadlier of the five venoms in my denim
Definitively got a wad in em garages with cars in em
Hanging out in bars to have menages with bartenders
God was an artist and Jesus was a carpenter
They put me together like an easel in the darkness of hell
And lost it and left me some loose screws but
These are the nails to your coffin
These are the folk tales of a starving artist
Battling demons through his notepad like Adam and Eve eating kale in the garden
Flying private away from all charges
