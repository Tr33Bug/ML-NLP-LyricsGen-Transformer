I know my streets I know my sound
Yall know my beats how I get down
I take my steps and leaps and bounds
Nigga its hip hop
Yeah yeah we started from nothing a couple MCs
Beatboxin the crowd in the lunch room
Me and Preem both names go together
Like they aint supposed to be separate like DD
I said it before I rep in records beats
At the HeadQCourterz rest in peace
Nigga Imma hold the shotty and knock you out
And I aint gotta know karate like AfuRa
Its hip hop strong or not
This is rap basketball stats all you got
Long as you hot and your flow can hold up
To knowing that all of your short goals is long shots
Ninety percent of you niggas aint hard
Here just to get a rep you not Gang Starrs
The finest flow will amaze
Rap without me is The Source minus the quotable page
Hip hop is everything around you
No competition
Back to the voice of today
Its real in the field
Whats realer than hip hop
I know my streets I know my sound
Yall know my beats how I get down
I take my steps and leaps and bounds nigga its hip hop
Rhythmically come on with it Im longwinded
I will diss you from long distances
You will not get the chance like Choppa
Ness and Dylan to disrespect who you dont listen to
Egg in the skillet brain nigga this is you
Smarten up every person in the Earth
Be hardened up but the only target is us
Its hip hop cars and trucks
I be dreaming about shit like having a hard time swinging
On a nigga or squeezing a trigger or falling
If I land I wont wake up
My six shot model ya crew
Im leavin ya momma faces blue like a Hpnotiq bottle
They feel you the realer you spit this killer shit is hearin us
Healin you if you ill or you sick mentally its
Hip hop is everything around you
Gotta be something for me to write this
Back to the voice of today
No talent rappers
Whats realer than hip hop
I know my streets I know my sound
Yall know my beats how I get down
I take my steps and leaps and bounds
Nigga its hip hop
More venom 59 is like a G5
Illest lyrics is stored in him
Chorus is killing any warrior feeling
That I aint God  Lord willing
Trust me after I crush ya building
You will just hush you wont restore the village
We look toward with killing real
Though this album is morbidly feeling its still
Hip hop Fuck your feelings
More rappers dying much more killing
Its no feeling realer than gambling ya life
Everyday and waking up to more dealings
Fourteen killings compared to offshore millions
Equals I got a lot more villains
You know that you easily lose you be on MTV News
For the first time because you died over
Hip hop is everything around you
Come alive yall
Back to the voice of today
Its all in the game
Whats realer than hip hop
I know my streets I know my sound
Yall know my beats how I get down
I take my steps and leaps and bounds
Nigga its hip hop
