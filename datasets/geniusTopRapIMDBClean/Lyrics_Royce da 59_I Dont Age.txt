Product of the dope game
Mama wanted no pain Papa wanted cocaine
Papa smokin pot over the pot over the stove flame
Dollar short from acquirin no change
Started out with no shame to ridin round in Mulsanne
Tolerance high feel no pain
Cotton mouth with thots who got the code names
I remember nodding out too high just watchin Soul Train
Now Im yachtin out the boat brain
Hunnid thousand dollar gold chain
Wife done got too pricey for a Cadillac
Too icy to be fightin too godly for a battle rap
Too nice to be in cyphers too deep for moderation
Too free for exoneration and seekin validation
Young black receivin salutations
Product of the dope game
Mama wanted no pain Papa wanted cocaine
Papa smokin pot over the pot over the stove flame
Flyer than the sky I am the pilot of the soul plane
Writer of the pyro I was a writer way before fame
All yall dudes is cyber I come from the bottom right by the soil where the rose came
Im too private to try to expose lames
And Im too violent to be ridin with those thangs
Im too shady to be neutral these artists try to divide us
If I go Kendrick Lamar the world gon watch the Control change
Im way too vicious to ask for my respect
Im way too Michelin for the dissin man listen
Even mindin my business I deal with entire sets
Always on time to collect like the IRS
Product of the dope game
Nostril full of cocaine
Violence over dyin over war games
Die here and get choked lames
Die here in the choke chains
Advise you in the full mane Siamese your whole frame
How can I be washed Im havin shooter rifle thoughts
Suicidal thoughts I should be writin these rhymes in the diary of Cobain
Beat him til his Bible lost
Beat him til he dies and then beat his body til we revive em and then his pulse came
Where I come from I tell the jokes and you the joke
Where I come from I sell the dope you do the dope
My brethren Im not a legend Im not a vet
Do not address me as second Im the best
You niggas always sleepin Id rather stay woke
They say you are what you eat but I never ate goat
I went from straight poor to shoppin malls
And Wraiths blowin gray smoke
Dialed in like conference calls
Strapped up like Waco
Playin Hov Friend or Foe
Lost friends like Ross and Rachel
In the road big bro was a criminal
Give you Ls gimme Os
The only thing that look good on paper to me is Benjis ho
My sobrietys been more faithful to me than these hoes
Never compromisin my intellect for the Internet
Dissin these goals in the Rolls
How the fuck is Nickel Nine a yesman
When 247 I stay in the know
Fore I hold a grudge I take a flight to Paris
Fore I spill blood I drink a pint of theirs
I dont age
