I Got the Keys  Freestyle  Lyrics
Yeah Im starting to have fun now so you know
I got the keys keys keys
I got the keys keys keys
Yall are the kings kings kings
I roll up to squeeze
Yall are the kings kings kings
Well Im about to see Im about to see
I talk scrilla like a art dealer
Im large money thats been augmented for the small printer
Homocide business got me side flipping like Im cartwheeling
Im Godzilla wearing Margiela in the mall inside of the Guitar Center
Got the boss mental
Got me off a little barking at the dog kennel
Keys open doors I said keys open doors squeeze open fours
Leave your boys leaking leave your overlord lookin like some old weave on the floor
Please dont ignore me Im going to war
Blowing weed in a foreign toy
My shooters killing anything Im pointing towards
Anything Im pointing towards
I would swing this mic when Im rhyming thought I better bring it
Im what youd get if Fetty Wap were to rob a marksman
With Robert Markman a dead eye Genius
A Jedi demon he sip promethazine I bet I lean him
I made a million I aint sell out I just got the hell out Neimans
Nigga my chips up ask me am I in my PRI I stop you just so I could spell out Pringles
Im in the strip club I shell out singles
Im the flowing boss sweeping semis pick one
Head or tails either way you are about to let Akeem in
I came in here to grow the crime rate
Bodies on top of bodies on me
I got skeletons in my closet that could do the Famous video with Kanye
My status loony nigga I love my chrome
IMac and Uzi more than Donald Glover love that song Bad and Boujee
Bad and Boujee Im a black addict mooly
With an attitude in a padded room full of savage ghoulies
Eratic goonies
I dont battle I look at battle dudes like Battle Who me
Fuck you niggas Im steady waiting I fed him bake
You know that devils food them Betty Cakes
And I got something for them crooked cops too let him pray
Turn his wedding day Freddie Gray
Let that machete behead him set him straight
Let it devastate let his soul levitate let the levies break
Im murderous I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
Im a wavy rhymer a Mercedes rider
Im a 89er Cartier with diamonds
At the furrier Saint Laurent sipping Merlot
You would never catch me boxing with the burner
Hundred in your mouth like Ted DiBiase did to Virgil
Rolling over these hurdles playing C Murder then Im playing G Herbo
Gang of cash on me keep the thumper with me since I became a sinner
Black youngster I dont know if Imma tip the waitress tonight
Or make it rain for dinner
I dont know if Imma sign a deal or stay independent its not just a simple thing
Aston Martin topless while Im weighing my options on the triple beams
Learning that life aint about the expensive shit its about the simple things
Like a sexy side bitch with zipper lip clit nipple rings
You can not stop what is already going
African bitch got her face on my lap
The blacker she is the badder she is
I was called tarbaby growing and Im feeling up to par
Whenever I see the police
I address them as top of the morning cause I feel above the law
Riding do I look like I am supplying the drugs Fuck raw
I am the plug fuck raw
You niggas is about as much action as a buttonedup bra
Im taking everybody instrumental going Ted Bundy on it
Out here cooking so much the original sound like its Peg Bundy on it
Im Christmas gifting yall wrapping shit
I fit the description of accidents in the axel of the bent
I have an immaculate acumen
You a splitting image of accidental flatulence
All it takes to be a gang banger on wax these days
Is the engineer that come in and patch you in
Yes sir Im too charming to stress ya
Im cool calm and collective
Im electric you Carmen Electra
If I catch ya you gone on the stretcher
Now question
How much protection does a vest and armor get ya
Especially when you armed with weapons stepping in the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh keys keys yall got the keys keys
Ride up and squeeze squeeze
Yall are the kings kings heh well Im about to see
