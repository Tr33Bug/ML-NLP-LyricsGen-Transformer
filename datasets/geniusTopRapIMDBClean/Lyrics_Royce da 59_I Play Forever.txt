I Play Forever Lyrics
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Uh-uh)
Doo-doo-doo (Uh)

I fell in love with the street life
I-I fell in love with the street, that's no lie
No lie, no, no lie
No lie, no, no lie
I fell in love with the street life, I (Boo-boo-boo-boom)
Look, got a raw deal, not at all chill
Nigga, we run up under your food like shopping cart wheels
My Glock, make you hop and cartwheel for props
Your block got a cough feel, my name dollar bill
Holla y'all ill, gotcha
Truck tough like a build Tonka
Still conquer, with the steal like contra
Still pop you through your shield, holla (Boo)
I wasn't in the room, but on the mini scooter
Or lickin' hooters with a spliff for Buddha
I was in the inner city sewer, underground dirty-dirty, in the manure
Clip in the Ruger 'cause I was raised different than you were
Nigga, I'm awesome, get off 'em, you all dumb
You all wonder where I get all of my ambience from
You all wonder how I come from the swamp and the pond scum
Peon, comparin' me to y'all is beyond dumb, biatch
Me, I'm from where it's dark as Hell
'Round the corner from death, right across from Hell
I am Orson Welles tossed in the garbage pail
I'm from the bottom not from Harvard or Yale, darlin'

Uh, prolly took a shot, even shot a few too
Now my future bright, lookin' out is futile
My mom was frugal, my pop was brutal
School of hard knocks, all I did 'round the clock was doodle
On the block all day and night like a prostitute do
Every artist out there y'all like on the charts are doo-doo
I'm from where thots'll convolute you, the cops are cuckoo
Charge you, try you and prosecute you, if not, just shoot you
Knock off your whole tribe with the chopper like Shaka Zulu
Chef the impossible, opposite pyrex pots are voodoo
Block magician, I chop a brick to a pasta noodle
Fuck the charts, I roll out, I swapped the old out and copped the new-new
This is my possible moment of truth, shouts to Guru
Cocked the Glock, let it do the do like cock-a-doo-doo
Hospital, nah, growin' up only doctor you knew
Was Dr. Dre, Dr. Jay, and maybe that Dr. Drew dude
I was raised by Gregory and James Evans, dawg
I catch you without that weapon, that's Frank Drebin, dawg
That's naked, dawg, that's sacred, dawg
I spray your dawg, that's aerosol, let's face it, dawg
I Che Guevara, dawg
Y'all make mistakes, not me, I create eras, dawg
I play forever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
Ever-ever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
I play forever, dawg, never lost
Record of wins and lessons, y'all
Too effortless with the rhetoric to be a legend dog
As far as the bars and measures
I'm prolly highly regarded as God up in Heaven, dawg
I play forever, dawg
I play forever, dawg
Far as the art, I'm what else but Magellan, dawg
Hella bars, Nelson Mandela, dawg
Draped in Maison Margiela, dawg, they jealous, dawg
These niggas fake, I'm the eight kissin' the figure eight
Playin' Drake at a weddin', dawg
Put that together, dawg, I'm clever, dawg
I play forever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
Ever-ever, dawg
These sessions are blessings, dawg
Clever thoughts comin' out the barrel of G Dep's Smith & Wessons, dawg
These thoughts are the confessions, dawg
Ever, dawg, I play forever, dawg

No lie, no, no lie
No lie, no, no lie
I fell in love with the street life, IEmbed
