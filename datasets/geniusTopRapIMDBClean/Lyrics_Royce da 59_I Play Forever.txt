Doodoodoodoodoodoo  Uhuh 
Doodoodoo  Uh 
I fell in love with the street life
II fell in love with the street thats no lie
No lie no no lie
No lie no no lie
I fell in love with the street life I  Booboobooboom 
Look got a raw deal not at all chill
Nigga we run up under your food like shopping cart wheels
My Glock make you hop and cartwheel for props
Your block got a cough feel my name dollar bill
Holla yall ill gotcha
Truck tough like a build Tonka
Still conquer with the steal like contra
Still pop you through your shield holla  Boo 
I wasnt in the room but on the mini scooter
Or lickin hooters with a spliff for Buddha
I was in the inner city sewer underground dirtydirty in the manure
Clip in the Ruger cause I was raised different than you were
Nigga Im awesome get off em you all dumb
You all wonder where I get all of my ambience from
You all wonder how I come from the swamp and the pond scum
Peon comparin me to yall is beyond dumb biatch
Me Im from where its dark as Hell
Round the corner from death right across from Hell
I am Orson Welles tossed in the garbage pail
Im from the bottom not from Harvard or Yale darlin
Uh prolly took a shot even shot a few too
Now my future bright lookin out is futile
My mom was frugal my pop was brutal
School of hard knocks all I did round the clock was doodle
On the block all day and night like a prostitute do
Every artist out there yall like on the charts are doodoo
Im from where thotsll convolute you the cops are cuckoo
Charge you try you and prosecute you if not just shoot you
Knock off your whole tribe with the chopper like Shaka Zulu
Chef the impossible opposite pyrex pots are voodoo
Block magician I chop a brick to a pasta noodle
Fuck the charts I roll out I swapped the old out and copped the newnew
This is my possible moment of truth shouts to Guru
Cocked the Glock let it do the do like cockadoodoo
Hospital nah growin up only doctor you knew
Was Dr Dre Dr Jay and maybe that Dr Drew dude
I was raised by Gregory and James Evans dawg
I catch you without that weapon thats Frank Drebin dawg

I Che Guevara dawg
Yall make mistakes not me I create eras dawg
I play forever dawg everever dawg
Everever dawg everever dawg
I play forever dawg never lost
Record of wins and lessons yall
Too effortless with the rhetoric to be a legend dog
As far as the bars and measures
Im prolly highly regarded as God up in Heaven dawg
I play forever dawg
I play forever dawg
Far as the art Im what else but Magellan dawg
Hella bars Nelson Mandela dawg
Draped in Maison Margiela dawg they jealous dawg
These niggas fake Im the eight kissin the figure eight
Playin Drake at a weddin dawg
Put that together dawg Im clever dawg
I play forever dawg everever dawg
Everever dawg
These sessions are blessings dawg
Clever thoughts comin out the barrel of G Deps Smith  Wessons dawg
These thoughts are the confessions dawg
Ever dawg I play forever dawg
II fell in love with street thats no lie
No lie no no lie
No lie no no lie
I fell in love with the street life I
