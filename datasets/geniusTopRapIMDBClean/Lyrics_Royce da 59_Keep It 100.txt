Keep It 100 Lyrics
What's in my mind
What's in my mind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind

I'm like royalty around y'all
Down to fall with niggas I feel are as loyal as me
Which is probably why loyalty is my downfall
Nobody's perfect, I'm first to admit
I know I'm flawed
Especially with the chicks I used to be with, that I don't call
I got an on-off switch that drives them up a wall
Wasn't my intention just my attention
Span for they kind, sometime it's high, sometime it's low
I switch into a magician when it's her time to go
Mekka-lekka-ha mekka-hani-ho, keep drama low
I ain't Clyde, she ain't Bonnie, no
She rode a rollercoaster ride with a junkie
Cheating on his wife
Stuck in the moment, now it his time to grow
I used to wear rhinestones, sometimes I vibe wrong
I'm just being honest
I'm the kind that can probably get addicted to anything
If I'm constantly around it
But I believe in Karma, so when bad things happen to me
In my career it was easy for me to stomach
Especially in a industry where they teach you to dumb it
Down for the public
I just keep it 100
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind

Uh, which makes me royalty around gods
The more you grow into you, the more you mature
And you know your crew is gon' downsize
That's when it's beautiful
What I'm riding with 50 shooters for, I got to pray
Marshall made a nigga nigga-rich
That's rich enough to go muscle up and not rich enough to get out the way
Most dangerous position I could be in
Richer than niggas thinking, but not as rich as them niggas think
Shady got these industry niggas on some fiend shit
They use me to try to get to him, like a seamstress
I tell a nigga quick to e-mail Paul
And quit acting like a female dog
Other than that, shoutout my nigga Khaled
You the homie my nigga
If it was up to me, you know bro would be on it my nigga
You turned that Ross verse around for me in like a day
While I'm blowing Big Sean phone up for a verse
Feeling like, instead of this busy body shit with my family
I might as well try for Ye
Don't mind me, I'm just keeping it 100

What's in my mind
Riding on the wind and turning with the tide
What's in my mind
What's in my mind
What's in my mind
