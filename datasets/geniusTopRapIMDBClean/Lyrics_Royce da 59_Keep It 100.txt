Whats in my mind
Whats in my mind
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind
Im like royalty around yall
Down to fall with niggas I feel are as loyal as me
Which is probably why loyalty is my downfall
Nobodys perfect Im first to admit
I know Im flawed
Especially with the chicks I used to be with that I dont call
I got an onoff switch that drives them up a wall
Wasnt my intention just my attention
Span for they kind sometime its high sometime its low
I switch into a magician when its her time to go
Mekkalekkaha mekkahaniho keep drama low
I aint Clyde she aint Bonnie no
She rode a rollercoaster ride with a junkie
Cheating on his wife
Stuck in the moment now it his time to grow
I used to wear rhinestones sometimes I vibe wrong
Im just being honest
Im the kind that can probably get addicted to anything
If Im constantly around it
But I believe in Karma so when bad things happen to me
In my career it was easy for me to stomach
Especially in a industry where they teach you to dumb it
Down for the public
I just keep it 100
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind
Uh which makes me royalty around gods
The more you grow into you the more you mature
And you know your crew is gon downsize
Thats when its beautiful
What Im riding with 50 shooters for I got to pray
Marshall made a nigga niggarich
Thats rich enough to go muscle up and not rich enough to get out the way
Most dangerous position I could be in
Richer than niggas thinking but not as rich as them niggas think
Shady got these industry niggas on some fiend shit
They use me to try to get to him like a seamstress
I tell a nigga quick to email Paul
And quit acting like a female dog
Other than that shoutout my nigga Khaled
You the homie my nigga
If it was up to me you know bro would be on it my nigga
You turned that Ross verse around for me in like a day
While Im blowing Big Sean phone up for a verse
Feeling like instead of this busy body shit with my family
I might as well try for Ye
Dont mind me Im just keeping it 100
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind and turning with the tide
Whats in my mind
Whats in my mind
Whats in my mind
Riding on the wind
