Look at you no pleasure in creative thinking because you dont think creatively anymore
The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do
Tug of war and my minds like a clash of the titans
Thoughts contrast so its layers to my writin
God fearin but Im Guy Fisher
Yeah God hearin but Im gone fishin
Im an artist drug dealer foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese
Birds in the trunk so these keys now they homin
Letters and numbers on the Coupe like its Roman
Woo all black like the omen
Kim said it yup BIG wrote it
So Im feeling like a Greek god when I quote it
Lightyears ahead but I was caught up in the moment
Moment of clarity moment of silence
Burner on my waist yet Im saying stop the violence
Sitting on that white horse look at prince valiant
Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents
I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars
Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my problems I know how to solve em
With a ski mask automatic or revolver
A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else
Them niggas wanna see me runnin they know I wont
They say misery loves company no I dont
Aint got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks
All I got time to do is go back in time and pose with the Unabomber
Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it
I live by a code of demonic Illuminati Obama Hovanomics
Hold up hurdles in life I hop in a Turbo and roll around em
Im Doug E Fresh in the flesh I beat box
I booboodudu between the sheets to seek the GSpot
Im in bed with three naked ladies holding hands
Im in bed with three major labels
And I aint talkin bout wearing clothing brands
Underground locomotive man
Putting on a global show that no promoter can
I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons
In my world mistakes turns to blessings
The hate turned to destiny
Im saying Lord Jesus while the Lords most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me
I got your baby momma down on all fours
When drama comin Im all for it
If it aint about the money please let this be your last question
You players can jump if you want but you halfstepping like Paul George
I make the yay invisible in like a day or two
Thats how the players do my nigga theres layers to it


First in science first in technology wealthiest country on Earth most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education So you have all been taken and you dont even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep
Paranoid of poverty hustle was the philosophy
I seen a kilo I swear it became a part of me
Lie cheat and steal I had it mastered by my teens
Started hands on a nigga still pulling strings
Hotel suites straight selling niggas dreams
Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring
Was a water boy but balling always in my genes
Season ticket holder nigga sitting with the team
Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice
So suspicious of the cars tuitions for the schools
Labeled a mastermind I positioned every move
Shots fired now the deposition from the crew
Smooth operation but the money came in knots
Forty million there I dare you tell me what Im not
I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more
Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow
