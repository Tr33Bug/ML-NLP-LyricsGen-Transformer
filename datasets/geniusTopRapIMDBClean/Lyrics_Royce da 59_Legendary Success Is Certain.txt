Legendary  Success Is Certain  Lyrics
Im legendary legenlegendary Im lelelegendary
The theme song to my supplier plays in the key of a ki Im like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles This the Christ chapter
Im sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Dont take me light or play me light we two of the same
God melted the Rubiks cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
Im eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice now Im running through until Im through with the game
You can find me under a black cloud Im a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style itd be Sammy Cassells
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause its the hammer the cannon you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
Im a heavyweight Im catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 911 meditate til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my fetti straight
The MAC11ll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes
Youll see surprise and realize theres no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the I in try
Ryan vibes like cyanide I am proud
To say that Ive evolved theres only one I in defying odds
Smalltime arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who yall respect is probably crossdressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself vibing to my Lost Sessions
Im legendary
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they dont really know whats in my heart
This time around its startin to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary legenlegendary lelelegendary 
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary leglegendary 
Fall down  lelelegendary legendary legendary 
Im legendary
I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you aint do jack
Just who we kidding here This heres a different year
So you shouldnt assume that Im tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back in fact
As far as you new kids what have you did
I know that Ive burnt some bridges in the past but Im happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing Im forever willing and ready
I will make my childrens peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb
You get the Ghini Im sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while Im listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow the blunted joint heres the reefer
One minute you tough one minute you shook
I know I learned a while ago to hide power from you I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites I kill you every time
Throw a nigga body around the room have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the bestdressed lie
And why you niggas is hating
I wonder is God really an atheist He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Yall need to repent cause yall been imitating
A statue of me to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Lets tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle Im a big wig
My straws in the hole of a volcano Im having a big swig


Now everybody wanna believe me
But they dont really know whats in my heart
This time around its startin to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary legenlegendary lelelegendary 
My enemies starting to fall down
Im legendary leglegendary 
Fall down  lelelegendary legendary legendary 
Im legendary
