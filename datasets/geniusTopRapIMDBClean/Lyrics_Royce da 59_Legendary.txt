A womans loyalty is tested
When her man has nothing
A mans loyalty is tested
When that man has everything
The definition of a legend
Is a man who starts with nothing
And leaves the game with everything
Legendary
That shit there gon make you legendary
This shit here gon make me legendary
Make me legendary
This shit here gon make me legendary
Pardon nigga Im the hardest nigga out
The farthest nigga out the party nigga Im the artist
I put all these niggas in the garbage
All these niggas in the toilet
While I sit in orbit Im not getting better
Im just getting started started Im just getting
I just flipped it like I do all my competition
Let me slow this shit down
I just need me a bad one
Come over here and wear my flag hon
I give yall the bottom line I dont do a lot of talkin
Cause a lot of talkin take up a lot of time
And I dont got a lot of time
Since a kid sittin in the wicker chair
With the sweater with the collar out of mine
I swore a lot and swear to promise to cut the line
Swear not to get out of line
I cant have Pac in my closet I dont got time to idolize
I just cop it and toss it
I dont got time to itemize my flight is high
Probably the only thing around me tonight thats high
Besides my IDEOlogy
Pockets chubby I should say tubby
Cause Im ballin like Dr J
Wonderin How could they sub me
I certainly got comrades like Conrad Murray
Who operate ugly from around the way
Im lookin around at these pretty girls and this what I got to say


Aint no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
It aint no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That right there gon make you legendary
That right there gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
I aint tryna fuck every bitch thats tryna fuck me
That shit right there just aint necessary
All Im tryna be is legendary
That right there wont make you legendary
I remember I was just a pimp
Save all that extra shit
You bitches neckll twist quick as The Exorcist
Just tryna catch a glimpse bitch I look excellent
Soon as I exit I peel out advantage
She try to look hard cause her ride lookin small
We will suit up and boot up and get out like Mexicans
All you niggas do is party all the time
Party all the time party party party
Once you my target Ill stop you while youre startin
Started why you stoppin My niggas clock around the party
Around the clock wearing choppers round the 40
And rocket launcher down the block
Mwah And they aint got no lawyers
That gon make em fuckin legendary
Thats gon make you fucking legendary
Beautiful women asking When we gon get together
I told all em bitches Nevuary
Now all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense
Cause they know that I will fuck em once
Like a record company then drop em
Hold up thats that shit gon make you legendary
That shit gon make me so so so legendary
Specially if she acting suspect
And the pussy just end up being so so
Im just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow
Got the underground wire like the tires low pro
Got the eye of the tiger inside of the mind of a old soul yo
It aint no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That right there gon make you legendary
That right there gon make you legendary
It aint no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
Thats that shit gon make you legendary
You get more for your money when you fuck with Mr Porter
