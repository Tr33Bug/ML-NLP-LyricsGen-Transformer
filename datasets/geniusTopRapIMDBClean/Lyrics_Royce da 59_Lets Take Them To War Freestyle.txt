Lets Take Them To War  Freestyle  Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
808 Mafia
Ive been had the moves  been had the moves 
I got the moves since I got my studio  I got my studio 
I got confused  Hella confused 
I cant figure out for the life of me how I can lose
how can I lose 
How I can lose  how can I lose 
But Ive been had moves  I got the moves 
I got I Decided on pre order my lil homie just went gold
I hock a loogie on a reporter Detroit is on Pete Rose
Thats Armstrong on steroids gated up no wing toes
My phones blowing up so much a nigga may end up like CeeLo
I bounce back like the fattest ass you can have attached to the fattest hips and anything after this shall be considered cataclysmic
Countin packs like a statisician
Emphatic charisma
Savage enigma
I have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism
The camera rollin and its time to flow
I dont know
I just go carnival
Im from Motown you know
I can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip
And I can just go down the road
And knock em down like some dominoes
After you already out then Im dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos
Watching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow
I got Elijah Mohammed glow
I got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope
My focus phenomenal
My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer
Guarantee I will kill the flow
This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie
Niggas tryin to cover it up and make her look old
Guarantee Imma still steal the show
I been had the moves
I remember these bitches was just a dream
Actresses and models I used to only see on television
Now they be climbin out of my television lookin at me to get the ring
I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me
Choppin and conceal bodies
Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me
I had to holla at a tube
I had to still deal with that field sobriety
Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished
Looked like Lil Yachty
Nigga I went to jail for the whole year
I got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when yall got your little show here
I came right out to boozeboos
Straight right out the news
Right off the cover of a magazine
Had the magazine with me at the club showing people like Look at this and please try not to drool
I fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work
And Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first
Translation Im bout to fool
Yall countin me out well I got you
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 here I count for you
Biiitch
Last time took an L now its time to bounce back
I been had the moves 
I was broke as hell now its time to bounce back
I got the moves 
Every time I fail I got up and bounced back
I been had the moves 
And nothing yall can tell me about that bounce back
Im doing this cause this what God want me to do
These lyrics is ordained by the Lord
You gon get these bars
For free
Its bad half and finally famous
The weapons Iranian
Yall niggas is Pomeranian
My damie yall Pootie Tang
Nigga Im Damien
Shots drop from out of my cranium
My mind is Lebron drainin em
Five finger ring titanium
Already in your top 5
Now my dingaling now dangling
Im flyer than Tom Chambers on the first NBA Live
Double pumping from the three point NBA line
On that war page with that 24 gauge
But when I double pump it Im prime Chamberlain
Every track on the record got a background message
We dont back down ever
Im putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan
I just let my bitch in LA read now that sounds epic
My mind carries words
You couldnt walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons
I hope you know theres more fish thats in the sea
I stole ya ho we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree
And these hos in Detroit be trickin sooo much
They can completely gooo up a magicians sleeve
Youre totally awesome
While I pour 40s on corners for those we lost
My soul suffers from holy exhaustion
Trippin on opium just to cope with openin coffins
The devil sittin close enough to me to quote me an offer
Keep the union in unison like the Soviets marching
We goin iron for iron like a trophy in golfing
My nigga better yet I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies
Cause he retarded as fuck on a boat with a treasure chest
That makes perfectly good sense
Thats exactly how my career went
Like a fuckin experiment
I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with
First of all my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died
I missed both of they funerals fuckin around with rappers
So every day and every night my conscience cries
Im stressed out because my moms be tired pops be workin
And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire
Thats why I be in the lab and my mind be wired
Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires
Man but its this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys
And thats why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashantis thighs
Im feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration
My sober righteous life only got a place for my lady
But maybe I can ask my lady for permission
She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis
This audio porn Im giving with a bit of sense
A mind fuck if you will
Im from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit
Bitch I was born by a river in a little tent
Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint
Im cut from the kind of cloth thatll never go outta style
With or without the internet my shitll still trend
Thats why Im still standing with everything I came with
Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in
Nah I dont borrow Id rather discuss loaning
Im ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it
Yall weigh your respect against your release date
Im just an artist dog I dont know how to be fake
I dont want no problems dog
I dont wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved
I dont want no phone that receives a thousand calls
I dont need to be around a thousand smiling broads
With they hands out
Probably couldnt survive without em all
But they cant vouch for who the next sucker
