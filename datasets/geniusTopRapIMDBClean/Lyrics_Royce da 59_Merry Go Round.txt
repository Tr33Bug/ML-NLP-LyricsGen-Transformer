I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again merry go around
My lifes been going around n round since 95
Went from going somewhere to about to die
Went from calling my chick a chicken
Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs
To calling your piece a chicken cause she got no teeth
And she got crow feet around her eyes
How hard are yall I got a heart the size of Arkansas
Count to five these birds gon hit the ground and they aint from out the sky
Went from having an outtathisworldflow to doing a video doing the coon dance
To watching my good friend Eminem winning a moonman
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit
Letting em stay with me long story short they tore up my corporate apartment
Went from being a kid addicted to basketball
To being an ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol
Round and round we go is how this movie would end
Selfproclaimed King of my city not really just truly the King of losing a friend
Who woulda thought this dude in the park whos true to his art would lose
Or win just by giving his thoughts and views
I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again merry go around
You would hear that Ryans skilled might even hear Ryan kills
You will never hear Ryan Stills here to put the i in ill
My mind is still like a merrygoround spill
Like leaving only guns to my kids when Im killed I got an iron will
Intellect of Zion I done went too high on pills
To triumph to hiding from bills to buying buildings
Then I went from writing for Dre to wondering if my head was on straight
On the sidelines feeling forgot about listening to Forgot About Dre
From there I went to about a bottle a day
Telling who we know Get outta my face okay I know what Kino said about Dre
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake
But if it wasnt for him doing that what would I be doing today
If it wasnt for Cashis saying that he gonna beat my ass
Then me and Em probably wouldnt be laughing bout us getting past it
If it wasnt for me being outcasted I woulda never been on the underground rapping with SLAUGHTERHOUSE
I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again merry go around
