Mr Grace  Intro  Lyrics
What is America built off of Violence and entrepreneurship
So if you had to tell another six year old like yourself what to look out for what would you tell em They would kill you for the right price
Are you a buyer or a seller A seller
If I gave you a million dollars right now would you buy candy or a candy store A candy store
What is the goal to be Independent
If you lost everything tonight what you got tomorrow Intellectual property
And what is intellectual property They can take your possessions but they cant take your mind
How do you say group economics in Spanish Economa de grupo
How do you say barter system Sistema de cambio
If I gave you something for 500 and you flip it to the next man for 2000 what is that called Upselling
Alright now me as your leader as your father the person thats supposed to have your best interest
If I celebrate holidays and Christmas your entire life and you gotta go beg somebody for a job at 18 what did I do
You failed me financially
And I want you to tell me how fast can somebody be a victim of gun violence in America
This fast  Gunshot 
Was told to hear no evil see no evil speak no evil
In a place that hears no evil sees no evil
Where the oppressor sees no color
The investor sees no others
The erection seems so seasonal plus illegal
Man thats just the mode thats just the evil
We just adjust to that thats just machismo
I was destined to be mo than a apple laying next to a tree bro
Clandestine colorful G stuck in a G code thrust into street mode
Searchin for soul with a stolen identity
Surface low economically
In need of capital in search of a loan and its a few bankin institutions who got the remedy
But this is America where credit is for the privileged and profit is not my amenity
Im just here to get popped by the cops get popular so I can get discredited in a documentary by the enemy
While in a homicidal fratricidal cycle of wild constant hostile energy
Lookin down the barrel of a rifle while tryna find some inner peace
As God as my witness through tearyeyed tyranny
Knowledge itself is the caveat and the dollar itself is the demigod
Listen nigga this is The Iliad
Flip the dollars for wealth until our figures resemble the myriad
We are the inventors we are the lenders we are the matriarchs
Only thing we didnt make was slavery laws
And on this specific day its the end of the prison sentence this is the period
A rich man wrote this with a poor mans focus
A sick man quotes this but the dope man sold this
Lookin for a soulmate and the bitch playin Go Fish
Provin you got heart doin dirt for The Tin Man in a quicksand culture
Standin on anything I said like the kickstand open
Feelin like Rembrandt sculpted some shit that just van Gogh get
I am the descendant of the original physical melanin skin man
The highlyintelligent pride of the ghetto the Zinjanthropus
The Phantoms so clean you cant see the lord sit damn she is gorgeous
All you see is a steerin wheel floatin led by a herd of stampedin horses
Checks and balances by the curb
Steps to amateurs flyin birds
Connected annual to a buyin surge
Expectin the amateurs to try and merge
To try and lessen the blesses but you can never lessen the connection of the indefinite pentameter Ryan serves tryin words
This is Category A
Definition battered slave of yesterday
Recognition by cattle
Present picture a guy battles sexuality in tight apparel eyeshadow
Thats not deep Im shallow
As time travels rapperboys get to doin acid on stage
Wearin satchels catchin cases like statutory rape
Online actin like naturalborn slaves really
I guess its from the back of the back to back to sittin with my back to the shadows
With actors standin behind me with puppets controlling nothing but shapes
But that shapes our fate
This is the Allegory of the cave theory by Plato and this is the first chapter
The first fortyeight Death Of the Dope Man
