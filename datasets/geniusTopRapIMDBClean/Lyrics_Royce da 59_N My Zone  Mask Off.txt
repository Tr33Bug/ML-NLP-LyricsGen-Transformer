The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel who have dreams that want to do things Talent you have naturally Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft
Ive been killing microphones killing microphones
Ive been killing microphones killing microphones
Nigga Ive been killing microphones killing microphones
Killing microphones killing microphones
I been like the zone
When you talk to me minimize your tone
Take some of that bass out your voice
Dont go and put your Energizer on
With this beef Im going all the way
I dont mean to the end of night come on
I mean Imma take it to the grave until end your life its on
Im talking about crackerjacking these niggas
Til their whole enterprise is gone
Im talking about clapping at these niggas
With some shit thats gonna feminize you strong
Im talking about tenderize the bone
I aint talking about weird science though
When I say that my ceiling is probably gone
Im talking about villainizing your home
Nigga I been in like the zone
Im looking like Rambo in this bitch
But nigga I aint feeling like Stallone
Feel more like Im in a heist alone
Look I dont like to aim my shit at any artist
When Im writing Im just generalizing
How am I gon take a shot at something
I cant even fucking identify with
Im feeling like the long days away from feeling my Patrn
Used to have the coldest bitches waiting for me
Chilling by the phone
Used to do donuts on the grass
Now Im just feeling like a drone
Cause even though Im sitting high somewhere
Im still spinning by your home bitch
Ive been killing microphones bitch killing microphones bitch
Ive been killing microphones killing microphones
Nigga Ive been killing microphones killing microphones
Killing microphones killing microphones
This a new life who this This a new phone who this
Im in a new zone who this This aint no Redbone and who this
Im sorry my top is unavailable right now
My roof gone who this
Nigga my taste amazin my chick look like the waitress from Hooters
And she about to fix me dinner
She independent but she into niggas thats big spenders
And Im into fitting this dick in her
And she into fitness like Brittany Renner
I used to chase the liquor with the Guinness
Movemaking nigga with the business
With the winners in the bed with two majors
I still wake up feeling independent
Im a savage on top of that Im a reckless product of DD
Stop critiquing me my detractors
Just couldnt sell a record to the DMV
Im somebody aint nobody better than
My precise knowledge and intelligence
Well advanced I swipe a knife across your white collar like a cheddar scam
I put your lights out like Edison
Aint nobody out there ready for him
My blood type B positive your type O like the credits wrong
Im immune to all medicon blue Ferrari head is gone
Went from palladiums to colosseum stadiums
You perform in the Reddit forum
I spot a bitch nigga like Cyclops on Santa Monica
Got a model blowing my mind
My new Monica is blowing my harmonica
The car odometer is on the bottom
Of all the numbers like you dial star pound
Or put the car around white walls
Call em fire marshalls to come and shut the party down
Im the leader of CMB doing 52 over speed bumps
In front of your table with TMZ doin interviews while you eat lunch
I deal with mics real Kendricklike Ill kill a mic
Cash rules everything around me until I die
Looking right into the vanilla sky
Im funny acting who this
You owe me money run me that or do this
Get a running start jump into a hole take a hole in that beluga
I act like them older cats with moola
Dragging motorcycles past the light
With Kodiak on that Patrn Im hot and on cognac Im cooler
And Imma show no reaction to your rollie flashing like my zodiac a jeweler
Aint nothing but a dead something I be headhunting yeah Im going for that medulla
Booyah dont be acting foolish
Baby this a new phone you yapping who this
Maybe everything Im gon say from here on then is gon be on the behalf of who this
Hello  This a new life who this
Im on a roll like two dice moving
Im on a boat in Dubai fooling
On the moped fluteby shooting
Im an unapologetic work in progress
Product of a hardworking dedicated father with shortcomings
Praying all his sons make it farther
People say that it make you softer to raise a daughter but it made me harder
Smarter with the way I make dollars just to make sure she stay a baby baller
The way I zone is like the AC on
I play like KC and KG you cant even cage me
I be using Windows like Im on a HP
Just look around I dont own a thing that aint in HD
I aint interested in the crown that dont belong to Wayne Shady or Jay Z
Thats a opposite
You dont like your life how about death
You dont like to fight how about sex
You dont like the kind of car you drive okay how about Bow Wows jet
I got the kind of flow that destroy the place though
How about you take your shot at Rihanna like I did when I said hi
Or how about with Soulja Draco
How about I come through and paint the floor with your whole crew
How about the coroner come through and tell you go get Maaco
How about I dont give a fuck about burning bridges
How about I walk through the fire cause Im hot and I got the golden gate flow
How about I box
How about like Argyle
I sock niggas and give em disease like a irock
How about I hop out the Maybach and challenge every living emcee
