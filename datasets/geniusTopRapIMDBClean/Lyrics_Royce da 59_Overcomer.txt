All we did was slang dope  All we did was slang dope 
Mini Tec thats my main ho  Grrr 
Fishscale pictures wish you well
Heard you got 30 up North its aight mean he aint need no scale
Ruger shells at Bloomingdales  boomboobooboom 
Word on the street he had two for sale
Pistol in your mouth like a root canal
Aston with the missing roof pissin Vueve  Vroom 
Put ten on your head I bet they get you soon
Courtside Zion got thirty Bron got fifty  Ah 
I better cook a brick in a jiffy  Whip 
All we did was slang dope  All we did was slang dope 
Baby TEC thats bae bro  Grrr 
Came home scramblin all you heard was ambulance
Somebody got hit on the corner doin hand to hands
1212s out the minivan it had the ceiling fan
Dashboard had the chandelier
Sold grams for years baggin up taste the tears
Hit em up close you gotta face the fears  booboobooboo 
Where Im from drivebys overrated  Overrated 
If you got five bodies then you famous  Then you famous 
Get a hammer for the brick we gotta break it  Gotta break it 
Shit broke the blender nigga  Brrr 
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope  Doodoodoo 
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope
All we did was slang dope
Griselda
I need your sweet love
Darling cant you see
I need your sweet love
Darling cant you see
Ohoh
Woo I love you
All I wanted 
Boobooboobooboom
In search of right like the birth of Christ
Breakin every generational curse in life
Perverse concise make sure the verse is right
Return who adverse to the Earth
Make sure that my hearse is white
And the contract Jewish to match a grind thats foolish
A Quran thats Buddhist
Rappin so Mike Caren and Denaun stack moolah
As I sign on the dotted line with the passion of a blind tattooist
In reaction to slithers from lizards mouth
Yelawolf this is your first and your last pass
I aint gon put it on blast your punk ass know what this about
You think its bout being loud or tryna be hostile
Til you get found face down on the ground outside of Kid Rock house
Though you a vulture pundit I hope you get sober from this
Men lie women lie so do numbers
The energy never lies when you a overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer
I dont rhyme for the likes Im who the jealous target
Im underground for life this shit is a sellers market
The rich get richer the po get mo greedy
We need Clarance A to get whats owed in these board meetings
Rappers catch Ls after just squeezing em four Feezys
Crackers pattern themselves after the teachings of Morris Levy
But I was dubbed the greatest by the gossip
Im King Tut to haters from this Spyder cockpit
Its Jacob custom makes me fire watches
Inspired by Cool J drivin Saabs
With Cut Creator right beside him drivin Mazdas
I was labeled drugrelated by the coppers
A government that through the republic
Has been subjugated by the mobsters
Martin got shot on the Lorraine balcony became alchemy
Was spit on at the hospital when suffocated by the doctors
Michael was sniped at six at night precisely by a laser
Mac Miller died pleadin for his life reciting Gods prayer
Immaculately conceived the product of Nas labor
Aint shit like me Im Chris Lighty Im Violator
Dedicated to the edification of sellin blackness
I feel like Dame yellin at Kevin Liles over leather jackets
Prince when he told Nas Own your masters or you ass out
Best rapper between Cardi and Meg Thee Stallion is Kash Doll


Overcomer
This Detroit energy Im on forever
Shout out to everybody who made it out  Overcomer 
And remember God doesnt call the qualified
He qualifies the called thats Christine Caine
Overcomer
The energy never dies when you a overcomer  Overcomer 
The energy never lies when you a overcomer  Overcomer 
Oh yeah
The station that keeps you in the groove
SaintTropez
It is that kind of weekend
Keepin it cool laughin with friends family
