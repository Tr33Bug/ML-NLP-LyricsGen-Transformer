As the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum
As the Lord swings the pendulum

When it aint nothing left to be for these hoes but a bitch
Aint nothing left to heat on the stove but a brick
Aint nothing left to eat for the po but the rich
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Time to divvy up your pieces with the deal
All my people gon be speaking what they feel  What they feel 
All my people gon be eating what they kill  What they kill 
Rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Nigga we gon rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
We gon rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Roll this weed with your degrees up in Hell
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum

All yall dudes is straight facades you just lie and scheme
Mark Cuban round your shooters you just buy a team
Started beef on IG and hide behind a meme
Dark secrets closet probably look like Halloween
Yall come out the closet just to market yall new garbage
Im inside your bitch apartment dick is parked about nine inches in the carcass
Like Mister Marcus
Too narcissistic to be licking carpet
Too artistic to nut this a catharsis
Fuck all that shit you talking
Yall wont stand yall wont kneel all yall with is marching
Hard labor for your racist Caucasian bosses
Talkin straight into a wire while its taped across you
Im still learning wheels turning tryin to get the fortune
My side chick is still burning out my dick is scorching
Talkin bout I think Im pregnant Im not with abortion
Any child that slides out you is an instant orphan
Thats why its nothing left to be for these hoes but a bitch
It aint nothing left to heat on the stove but a brick
It aint nothing left to eat for the po but the rich
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Time to divvy up your pieces with the deal
All my people gon be speaking what they feel  What they feel 
All my people gon be eating what they kill  What they kill 
Rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Nigga we gon rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
We gon rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Rob the rich and leave em with the fucking bill
Roll this weed with your degrees up in Hell
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum
As the Lord swings the pendulum
Round and round the Lord swings the pendulum
Your video got four million hits
Oh shit somebody told you Youre rich
You been mixing up your passion with your goals for that fix
For that rose for that risk for that blow for that sniff
I was still a  slave just four hundred years ago
Going massive for a cracker wearing a robe
And I just did a deal for my masters and my soul
For that whip whole clan is in the Phantom
Damn the roles have been switched
Look Im tryna just survive until my payday
Dodging these piranhas tryna rob me thots around me hollering Date rape
This bitch thats with me now all she like to do is kiss and sixtynine
All she gets is time shit I aint signed to TreyWay
Now Im falling in a downward spiral
My main ho is Bow Wows side ho with model in the bio
Im startin to sound dated
Cause I aint paid attention to the climate since the NaeNae
I remember sprayin Cris hanging playin Hurricane Chris Ayy Bay Bay
Now Im syrup sipping cant sniff playin Dre Day
Now dont nobody come and kick it damn Pel
Wishin that I had one wish playin Ray J
I feel like Im sittin on a plane thats goin down
And Im a pigeon with no wings sayin Mayday
Calm down its your pilot first class the way you flyin
Fuck them niggas thats in coach
They too far cant see you rollin
Mad that Coach designed your coat
I seen it all before oneminutelater shit
The next one niggas aint gotta commode to take a shit in
Now they in they feelings reminiscin
Talkin bout Remember when in nigga no I dont
If it aint business we aint never spoke
Dont try to stop me when Im in the airport
To take a pic cause I wont even pose with you posers
Sorry I dont know ya
On my mama nigga
This my shit nigga Im taking it right now nigga
2019 is my year
I recorded the whole mixtape in 24 hours nigga
And I dropped it the next day on MyMixt
You niggas is trash bruh making all this trash ass fucking music bruh
Saturatin the fucking game bruh get the fuck out of my wave bruh
I sat back 2018 I sat back 2017 and watch all you lame ass rap niggas bruh sit down and fuck the whole rap game up bruh
Trolling and shit bruh
