You want what for Christmas Hell no
What you mean Is this is all we got
Thats it
Its Christmas time in the Montgomery home
Daddys actin all crazy again
Mama got herself a bloody nose
Daddy slapped her in the face again
Why they always gotta fight so much Damn
Mama face swole me and my bros in a panic state
If thats the case yo I cant just stay around this
Everything was fine we just had dinner we got all the HeMans
Battle Cat Adam and Cringer even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain
Now we sit and listen to yall argue about how yall planned this day
And yall just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin
Now I gotta go and console him
He wasnt nothin but a spoiled little boy then
Little naive with an innocent cry all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us
And yall bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put em in a real Timberland box
I never forget them boots they was called Rugged Outbacks
Mama went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin
Then Pop came in like he aint know nothin about it
Like Judy you gon send that boy out in public like that
Hell be just fine these kids aint bout to be
Lookin down at his feet for no tree and she really meant that
Meanwhile this little arrogant nigga caught himself stuntin on me and Greg with em talkin about Where yall Timbs at
But he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like Nigga where yo Timbs at Pfhaha
Its Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home
Greg just came in here drunk again
Now mama tryna cover for him
She afraid my daddy gon punch him again


Why you gotta get drunk so much Damn
I wish you would just stay where you was at
Instead of comin home all rude and disrespectin all our father rules and shit man
The mood done switched me and Vishis playin Connect Four
Our favorite movie just came on the tube and its ironic its Bloodsport
And Im lookin at Frank Dux and shit thinkin you should split
Before Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted
But he just cut me off like That nigga aint gon do shit
But the truth is this he couldnt whoop my dad even if he was sober
I know cause he tried once
Ended up unconscious a broke arm and a tooth was chipped
My big bro got a lot of emotional problems he feel that we was all abused as kids
He saw mama get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two
And this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine poor thang
He had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk he gets to losin it
He gets the illusion that he gon protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf
Stand up to him and prove some shit
But all he really doing is stressin mom out
Got her goin Boy you know your daddy up there asleep
The food is ready why dont you stop
Making all this noise and just let him stay sleep
The turkeys done in the Montgomery home
Dad has just been awakened again  Uh oh 
Greg is making all kinds of noise
Dad is on his way angry again
Who is that making all that God damn noise  Not me 
Greggy  Huh  get up here You been out there drinking again
What the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit
Nigga where the fuck you done been
Im thinking to myself Greg please dont say nothin stupid man
Every time my daddy in his drawers and hes standing in the hallway
Mad at somebody I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman  Sniff 
My brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen
Without even givin an answer with his back to him like I aint gotta talk to you nigga
Nigga you dont hear me talkin to you
Next thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just dont do
He looked him right in his eyes and he asked him
What the fuck is you gon do  Mm mm mm 
My father hit him so hard his body hit the stove
The oven door hit the fucking floor
The turkey fell out the oven hole and landed near the stairs
Now Daddy standin over Greg talkin bout Nigga you aint hurt Get up get up
And here come Vish talkin bout Dad I dont think he gon get up
Then mama went damn near hysterical  Ahh 
She called the police the police came
Neighbors is all in the street
Watching the cops takin my father out in handcuffs
Damn man that shit was real embarrassin
To all my friends I grew up wit who grew up fatherless
I know through me you live vicariously
I want you to know that we aint no better than you and yours
We all needed therapy
We care about each other more
Than we care about if anybody understands us
What Im tryin say is Fuck you and Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family
Every man reaches that point in life
Where he dont want to make excuses no more more
Life took me on a rollercoaster ride
Ive been up Ive been down all the ribbons and my daddy game
Took me on highs
Turned around and then took me on lows  This is how the story goes 
Ohh then I think about it
I use that shit as fuel
Then I changed it into
Power  now cant you feel it  Cant you feel it Cant you feel it 
Cant you feel it  Cant you feel it 
That Im a grown man with  Power  yeah  Yeah 
Let me hear you say yeah  Yeah 
If you was raised in a strict home like me felt alone like me
And it gave you  Power  ooh
You can do it too just look at me
See Im a grown man with  Power  yeah  Yeah yeah  everybody say yeah
If you dont know the meaning of abusive
Youve been through so much aint nothin nobody can do to you
Now cant you feel it  Cant you feel it  Im a runaway
This is how I became a grown man with  Power 
Ooohh you can do it too if I can do it
Use this  Power  I was a runaway I was a runaway
There aint nothin none of you can do to me do to me
When you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny
Did you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you
Absolutely absolutely
All my friends daddies was walking out on them left and right
You know he never left us he was always there for us
You know there were a lot of things that happened that I didnt understand
Maybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager
But I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man
You know cause he taught me respect and discipline
And consequences for your acts so yeah of course
Do you think his approach as a father
Really shaped the type of father that you are today
Or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it
And if so what kind of negative traits
Do you try to avoid having as a father right now to me
When you have your own youll understand
