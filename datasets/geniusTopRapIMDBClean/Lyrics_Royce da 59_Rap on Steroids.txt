Jahlil beats holla at me
Philadelphia meet Detroit
Time to shut your mouth  where your money at 
Now its time to show these motherfuckers whats the fuss about  time to go 
What you dealing with lyrically
A couple lyricists who dont miss
Niggas ask if Black and Nickle get together for an album what you gon get
You gon get rap on steroids rap on steroids
Niggas thats silencers on the nozzle
You wont feel the clap youll only hear the noise
Yall got these hoes pegged so wrong while you hotel checkin
I gotta pay these hoes just to keep their clothes on like Im Odell Beckham
Im flyer than a hat on Elroy
I just took it back to the Jetsons
I with the static like I got a Crooked I
Near an open exit with a bad connection
Cause no matter where you go
Youre fucked if this rubber grip roll back in your direction
What you lookin at Thats for your protection
This that rap on steroids nigga that rap on steroids
I just spit more clairvoyant raps
Than it take to make you half paranoid
Clap a gun at any day or night
Stand over his body then pray to Christ
Like you gave me life so Im gon throw you back one dear lord
Imma throw back one like Fab on the Gram
Garage look like its sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole ave going HAM
Yall dont know with what yall are dealing
Im on every block my team bigger
Cause I rap anything I wanna got
The only thing I dont got is feelings
Nigga my mind so clear
Feels like every thought is visine drippin
No Im not a lean drinker but over that Fetty Wap I lean niggas

Rap on steroids

Yall ran into me on the wrong day
Fuck strong Jay do gon say
Just bear arms you in harms way
You hear alarms you in Bombay
No Baghdad get the gas mask
Run break do a maddash to that gun safe
You unsafe in the right place to get blast at
And thats anybody
I stay on that anabolic
Im far from anatomically correct
Hos call me that anaconda
Roll a sack of that Santa Barbara
Lead poisonin in the damn water
Flint Detroit Ann Arbor
Philadelphia and Harlem
Roid rage yall damn problem

Thought trifle the assault rifle
Got a twin brother like Irv Gotti Im 
Probably back on steroids
Kinda like crack on steroids
Lou Ferrigno super negro
Gon and pack your steroids
Nigga my memoirs Renoirs
Everything I do is fine art
Putting rappers in that pine box

And if lifes a bitch we gon Rohypnol her
