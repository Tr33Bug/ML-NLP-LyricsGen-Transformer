Motherfucker say what
Yeah
White Jesus taught you heathens cross you niggas just to stone you
Knowledge empowers all you quicker than ignorance disarms you
I hate to see Tee Grizzley going through shit he shouldnt be going through
I hate to see Shady respond to shit he shouldnt respond to
I hate that your Commander In Chief is more demander and thief
And it seems like this boy just cant be impeached
I cant be under the thumb of one who seems to be attracted to his own daughter
Why should we not set up shop
We black we are our own barbers
But even a jewel from a fool is still a gem
A dudell put more energy in killing you than healing him
We went from riding in Yugos to buying sumo statues
When you fall from that level of flying who gon catch you
Pac and Biggie died for you rappers so you dont have to
Martin and Malcolm died for your blackness pursue your masters
I wore that rhinestone doorag so you dont have to
Ima need you to Google that too
I wore a rhinestone doorag but you dont have to
Next generation its on yall
