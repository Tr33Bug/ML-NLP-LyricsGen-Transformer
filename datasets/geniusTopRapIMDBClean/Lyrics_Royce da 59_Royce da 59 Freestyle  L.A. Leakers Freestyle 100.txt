Royce da 59 Freestyle  LA Leakers Freestyle 100 Lyrics
Thou shalt not fuck with Detroit me
Never owned a Coogi Ford truck or a pair of them gator Mauris
Please hold your applause for these parables and stories
Give all praise to Allah to God be the glory
My Papa raised me like Im a dog with rabies
Playin da ha da ha in the drop Mercedes
Drivin with the chopper daily
Pupils dilated like Im Sada Baby
Nozzle on that gun larger than the one on that Gaga lady
Play with my time like Im a playful don
My arm comes out the car my window down like Im tryna borrow some Grey Poupon
First these bitches hate it then they love it then they hate to love it
Im straight with publishin I dont care if the radio stations stubborn
You haters busters Im David Ruffin
Itll take me nothin to put your life on a dollar menu right there by the Egg McMuffin
While you boys totin Glocks snortin rocks and importin thots
Im floatin with forty knots to the bag like Im a border cop
Any artist in hiphop fuck with Nickel stock sure to drop
Especially if he Russell Wilson good guy sorta pop
You sure to die pallbearers bring flowers hes mortified
Me and Porter got the same stayin power that hoarders got
Whoever Superman I got kryptonite in these hands
But Id rather soup a man leave you liquefied with these cans
I dont care if you rap niggas is trendin topic your shit is garbage
You couldnt make a classic out of that trash if you had Brenda drop it
You at the rental car spot Enterprise while Im enterprisin
I dont cop my whip without coppin rims and a body kit and my tint is darkened
Closest Ima probably get to window shoppin
Ive been a real nigga since the beginning
I did it without the ridiculous gimmicks or pretentious pretending
I was taught the sky is the limit by way of Fenkell and Plymouth
But my only limit is sticking my dick in a chick with a blemish
I speak from a frequency that was meant to uplift the antennas
I sing with the intention to riff with The Tenors my gift is tremendous
I didnt get rich and forget the incentive
Im never buying into religion or soliciting sinners my nigga
We attribute the original wave we articulate
Through bricks of yay zipped up on 18wheelers on interstates
We distribute weight then matriculate into real estate
Then we assimilate powder dealing they probably stillll hate
Me and Em came through did the original Renegade
Gave that shit to Jay then spit a gem on stage at DillaDay
Used to rock the byzantine mix Croc with the grenadine
Euthanize the blocks with a sinner they tend to intervene
Snitchin is a sin as mixing your linen and denim jeans
Growing up blowing up was a long shot like drone shots or limousines
In between Greyhounds and Jim McLean
Dome shot a cop with a stray round like Slim and Queen
Its bout time we invest in our mental status
I write rhymes for Anunnaki slave ancestors on emerald tablets
Today we raging on Vegas stages with bass guitars
Yesterday was agents chasing us aprons and mason jars
Planets align in orbit
My mind absorbs it the finest orifice
Therefore my soul can glow in divine proportions
You niggas snitchin you need to stop your beefin
Cops crooked wearing swat stickers attending Nazi meetings
Liberace Nickel rock gems Timbs and Huarache sneakers
The caine made me able to drop the deacon and go off the deep end
Yall so weak I forgot the weekend
Philosophical syllables seamstress speaking in a biblical Fibonacci sequence
When that bar drop you feel your life pass you by from your farside
I got more poppin bros than DeBarge got
I suppose I compose art like a Bartk chart high
Especially now that Im steppin outta that economic apartheid
They left us out of the archive
Im definitely probably a marked guy
My weapons out and Im wetting yall like Im webbing out of a sharks eye
Stepping out of a hard top on the 7 Mile and Oak Park I
Where several bodies get hogtied and left inside of the chalk lines
10 toes standing on granite floors a Mosano porch
Hoes snortin Xanax Roseanne endorse a Gauguin of sorts
Culture vultures know I wont stand for shit I cant enforce
Labels know my name aint on paper or dough I cant endorse
Cordae you know youll always be my lil man of course
Dont let Atlantic destroy your standings playin mechanic horse
Pass the torch and walk away a hammerthrower my hands of force
Slap Michael Rapaport cross the face at the Gansevoort like
Thats for Meek
Drop a Lonzo Ball corpse off on Nas porch dog thats for the blasphemy
No apathy inside the mind of white supremist with cognitive dissonance most compromised position for blacks to be
They cast stones and sticks at the rap throne of drip and the coin flips and
Well all you gon get back is a splash from me
I rap ridiculous craft ubiquitous
I have you niggas swimming where the bass and the fishes is ask Vishis
Yeah I piss off the critics Im Master P
The heavy metal was always strapped to me fore there was ever a Yela rapper beef
Throwing choppers in runbys
Unloading them outta Hyundais
Lotus shoppin in Mumbai
Thats my modusoperandi
My portfolio expands
Income from the slick sayings
While the FBI tryna give the M1 to the stickman
Spit them braggin bars grab your balls thats the speech from all
They told us money talks aint tell us wealth dont speak at all
You a fan of ours or you not a fan of art
Im a dog baller for Los Angeles broads my cannon bark jam and spark
And it talk brrrrrrt skip brrrrrt hold up skip
Man this bitch sounding like Shannon Sharpe
Dont get your soul thrown to the deacon by way of this weekends news
For violating a dude like me for publicity and views
Shorty dont get this 40 and this Colt 45 misconstrued
Cause you new school dudes got Billy Dee confused
I rather watch Floyd May flash in a Gucci store a day
Than work for a asshole who get mad at me askin for a raise
Cop a new cottonpicking Aston in gray just for the slaves
You niggas current Nickel was born and raised to destroy a wave
Rather give these young uns directions stead of ignore they ways
Plant trees so all my advancees can enjoy the shade
6040 ventures while tryna make 60 40 ways
Paid 40K just for the Js before the Yes
Glass door attached to a castle exquisite foyer
Side door trapped through the silver screen Sidney Poitier
Flash gold on stage stoneface just for The Spades
Paid 50K for the stone flakes thats 40 yays
Back when the 1990 west met the shiny vest
I had Tommy S tryna sign me next
Mazi Mani Lex drysnitching yall probably find him wet
Tell your AR and PR that yall aint shit without your tiny desk
