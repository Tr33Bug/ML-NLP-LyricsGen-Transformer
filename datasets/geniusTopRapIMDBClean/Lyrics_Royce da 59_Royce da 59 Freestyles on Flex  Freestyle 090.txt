Im ridin with the K solo Im spellbound
Used to ride with Delilah and Nicole in the Fairmount
Im who incite the riot you the guy at the staredown
I worked at Taco Bell now I just fire the shell rounds
Now somewhere in the air lies the truth like a thunderstorm
I terrorize the youth as if Im gunnin for em
I couldve jogged here I marathon the booth and let it run its course
The Rs here Im paralyzin you like the underscore
Your riders couldnt impress my chauffeurs
Your favorite artist couldnt benchpress my notebook
I transcend like WuTang to all eras cash rules
Now Im just dead nice the pallbearer of bad news
Shouts to all my niggas out there in the locks of crime
Remember they can lock your body but cant lock your mind
You lack triumph when you stop the grind
You rappers Blac Chyna went and got your bread and went and got behind
Gun professor Ill punch whoever
Come here lookin like Conor McGregor
Leave this bitch lookin like Uncle Fester
Question are we bitter rivals
Cause we can shoot the Ks or the fade
Til both of our arms get vitiligo
I stay in my prime yall niggas just sippin on scotch
I stayed with my nine yall niggas just live with your pops
I sit in the original lyrical pivotal spot
Even though I changed with the time like digital clocks
Either goin straight for the kill
Gunslingin or Im goin straight up Jada and Will I come swingin
I write for BIG and 2Pac
Im rollin like the prices on the coupe dropped
Im dolo like a snipers on the rooftop
Im sicker though Im feelin like the flu shot
I shit on every artist on the charts and leave a diaper on the jukebox
My minds like the Japan bullet train it floats in cycles
Rhyme full of pain spoken right out the smokin rifle
They wanna see me tweetin Yo man who need a feature
Id rather squeeze until the Colt jam like Lisa Lisa
Im 59 givin niggas them 69 fears
We can battle like them Grind Time kids
How about this how about I take your wifey on tour with me
And never give her back same way my nigga Big Sean did
I go hard til 2088 my father was crazy like Hailie Jade
Still I was born a Saint like Baby Ye
I prayed hard and only God I fear
You just plain playin God lookin like James Harden without his beard
These niggas hoes man its sickening
They only goals is get some golds and bitches and
Get on the Gram wearin a Roc Nation hat
But anybody who anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was
But anybody whos anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was bein witnesses
So run along with your little microwave hits
All you niggas is my light work like the day shift
Yeah right now Im finally respected
Until the day that Im finally neglected
And Im fallin Im callin all kind of pyrotechnical fires in the sky over Heaven
During my final eclectic spiral to die right on the steps
As if I dont accept it
If it aint green I dont see it Im colorblind
With my eye on the exit with my other eye on the double line
On the essence and any other kind of successes of the grind
Dominoes with destiny Ill forever be fuckin fly
Im fired with flows top five and you know
Im happy at platinum but I was happier
Back when 500 thousand was sold
My proudest accomplishment now
Was when I got quiet to get sober
And silence is gold
I let my whole story fly at no cost to the people
While Im talkin to Joe no Budden
Im talkin Joe Walsh from the Eagles
No stuntin we just wrote somethin
My demise was sposed to be weeks ago keep your smoke comin
Im over here with 500 styles like a savant
You wanna see me washed 500 pounds like Im Avant
Hair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc or Jaheim
Only way Im goin out is gunshots or sirens
We make paper you party we play Vegas
Nothin but sirens surroundin me when we play wagers
Im fuckin the bitch of my dreams and we they favorite
My BMWi green like DeRay Davis
I be givin bitches orders like they mothafuckin grandpa
Trappin is for rappers I be grindin like the dancehall
I dont know astrology I just know Im a Cancer male
Eatin south of France he who doubts the man cant prevail
Back when Guru used to manifest the rhyme
I was known for nothin less than just a candidate for crime
In and out of Ibiza spendin power a Visa
Standin the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
In my Dzone so the bitches gon sweat it
Got the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit
Got the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and DayDay with
The 38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with


Everybody comin with they hit record big record
This gon play in the clubs radio chick record
Either that or they come with a diss record
I come from where you dont disrespect none of your successors
I dont fuck hoes that I cant leave in less than six seconds
Who the best is a horrible rhetorical sick question
You guessed it Im throwin bullets at you but you aint about to go for long
Ill pull the 44 and let it bang like Post Malone
Might as well get ready for your tomb you play me
Tell your wife she gon be solo soon like Swae Lee
Quarter pills recoupin the deal worth a quarter mill
All Im tryna do is stay Black and get out like Jordan Peele
Everybody do it for the accolades Im tired of them
I aint cared about Grammys since Jay boycotted them
Spent my first advance at Mannys followin Pharrell and them
Used to ask bitches for ass now Im just tellin them
If I get anymore fly Ima need my own space suit
Got these hoes gettin naked like they high on K2
All I need is five minutes every style get augmented
Wellendowed in Gods image never smiled Kawhi Leonard
These pellets of pedophiles comin out this arm bro
They touchy trust me Dudley Arnold
My show start at 12 and it sold out by 11
Rappers blow up then they debut they whole album on Ellen
Aint nobody fresher than him that dealt with more pressure than him
Never dealt with niggas whose image is skinny stretchy denim
Just remember everyone who with me winners
Everyone who with you dinner
Bitches switchin quick as Bruce and Krissy Jenner
Chrome rims on the whip just to shine on niggas
Black tires the lip white Tyrone Biggums
We givin out turkeys on Thanksgiving like Nino with us
We even passin out TVs like Wendy Williams
All I know is that Im the wild child
Yall dont want no smoke with these bars
All yall niggas know is yall SoundCloud
Lets hypothetically say Im pissed
I would definitely AR grip I would definitely spray off quick
Yall expectin me to hesitate to shoot this bitch
Then yall are definitely in the playoffs with JR Smith
Ill definitely put my hand in your pockets but not the way you want
Ill put your whole family in boxes like yall the Brady Bunch
I go bananas too miraculous to react to mortal mammals
Cookin crack in my new velour pajamas
Gettin back to my roots rap where I store them hammers
Lore the grammar my IQs my actual quarterpanel
My IP address is my dresser drawer
I aint stressin less its war I aint said shit less is more
I bet you youll die less of my irons legend for regrettin gore
Ghost whiter than the driven snow and its headed north
Lookin like its four of the seven dwarfs flows and metaphors
Bury skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus
Why these niggas gettin they hair dyed and they nails polished
Im like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big Ls body
I dont relate to common folk they focus on the comments
So Ima go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold your honorable niggas is sheep
Niggas asleep bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connectll give you a whole kilo of coke
So he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein the Holy
Jesus of flows he the GOAT
Baaaaaah that should be my tag
Im from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery themin ball its debauchery schemin
Allah and Jesus its hard to believe
Im a product of Eve in the Garden of Eden
Thinkin how targeted weve been
Rihannas stalker Im parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end
Put these paws on you Ill soften your defense
Hit your pause button halt your critiquin
Talk is cheap the more I hear you talkin it cheapens
And all I see is prey round the streets today
Im bout a freak away from havin Issa Rae eatin out Lisa Raye
Any artist out that you see is great
Tell him I said bring his ass better bring his A
Let his single play
We dont care what you sing
Hit you in your face with the butt of the gun
You leak and give your street credit a few streams
Pop go to weasel nigga fever nigga Im the illest
You got pop culture fever nigga
All I know is BIG and Pac quotes
Pop toaster squeeze the triggers season tickets
Now I pull the cops over give them niggas season tickets
Wifey used to shoot me down vicious now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga prolly got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now a nigga grow up my groceries in twoseaters
Used to roll the oldschool four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin with nothin but raw quarter packs in duffles
Ryan writes heaters
Yall niggas is cut like one of them Get Rich or Die Trying wife beaters
Me Im just all shoulder straps and muscle
If youre a hater lets do it
Ill whip you now then Ill whip on your boy later
Them whippingsll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I dont do Rodeo or ayos I do the Floyd Mayo
So many men shoppin in womens section it aint no ladies left
You niggas crazy yes
You playin crazy like the Chappelle sketch Wayne Brady ep
Im what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine 80s met
Im bringin bars back to the street like Jay and Nas beef
