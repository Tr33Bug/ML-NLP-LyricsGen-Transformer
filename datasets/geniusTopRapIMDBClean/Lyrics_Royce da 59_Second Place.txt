Second Place Lyrics
Nickel, tell 'em what it is
(This is a world premiere)

Look, I'm in a zone for reala
In a freezer with Medusa, I'm fucking a stone-cold killer
Your bitch vibing, I'm inside her and I tell your kids this:
Daddy's been doing more dick riding than Kari Wigton
I'm very venomous, you very innocent and
I will send a monster to your house, call him Harry Henderson
Oh my God, I was just in jail, then the
Devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell
You niggas counting me out can get the riches still
You're all in the Matrix, shoulda picked a different pill
You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg will go
The height of my game is like DeMar DeRozan vertical
No one understands me, only one sicker than me is Em
I'm the new 'D' MC, it runs in the family
"Man why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time?
Man that nigga wouldn't even be rich without that nigga"
Shut up faggot!

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
My wedding with the streets got the cake but no vows
I'm arrogant as fuck, who cares? You suck
Rappers talking about "We the best" have been to Paris too much
Who hot? Who sick? Shit, I'm like a Theraflu slush
Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the parachute up-up
I'm a face-slapper, niggas sleeping on an outfit
Call us Taylor Gang 'cept we Wake and Bake rappers
Slaughter/Yelawolf responsible for haters' actions
Y'all on Gilligan's Island, find a greater Captain
Ha-ha, victory laugh
Even my photographer's happy, picture me mad
I feel well, your bitch sucked my dick, I nutted on the floor
Left her standing there crying over spilled milk
You might also like
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

My swing's like chains on a playground
I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound
My theory of you is: you lie and you drink beer
And I ain't hearing ya so you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler, 100-round Thumper
Bulletproof what? You gon' need an underground bunker
I aim where you should go
I put my whole life on the net, even my weapons
I am Bazooka Joe, ugh
We the shit, nigga eat a dick
We'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks
I'm going yelling Shady everywhere
Smacking niggas' bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear
To you and your man: ain't gon' be no Talladega Night
I come to question y'all and y'all don't know what to do with your hands
Nickle Preme, killer team
At a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
