Let the beat play Broady
Uh solidarity like that muscle we refuse to flex
That synergy that these niggas just refuse to tap into
In our disparity match our hustle we exude success
Attack us mentally thats that energy kings get trapped into
Therefore Im done promoting the dumb shit
Ill put a hole in your son while hes holding your Sun Chips
While youre over there with a chip on your shoulder
Like you Hova or some shit
Your flow is redundant Ill separat your body from soul
Now your body is cold spiraling out of control
Now youre over ther body odor is pungent
For coming out of your body over assumptions
Look at all this passive aggressive pussying
All the past neglectful positions these pussies put me in
We them cool niggas bringin food liquor and fullies in
They do all the yelling and accuse Nickel of bullying
Cruelty to MCs Is intellectual vibrato
Run up full speed hit niggas with the message like Wallo
I bleed mint leaf
I grieve mentally in sync with NeYo and Stevies sensory
I squeeze until the Eagles completely empty
Im 3 Dimentry now feed me MCs Im greed and envy
Carlito watch me go repo yall sweeties Bentley
I skid mark through these thoughts with a narcs commit larceny
I live hardly to incarcerate me is to kill softly
Eitheror its me or its Bill Cosby
They tryna kill a Lord online premature as Biz Markie
Cant expect you to like me more than you love rap beefin
You respect white people more than you love black people
Shit I let you waste where the apes ate
I SMH I let you naysay yall legends aint safe
I desecrate Flex I decorate Sway
I estimate a hundred left I let the Kay slay
I dont carry suitcases on big runs to malls deep
I dont carry big guns to a small beef
I dont really care what Mickey Factz has to say add Lupe
Thats touche I dont care for big gums and small teeth
You know the gold all froze if Ima purchase bling
Just so you know not a soul walkin the Earth this mean
Bow before the king kiss the GOAT allpurpose ring
While the God poses like a BowSoulja Verzuz meme
Yall with all the jokes laugh hard but yall ridiculous
Im with all the smoke Matt Barnes ShaCarri Richardson
Proving rap pays through the Wraiths cache
Im the dude they threw the case at like 8track tapes
Blew eight stacks at Peter Lugers til its your faith at stake
Who waves at the Louis haters through the new Maybach drapes
We gon do this for Kanye if you can relate thats Drake
We come shootin for Conway Ruger your face back straight
A hundred and seventy on the dash
All the felonies and the demonic acts
With devils like Vlad always selling me all of the trauma back
I speak to cabarets as a deviation Of drama
Pastors in wave caps as a recreation of honor
Glad to appreciate black abbreviations of genres
Battle me AAP thats for PDA with Rihanna
These male betas with crying attitudes I aint mad at you
My kind of fabric is well tailored to a Byron Allen suit
You are you are a superstar a superstar
But usually Im choosing peace of Heaven or Taxstone
From using celery ranch to moving into a new elegant ranch home
A true MC yall doing them regular degular dance songs
You losin your teeth moving like using Kevin Durant comb
We sheddin light whenever the mic and drums get blacked on
The bed of knives the never polite and young relaxed on
Here comes the Thundercats song karate beef Miyagi
Keep it completely boxer brief dont dadun dadun get waxed on
And thats the Ritz
Im staying tonight for writing the scripts that last long
I like my crackers dead and white just like them shits that Shaq own
Call me Big Cialis if she stalk then switch my address
Give Viagra dick diagonal lick her walls and its Niagara
This androgynous fly actress Im involved with is my Astra
Lick my ass and if yall askin if Im gaspin its my asthma
Yall listenin to the master whose been talking to the masses
Whose been listening to thy master through this targeted diaspora
Yall get awards to get in wars I spit water dilution
Im ballin I hit record Im gettin courted by Lucian
The Lord abuses the blacker culture with actors like Rapaport
Rap your chorus distract you boys just to lower the nooses
The more important the news is more distorted the views is
Vax all they employ Lou to exploit the movement
To know its cops killing Blacks God is a mortal nuisance
Hole in your top thats the last straw like quarter juices
The more exclusive Dior or Gucci Imported boosters
Its still more juvies and 42s that the court accuses
I wish Nick Cannon the testicular fortitude
To forty new stepchildren to inject him with the cure to lupus
Pain aint even frequent just evil teasing the godly
It aint even inside me its just weakness leaving the body
I flipped my heritage redefined it to die in jail
Buy and sell for my clientele but without the Mayans help
Ryan big alliances clique of lions thats eyein elk
Built the giant pyramids in alignment with Orions Belt
Well you aint gotta lie you a hostile guy
Like you about to ride with new entourage but you not too wise
You been ostracized you used to rock with Nas
You was hot July but look at you now you just AfuRa
Loaded Lux said if we battle then he gon sit with Lu
I told him Youre dead if we battled now who gon sit with you
Im the great MC all the ladies see yall the latency
In HD and 1080p and this shit for publicity
You and Mick couldnt mix your written
And spit good as a pic of me
Stop it or sit with the Doc or quit with the hickory dickory
This Oscar de la Renta cloth is on a Kunta Kinte
Tutor for the school of pen play offering a fool the template
Its hard to differentiate ODog or who Larenz Tate
Judas From Ingrate who the students from who the sensei
The car the mascot far as moving packs on a back block
Nobody argue with Shaq while rooting Dikembe
Take your momma out on a date at the Barclays
Like Im Drake on the parquet call the Uber soon as the rent paid
When its the last shot with a second left
The second bestses and RJs need to get used to moving with MJ
Everybody Bronin or Allen Iverson cornrows
Heavy grindin on every island out of the Congos
I have not encountered violent exchange through a convo
So I dont holler I do the bodies Janes and John Does
We can kick it be specific or meet with my Timberland sole
Yall timid and bold yall feminine trolls pretending its smoke
Got bitches sniffin Armenian blow Im Benny Im Kenny and Cole
Im Bimmy and Po Ill hit my enemy and chalk any opposed
If Umi said you really the GOAT who tryna hit em the mos
Im hollering that we outside like my nigga King Los
I hardly heart you be outside unless yall be whispering low
We back outside quit lying ho you sound like Remy and Joe
No watch the reactions of your kids
Masculinity aint whats toxic the absence of it is
Im Jill Scott playin Gil Scott Heron
With Preem HER and DAngelo queen serving me cantaloupe
Hammock low swerve Lambs on Atlanta roads
Earl Animal Manigault furs lamb or the nana goat
The pearl handle where ammo go
Answer war with your girl nana or auntll go
Cancel cultures annual Santa Po is the anecdote
Cancer dont take for granted no family though
The streets wont hand us no manual so we go Hansel Emmanuel
You forgot the dude who about the Chi whose was locked inside
Without him youd be dead probably dread standing beside you
Fed salmon and lied to while the red camera disguise you
You violent but where was that for the Craig Kallmans and Kysers
Nine minute style about me I had to make fun of bro
I got plently problems my nigga rappin aint one of those
Rappin aint one of those
