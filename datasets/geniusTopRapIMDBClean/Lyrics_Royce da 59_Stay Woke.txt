Stay Woke Lyrics
Yeah, now you see what the Lord doin'
Rippin' pages out the book, I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall, I'm sober doin' what I enjoy doin'
I'm puttin Chavis Chandler on, had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah, every other day another star is born
And that's to freshen the decayin' of the art form
Fuck with my commas, shit will be quick
Got what's in my pocket out of the dirt, filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma, stay focused
Double entendre, I'm tryna vocally smoke you, you will be missed
The hocus, the pocus, magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit, loyalty, forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom, paintin' pictures of this
Historical war of attrition who's just, the dopest, the wokest
I'm five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me 'til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet, with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
'Cause I didn't want her, I needed her, though I didn't want her
I'm hot as July, no lie, I wouldn't lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth, don't expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now y'all scared of them shook niggas?
Jamal Crawford couldn't crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets
Uhh, "Best Rapper Alive" broadcasts in five
Four, three, two, one

I’m fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin' on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society, though I am a promise
I am a one-of-one like I’d say a Isaiah Thomas
You can’t fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac, I’m thinkin' of sinkin' your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I can’t fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
I'm private when I fly, I ball out like 'Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers, we just out here mobbin' like old Italians
Snatching your homie's necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries, I’m toe-to-toe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this .44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contra-esque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose, I can't go out like I’m Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin' in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware, pair of Pumas on
Looking like I’m aboard a Lear, headed to uniform
I’m so lyrically rare, I spearheaded the unicorn
You might also like
I was born a bold one, sugar-coated
All the way I'm livin' put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me, they say, "Ain't nobody did this, nah"
And if they don't, they shit been off, just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I won't break a fool, they don't want me to blow
But every single show, they hand out like I owe 'em
Already paid my dues and wordings, uh
But if I said it then they still won't know, so I won't waste my time on you
And speakin' on the level that ya never on, the way they hatin' so incredible
My writings on the wall, to you, it's so illegible
I'm invincible, you're sleepin' on me, I'ma stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah10Embed
