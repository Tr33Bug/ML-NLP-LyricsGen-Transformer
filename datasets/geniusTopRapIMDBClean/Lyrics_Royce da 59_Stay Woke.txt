Yeah now you see what the Lord doin
Rippin pages out the book I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall Im sober doin what I enjoy doin
Im puttin Chavis Chandler on had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah every other day another star is born
And thats to freshen the decayin of the art form
Fuck with my commas shit will be quick
Got whats in my pocket out of the dirt filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma stay focused
Double entendre Im tryna vocally smoke you you will be missed
The hocus the pocus magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit loyalty forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom paintin pictures of this
Historical war of attrition whos just the dopest the wokest
Im five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didnt want her I needed her though I didnt want her
Im hot as July no lie I wouldnt lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth dont expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now yall scared of them shook niggas
Jamal Crawford couldnt crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets
Uhh Best Rapper Alive broadcasts in five
Four three two one
Im fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society though I am a promise
I am a oneofone like Id say a Isaiah Thomas
You cant fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac Im thinkin of sinkin your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I cant fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
Im private when I fly I ball out like Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers we just out here mobbin like old Italians
Snatching your homies necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries Im toetotoe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this 44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contraesque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose I cant go out like Im Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware pair of Pumas on
Looking like Im aboard a Lear headed to uniform
Im so lyrically rare I spearheaded the unicorn
I was born a bold one sugarcoated
All the way Im livin put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me they say Aint nobody did this nah
And if they dont they shit been off just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I wont break a fool they dont want me to blow
But every single show they hand out like I owe em
Already paid my dues and wordings uh
But if I said it then they still wont know so I wont waste my time on you
And speakin on the level that ya never on the way they hatin so incredible
My writings on the wall to you its so illegible
Im invincible youre sleepin on me Ima stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
