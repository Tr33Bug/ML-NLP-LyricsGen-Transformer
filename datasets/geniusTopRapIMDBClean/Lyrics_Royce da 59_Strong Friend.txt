Reflections of your strong friend
You need to check up on your strong friend
Nobody ever checks up on the strong friend
Uh strong friend
I remember 2003 out hear screaming We next
I was grippin that 300 Rock  Rye Lexus GS
I put rhinestones in my durag I put on leather pants
I went to parties just for Bacardi I tricked I never danced
All my friends expect to be treated just as my next of kin
Eyebrows lift up if Im out with them and let them spend
The question is How is yall problems becoming my problems
Im already hiding all of my problems behind my pop problems
When I was nine seen my father beat the shit out of my momma
Im smilin right now Im trying not to cry about her
Alcoholic I just spent five thousand tryna buy bottles of Patron again
Now sing along with your strongest friend
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
Suicide its a suicide
You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength thats never gon end
The one with sense take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him the Devil play to win
I remember I had Maia Campbell in my Mercedes Benz
You probably thought she gave in to the plot of Satans sin
She got demons greater than you and I
And this message is to Denaun and to Shady you say we friends
Well take care of Lyric 80 and baby Quinn like they Hailie then
Well shit its my funeral yall should play all of my songs too
Hope my body look beautiful while I lay in my strong suit
Rumors spread about me that aint true thats how the fake do
If Im the strong friend then what the fuck do that make you
Check up on your strong friend uh
