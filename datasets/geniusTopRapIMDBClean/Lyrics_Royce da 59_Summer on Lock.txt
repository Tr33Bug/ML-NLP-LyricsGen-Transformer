Nigga Im so far ahead of my time Im bout to start another life

Curveball through the eye of the storm I am the calm fore disaster could strike
The rocks on that watch on that dial gon shine loud
On you hustlers who out there in brownstones like the Huxtables
Yall came to be euthanized I cant be dehumanized
I aint even human Im pane and communion wine
Cruisin in that Wraith dawg like we came to offend haters
Shoot a nigga face off like his neighbor is Tim Taylor
Racketeerin charge tennis match in the yard
Yall can finish that whack shit then its back to the gods
