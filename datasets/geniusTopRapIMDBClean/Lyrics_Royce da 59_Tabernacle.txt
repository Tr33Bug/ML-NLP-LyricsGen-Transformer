Yeah
I wanna share some shit with yall
All truth all truth
Uh like Im standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells ADATs DATs and gats
Uh my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic I grew up on 9 Mile
Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Now sometime around 95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah
Aye yall remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called
Sean Price be like Im not sure any yeah that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all day
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
I didnt want to be anything else
You know but my mom had plans for me
She wanted me to go to school so you know
Uh to make moms happy I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the openmic it was like a reunion
I was a shoein
I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like let me see
97 my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me uh
I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate
Okay now its December 28th my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girls people saying shes in labor
In the hospital right now 9th floor
I get on the elevator elevator stops on the 5th floor
Elevator opens up my uncles standing there crying
Now Im caught off guard Im like What the fuck
My uncle standing there like Ryan they that way
I walk out I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like theres some kind of drama happenin
I said What happened They like Grannys been in a bad accident
And it aint looking good Im like Man what
Im having a baby four floors up before I froze up
Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
My momma said The baby here yet I said Maybe
She said Maybe Baby go see
I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to bout nine til its that time
And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching whispering like Thats the one right there
Who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5
By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me the doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like Well keep you posted about the baby
Well keep you posted about your granny
I didnt like seeing my mama like that so I had to get out of there
Yeah I hit the stage at 1150 killed it
I got off at about midnight with about six types
Of different emotions floatin around inside me
Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
In the future just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin and how chasin this rap thing is aggravatin
But Ill get back I got the family waitin
I get to skatin
As soon as I get to the hospital they tell me that my granny didnt make it
She just died Im feelin helpless it hurt me
On the flip side my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Aint no denyin this is the power of God
I said I love you Granny and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here goodbye
This is how the story goes
Powerful day  now you know  powerful day  now you know 
Most significant day in my life
I mean aside from meetin my man Marshall
My son bein born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didnt live anywhere near that hospital
I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
It showed me that God is real God is real
And you know what they say God giveth God taketh away
