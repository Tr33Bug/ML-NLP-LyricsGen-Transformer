Thou shalt not fuck with Detroit MI
Never owned a Coogi Ford truck or a pair of them gator Mauris
Please hold your applause for these parables and stories
Give all praise to Allah to God be the glory
My Papa raised me like Im a dog with rabies
Playin da ha da ha in the dropped Mercedes
Ridin with the chopper daily
Pupils dilated like Im Sada Baby
Nozzle on that gun larger than the one on that Gaga lady
Play with my time like Im a playful don
My arm comes out the car my window down like Im tryna borrow some Grey Poupon
First these bitches love it then they hate it then they hate to love it
Im straight with publishin I dont care if the radio stations stubborn
Yall haters busters Im David Ruffin
Itll take me nothin to put your life on a dollar menu right there by the Egg McMuffin
While these boys orderin shots snortin rocks and importin thots
Im floatin with forty knots to the bag like Im a border cop
Any artist in hiphop fuck with Nickel stock sure to drop
Especially if he Russel Wilson good guy sorta pop
You sure to die pallbearers bring flowers hes mortified
Me and Porter got the same stayin power that hoarders got
Whoever Superman I got kryptonite in these hands
But Id rather soupaman leave you liquified with these cans
I dont care if you rap niggas is trendin topic your shit is garbage
You couldnt make a classic out of that trash if you had Brenda drop it
You at the rental car spot Enterprise while Im enterprisin
I dont cop my whips without coppin rims and a body kit and my tint is darkened
Closest Ima probably get to window shoppin
Alright were gonna try a new sound
Uh yeah yeah  Alright were gonna try a new sound 
Say goodbye to the good guy
I hotboxed on your block and I got the whole hood high
You know who all the dead niggas is they tryna look live
Instagram post bank accounts it wouldnt look right
Your favorite rappers sweet you look up to geeks
I wanna flip the world upside down and make all you niggas look up to the streets
I dont believe none of you frail niggas
A man should never be described as petite
I dont wait when its war Im on some now shit
Leave your mama prayin over beef I halal shit
All these foul styles goin round and yall allow it
No skill required the games overcrowded
So when a rapper say he can spit now I doubt it
You could listen to Future but just know who the now is
I get to share a stage with Nickel Nine thats crazy
We on tour with Eminem baby thats Shady
Room full of naked chicks surrounded by pussy
Cause I rap amazin you at the crib hatin
With your kittens lookin like the weird cat lady
Trippin watchin Xvids while Im with your exbitch til Im restless
Dont want me to send goons to investigate they fold niggas
And believe me its hard to find a coffin thats pretzelshaped
When goin to the special place
Say an extra grace black men in America aint just slaves
Long as the queen dont need nothin for  a seven
While Im still buildin credit outta debt
I know where Im headed I dont need the reverend
Royce gave me access to the lab I got the key to Heaven
