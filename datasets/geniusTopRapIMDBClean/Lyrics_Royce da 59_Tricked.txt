Trick weve been tricked
Tricked into thinking we need that we need this
Tricked into thinkin since we rap we get rich
Trick trick my nigga its a trick
Trick trick its a trick weve been tricked
Into thinkin that the art is a pie to be split
My nigga thats a farce its a lie weve been tricked
If you can name a record label guy takin risks
Then I can name a misdirected guy thats been tricked
Tricked this is why I dont fuck with them
Only thing they takin is your publishin
Watch you make mistakes in the court of public sin
Got you concentratin on hittin the club gettin spins
Ballin off of your budget thats at your expense
Your AR spendin five they deductin ten
Trick trick trick
Trick weve been tricked
Trick its a trick my nigga its a trick
Tricked into thinkin we need them to exist
Tricked into thinkin that my sister is a bitch
Thinkin that I can kiss these random bitches on the lips
Thinkin that my health is not an issue til Im sick
Forever havin issues with my brother thats a trick
Because we Crips and Bloods we kill each other thats a trick
Think because you do crime that you cannot fall victim
Think you can drink and drive not end up in car collision
From day one at the hospital they target our children
Say they gonna immunize em they somehow get autism
Incriminate myself on records speakin on my life
Expect to receive blessings out here cheatin on my wife
Trick trick its a trick weve been tricked
Trick trick my nigga youve been tricked
But I knew I never
But but I I never knew Id be
But but I I took the sweet life I never knew Id be
But I I took the sweet life I never but


The owners of them prisons are magicians thats a trick
Voila disappearin in the system thats a trick
Trick trick my nigga weve been tricked
Trick trick my nigga thats a trick
The pen is a black magic hat thats a trick
Pull your rabbit ass out and put you back thats a trick
Thinkin its a rite of passage for a black male
Aint a real nigga til you enter that jail
Its a trick its a spell
Youre bewitched its a L
Youre bigger than that prison like Mandela in the cell
Made you fall in love with sittin in a prison room
Then swept you under the rug with the wicked witchs broom
What about your son sittin in your bitches womb
Without you hes a thug prison business just resumes
Trick trick my nigga its a trick
Trick trick weve been tricked its a trick
Them 360 deals got em livin in your pockets
Now everything you gross is hittin different than your profits
Thinkin you the man cause you made a million dollars
They wave a magic wand Uncle Sam fill his wallets
Trick trick my nigga youve been tricked
Trick trick its a trick weve been tricked
Trick trick my nigga youve been tricked
Trick trick my nigga youve been tricked
Tricked into thinkin your amendments really matter
The right to bear arms was only made for Grizzly Adams
Trick trick my nigga youve been tricked
Trick trick weve been tricked its a trick
Thinkin your degree will have everything protected
A ghetto soundin name got your resume rejected
And politicians lie got their clever ways perfected
Cause puppet masters still control whoever they elected
Trick trick my nigga weve been tricked
