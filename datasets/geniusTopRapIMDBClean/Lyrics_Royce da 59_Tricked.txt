Tricked Lyrics
Trick
Trick, trick
It's a trick, trick
Trick, we've been tricked, it's a trick
Trick, we've been tricked

Tricked into thinking we need that, we need this
Tricked into thinkin' since we rap, we get rich
Trick, trick, my nigga, it's a trick
Trick, trick, it's a trick, we've been tricked
Into thinkin' that the art is a pie to be split
My nigga, that's a farce, it's a lie, we've been tricked
If you can name a record label guy takin' risks
Then I can name a misdirected guy that's been tricked
Tricked, this is why I don't fuck with them
Only thing they takin' is your publishin'
Watch you make mistakes in the court of public sin
Got you concentratin' on hittin' the club, gettin' spins
Ballin' off of your budget, that's at your expense
Your A&R spendin' five, they deductin' ten
Trick, trick, trick
Trick, we've been tricked
Trick, it's a trick, my nigga, it's a trick

Tricked into thinkin' we need them to exist
Tricked into thinkin' that my sister is a bitch
Thinkin' that I can kiss these random bitches on the lips
Thinkin' that my health is not an issue 'til I'm sick
Forever havin' issues with my brother, that's a trick
Because we Crips and Bloods we kill each other, that's a trick
Think because you do crime that you cannot fall victim
Think you can drink and drive, not end up in car collision
From day one at the hospital they target our children
Say they gonna immunize 'em they somehow get autism
Incriminate myself on records speakin' on my life
Expect to receive blessings out here cheatin' on my wife

Trick, trick, it's a trick, we've been tricked
Trick, trick, my nigga, you've been tricked

But I, knew, I never
But, but I, I never knew I'd be
But, but I, I took the sweet life, I never knew I'd be
But I, I took the sweet life, I never, but

The owners of them prisons are magicians, that's a trick
Voila, disappearin' in the system, that's a trick
Trick, trick, my nigga we've been tricked
Trick, trick, my nigga, that's a trick
The pen is a black magic hat, that's a trick
Pull your rabbit ass out and put you back, that's a trick
Thinkin' it's a rite of passage for a black male
Ain't a real nigga 'til you enter that jail
It's a trick, it's a spell
You're bewitched, it's a L
You're bigger than that prison like Mandela in the cell
Made you fall in love with sittin' in a prison room
Then swept you under the rug with the wicked witch's broom
What about your son sittin' in your bitches womb?
Without you, he's a thug, prison business just resumes
Trick, trick, my nigga, it's a trick
Trick, trick, we've been tricked, it's a trick
Them 360 deals got 'em livin' in your pockets
Now everything you gross is hittin' different than your profits
Thinkin' you the man 'cause you made a million dollars
They wave a magic wand, Uncle Sam fill his wallets
Trick, trick, my nigga, you've been tricked
Trick, trick, it's a trick, we've been tricked
Trick, trick, my nigga, you've been tricked
Trick, trick, my nigga, you've been tricked
Tricked into thinkin' your amendments really matter
The right to bear arms was only made for Grizzly Adams
Trick, trick, my nigga, you've been tricked
Trick, trick, we've been tricked, it's a trick
Thinkin' your degree will have everything protected
A ghetto soundin' name got your resume rejected
And politicians lie, got their clever ways perfected
'Cause puppet masters still control whoever they elected
Trick, trick, my nigga, we've been tricked5Embed
