Wait a Minute  Freestyle  Lyrics
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a goddamn minute
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait one fucking minute
Im looking at your year end list
Youre choosing rappers youre friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait wait wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean molly Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since The Message
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right out the cannon barrel
Through your wall closet through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair through your granite countertop
And I aint tryna stop it til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs nigga youre next
Wait a minute nigga
Ive been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex armed in navy warfare
Yall them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say its fuck the world then the worlds getting fucked
Eighty million different ways when Im finished with it
Then the worlds gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer
All Im tryna hear today is trap and drill
Its all downhill from here like Jack and Jill wait
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
Im giving all my hoes an ultimatum she my mascot
Im just tryna motivate her Im just popping
Shes just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get exonerated
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
Im Compton menace on school bus
Its documented boy prove what
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move bruh
The targets been destroyed boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
Im Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait wait wait a minute
I know you heard Im back in business
Im going harder than Tha Carter X
Im birds flapping independent
Im tycooning through the pressure
Im typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two Brinks truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle fuckboy dont run
Im live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
Its feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like say something
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me nigga this is God hustle
Phantom or the Vette
Tomi Lahren Charlamagne shit the odd couple
Wait wait wait a minute
Im primal if Im fuckin mating with her
I bend her over stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame you from Twitter fame
You had a chain thats your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
Im Cold Chillin on the record business
But I aint saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches
Im Talib Kweli with the blackness
Im most def with immigration
Ladies on top of ladies
Im Mos Def with immigration
Babies on top of babies
Wait a motherfucking minute
