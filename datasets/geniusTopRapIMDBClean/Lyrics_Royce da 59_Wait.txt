Shoot 
Trust the fuckin shooter
Being feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does
So I play to the tune of my own eardrum
While Im out on my quest love
I dont speak on behalf of myself but my impeccable rep does
Christmas morning I remember waking up
Wishin I could just go to sleep
Cause we only got like two toys a piece
I ask my pops did he do more for me
He said yes I got you clothes and heat
And let you keep a whole two rows of teeth
Ha Im royalty
I took whoopings I took losses but no defeats
Been dropped and been shelved with no release
Been in jail no commissary or relief
But God looks over me like a cross and rosary
Rifle in hand I let niggas have it I wont hesitate
Stripes on the cans in the cabinet section eight
My son got on them threefifty boots Kanye West is dressed in Bape
Askin me questions bout gettin to second base
Uhh wifey textin SMH house phone ringin off the hook
Conference calls from record labels guess Im late
But my other sons autistic he wants my attention
This just might be my defining moment let them wait
Its my time now nigga let them wait
Pick up the phone tell em hold let them wait
Old friends comin to they senses tryna reconcile
After I fell out with them well fuck them niggas let them wait
Wait Im here for that green for that mula
You scheme I see right through ya
Im regal like Akeem father King of Zamunda
One things for sure I think they do know
That me and Porter and Jake Uno
We dont play no games no we play sumo
We attempt to flatten into action
With all these average flaccid defenseless rappers
I have no problem killing like sent assassins
They tempers bad when my tempers graphic
They hide or they fly while Im high and flyer
Im intergalactic Ive been spectacular
Flippin like I invented spatulas my lyrics is futuristic
Im in here with my vintage ratchet with prints and scratches
My mental actually incapacitates fast as my passion
And pen surpasses my Aston
And leave a skid road in the street like Im into smackin
I fill my engine with acid
With my finger wrapped around a hairtrigger
That resembles lashes
I get into bitches quick and then I get distracted
Im like the stock market just like that my interest crashes
Like a cymbal my symbol should be expensive glasses
She with me she an afrocentric nympho chick with her ass did
She callin me backtoback for a second date
While my ex is callin for makeup dick let them wait
Money all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City
I weapon wave everybody step away
They said that we should go our separate ways in high school
Now they wanna jump the line in my shows let them wait
My whole life they pressured me let them wait
You rushin me you rushin excellence let them wait
Police in my rearview mirror with they sirens on
But Ima call my lawyer first fore I pull over let them wait


Its my time now nigga let them wait
Pick up the phone tell them hold let them wait
Old friends comin to they senses tryna reconcile
After I fell out with them well fuck them niggas let them wait
