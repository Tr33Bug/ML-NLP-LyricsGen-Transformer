Oh yes
This ones for those of you just aint woke yet hotep
You rich but you broke nigga just dont know yet hotep
These rappers aint woke yet security back em hotep
Hotep come to Detroit with that oh yes thats a toe tag
Might as well have Mayweather back ya at a Blacks matchup protest
Thats that Write a check you cant cash I might have to collect
Thats that yo ass is bleeding thats that Kotex
I massacre your whole rap allegiance oh yes
This ones for little bro who big bro aint come back from the store yet
Hotep Im here for blessings sent my direction no less
This ones for those who dont know they pops not invincible yet
Trick bitches hoes that dont know just how nasty they are
They out here wearin the same tongue ring they aint change from ten dicks ago yet
Hopefully that scope on that AR dont take my focus
To places where I put fakers in comas longer than daytime soapas
Any calendar day Ill hollow him like late October
Ill bury these niggas up under the Devils playground playtimes over
Your bitch fine dawg I cant deny it
She tryna be my wife on the side I aint invite it
I just step over the ring and hit the bitch like Andre the Giant
Papa used to beat on me often for not being perfect
Thots used to call me tar baby cops taught me that Id be worthless
Mama gave birth to only one dark child like Rodney Jerkins
That taught me to focus on whats inside yall and not the surface
