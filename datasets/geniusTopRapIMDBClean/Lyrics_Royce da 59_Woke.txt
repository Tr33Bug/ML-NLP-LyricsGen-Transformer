Woke Lyrics
Oh yes
This one's for those of you just ain't woke yet, hotep
You rich but you broke nigga just don't know yet, hotep
These rappers ain't woke yet, security back 'em, hotep
Hotep, come to Detroit with that, oh yes, that's a toe tag
Might as well have Mayweather back ya at a Black's match-up protest
That's that "Write a check you can't cash," I might have to collect
That's that yo ass is bleeding, that's that Kotex
I massacre your whole rap allegiance, oh yes
This one's for little bro who big bro ain't come back from the store yet
Hotep, I'm here for blessings sent my direction, no less
This one's for those who don't know they pops not invincible yet
Trick bitches hoes that don't know just how nasty they are
They out here wearin' the same tongue ring they ain't change from ten dicks ago yet
Hopefully that scope on that AR don't take my focus
To places where I put fakers in comas longer than daytime soapas
Any calendar day I'll hollow him like late October
I'll bury these niggas up under the Devil's playground, playtime's over
Your bitch fine, dawg, I can't deny it
She tryna be my wife on the side, I ain't invite it
I just, step over the ring and hit the bitch like Andre the Giant
Papa used to beat on me often for not being perfect
Thots used to call me tar baby, cops taught me that I'd be worthless
Mama gave birth to only one dark child like Rodney Jerkins
That taught me to focus on what's inside y'all and not the surfaceYou might also like5Embed
