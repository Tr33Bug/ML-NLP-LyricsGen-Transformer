Yeah I dont know what else to say
I cant I cant think of nothin
Im stumped here we go
On your feet Stand up Everybody hands up
Uh man I dont know man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it
I aint callin names cause all of yall the same
Plus Im the king all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains all these lames since the Slaughters came up
Cause they know their hands tied feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial but heres the brain fuck
We the same cause
Im probably bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin game up
Bitch splat Only thing I fear in here is chitchat
You are hearin bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy try us wavey byebye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Babys Maybach
My shit is parvo literally sick
Trust me nigga its ugly to kill the thing is the bigger I get
The more disgustin and fuckin disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop oh stop
Yall about the Champagne Im about the toast I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas thatll smoke you while you starin in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when hes thinkin
While that sinks in I got a Brinks ink pen
Im back Motherfucker notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL Im back from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How yall realer If I said it I did it
If I didnt I seen it firsthand like a card dealer
Give up the throne your lease up I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code you throwin your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony Bcup
Makin the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait til they get a load of me cause
Ive got Guccis on my feet diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist bitches on my dick
But yall already said that
Choppers in the trunk models in the front
Bottles in the club but I dont give a fuck
But yall already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard for me
To come up with shit to say ayy
Im at a loss for words cause yall already said it all
I think Im runnin outta clichs
Im gettin writers block psyche
When I stand up in this booth niggas notice it
Sittin on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion but we sittin on your grave site overkill
Arent you tired Why are you so loud Quiet
Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude thatd try to sue a dude thats suicidal
You will just be another victim
Im like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie Im a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies yall just got scripted
Got yall niggas bitches bobbin to this one when she wit ya
When she with me she bobbin not vibin
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
Im a serpent with a purpose
Havin problems Not a problem
Ive encountered I have found elephants lions clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin for the circus
If the fire round the circles right in front of them fire rounds
Pun intended gun extended what are you marks askin
Cars Aston started as a hardtop and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class this all black all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin marked absent
I authorize my own allaccess
Your bitch a whore Im a catch she ballcatchin
Her jaws been broadcasted
All across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope I been this dope
Now sell it my voicemail is full
Got bitches screamin inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail em to me
Tryna reach my phone I dont know which one is harder
Tryin not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own
Ive got Guccis on my feet diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist bitches on my dick
But yall already said that
Choppers in the trunk models in the front
Bottles in the club but I dont give a fuck
But yall already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard for me
To come up with shit to say ayy
Im at a loss for words cause yall already said it all
I think Im runnin outta clichs
Im gettin writers block psyche
Man get the bozac
We need to start bringin that shit back  Mad flava 
Man fuck it Im bout to catch some wreck
We in effect money 
Mad props to Royce for keepin it real
On the strength no diggity
Im bout to go pull some hoes get my mack on
Haters get the gas face
