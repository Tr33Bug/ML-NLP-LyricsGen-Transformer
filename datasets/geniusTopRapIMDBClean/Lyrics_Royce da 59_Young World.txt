Big drums and the sticks band camp with the crew
Made music in feuds before I seen a studio
Glock held the stock 10 shots like it knew Malone

The truth should set me free but somehow Im stuck with answers
Wish I could give George Zimmerman Karlie Hustle cancer

No one would front though like where the fans be lined up
James Baldwin speakin to street niggas with peace signs up
Straight boss my pheromones secrete Elon Musk
Ive grown to rebuke the Bible had homies that suicidal
I loaned them until they wronged me when grown men were too entitled
Took my first drink at Dr Dre home cause I was homeless
But nowadays while in Rome Romans should do as I do
I aint here for the prize or medals
Knowledge of God or lies of Devils
Knowledge of I or the eyes of several
Death from the gun at the drummers expense
Tell Trump dont send a tweet send a plumber to Flint
Take the sky as your limits
Take the sky as your limits
Same ones that tried to hide your lineage
