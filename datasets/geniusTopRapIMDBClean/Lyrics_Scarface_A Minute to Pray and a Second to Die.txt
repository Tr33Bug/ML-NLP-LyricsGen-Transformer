Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry and gets by while others choose to wonder why
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit but he didnt wanna
As he got older he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldnt survive but hey
I aint the one to speak up on anothers
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and thats the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldnt raise
And she will never see her father again cause hes in a grave
Hey yo lets think about it nilla
My daddy was a dopeman so Ima be a dope dealer
How will the family explain it
My daughter had a baby for a caine head
He aint around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid now shes realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealers all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situations got me guessin
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray and a second to die
It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead he didnt stand a chance
You shoulda seen him he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest and one to his head
He just laid there in silence
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a lawman and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher
But if he survives Im willin to betcha
Hell be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit its a hit were gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK47 M11 and a pump
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street
School was lettin out
Yo you aint gonna shoot yet WATCH ME
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
JD rolled by and smoked Blacks brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a port
Full speed down Reed shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullen
His brother was just dazed in a shock Why you do it
Why you shoot his moms Jay Shit
Hehehehehe hah man fuck that bitch
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack Aiyyo JD homie
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didnt fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull hes expired
A whole army came out
Twentyseven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the Acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die
