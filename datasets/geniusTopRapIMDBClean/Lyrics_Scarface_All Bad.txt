Sunday morning Im off at church
Sinnin throughout the week hustlin every day
Gettin it as we speak listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song annie clapping her hands
Momma singing along Im impatient I wanna leave
Cant let my Momma see I aint listening to the word
Not like I dont believe but Im trippin nobody perfect
To speak it wouldnt worth it for a person to be so Christ like
But I swear I heard him cursin
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on on
Get home and he will find his hat on
Whos family when this all went on
Come on lets see some laughs then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when It happens like that
I smile because its not all bad
You know they say that no ones perfect
Thats why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
Im just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water  keep my head above water 
Tell me whats the use of lookin sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it aint all bad
Monday mornin its back to business
Cash the motivation cops steady watchin
Plottin and waiting patient
Yeah I been thinkin lately
Prayin on even maybe
Probably best if I left it
The stress will drive you crazy if you let it
The penitentiary is where were headed
Designed for downfalls and some still dont get it
And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by
The same ones admitting it now but no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
Ashamed how we cant stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt cause Im a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
Im ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
Im what the hood made mothafucka what
You know they say that no ones perfect
Thats why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
Im just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water  keep my head above water 
Tell me whats the use of lookin sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it aint all bad
As solid these niggas come realist they ever made
Money is not important its livin it how you say
Picture back in the day me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to nigga Im from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps speak and your getting froze
Neck gettin wrapped in sheets sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex that said I could jack my dick
She dont deserve respect Im knowin my niggas feel it
Nothin is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers Children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners Im standing on and I love em without a reason
Chillin or either bleedin they made me Im never leavin
Though the looks can be deceiving
Believe me yall it might sound sad
But trust me dog its not all bad
You know they say that no ones perfect
Thats why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
Im just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water  keep my head above water 
Tell me whats the use of lookin sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it aint all bad
