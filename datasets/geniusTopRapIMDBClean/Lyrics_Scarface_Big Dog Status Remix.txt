Big Dog Status  Remix  Lyrics
Ho Its young Face slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind nonstop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
Im a true OG you can quote what I say
Im an Htown nigga from around the way
Southside Ridin Dirty like Im UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I dont gangbang I patrol the game
And what Im representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing Ill be old and grey
Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks dog but that aint me
These elbows hit the scene back in eightythree
I stay street when its done thats that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of niggas bitches they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat pussy watch and see
UTP
Ive been straight for a long time
Getting cake for a long time
EJ for a long time
Nigga try to get like this
Ive been a G for a long time
In the street for a long time
Toting heat for a long time
Nigga try to get like this
I got big dog status 8X
Hey Im they fave
They say pressure busts pipes but I aint scared
Its my pleasure to tell it right dont think I aint said
Cause they got prices on my head homie I dont slip
Clips long as giraffe necks thats why I dont trip
Just open up and let it rip aint nothing new to a G
Hey I aint worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
My partner died daughter too give excuses to me
Still a buster ass rapper Im refusing to be
Scarface seem to say Im the king you a fool if you think
Theres another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me  Haha 
I cruise in the V brand new with the beat
I live a real life like I say I do in the beat
Yo true indeed I do indeed
Do it for the OGs and the true MCs
Them busters say this year I got brand new and its all phat
Cut that fighting in the club Im done with all that
Nigga ass out of line well his ass getting wet
Give a west side nigga ten stacks thats that
Oh or maybe less as a matter of fact
Nigga be testing the professor whats the matter with cats


Ive been doing this shit nigga who are you
Lil nigga I done seen keys bigger than you
Lil nigga you aint know shit
Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick
How the game go Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr Mr Scarface pistols into yall face
Mr Mr Scarface pistols into yall face
Yeah
I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies barbeque them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I dont fuck with drank
Dont pop pills either cause that shit aint cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog fore we went to school
Flick off back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now I demand respect
And if I slapped one ho then her man was next
Im a kick door robber a hotshot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If its a dare to be made then Im finna make it
But if it aint no way then believe Im finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle it aint worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
Ive been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga cant maintain mayne he lost
He a nerd and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga I come in here with my balls and my word
