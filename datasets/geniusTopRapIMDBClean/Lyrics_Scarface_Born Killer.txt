Im a born killer youre face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an ace but thats a motherfuckin waste
You smooth fucked up G
And your momma shoulda warned you bout a nigga like me
Cause I dont weep and I dont sleep
Save that motherfuckin flack cause talk is cheap
And uh since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and Im a bring it to your ass G
Im coming from the heart son
And I dont take no shit but Im about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static then get it off your chest punk
Cause I aint barring none
If youre feeling lucky then go ahead and getcha some
I aint with this fucked shit
If ya aint in trick then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause Im about to square it off
Hit your ass in the chest with the Tec and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy in some plastic
And have the bitch out hunting for a casket
Im on the for realla tilla my nilla
Im a born killer
Imma born killer
Born
Killer
Dont fuck with me
My momma did her part
But it aint her fault that I was born without a heart
In other words Im heartless duke
I dont love me how the fuck Imma love you
Thats right you guessed it
Im legally insane marked manic depressive
Im taking all types of medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditating
Yo the longer Im alone its worse
Im having thoughts of killing me but Im killing you first
My psychiatrist talks but I dont listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole lifes been a see saw
Im up one day down and out on tomorrow
Right now Im even more upset
Some shit done happened to me that I dont think Id ever forget
You think Id let it die but I aint
It aint because I want to its because I cant
Imma getcha but I aint going into it
Cause aint nothing to it but to do it
See it aint no sweat to me
Cause in the first place you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
Im not your average dealer
Im a born killer


Now Im living where I can cause Im homeless
Cant make important calls cause Im phoneless
I aint eating Im starving duke
I cant go to mommas house cause mommas starving too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause thats the only way a niggas gonna get paid
Im on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they dont think that Id gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And dont think about pushing that panic switch
Im getting paid and youre getting killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dying ho and cant nothing save ya
Im doing bad so Im going bad
Huh and you never expected that from Brad
But its a lot of things pressing me
And I aint the nigga to let a mortician be dressing me
So Im coming out winning
A hundred thousand in the case now Im coming out grinning
But the shit didnt flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pull a ho move
He reached for his pistol
The 10 gauge went BOOM shouldve heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one of you motherfuckers in here wanna die next
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And thats how it is nigga
I spared a couple of lives but Im still a born killer
