Yo anybody seen my diary Oh there it is
I gotta write this shit down Check it out
Dear Diary Im having a little problem
I cant make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
Im confused and I dont know what to do
Im hoping you can help me cause theres no one else to talk to
I want to die but it aint for me
I try to talk to my dad but my old man ignores me
He says Im delirious
And I drink too much so he doesnt take me serious
But little does he know Im really losing it
I got a head but aint no screws in it
I be thinking deep
Thats one of the reasons at night I cant sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now Im still peeping over my shoulder
Is there life after death too
And what about the nigga with the cane and the black suit
And what about cancer
Too many motherfucking questions and not enough answers
Aint no use in trying
We might as well face it we were all born dying
Theres a black book in Brads hands
And its the diary of a madman
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with the torch
Shot him in his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I cant put the shit behind me
Im know Im here somewhere but I cant find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the fo rilla but now Im a born killer
And it aint no changing me
It used to be hard but now it aint no thing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then Ima take ya
Cause Im a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11 bring your weapon
Huh I got an AK47
Its gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to care
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousandyard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and Ima be the grave digger
And if you want to cap come cap me
Im trigger happy like my greatgrandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman


Dear diary help me cause Im frantic
Sometimes I think Im going schizophrenic
The worlds looking dark for instance
Maybe cause Im looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfuckin world with my eyes closed
To myself Im a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger
Its a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked off now Im living in my diary
