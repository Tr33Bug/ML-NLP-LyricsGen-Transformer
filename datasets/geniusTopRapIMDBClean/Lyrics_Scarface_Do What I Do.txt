I am ghetto boy chillin
Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin
Heavy metal concealin
Hustlin til you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin
It dont matter how I get it I got it fuck feelings
I dont have none Im bout my paper nigga ask em
Dont get confused on how the cash come
Never by any means necessary better
Get up off your ass and get my money fore I stretch yah
Out in front your doorstep when I brandish this 45th
You can make arrangements you a dead man a ghost
See I come from them cuts for real
Much long before this rap came fuck the deal
I survived the game of life nigga fuck some skills
Crossin me get in the way this pussy must get killed
Im alive he came he bust til he left
I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself
Yeah cause now Im at his ass with a vengeance
Blood in blood out from the beginning to the ending
Real shit bein spit know your limits
Its best you mind your mothafuckin business
If you aint in it
So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church Sunday Monday sellin raw in these streets
Never took it home though I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I aint promotin no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle til I see the dirt
Riskin 25 years just to see another first
I was all alone car full of niggas
Howd I get here Car full of hittas
I was rollin weed they was snortin blow
Such a cool breeze heart so cold
Step up to the plate where your money at
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan tried to motivate
Continental my Bentley this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost thousand bales of that diesel
Lord go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck one time for Face and all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where Im from a half a keyll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin all 8 thats inshallah


So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church Sunday Monday sellin raw in these streets
Never took it home though I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I aint promotin no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle til I see the dirt
Riskin 25 years just to see another verse
Speakin for those squeakin in them cell blocks readin
To blacks whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets impatient for their releasin
To make it back to the block the hatred the present
Time sure flies look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces women bad as a mug
Gettin fat as fuck
Fried food be addin up the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past yo to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people rep I
Brown and black we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin set up
The Aztec Olmec African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim who Im gon wet up
When violence is resorted knowledge is distorted
Unless its payback for brutality
Im more or less with that get back
So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church Sunday Monday sellin raw in these streets
Never took it home though I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I aint promotin no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle til I see the dirt
Riskin 25 years just to see another verse
