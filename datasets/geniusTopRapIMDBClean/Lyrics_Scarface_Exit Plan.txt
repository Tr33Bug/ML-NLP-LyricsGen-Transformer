Cos I aint ever change on you motherfuckers
And OGs spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You wont find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper
These youngsters think that Im so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends aint shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you dont owe nobody niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds thats your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life its a game but its not fair
Its hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game thats a nono
The streets aint the only ones watching taking photos
And life aint bitches and money
This lifes bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Cant live with and cant live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind nigga
And we dont talk to police
Thats the number one rule on the streets
Cause if you cant do the time then you dont do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You dont upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon revenge somebody
Dig two graves just in case its two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot one kill you get one life
And shitting where you sleep aint an option
People knowing where you sleep thats a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They aint your home boys not these niggas
First chance you call sleep they could murk you
So dont put squares in your circle
Cos these streets dont love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs Johnny
If you a weak nigga dont try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard
And dont get fronted just avoid that
But if you have to pay them boys back
Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
The border is closed the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least when you make that money
Keep it lowpro dont say shit dummy
And dont say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game Im providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds aint stupid
You aint the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a fourdoor
Flying spur ol rims trynna showboat
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it its hard to get out of
And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it run fool
