Man I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick sometimes
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating still jocking
Second anniversary and Im congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldnt palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit and told her Try it
Replied Why with light brown eyes
Im shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for it and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store its our secret
But peep it made it down the hall she came running
Bags about to bust blouse wrinkled but still stunning
Ive done it made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter exchanged our fuck faces
Its tasteless but honey mustve missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Lets see the sights its me tonight
Lets leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager exchanging fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all thats left is for us to exchange
I called her up on the phone said Ill be there in a minute
Cause all them faces she be making when Im in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you aint knowing shes a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Doggs on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with stuck with
I love the way she suck dick and make me bust this
Its hard to hold back when its this good
You said she wouldnt I knew the bitch would
Cause Im a veteran twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping bitch you know you aint gon last
I got to get em let em know Im pimping really
Unless Im getting paid the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause its like that
Thats how we do this shit bitch
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all thats left is for us to exchange
Verse 3 Devin the Dude
Let me holla at cha B Short check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock she didnt budge or move it
Sucking and fucking mayne she loved to do it
I bust 4 5 6 nuts in her mouth when she come to my house
I know thats my bitch and she dont tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool she said that pussys mine
And because the way I rhyme she let me fuck her all the time
Im thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But Im numero uno the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said Look what I got
Then rubbed it hugged it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop but the bitch wouldnt listen
I guess a dick thats hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all thats left is for us to exchange
Verse 4 Tela
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick its kind of nice
Not too expensive but comfortable and its quiet
The Remy that she give me and feel me its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She aint got on panties so damn me its in the signs
Somebodys getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the catass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they aint with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe I must admit thats why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places drinking love and sex chases
You know what Im saying baby Its either now or never
Too hort Tela Devin Scarface in style
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all thats left is for us to exchange
You must be used to all the finer things
