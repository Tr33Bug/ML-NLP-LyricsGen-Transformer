Fuck Faces Lyrics
Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick sometimes
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her "Try it"
Replied, "Why?" with light brown eyes
"I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size"
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it, made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

I called her up on the phone, said "I'll be there in a minute"
'Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good, have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get, you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her, got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine, bitch
I want to make you mine, bitch
I want to fuck one time, bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind, bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with, stuck with
I love the way she suck dick, and make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't, I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you know you ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
'Cause it's like that
That's how we do this shit, bitch
You might also like
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 3: Devin the Dude}
Let me holla at 'cha, B; Short, check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it
Sucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click, she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said "Look what I got"
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 4: Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying it's about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice
Man, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet
The Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat-ass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl, stop licking right there, you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases
You know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
You must be used to all the finer things...10Embed
