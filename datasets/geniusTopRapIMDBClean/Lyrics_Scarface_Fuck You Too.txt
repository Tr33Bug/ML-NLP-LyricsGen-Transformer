You know they always say man its tough being at the top huh
I couldnt agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position Im a chess player
And if I did Id just shoot my way out
First born to my momma
I come from the place where youre promised
To die before your 21st
Youll be surprised whats underneath the earth
Dug dirt I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I cant sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks Im a known threat
God fearing yet Im evil though
I think deep I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body
Then you know why I took my gun and headshot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
Its either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU
Fuck you hey I been running this shit so long
My MO is like fuck you
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
Ima reach out and touch you
I aint gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe bitch pussy nigga fuck you
I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is get it
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like its business
A weak nigga facing time go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team cause he aint wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge thats your key of dope
We all wanna eat gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
Thats what we live by die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have fiveKones gun killers
bust that nigga fuck that nigga


Fuck you hey I been running this shit so long
My MO is like fuck you
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
Ima reach out and touch you
I aint gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe bitch pussy nigga fuck you
They jealous of me cause I shine bright
My grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit this is music you can driveby
Gs the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another niggas hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he aint keep his word
He aint fooling me my nigga he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune he aint seen a bird word
I talk that shit that I can back though
Cause thats in my boxing game Im in the back hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble aint
Just another saint fuck em
