I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of life
Far as Eve there couldnt have been a more deceivin wife
Seen that Adam had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it she in love with him
And he in love too but still be fuckin all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life
Wakin up in the mornin and layin down at night
With the same face lookin at you all the time
Realizin now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus shes always mad and her sex aint great
And she dont suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into tryna find him somethin new
And on the real I done seen it when it went like this
But girl theres one thing happenin that you cant forget
No you cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know aw 
Cause I dont need that stress up in my world and
Girl you know III girl you know III love you
No you cant be my you cant be my girlfriend  Aw baby 
And we can get it on and on and on  Girl you know aw 
Im gone when the sun come again  Girl you know III 
Cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know III love you 
You cant be my you cant be my  Aw baby 
But you can never be my main boo we can remain cool
But we cant be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F350
You been ran through and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met Ive been hearin your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Comin out the club half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out him quick cause how you handle the dick
Its unlike no other she a bad muhfucker
But Im too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up cause unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you cant get mad cause I am not your man
Your understandin was bad it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me girl its not like that
No you cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know aw 
Cause I dont need that stress up in my world and
Girl you know III girl you know III love you
No you cant be my you cant be my girlfriend  Aw baby 
And we can get it on and on and on  Girl you know aw 
Im gone when the sun come again  Girl you know III 
Cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know III love you 
You cant be my you cant be my  Aw baby 
For me to say that I do would be a lie cause I dont
Believe no woman is right for me so I wont
Try to talk myself into thinkin she is
And if she leaves me for this thats just one less bitch
And trust me I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman theres a man home man
Sayin Damn I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool then the bitch just flipped
And then thats it had to make some new plans
Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you hurt all alone steady hittin her phone
Bought a bigger dick and longer bankroll she gone
And if I ever say Maybe and you thought that I might
You consider just imagine what my wife was like
And if you aint love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong I was gone
No you cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know aw 
Cause I dont need that stress up in my world and
Girl you know III girl you know III love you
No you cant be my you cant be my girlfriend  Aw baby 
And we can get it on and on and on  Girl you know aw 
Im gone when the sun come again  Girl you know III 
Cant be my girlfriend  Girl you know III love you 
You cant be my you cant be my  Aw baby 
Girl sorry baby  Haha woo
