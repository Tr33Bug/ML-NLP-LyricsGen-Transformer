If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place for the young to come out if they want to play
Id let their mommas know that they ok
And when yall pray Ill respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If Im God huh all the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace no more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens screams of people being smoked
No more dope you dont need it youll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me Ive been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling
Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I dont want to wait wait wait til I die
Wait wait wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face
Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away would you feel safe
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angels evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake one life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make cause one day
Youll be standing on your feet and then the next
Youre underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
Stealing breath shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs shes depressed
A priest who confessed a judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor what the fuck did you expect
A father kills his son look at life its a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left


Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I dont want to wait wait wait til I die
Wait wait wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself thats what it is when its not
And all the whole while its been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark on how they act
We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasnt that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
Its a shame but thats how were blaming its for the scratch
So I dont knock Im tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket aint the topic
Yall need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldnt be the mom before she twentyone huh
Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I dont want to wait wait wait til I die
Wait wait wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
