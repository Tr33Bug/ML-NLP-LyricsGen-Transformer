And meanwhile on the Southside of town 
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
What do you see
I see some muthafuckin Gs 
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
Tell me what you see
Some muthafuckin Gs 
Roamin in my muthafuckin hood and thangs
Seems to me my mutherfuckin hood done changed
Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
45 in my lap when Im on the creep
Niggas livin shife so I roll one deep
Cause now they see me flippin in the 1994
CSI nigga black 850
And now they lookin at me crazy
But offbrand niggas can suck a dick because they cant fade me
And if it came down to the gun black
I never cracked up under pressure cause I was trained for combat
So get yo muthafuckin boys together
I represent SA nigga and we makin noise forever
And gettin paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
Cause if you disrespect you ass out
And they we rolling through yo shit in the Glasshouse
Actin bad with the flashers on
Makin niggas get they asses on
Cause aint no mutherfuckin love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub you fool
It aint no haps on it hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the Glocks
And take the law into our own hands
Cause you aint fucking with a rookie nigga you fucking with a grown man
And we gon show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka you aint see my trunk
I got a  SK  and a  AK 
And a  12 gauge  thatll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo mutherfuckin hood what do you see
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
What do you see
I see some muthafuckin Gs 
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
Tell me what you see
Some muthafuckin Gs 
Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
Scored a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin cause its all good
And we aint trippin on the bullshit nigga because we all hood
But other niggas dont wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is you dont wanna see that SA
Because were all upon a mission
Killin dont make us no different
And dyin dont make it no different
Cause I done been to mo wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin Bengals lost last year
So aint no muthafuckin thang for me
To kill a nigga who aint fuckin with the gang with me
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
What do you see
I see some muthafuckin Gs 
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
Tell me what you see
Some muthafuckin Gs 
Formaldehyde smokin niggas gettin loced and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin up your shit
It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
So I know I got to get em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
And thats the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
What do you see
I see some muthafuckin Gs 
Now when youre rollin through yo muthafuckin hood
Tell me what you see
Some muthafuckin Gs
