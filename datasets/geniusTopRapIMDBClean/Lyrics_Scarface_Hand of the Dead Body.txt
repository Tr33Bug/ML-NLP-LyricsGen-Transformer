We got this ho muthafucka on a mission
Now the whole entire worlds gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip Spice1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap aint done shit for that
Ive even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
Americas been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuckups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So Davids got a silver mag
While listening to Brad David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Dukes got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you dont dig me than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying aint worse than no western movie
Dont blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fucking with Dvoidofpop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bangbang boom boom ping ping Im the black
White boys got a magazine and dont kow how to act
Ill attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother Im it now
Im the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this
You punk niggas make me sick
Sucking on the devils dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start douching
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
Do the Reverend Calvin Butts
Got a pair of nuts
I started this gangsta shit in 86
Now you dissing me
For publicity
Isnt he a ho to the third degree
Who me
Im a g who like to scrapalot
Down with RapALot
And I cant stop wont stop
So fuck Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube there aint no killing me
Ice Cube Scarface
Dropping on these selling out niggas doing it like this
Chorus Devin The Dude
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
Nigga dont believe that song
That niggas wrong
Gangstas dont live that long
