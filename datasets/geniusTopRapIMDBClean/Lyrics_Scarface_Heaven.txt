Theres gonna be some shit you might not understand but you may have to rewind this shit a few times Heaven heaven Check it out
I know tomorrow aint a promise thats why I live one day at a time
So when its my turn therell be no crying
Im aware that when my numbers called Im punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma Im out
And plus I wasnt really happy here to start with let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me and thats 3 cold
I said 3 Its all intentional cause 2 dont count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming
And every other corner youre passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open Im remembering this
Your familys your backbone your friends aint shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying Back in the days
When our homeboys left she the only ones stayed
For that very reason Im a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl everybodys saying
My angel my sunshine
Thats the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend my good time
Thats the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
Listen to different scriptures they teach on God
And if you aint never met him dont speak on God
Im serious about religion this shits aint no song
Im hearing niggas makin up scriptures and playing along
Probably saying Im the hypocrite for judging these folks
But you can tell he aint a Christian by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down boy
When youre aware of your surroundings yet you still cant move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon change your life when you hear it
And the next morn you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life and it was like
Heaven but Im a man I aint perfect
Thats a poor excuse that aint working
I asked him for forgiveness for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven


America the Beautiful dont be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin at home
Id cry if I thought that me sheddin a tear might help
Then again me sheddin tears dont help
Wanna call up to the President and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself we all sinners
Facin the winter with no socks and no shoes
In a position where we all gon loose
Instead of penitentiaries we gon need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do
Sit around and let the world pass us by
Waitin on a message from the reverend
And he aint but another man tryin to get to heaven
