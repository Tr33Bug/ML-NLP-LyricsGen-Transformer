Homies  Thuggs  The Remix  Lyrics
No Limit motherfuckin soldiers
And the RapALot crime family  No Limit RapALot 
Scarface
Master P
They aint ready for this yall
Yeah
Ghetto niggas remain violent  Remain violent  all the killers remain silent  Remain silent 
Niggas strapped with 45s and aint smiling
And Im driving to 
The lake we build houses but its the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucka will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the Face
When niggas do they struggling ended with a straight face
Surviving under conditions demons dining
You could run it but cant hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this mothafucka like pussy with no sheets cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and wont surface
They let the money make em nervous whats the purpose
A mothafucka sitting on fat
Who done came up out the hood money cant come back
Fuck that I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me then take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but whats right
Surviving sitting on a ki doing business on a beeper
Im sinking in this mothafucka deeper
Fear the Reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck beat these niggas in your army though Im a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it loves me
Let it be stop looking at this mothafucka strange
And talking bout a mothafucking change
This is for my thug niggas
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas
Face imagine us working at McDonalds
To me and you selling fucking tapes to the Bahamas
Gold slug a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch  so we drug dealers
No Limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on red beans the size of some bullets huh
We ghetto niggas cant be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little Jay down at RapALot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto thats my life
You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane  uuuuuugh 
Independent black owned got em hooked on this cocaine
You used to see CEOs in suits and ties
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diam
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout til we gray in the wheel chair
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas
What do you get from boosting
Niggas coming out from California and represent them niggas in
Houston
And now 2Pacll keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the Bay know LA keep this shit hot
I keep a Glock inside my pants dont give  a chance
Put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police cant find me
My shit is dropping and Ill sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game they caught up in this drug dealing
Now how can I fall how can I ball
How can I catch my enemies and murder em all
My words of flame burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas cant hang with me and nuttins changes uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We lace heat mothafuckas in they body and face uh
Growing quicker liquor made me your daddy your nigga
Niggas dont wanna see me worldwide mob figure
MOB Hennessy keep me gd and kid
Niggas dont wanna see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim catchin bodies
Bring a shotty to the fucking party yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause its wrong but we born right
And to these niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Til these bitches understand nigga my song pays cause Im the man
Now these is my homeboys we outlaws til the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw
My 45 make sho that I survived to another day
Just bust rhymes and brothers get paid
Now thats the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead
Buy my shit and you can hear it plain West Side niggas
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas  uuuuugh 
This one for the homies and the thug niggas
