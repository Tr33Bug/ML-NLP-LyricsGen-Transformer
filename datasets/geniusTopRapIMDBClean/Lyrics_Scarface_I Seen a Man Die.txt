So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy 
I dont know dawg Im just trying to live it one day at a time ya know
I hear you talkin man live it one day at a time 
It aint nothing but a thang though bro 
Yeah I hear you fool
Well let me get up outta here my ride out here waitin for me
Alright cat daddy take it easy baby 
You stay up fool
Peace 
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly but glad to be the mans child
The world is different since hes seen it last
Out of jail been seven years and hes happy that hes free at last
All he had was his mothers letters
Now hes mobile and hes gotta make a change and make it for the better
But hes black so hes got one strike against him
And hes young plus he came up in the system
But hes smart and hes finally making eighteen
And his goals to get on top and try to stay clean
So hes calling up his homie who done came up
Livin lavish now they dealin with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now its different he done did dirt
And realized killin men meant comin up but it still hurt
And cant nobody change this
Its 1994 and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry til I seen a man die
Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this Earth when theres no grief
Imagine grief on this Earth when theres no peace
Everybodys got a different way of endin it
And when your number comes for souls then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be til its all done
Total darkness at ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life but your memory youll never take
Youll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mothers face
I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die
I hear you breathin but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because theres no way you can fight it though youll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but youll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but youre still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice let it go if you can back it up
If you aint at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
Here lies a man not scared to die may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry til I seen that man die
