Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging my arms bugging adrenaline pumping
Oh shit this little niggas thugging
I mean I was thirteen I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Aint gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit em or slice em
Either stick em or blast pipes its the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life how many you get
How many niggas do you know get two
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a lifebid be one a your crew
I dont respect killers I respect OG knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules but no guidance
Lessons detrimental to a young disciple
Focus take care of your brothers niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close where they can see you
Its not your enemy who get you
Its always your own people
Its always your own people
Its always your own people
Its always your own people
Its always your own people
Mass confusion in my head
Killing me driving me mad
Got me wondering can I trust my friends
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid and if thats the case
Is it curable Can you help me find my place
I cant handle this Im losing it
With a loose grip Im hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother save him from the
Evil demons in between us came between us
I know you hate me dont you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well yall see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But Imma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
Ima starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player well Im the one designing your prints
Something to go by to let these niggas know I
Dont believe in letting shit slide nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us
Mass confusion in my head
Killing me driving me mad
Got me wondering can I trust my friends
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid and if thats the case
Is it curable Can you help me find my place
I cant handle this Im losing it
With a loose grip Im hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother save him from the
Evil demons in between us came between us
Ay this um
