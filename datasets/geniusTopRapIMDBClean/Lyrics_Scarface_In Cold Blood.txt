I started small time dope game pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cookup fifty flippers if you want em
Full of formaldehyde my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us my neighborhoods like a sauna
Pistolgrippin insurin wont nobody run up on us
But if they do fuck em we murderous nickeldome em
I aint playin no games Im on a mission fo the change
Motherfuck being a lame Im ten toes in the game  deep
I cant slip this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps cause see its a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his and me gettin mine
And plus Im a nigga with that feelin like its my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust ninehow many times I gotta warn you
I aint the one be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
Im the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly so you hoesll understand me
One wrong move and Ima have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then  Explosion 
Get you Audi now what the fuck was this dude thinkin
You can cheat the rules of the streets and not leave stinkin
I can squeeze without blinkin Im a coldblooded nigga
Bank robber  ooooh  Im a natural born killer
Drug dealer anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die Im a gangsta right
I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while Im cookin Im like Fuck this dude
Its on thirtysix zones of my own
Keep the money fo myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone Ay I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you come get me hot
Never showed so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme steppin on the dope
Its cold but thats it Im on it like I want it
And twentyeight cash and change the whole game on it
That means Im on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break em off a couple of C and double up they fee
Takin over shoot up they spot make it hot
And when the cops dry it out put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with em
Dummy move whole thing the goon squad get em


No mo petty rock hustlin Im in for the run
And Im fosho Im gon be murdered for this shit that I done
But Imma die standin up cause Im a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees Im a killer
So dont nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember Im the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved ones fatality
He aint got a reason to die then kill him its a tragedy
Right
