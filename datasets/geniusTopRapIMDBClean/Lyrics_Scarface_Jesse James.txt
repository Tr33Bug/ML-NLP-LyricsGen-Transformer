Snuck up behind him had his hands in his pocket
Took my pistol out unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and  cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a  murder murder  I pinpointed my target
Im making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came through this motherfucka
And killed his ass just like Jesse James
Think its a motherfuckin game
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
Whats my motherfuckin name
Therell be no witnesses to this homicide
No reenactment on the late night news to be redramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his motherfuckin head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he aint breathin
And the niggas on the go cause we aint seen him
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha out of line so it got witcha
Call the motherfuckin helicopter
But aint no hope cause the nina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass  motherfucka you 
That oughta teach your funky ass  motherfucka you 
I know this motherfuckin game is sheist
And you done lost the fuckin game of life
And thats a motherfuckin shame
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James
Think its a motherfuckin game
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
Whats my motherfuckin name
Wait  this motherfucka got me bent I gots to  break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my  face
He best to chill before I hit him with this  mace
And catch this motherfuckin case
Cause once I got him blind then he done with
Because Im true to myself fuck the dumb shit
You aint no motherfuckin gangsta gee
And when I get up out your ass you gon realize it just aintsta be
It aint no studio up in me
And all that bullshit Im hearin you talk only offends me
And lately Im under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you cant come clean so yo I gots to check ya
I pull my 45 and  buck buck buck buck 
And right before he die I  fuck fuck fuck fuck 
I could give a motherfuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges cause Im  SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE 
Cause life has no meaning no meaning
We were all born to die so no screaming
Think its a motherfuckin game
Ill come around this motherfucka and cut yo ass just like Jesse James
Blow out your motherfuckin brains
Think its a motherfuckin game
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
Whats my motherfuckin name
