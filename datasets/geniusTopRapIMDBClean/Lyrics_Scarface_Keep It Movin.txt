If this is love I dont see it
Cant make me believe it
You a nice girl but Im a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour I aint never seen you drink
And now thats leaving me to think how I got so close to you
This was just a hit and split thats what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next Im addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick every cause has its effect
Thats what I get I guess I cant commit thats killing this
You gave me an ultimatum Im numb I aint feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case tears running eyeline lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok
You disobey you pay for that
Well the love is gone and she aint made it back pray for that
What happened to us you acting foolish
Im acting foolish what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
Im bout to lose it were going through it
This shit confusin what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
skit Scarfacewoman 
Im just sayin a relationship should be 100100 not 5050 right
Right
Oh what you gon think about that
Yeah Im gon think about that
Look you want me here or not
Think before you answer that its hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back brought this on myself with her
Mistakes Im forced to live with that Im knowing more mistakes to come
Im human thats my best excuse in fact my only one
Tears fall my kids call This aint me its his fault
Oh shit no we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame take your aim
Shoot that shot cant wait to claim
All of this in Jesus name
Pray in church they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come Id see the light
Cant sleep at night
And Im wondering whos fooling who
Im sure you know whos fucking me cause I know whos been fucking you
We used to be inseparable never thought that that day would come
Where Id take that shit so serious and you get so good at playing dumb you got away with one


What happened to us you acting foolish
Im acting foolish what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
Im bout to lose it were going through it
This shit confusin what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
You had me Ill admit that fell into the trap you set
Lookin me in my eyes lyin killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldnt let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when Im in it all the way
60 calls a day wondering where the fuck Im at
Wondering where the fuck I stay who else I fuck like that
Now lets be honest you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget its her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives are husbands reckless why
Beneath the questions lie why was she left to cry
Should have left shit quiet but you was out of line
Better step aside gotta tell me why
I was everything you was all I had
Now this is change and then this change is bad
Make a note of that
What happened to us you acting foolish
Im acting foolish what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
Im bout to lose it were going through it
This shit confusin what we need to do is
Keep it movin thats what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin
