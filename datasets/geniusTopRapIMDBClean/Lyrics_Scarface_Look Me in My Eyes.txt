aka Look Into My Eyes
Look me in my eyes tell me what you see
Do you think Im crazy  AAAAAGHHH Just bein me 
Sometimes I wanna die maybe Ill be free
Free from all this bullshit thats constantly surroundin me
I can feel it in my head  I see when Im asleep
I dont wish to discustin cause it done been too deep
Im tired of bein stepped on and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes  Look me in my eyes 
And tell me what you see  and tell me what you see 
Can you see my future and what lies down the line
Is it just my test or is it just my time
Time for me to pay for all the wrong Ive did
I forgot to get picked off when i was just a kid
A poison in my mind tryin to find relief
But I cant get no peace cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin to set me up bustin down my streets
Blockin up my door to see if he can catch me
But I dont sell no dope so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone   and fuck the DEA
And fuck these undercovers that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to but you wont find no cheese
And I aint finna snitch cause I dont know a thang
Dont ask me shit bout Steve dont ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off I can see it in your eyes
Im down with RapALot until the day that I die
Until the day that I die 
So fuck you in ya asses you know its all a lie
You just wanna destroy me just like you did my god
But now I must expose you and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggas The FBI been watchin you
Especially if you black and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib makin niggas lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I aint no dopeboy aint never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks but that was back in school
Now I just do music and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house so why you fuck with me
Look me in my eyes
Will you look in my eyes and tell me do you see what I see My eyes 
Will you look in my eyes and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee
Look me in my eyes Ive told all I could tell you
And now you know too much if you leak a word Ill kill you
You think that Im insane partially deranged
Youve had your chance to pick my brain now explain
Whats up with all these nightmares this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from
Right before I left home
Look me in my eyes  I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons I give you time to think
OK your time is up now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses look me in my eyes
Look me in my eyes my eyes 
You seemed to be confused I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes because this sessions over
I headed for the door he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes
2x
