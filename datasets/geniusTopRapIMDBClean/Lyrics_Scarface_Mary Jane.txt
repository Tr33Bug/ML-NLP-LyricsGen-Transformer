Mary Jane Lyrics(Scarface whispering):
I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my life-for this dame
And indeed took the form of life-and that's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks-got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke-shit got 'em by
Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
When the world starts to stress you out-what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth-or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is-they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (   )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks- true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need-all I need
Your natural you come from seeds-I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
