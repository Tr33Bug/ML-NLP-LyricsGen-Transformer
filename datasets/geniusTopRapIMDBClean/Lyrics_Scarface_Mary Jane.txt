Scarface whispering 
I dont really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin in my lifefor this dame
And indeed took the form of lifeand thats a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreamsnot afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folksgot em high
For the days that they were lost and brokeshit got em by
Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
When the world starts to stress you outwhat you do
Put a cancer stick up in your mouthor grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains isthey the blame
And the governments been taxin that       gettin paid
If its taxable its cool to smokekill or not
And the alcohol is killin folks true or not
Other people try to make you badbut I know you not
When my situations lookin sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of needall I need

Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
