Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke it aint an option penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time ATW then crawl back
To them streets where we come from taught life
Look alive know niggas better walk right
Real with it quick trigger finger gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God Imma change that
But I cant cause them evil demons came back
And when Im high yall I cant explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism
And wishing
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
Lost stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
Bgs is tripping aint nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mammas
Cant teach them how to be men grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but yall niggas is comical
90 percent of our futures off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism
And listen
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
Another kid killed in cold blood a mothers heart broke
Family crying on the first few my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the lord still Im in the devils reach
I dont wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX news tried to justify him
And aint no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but its terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off we worried about the money lost
While the clans about to light another cross
I aint denying it I speak from intuition
Its also from my mental exorcism
And wisdom
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
