I sit alone in my four cornered room starin at candles
Are we on the radio dukes
Awww yeah give it to me
Yeah at night I cant sleep
Im tossin and turnin
I still got the candlesticks burnin
It aint changed but its a different time
And Im still playin tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin that Im livin wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson cause Im gettin grown
And their lookin at your little boys success
And I been thinkin Im dealin with too much stress
So I stay up on my ps and qs
And watch out for the Gs and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin up a grip
And they just started talkin bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through it makes em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin tricks on me
My mind was playin tricks on me
My mind was playin tricks on me
Yeah
Dear diary Im havin a little problem with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I dont though
They tell me see my pastor but I dont go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin a price tag on a mans word
And its a fashion show so the men flirt
The world is endin so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin up these churches for some quick cash
And usin the money fo they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man cause man be phoney
My mind was playin tricks on me
My mind was playin tricks on me
Day by day its more impossible to cope
I feel like Im the one thats doin dope
Cant seem to keep my mind on a steady track
Im all about gettin mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wasnt real wit me
And now shes back with her old lady
And now I got it goin on and they sure hate me
Now Im a goner and shes a loner
Hahahaha her mind was playin tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin mind
Bringin it back like this here
1991 all the way to the 1994 and they call me Face
My mind was playin tricks on me
