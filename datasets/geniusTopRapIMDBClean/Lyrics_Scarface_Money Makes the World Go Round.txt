Money Makes the World Go Round Lyrics
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round (that's true)
And money makes me do all things that I do
And hang with my homies smoke weed and drink brew
Ride down Belfort one deep and bang Screw
And money makes the world go round, (that's right)
Money makes the world go round, (that's my life)
Livin' in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stops blowin' these days to my sight
The winds start flowin' I'm paid, trunk tight
I gots to have paper these days in my life
I gots to have paper these days of my life
Cause money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

That's right
Money makes the world go round, (straight up)
Money makes the world go round
Everyday up on your life thank your God for your life
That money makes the world go round
Without a doubt
They all want to see you about a clout
They don't know, don't want to know or see what it's about
We faced with danger, do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life mentality of the street life made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours to make it theirs so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money make the world kill all niggas quicker
The sckrilla, the cabbage, the cheese, the scratch, the cheddar
Whatever you call it, it's all hot

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
The unfortunates is now fortunate
Cause money makes the world go round
What's up 'Face?
You might also like
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it, some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me, money's good to me
Money can't buy me love but it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although it's made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you comin' up sellin' weed, while you blow on sweets
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of livin' go up, chances of livin' go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you ain't got it you ain't nothin' but you come up then they hound you
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
Bumpin' the south/west beat, while I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rappin'
The nigga got to do somethin, until this rap shit happen
It's been a long time, since I got my hand on some cheese
It's gettin' hectic, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope?
I go days without eatin, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days?
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down to get sprayed
Hey man, I got to reason with ya
Nah, fuck tryin' to reason
I'm tired of strugglin' so now it's huntin' season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinkin'
Get a bag of that dank, from the hemp and I'm steady drinkin'
Contemplatin' on what should I do
This nigga got G's, I'm talkin' about a hundred or two

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
See, money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
For my stars, money makes the world go roundEmbed
