Money makes the world go round  thats true 
And money makes me do all things that I do
And hang with my homies smoke weed and drink brew
Ride down Belfort one deep and bang Screw
And money makes the world go round  thats right 
Money makes the world go round  thats my life 
Livin in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stops blowin these days to my sight
The winds start flowin Im paid trunk tight
I gots to have paper these days in my life
I gots to have paper these days of my life
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round
Everyday up on your life thank your God for your life
That money makes the world go round
Without a doubt
They all want to see you about a clout
They dont know dont want to know or see what its about
We faced with danger do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life mentality of the street life made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take whats yours to make it theirs so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money make the world kill all niggas quicker
The sckrilla the cabbage the cheese the scratch the cheddar
Whatever you call it its all hot
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
The unfortunates is now fortunate
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round
Some people gots to have it some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that moneys good for me moneys good to me
Money cant buy me love but it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without do strange things for it
Although its made of paper it dont grow on trees
Unless you comin up sellin weed while you blow on sweets
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of livin go up chances of livin go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you aint got it you aint nothin but you come up then they hound you
Cause money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
Bumpin the southwest beat while I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rappin
The nigga got to do somethin until this rap shit happen
Its been a long time since I got my hand on some cheese
Its gettin hectic my daughter cant get what she needs
Shit is fucked up you wonder why we rob and sell dope
I go days without eatin it aint because I snort coke
Fool Im broke whats a good way to get paid these days
Flip burgers or lay your ass down to get sprayed
Hey man I got to reason with ya
Nah fuck tryin to reason
Im tired of strugglin so now its huntin season
I hope you understand by now what Im thinkin
Get a bag of that dank from the hemp and Im steady drinkin
Contemplatin on what should I do
This nigga got Gs Im talkin about a hundred or two
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
See money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
For my stars money makes the world go round
