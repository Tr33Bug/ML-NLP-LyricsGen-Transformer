Money and the Power Lyrics
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup! Hehehahaha, hehe ha hah hah.. yeah
Money and the power, money and the power
Never goin back 'cause I got
Money and the power

Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it, blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin over fiends
Sellin niggas beat, in other words, amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd, and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power.. yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Bitches on my dick 'cause I got
Money and the power

Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static, I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up, a nigga sprayed 'em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin short 'cause I got money and the power, yup
You might also like
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short 'cause I got the
Money and the power
Yeah
Money and the power, money and the power
I got it like dat, 'cause I got
Money and the power

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute, then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ak'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggas stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggas up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise
Hehehehehe...I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin short 'cause I got money and the power YUP!
Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records, I got
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Best to come clean, 'cause I got
Money and the power
Money and the power, money and the power
Money and the pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-power!1Embed
