Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
SA fool native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And thats what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they aint give a shit I aint give a shit either
Sweet 16 time to stack me up some kis
Learned the game of hustlin fuckin over fiends
Sellin niggas beat in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced sellin speed Im goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up now I got it sold

Bought me a Caddy 30s and vogues
Brand new crib brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money Mickey Ds aint paid me shit
Id make up a story just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard stackin paper like Trump
And I aint give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didnt worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump

Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid I guess my brotherd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life and theyre still runnin Lee
I guess he doesnt realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesnt matter cause Akll never tell
He can stay broke but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 50
Niggas stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggas up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But Ima play it cool if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit I never ran and never will
Come to find out they wasnt fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em talkin noise
