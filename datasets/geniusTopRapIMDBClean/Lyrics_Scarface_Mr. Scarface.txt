Mr Scarface Lyrics
Mr Mr Scarface been walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr Mr Scarface went up the block again
All I have in this world all I have in this world
All I have all I have all I have in this world
Ahh yeah hah
Mr Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again
Yea droppin some of that new
Mr Scarface Two on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick or make a nigga rich
Or something bitch
I dont give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is Aks town
If you dont know I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game aint roulette
Slangin caine is the thang and I bet
That theres a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
Ive heard the name in ninetynine different places
Im here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor at states camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why Ive slowed up
Its either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass aint made for no caps homie
This ass says Exit Only
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now Im ready for combat
Mr Scarface is back
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Nobody knows my name theyll only know this face
On the forreala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Nobody knows my name theyll only know this face
On the forreala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Aiyo Bido drop that shit
Yeah heh heh
Back in the South Park six oclock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin 128
I got myself a bag and I cant wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggas on the cut short stop it
Fiendsll see em small then they go
Where to see the motherfuckin pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin for his shit
357 on your ass fool
Like I said before you dont get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin rug
Gettin pumped full of 38 slugs
Some other niggas stepped out yall
Aw shit I had to make a phone call
J Prince Hello
Scarface Hey J
J Prince Wassup
Scarface Im in a little trouble man
J Prince Where you at
Scarface Im out here in South Park Village
J Prince Stay right there Ill be right on
Scarface Cmon lets take these motherfuckers to war man
J called up some niggas from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin Uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And thats about the time they got drug
One more war took place
You can call me the shit starter or call me Mr Scarface
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Nobody knows my name theyll only know this face
On the forreala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Nobody knows my name theyll only know this face
On the forreala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this worldall I have in this world
All I have inall I have inall I have in this world
Damn check this shit out
Later on all alone you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was throwed off
The last bitch got her head blowed off
But fuck I aintsta pass up no puddy
She started strippin at the door oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didnt have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was Fuck me baby fuck me baby
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said Im killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it  Fred  Who
Who the fuck is Fred I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do
The bitch packed a twentytwo
Hit him in his head there she laid him
The nigga standin by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr Brad
I dont know what happened to the slut
Well thats about the time the closet door it opened up
On your ass trick
Ill be damned if I go out like the last bitch 
Heh five0s on my ass mane
They know me by the face but they dont know my last name
Now Im back on the case
Yeah just call me Mr Scarface
