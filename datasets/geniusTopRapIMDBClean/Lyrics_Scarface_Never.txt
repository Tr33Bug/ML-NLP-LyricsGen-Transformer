I would never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise that I know I couldnt keep
And I would never testify cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would never pull it out unless Im bouts to black
And I could never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for em God send me back
And Ill never shed tears my heart is like a stone now
Never thought Id live to see 21 look Im grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means its forever but its never crossed my mind
And Ill never go broke I promise Imma shine
Never come short on my issue Im on it every time
And Ill never be passive you better gimme me mine
Its my money and I want it every motherfuckin dime
No I never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then I knew I had to mash
And it could never be said I went out like a ho
Never been punked Ill never let it slide never let it go
Never ever never ever ever no
Get on my level ho or get a shovel ho
Its never any question for my manhood I get down
Ill never switch never snitch never sit down
Ill never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
Ill never squat to take a piss whos the bitch now
I never ran I never will I aint never scared
Its in my bloodline the realest nigga ever bred
And thats some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics I aint never dead
Ill never disrespect my momma never disrespect her momma neither
Ill never turn my back on Jesus
Ill never get caught off in the system cause I believe a
Man that follows man aint no man and Im a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga I could never trade
Ill never cross my homies out that I aint how Im made
And I never had not one regret on how I was raised
Im from the ghetto where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way this aint gon never change
Never gon bite my tongue FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God Id stay the same
And when I finally got my paper I was on my game
Ill never talk a nigga down do yo thang dawg
Never hate a dude for tryin thats insane dawg
Get yo motherfuckin money thats the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin young feel my pain yall
