Greatest ever done it you can learn from it
Dope game ran it  rap game run it
Street cred hundred nerd turned Dboy
Naughty genetic makeup baby Im a Gboy
Hashtag streetboy wrong one to fuck with
Cross me at your own risk play to get back you can trust this
I am far from average to me it aint no such thing
Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang
Ive been known to bust bang Kli of the NEB
I dont need an army when the smoke clears he sees me
Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas
They claim that they the real deal knowing Im the highest
Time for the command chain I am what the streets made
I am what the hood built you are just a weakling
Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
Youre more like a punk band Im more like a pedigree
Nigga you aint seen yet so yall can not describe me
Im a freak of nature Dont shit here suprise me
Money over everything except a niggas manhood
I am not a prostitute you dont understand hood
Fuck a nigga getting his unless he bout to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef shocking when I up the nine
And hit him with it several times fuck you thought I was civilized
Welcome to the jungle fool its only right I punish you
Nigga with an attitude feel like MC Ren felt
Quiet on the set you funky bitch you get your friend slept
Ill give your gang a black eye blame it on the black God
I be on some nigga shit Im nigga rich so thats why
Guess what my religion is this is what the business is
Expose you for your garbage ass rappers you can witness this
Came to bang the game up pussies think they came up
Oh you got a drophead So now you think youre famous
Out here its dangerous if we dont know your name cuz
We dont even give a fuck rappers get it fucked up
Security save you Nah its their side job
They dont want no conflict they dont want no problem
Nah
