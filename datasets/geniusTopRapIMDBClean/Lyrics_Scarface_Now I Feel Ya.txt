Its a new day ya know what Im sayin
A new day brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life wouldve been joke
Either locked up playin dead and still slangin dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help my mother made a man of me
Didnt blindfold me to the world we was livin in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated Id have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad for raisin another niggas child
So now we livin comfortable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldnt see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kids leavin
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now Im livin in my grandmas home
My grandmas strong shes got nine kids of her own
And keepin me aint no big deal
But now that Im much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kindhearted not wantin to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the moneys low
And pretty soon a brothers gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
Im in the ghetto I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
Im losin all hope a brothers fallin short
I cant cope so now Im slangin dope
And now my granny knows Im doin wrong
She just prayin for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldnt have told me nothin back then
But now I feel ya
Im eighteen and now Im havin big fun
My babys mother just had my first son
May eleven I never will forget the day
A stars born lets name him little Scarface
My first born and yo Im a proud father
I gotta son I gots ta be my sons father
And sellin dope aint the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk and pampers tryin ta do my part
And hes my son I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes and jewelry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I dont want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin to make it lifelike
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man hell appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the fathers role
Because these years hell remember most
So its all about little Marcus and me becomin close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it aint my line of work its the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybodys got my baby
Wantin to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
Its your daughter dont she look like you
I just cant tell why dont you take it to my Momma Duke
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin coochie tryin to get a free meal
So now we in and outta court
Tryin to get mo money braggin om the child support
Tellin her friends that shes breakin me
Now eveybody knows that she was just fakin G
Come to find out the girl never had me
Shes the babys mother but me I aint the babys daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin
I know that Im the babys father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldnt have told me nothin back then
But now I feel ya
I feel ya
Now Im twentytwo and finally got a grip on life
Its nineteen ninetythree I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
Im young and black so my choice aint a nightstick
Because we livin in a concentration set
And everyday we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
So I know my numbers comin up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up
And even though I hate killin off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine
My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the storys all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldnt give a fuck
Because she left my partners family with memories
And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you wont realize until you dead and gone
It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I aint goin out like dat
Ya feel me
yeah
