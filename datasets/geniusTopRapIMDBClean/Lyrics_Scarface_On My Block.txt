Woo This for the block boy
Take a breath Woah
Every day its been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle cause thats how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out you came back in
To my block from Holloway Bellfort to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks drink all the blue dots
On your block you proly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun or BI your homeboys from kneehigh
And even when it was storming outside that niggad be by
Thats me dog on my block I aint have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy
If Black June could see me hed be tripping
And Id bet he still try to tease me
My block where everything is everything for sheezy
My block we probably done it all homey believe me
My block we made the impossible look easy for sheezy
My block Id never leave my block my niggas need me
On my block we duck the niggahaters and the cops
Fuck a IROC we race Impalas chromedout
On my block it aint no different than the next block
You get drunk and pass out and they back you to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when youre that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block its just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas making your mark
On my block were cuing all the time playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fly pass it around a few times to get high
My block where everything is everything for sheezy
My block we probably done it all homey believe me
My block we made the impossible look easy for sheezy
My block Id never leave my block my niggas need me
My block where everything is everything for sheezy
My block we probably done it all homey believe me
My block we made the impossible look easy for sheezy
My block Id never leave my block my niggas need me


On my block everybody business aint your business
Whats going on in this house is staying here comprende
On my block you had to have that understanding
Cause if you told Ms Mattie she went and told Gladys
And once your mama got it it was all on the wire
And when the word got back they set your ass on fire
On my block we got some Nam vets shellshocked
Who never quite got right now they inhale rocks
On my block its like the world dont exist
We stay confined to this small little section we living in
Oh my block I wouldnt trade it for the world
Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block
My block where everything is everything for sheezy
My block we probably done it all homey believe me
My block we made the impossible look easy for sheezy
My block Id never leave my block my niggas need me
