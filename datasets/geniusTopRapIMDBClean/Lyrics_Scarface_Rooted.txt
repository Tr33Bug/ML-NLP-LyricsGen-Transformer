You win some you lose some life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down fuck jail
Ive seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit this cant be life
I cant blame it on the hood cuz it gave me  life
This a stickup dont turn it to a 187
I dont go to church so Im far from a Reverend
Aint nothing like a young nigga armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say Im all day villain
Im getting money so Im always chilling
And even though they say Im killing all they children
Im just a nigga hustling for my million dollars
You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer crooked officer
I stay rooted  beh 
I and I stay rooted
Now if I had to play Jack Ill be leaving you bad news
Everybody in here be bound and gagged too
Im postin at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home
You was out here hicapping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and thats a real life nono
It dont take a bunch of niggas just me solo
I go for dolo I cant tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stone cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge my nigga
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
Cause everybody is listening speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say get what you get and get your ass out the way
Cause greedll get you 35 type youre 27 thats the rest of your fucking life
You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer crooked officer
I stay rooted  beh 
I and I stay rooted
Its in my DNA my blood type G my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets 


Real recognize whats real the bullshit see through
The way I spit it aint another one thats equal
This for my people in the game ten toes rooted in the streets and withholding info
We got secrets we gon take to the grave
We dont honor nothing else except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga dont forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause hes seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world thats enough to respect when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying fuck it at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me Id be leery of the people I meet cuz in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps
You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer crooked officer
I stay rooted  beh 
I and I stay rooted
