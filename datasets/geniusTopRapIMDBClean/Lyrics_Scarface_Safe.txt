I got the new Face tape Im about to pop in the deck for you niggas
Turn up your radios
Youre down and out money funny you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him aint no life in these streets
You only out here til you touch it when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco
Im givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet the next hes WHOA
I was a 70s baby raised in the 80s
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80s me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres wes about to buy
He had already been what Im about to go through
Told me aint no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars you put seven away
And lived off the five and never ever fuck with your safe
But when
When he hustle and he robbin
Thats when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin mobbin
Im bout my paper these other niggas slang for the sport
Like unaware tomorrow aint promised the game is too short
Ive witnessed niggas get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up then the murderous plots
To set up they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with the ones you dont want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards forwards sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
Its cutthroat thats fucked up niggas want they come up
So bad theyll take the 357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame but thats the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
Ive been in that position back in the day
In fear of my homie hittin my head to crack in my safe
And thats when
When ya hustle aint evolvin
Thats when niggas start starvin
And when you niggas start starvin
Thats when you niggas start robbin  when these niggas start robbin 
When these niggas got problems
Thats when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin  mobbin
So listen up my niggas and I aint tryin to preach
Im just tellin it from my side cause Im in the streets
I done been there done that seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
Thats the shit there they aint even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirtyfive years cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin thats a motherfucker watch what you say
You dont know nomotherfuckinbody nigga you lame
Watch your socalled homeboys keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Dont talk about your business keep yo thoughts in yo head
And this game it got a paper trail watch where ya spend
Dont write down names and numbers its a memory thing
Never shit where ya sleep keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay
Cause when the push turns to a shove they hittin your safe
True motherfuckin game true motherfuckin game
When ya hustle aint evolvin
Thats when niggas start starvin
And when you niggas start starvin
Thats when you niggas start robbin
When these niggas got problems
Thats when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin mobbin
