Theres gon be some stuff you gon see
Thats gon make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Mmm yeah keep ya head up Yeah
Our lifestyles be closecaptioned addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell jail and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin on backstabbin vultures
Sellin my soul for material wishes fast cars and bitches
Wishin I live my life a legend immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin my peers in the cemetery
Heres a message to the newborns waitin to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds though life is hard we carry on
Livin in the projects broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me protect your essence
Born with less but you still precious just smile for me now
Oh smile oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me 
Just smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile 
What you lookin all sad for
Nigga you black smile for me now 
All you gotta do is smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to be worried about 
No doubt smile for me now 
I want you to smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
And the next generation 
Now as I open up my story with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone but Im a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin his tomorrows and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories and Im still feelin the pain
Turnin circles in my 9th grade dealin cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life survivin the strain
And a man without a focus life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin wealthy and makin it big
Over football chose to cook raw wouldnt take but I did
And after all my mommas thankin God for blessin the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile smile


Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me
Fuck the world as we unloading witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin curious Gs
Backstabbed and bleedin
Crooked thoughts laced with weed learnin
Duckin stray shots bullets be hot they burnin
Inhale the sherm smoke visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange whispers cowards conversate so quick to diss us
Takin pictures for the feds in desperate hopes theyd get us
Hit us all give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is Fuck friends  we military minded soldiers
Bustin shots blindly tryin to find Jehovah
To help me somebody save me lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin I aint cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
Oh wont you smile for me
Sometimes you gotta let it feel good 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh smile 
Oh wont you smile for me
Smile for me now 
You know keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Hey keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
2Pac and Scarface keep ya head up 
Oh wont you smile for me
Oh wont you smile for me
