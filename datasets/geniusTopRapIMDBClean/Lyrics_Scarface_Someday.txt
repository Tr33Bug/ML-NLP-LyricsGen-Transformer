I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what Id do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know hes with me hes with me
I know someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me
I wanna walk with you follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my goods kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
Im confused about a lot of things but not with my faith
So Im depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See Im a sinner in the third degree
Aint afraid to admit it cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when Im a man myself
In the dark trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnels got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as Im thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what Id do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know hes with me hes with me
I know someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me
It seems like every other Wednesday Im attending a wake
But I dont question you I know thats your way okay
I know we living for the minute and theres a moment in time
Weve got to leave here cause thats your design
And nothing lasts forever not even spirit only your word
Thats what I live by cause thats what I heard
I wasnt there when you rose from the dead or you parted the sea
I never seen you but still I believe
How you explain the moon the sky the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
Its impossible for scientists to make up the seeds to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth
Its Heaven or Hell the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what Id do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know hes with me hes with me
I know someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me
Lord I know that Ive been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer without a song
So Im singing on my knees cause I believe youll keep me strong
Until its time for me to bring it home
But until its time for me to bring it home
Ill be out in these streets hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray cause when I pray its understood
That I got flaws about myself I cant make it by myself
I need the Heavens help I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to God cause God towers
Over all and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies thats been trapped out there
Thats stuck in their ways its different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say cause aint no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then youll understand what Im talking about
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what Id do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know hes with me hes with me
I know someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Someday someday someday
Hell come to get me

I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your vessel woo Lord
I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your vessel woo Lord
