Alright lets ride
I spent my day right off a Holloway broke and disgusted
Without enough money to buy food but Im smoking so fuck it
Hit the schoolyard no report card because Im larger than life
Clothes smokey eyes shining cause Im high as a kite fuck it
High school teachers Im a man of respect
South Acres baby gangsta Im demandin respect
Fuck the school vice principal he shife and Im leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and my mama believed him
Now my daddy got a problem cause Im home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out  Trust me 
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure Ive be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I cant face him  oooooh 
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground cause the devils in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
Cause Im standing on the cut with a Tec9 for the hoe behavior
They want to take me out the game like Rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to those who thought that they come
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side southside south south side
Southside south south side southside south south side
You know what Im saying
