Southside LyricsAlright, let's ride...
I spent my day right off a Holloway, broke and disgusted
Without enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the schoolyard, no report card because I'm larger than life
Clothes smokey, eyes shining, 'cause I'm high as a kite, fuck it
High school teachers I'm a man of respect
South Acres baby gangsta, I'm demandin' respect
Fuck the school vice principal, he shife and I'm leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and my mama believed him
Now my daddy got a problem 'cause I'm home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind, let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this, but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out (Trust me)
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground 'cause the devil's in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
'Cause I'm standing on the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoe behavior
They want to take me out the game like Rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to those who thought that they come
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side; southside south south side
Southside south south side; southside south south side
