Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 1
Its like I have been living a lie
Its beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
Im settled in somebodys dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebodys mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think Im insane
I hear the voice when Im asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is whats shes singing to me
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 2
Sometimes I just want to cry
We kiss in the rain
She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isnt clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love Ive ever known has left me alone
And Im dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness Ill never find
All in my mind
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Bridge
I think Ive finally failed at something
I honestly believe that
Cause looking at us from outside
You would think we would take better care of our hearts
I died when you did mentally
Spiritually
Im numb I feel nothing
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
