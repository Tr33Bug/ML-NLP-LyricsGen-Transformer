What can I do
What can I do to make it better
Yeah yeah
I thank the Lord for every morning he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining theres a cloud in the sky
Lettin me know that at any moment there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is there still can be pain
Down the park I hear the sirens just a screamin away
And then the inevitable happens the end of them days
As sad as it sounds but thats the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth will taketh away  will taketh away 
I live and I learn I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer cause eventually Ill stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest
Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears  someone like you and me 
Take away their fears
And then a child is born
Bloody naked clingin to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams  babys alive 
At the same time another mother murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
Its hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith and killin your pearls
And sometimes I sit it down and wonder myself
But then again I aint Jesus and I couldnt help
All I can do is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds cause dealin with that
Would be the hardest thing Id ever have to do in my time
Id have to take my own life too and I couldnt climb
The stairway that you hear me singin bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin his kid aint decidin the time
I know its truth the next day we just livin to die
But I believe if you livin right youll live in the sky
Lookin down on the good and the bad the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did before you had to go


Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears  Take away their fears
Can I make it better  I want to make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through  theyre through 
What can I do
What can I do
I say goodbye to you cruel world I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die relief when my heads high
Hear the streets up ahead cry when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Does that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb but Im cool Im cool
Kelly Price 
Do you hear me
Im cryin
Do you hear them crying  x2 to fade 
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears 
Take away their fears  take away their fears 
Can I make it better  gonna make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through
everything theyre goin through  What can I do
What can I do
