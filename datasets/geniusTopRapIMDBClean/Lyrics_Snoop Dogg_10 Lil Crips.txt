Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they dont die they just multiply
So dont give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Dont give them niggas a reason
Because theyll turn it into Crip season
The gangstas back the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC in a gangsta llac
Hmm fools be like Break off some cheese
Friends and enemies aww nigga please
Fuck you thought who pumped you up
Stop you stuck too much pop drop you plucked
Its all similar to gettin laid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K sprays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit  ignit 
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these they cant believe how I leave em
Look into a mind of a nigga thats crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real they pop the pill
You cap back young motherfucker its like that
Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they dont die they just multiply
So dont give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Dont give them niggas a reason
Because theyll turn it into Crip season
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip cause I got money to get
Aint no books aint no help aint no role to this
Stay focused young homey thats the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
Theres a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low theres only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean so green crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies show em what you got
Its a gangsta jack  gangsta jack  in gangsta black  black 
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby hooroobies and your Scooby snacks  Its like that 
Its like that


Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they dont die they just multiply
So dont give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Dont give them niggas a reason
Because theyll turn it into Crip season
Its a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside nigga we ride
And its a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside nigga we ride
And its a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside

Ten little Crip niggas runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they dont die they just multiply
