Bathtub Lyrics
(Water Trickling)
Uh, that felt good
Does it baby?
Yeah, rub my back for me
Where do you want me to rub it baby?
Right here
Okay
Oh
Turn around
Aight, check it out though
Why don't you put me on some music?
What you wanna hear baby?
Put me on some of that old gangsta shit
Aight then
(Door Bell, Needle Scratch, "Give Me Your Love" Plays)
Damn, the fuck is that?
Every time I'm chilling someone ringing my motherfucking doorbell
You want me to get that for you?
Yeah, handle that shit for me
Aight, I'll be right back
What the fuck?
Hey, Snoop!
Yo, what's up, Snoop Dogg?

Hey, hey, hey Snoop, what's going down?
What's up G-Dogg?
Oh, nothing, trying to live between the sky and Earth and ainâ€™t touching dirt nowhere, man
Right, right
I'm fucked about right about now Dogg
I'm about ready to get up out this, damn
I'm ready to get his shit up, man
With the motherfucking law after me
Punk-ass bitches, sucka-ass niggas
I can't take this shit no more dog
What? Man, you want to get out the game? Come on man
You can smoke a pound of bud everyday
You got a big screen TV, man, you wanna give all this up?
You got the dopest shit out on the streets
Nigga, is you crazy? That's the American Dream, nigga
Well, ain't it?
Fool, you better come on in
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up Snoop
Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed
You better quit fucking with me

(Smoke inhale)
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time7Embed
