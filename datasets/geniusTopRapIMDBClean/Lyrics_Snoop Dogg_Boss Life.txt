Some of em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of em lie about the guns they pop
But I dont I dont I dont I dont
Thats how it is for me cause I live a boss life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I dont I dont I dont I dont
Thats how it is for me cause I live a boss life
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs and the Ds and the Hs
And the Gs puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it if my nigga detoxing its more for me
Baby this is presidential really a pocket full of women
Understanding how Im living show them hoes how you winning
Its the beginning with the pearls youre given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say its Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes then the clothes Imma have to let em go
You know how the Dogg roll dont get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite mixed with somethin pimpish
And its comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen all that shit is in my past
Im connected to the purse first nigga the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and Im strong to the finish
See me man Im nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you aint used to
Im leanin in my ride fo fifth cock bangin
Me Im ridin by ya on the corner block slangin
Im livin that boss life
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
Im livin that boss life
You can have anything just dont fuck with my money
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khakis and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin aint the route thats even if you got it
Theres a method to you holdin it when they cant do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she bout it
You can have her and her partner fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a baller she gon ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow then she gon swallow
All the game you got to give her be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out the Doggfather
less I knew that she was bout him havin diamonds on his collar
Im just an author spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor
See me man Im nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you aint used to
Im leanin in my ride fo fifth cock bangin
Me Im ridin by ya on the corner block slangin
Im livin that boss life
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
Im livin that boss life
You can have anything just dont fuck with my money
