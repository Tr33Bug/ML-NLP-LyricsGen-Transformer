Candy (Drippinâ€™ Like Water) Lyrics
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water

Narcotics vision of death merchant, shipping and handling yola I supply
Time to get up and wipe the eye boogers out my eye (out my eye!)
Whatchu try'na buy, pimpin? y'know it's kinda' dry here
Yeah, I only gotta' couple of pies left that'll last me through the year
Yola, (ewwww!) ice cream candy(What it do?)
Man that shit be comin in handy
(Ewwww!) It's real walkie talkie (What else?)
I got that from the DB's, my cousin.. work dirty!
If you want 'em I got 'em; you here for the cop, you'd better be about your grip
Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast up, suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker
Real mannish with my Spanish
If ain't about no gouda, partner you can vanish
Don't get put up in yo' place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
Now-A-Later's, gum drops, jelly beans
Lollipops and triple beams
Blue carpet, yeah that's the treatment
Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin' it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
(Deez nuts!) I'm almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water

I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap?
(Clap!) Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on
It's gettin sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy
Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy (Candy!)
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water

"It's like candy, candy!" Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for sheez
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, yea I really burn rubber
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!
Yeah, nigga, shot caller
It's America's number one baller
Man I don't give a fuck, like, "Fuck it"
Hi, bye, slide in the bucket
Little momma all up on a nigga like a coat
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat (Candy!)

You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water
You want 'em? I got 'em, drippin' like water3Embed
