Devour any cowards sours slippery at the lip
Beast up suck up to none dont be no sucker
Be a block monster be a reputable motherfucker

Bigg Snoop Dogg Im the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
Deez nuts  Im almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man What it look like
Im in your neighborhood pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum itll be fun
And I bet you cant just eat one  Candy

Im in the hood with the sixtrey candy paint
Lil somethin to chunk make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt I hold her steady
Gyeah she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who dont know me

My gangstas understand me
Shake it baby dont break it baby now can you make it clap
Clap  Tryna fit this work in your gap  gap 
Drop it like it water pagoda get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on
Its gettin sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy black rollin on gold thangs
Foshigiddy he turned it into somethin boy
Cause I cant leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy  Candy 
You want em I got em drippin like water
