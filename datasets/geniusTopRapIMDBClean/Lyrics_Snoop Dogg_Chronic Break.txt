Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For this small chronic break
Ahah yeah niggas be brownnosing these hoes and shit
Takin bitches out to eat and spendin money on these hoes YouknowhatImsayin
I treat a bitch like 7Up I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this
Bitch you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes
Youll never go platinum
Hey Daz give me a light nigga
