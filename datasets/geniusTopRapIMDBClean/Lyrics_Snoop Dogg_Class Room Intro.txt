Class Room Intro LyricsGood Morning boys and girls, I'm your substitute teacher
My name is Mr. Buckwort
The topic fo' today is, what you would like to be when you grow up
You, over there in the jean shirt
What you wanna be when you grow up?
"I wanna be a police officer"
Alright, that's a pretty good profession
You over there in that black shirt
What you wanna be when you grow up?
"I would like to be a fire man"
Alright, that's a pretty good profession too
Hey, you in the back with those French braids, what's yo name?
"My name is Snoop"
Hi, Snoop, what you wanna be when you grow up?
