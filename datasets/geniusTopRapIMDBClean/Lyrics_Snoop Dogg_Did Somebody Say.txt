Did somebody say  Sick of this
Get those Just Eat foods online for me
Just Eat  We gon do this Doggy style
Did somebody say Just Eat
Me get delivery like a G
See hungry Doggs gotta eat
I get mine every day every week
Chicken wings to the crib Im sittin in
Burger in the lowlow
Hope they kept the pickle in
Wonton on a catamaran
Oodles of noodles thank you my man
Tacos to the chateau please
Did somebody say Just Eat
Private jet in the night sky
My man hand glide by with my fried rice right
What could you not love
Bout a slice on the side of the hot tub  Ooh 
What you gonna do boo
Chocolate fondue right on cue
Even dipping in the sea
I see food seafood sees me
JUST  EAT
