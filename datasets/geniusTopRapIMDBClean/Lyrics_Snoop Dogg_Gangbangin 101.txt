West Coast its time to stand up nigga
We gon unite round this motherfucker one time
Im callin every real Crip nigga
And every real BDogg to the table right now
Yeah we gon push a real line right now
See if yall with this real gangsta guerrilla shit
Have you ever seen 100000 rip riders from the side
Blue Chucks blue rags grey clouds blue skies
On the move cant lose Hill Street blues
Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
These suckas then I cruise my granny saw it on the news
She shook up look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away but I couldnt get far
Cause the homies had the looploop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin bail
4800 with this Crippin oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg ya better get right Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seezight
It aint no motherfuckin problem  poppop ticktock
Never flipflop 20 crippin til I drop

Is I in the motherfuckin S5
With the red bandana double knotted round the rearview
Niggas see clear through they know that its Game
Cherry red Lowenharts let em know that I bang
So bang like Snoop in Deep Cover
I got the seat reclined fofive under the whiteT smothered
Dippin down Green Leaf I aint got no enemies
Been shot five times now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up they cant stop us
It aint a gangsta party til we go and dig Pac up
Im Dr Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P Newton with Air Force Ones on
I gangbang but Im the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo red bandana print ceilin
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin homies yellin out
Suwhoop suwhoop suwhoop suwhoop
Carip Carip Carip Carip
Suwhoop suwhoop suwhoop suwhoop
Carip Carip Carip Carip

I ran outta gas in Long Beach Im stuck
Aint no Bloods and all I see is blue Chucks
Hopped out the 6trey nowhere to go
Til Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler 64
We just dippin one Bloodin one Crippin
Im on that Bulls shit throwback Scott Pippen
Moral is my bandana hangin from the left side
So if you aint a Crip or a Blood just throw up Westside
What up Blood  Yeah cuz we just tippin
Me and Game doin thangs switchin lanes Hurricanes on my feet
Stop and CWalk to the beat
Game take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC gun in my hand
Its the turf by the surf but we dont play in the sand
We just  slip and slide out we rip and ride out
Let it C known nigga welcome to the Thunderdome
