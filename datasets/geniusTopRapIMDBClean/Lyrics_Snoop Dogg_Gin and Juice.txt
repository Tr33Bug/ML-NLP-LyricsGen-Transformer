But I somehow some way
Keep comin up with funkyass shit like every single day
May I kick a little something for the Gs
And make a few ends as I breeze through
Two in the mornin and the partys still jumpin
Cause my momma aint home
I got bitches in the livin room gettin it on
And they aint leavin till six in the mornin
So what you wanna do
Shit I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But  But what  we dont love them hoes yeah
So we gon smoke an ounce to this
Gs up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin down the street smokin indo
Sippin on gin and juice laid back
With my mind on my money

Rollin down the street smokin indo
Sippin on gin and juice laid back
With my mind on my money

You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the DOG

Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin to this bitch named Sadie  Sadie
