Ladies and gents playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the mic pay attention
One two oh what shall I do
Im slipping on my khaki suit  Which one 
The blue one gun by my side as I mob to the beach
On a mission and Im fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink thats drank by Gs
Sagging like a mothafucka khakis to they knees
Bitch please you know how we do the undercover
Im Snoop Doggy Dogg not your average motherfucka see

Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
Imma hit ya up with the Pound Gs up hoes down

Some of you dont know about the G thang baby

Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound

And let all be accounted for
And if you dont give a fuck about a bitch
