How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 78 Coupe DeVille
Chill as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride and slide you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself here to show you where its at
With my hoes on my side and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe if you aint on the Row
Fuck you and your ho really doe so check it
Its Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin grip and dont really give a shiiit
About nuttin at all just my Doggs steppin through the fog
And Im still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin
How many hoes in ninetyfour will I be bangin
Every single one to get the job done
As I dip skip flip right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin and I be rhymin

East Side Long Beach in a 78 Coupe DeVille
Im rollin with the G Funk bumpin in my shit and it dont quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back bring it back just like this
And if you with my shit then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc
Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See its a West coast thing where Im from
And if you want some get some bad enough take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side
So bow down to the bow wow cause bow wow
Yippie yo you cant see my flow
My shit is dope original now you know
And cant no hood fuck with Death Rizzow
This is for the Gz and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz
