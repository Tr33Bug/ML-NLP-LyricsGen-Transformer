Iâ€™m Ya Dogg Lyrics
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming (Keep me coming)
And I come running (Running)
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming (Keep me coming)
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog (I'm your dog)
Baby I'm your dog (Oh, oh, oh)
So whenever you call (Whenever you call)
I come running (Baby, baby, baby)
He ain't listenin'
So you can talk to me, don't listen to him (No)
A body like that ain't hard to feed
'Cause girl, I'll eat you up
All in a couple of seconds
Girl, I'll eat you up (Eat you up)
It's when you realize you're in Heaven
Like how'd you get there?
Baby, what you doin' in this chair? (Ugh)
Couldn't let you sit there
You need help, somebody should get there
You see, girl, time is like money
Both of which men love
Spend them both with me
And then for sure, you'll know

Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running

Uh
She's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game
Maybach Music

Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we
Should tone it... down with the clean version
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it... make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place
I'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho

Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running
Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running23Embed
