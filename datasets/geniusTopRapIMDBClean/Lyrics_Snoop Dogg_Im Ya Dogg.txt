Cadillac weed pistol on his lap boy
Home run hitter thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib you better get a map for it
Paid for meanin I aint gotta rap for it
She a alley oop I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin baby what you lookin for Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari Im the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick really biggest in the game
Maybach Music

Pitbull lock on your neck kiss it and youll die
Boxer you take mines off then hallelujah
Shando count my blessings spin around two times
Freaky freak like its the 80s
Fuckin explicit radio prolly say we

Dirty but in public youre like teen virgin

Enticin flower bombin all on your privates
Private meetin inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin thank God for leg room
Its a trophy in that pussy Imma cum in first place
Imma cum in first place cum in cum in first place
