Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg this is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin gangsta man
I think its time for me and you to just tone it down a bit
Come on
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin if we never got this shit crackin
Imagine lifes so hard
You cant imagine its like livin in the City of God you feel me
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin called Pop by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that dont give a fuck about who shot her son hm
Imagine life where you cant win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets you go right back in hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam just another nigga hustlin
And aint no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas just tryna keep it bubblin
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast everybody fucked up
I cant imagine no less
But it dont take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hiphop
Before we go can you imagine
With your ears clear your mind can you imagine
Paint a picture in the sky can you imagine  Oh heeee 
Lord have mercy Ive been dreamin all my life
Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you cant get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo
Remember how they asked you What you run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin like they hate to see you gungho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and DRE
And felt just like them niggas in the 213
Then imagine thats whats coming when you fuckin with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said Fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch yeah
You cant imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty million records worldwide or fuckin off somebodys son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All a drunk fool get is pissedon balls
Keep fuckin off my niggas they gone murder us all
Imagine that


Before we go can you imagine
With your ears clear your mind can you imagine
Paint a picture in the sky can you imagine  Oh heeee 
Lord have mercy Ive been dreamin all my life all my life
Before we go can you imagine
With your ears clear your mind can you imagine
Paint a picture in the sky can you imagine  Oh heeee 
Lord have mercy Ive been dreamin all my life all my life
Imagine imagine
Yeah yeah oh yeah ow
Can you imagine Uh

Imagine imagine yeah ooh
In the name of Allah in the name of God
The beneficent the merciful
The one God to whom all praise is due
Regardless of land labor or title
No matter what name you call God by
Whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must talk to God
