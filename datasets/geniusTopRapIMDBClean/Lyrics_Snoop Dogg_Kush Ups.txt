My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now Im doing kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing
Dont stop
Tae Bo five four three two one
Working out chiefing up creeping up keeping up
With the Joneses smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood flavors good roll up put some papers to it
Straight into it gon make him do it that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on while get my spliff on fo sho
Break bad stay cool way cool roll a doob
Old school paid my dues spray these fools ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And itll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like
When you smoke with the Dogg you had the time of your life
Now light the fatty jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back yup I know you need that
Let it flow set it go incredible
That aint gold laying low like 10 to 4 on the floor
My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now Im doing kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing
Dont stop
Dont even trip
Aint really gotta use a scale I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin Why this aint for sale
Weed in my lungs weed in my nails
She coning joints Im rolling weed up myself
Dont ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo bout to drop some shit order those
Pounds I got more of those why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll more arms than  though
Boys hating Im just counting up the money I just made
And what Im making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Aint empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint you roll another one next
Cant even name a nigga colder than
Aint pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know its the bomb when you hold it in
My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now Im doin kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me I was at the crib doing
Dont stop
