Lay Low Lyrics
Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit till the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A
You might also like
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so12Embed
