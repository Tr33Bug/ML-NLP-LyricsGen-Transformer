Yeah gotta say whats up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who dont like it eat a dick
But for those who with me sing that shit
As it go a little something like this
Lodi Dodi we likes to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some niggas whore on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic  right 
For all my Doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 oclock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly  dally  I ran through a  alley 
I bumped into this smoker named  Sally  from the  Valley 
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im 19 she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover
Yeah uh ticktock ya dont stop
And to the uh ticktock nya dont quit
Yeah nya ticktock ya dont stop
And to the uh ticktock nya dont quit
