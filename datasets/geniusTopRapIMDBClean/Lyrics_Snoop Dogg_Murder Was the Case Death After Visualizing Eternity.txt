Indo Smoke Plays in Background

What set you got now
Fuck you nigga

Yeah nigga one less nigga
Yeah nigga yous a dead motherfucker now
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
Im shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and Im screaming
I stop breathing damn I see demons
Dear God I wonder can you save me
I cant die my boo boos bout to have my baby
I think its too late for praying hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me Ill make it better 
How long will I live  Eternal life and forever 
And will I be the G that I was
Ill make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul let me take control
Close your eyes my son  my eyes are closed
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Im fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
Its gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now Im rolling in a ninetrizzay El DoRad
Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start settripping that ass is mine 
Indeed agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want never have a need
They say Im greedy but I still want mo
Cause my eyes wanna journey some mo really doe  check it out 


Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
No more indo gin and juice
Im on my way to Chino rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twentyfive with an izzel with nowhere to gizzo I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause its the OG DOdoubleG LBC
Mad dogging niggas cause I dont care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cause you cant tell whats next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo
I put that on my Momma Ima ride for you Baby Boo
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
