WBalls its your main man DJ EZ Dick
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg
A day in the life of a Rollin 20 Crip
Im just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet they say that Im hopeless
But I dont give a fuck so blame it on the locness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch so dont even trip
I bust a funky composition thats as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funkyass rhythm
Its six dub the phone is ringing off the deck
And its some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah Dogg aint diss yall
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon not me and yall
I got love for a bunch of real BDogs
Like KDub Top Cat BReal ERock BooLay Face
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
Its so real I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub it aint about Crip or Blood
Its about you bein jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most the king of the coast
In the paint playin post  I back you down
Like ShaqDaddy and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
Im not Xzibit you cant Pull My Ho Card
I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches no killers just bitches
And you was payin niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco why you aint go to level fo
Oh I know  bitch 
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it LBC style
I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
Youre not able to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still aint been paid for 187 on a cop
I started yo shit and I will end yo shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip
It all boils down to the fact
That youre jealous of my paper stack  jealous ass nigga 
It all boils down to the fact
That youre jealous of my paper stack  gon get pimp slapped 
Money I get it paper I got it
I got the dope
Heaters I keep em bitches I got em
Run up ya get done up I stay one up
If I shoot you Ill be brainless and youll be famous
And Ill be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worse than them devils
Alotta niggas shouldve said it fuck em
But Ima say it for em stop it pop it rewind and play it for em
This niggas a bitch like his wife
Suge Knights a bitch and thats on my life
And Ima let the whole world see
Cause you fucked up the industry and thats on me
We can go head up nigga set it up
Or we can do the other thing I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists tell em shut it up
Cause Ill fuck every last one of em up especially Kurupt  shshshsh 
See thats my lil homeboy so he knows whats up  whats up 
He better keep it Crippin and slip his clip in
Cause these niggas trippin this is official business
Do the same way leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected misdirected sprayed covered and protected
Strip you butt naked chickycheckcheckit
Its all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Do Double in the hood again  Eastside 
Spinning that real times spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it  feel it 
So put the bacon in the skillet  hahaha  and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest nigga


Money I get it paper I got it
Heaters I keep em bitches I got em
Money I get it paper I got it
Jealous ass nigga
