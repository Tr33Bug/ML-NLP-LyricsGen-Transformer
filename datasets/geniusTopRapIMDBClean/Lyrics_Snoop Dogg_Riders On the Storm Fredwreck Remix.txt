Riders On the Storm  Fredwreck Remix  Lyrics
Ayo Jim man why dont ya
Why dont you kick some of that you know
YouYou know how you do it man
Its a trip people dont even believe were together right now  Wow 
Bu bu but tell your story
You know the one I like  Ride ride ride 
Say it for me
Riders on the storm
Ride ride ride 
Riders on the storm
Ride ride ride 
Into this house were born
Into this house were born 
Into this world were thrown
Into this world were thrown 
Like a dog without a bone  Woof woof 
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm  Ride ride ride 
Theres a killer on the road  Killer killer murder murder murder 
His brain is squirmin like a toad
Take a long holiday
Holidays holidays 
Let your children play  Cme here and play 
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die  Ride ride ride 
Killer on the road  Killer murder murder murder murder murder 
Yeah
Goin off of this goin off of that
With the Lizard king bumpin in the back how bout that
Driftin liftin swiftin  Let em in let em in 
Coastin testaroastin  Yeah 
But the wheels wont stop  Wont stop 
200 on the highway fresh up off the block
Hes a rider  Woo woo  Naw hes a killer
Dressed in all black but his hat says Steeler  Steeler Steeler 
Pedal to the metal  Metal 
I gotta go hard drive by and say hello
Hey Fredwreck you my mello
Now let me hear what I sound like acapella  Shh 
Wow ride dip swish
Now bring it back just like this
Like a dog without his bone
Unlike a G without his chrome
Its hard to imagine
The homie dog in a Jag and hes checkin for the checkered flagin
Comin in first never in last
Cause my car too fast  Zoom zoom 
I never ever run outta gas
Cause Im just too clean I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
Its so hot itd even make heat melt  Woo woo 
So get a board and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide


Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Theres a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Yeah
Woah
Away in India
Woo
Need for Speed Im tryin to take the lead
Hold on little homie fore you run into the trees  Watch out watch out 
Ive seen things that I never wouldve saw before
Ayo Jim let em in let em in
Open up my back tire smokin up
The whole street
And now the police wanna flash their lights  Wuuh wuuh 
And chase the Dogg all night  Woof 
But I wont pull over nor give up
Cause I just dont give a  What 
Yeah Im from the side boy
Where we was born and raised
Straight up to ride boy  West Side 
Continuously  Continuously 
We get to it expeditiously  Yeah 
Keep the light on East side on
Snoop Dogg and The Doors and yeah we bout to ride on
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house were born
Into this world were thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
And lets ride  Wow Yeah
